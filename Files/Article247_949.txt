                                 Fun for the Whole Family            The WB networks hit family series  th Heaven has beencelebrated for its uncommon pleasantness and normalcy by publications asdisparate as The New Yorker  Spin  and TV Guide  Now youcan indulge the show in that fashion if youve seen it once or twice but afterrepeated viewing you cant help suspecting that its niceness is the punch lineto a dark joke The show revolves around the Camden family a genial Christianminister his tightly wound wife their seven children  sevenchildren and a big house in a small town in California The children bringhome the social diseases of the daysex and drugs mainlyand the parentsdispel them with the dreamlike reasonableness of a ministerial counselingsession The yearold son is grounded for coming in late Just when youexpect him to clutch his head and moan like James Dean in Rebel Without aCause  Youre tearing me apart he smiles cheerfully at his punishmentand trots off to his room A bottle of overthecounter speed is discovered inthe yearold daughters bedroom She didnt know it contained thedangerous but not yet outlawed substance ephedrine Once she finds out fatherand daughter join forces in proselytizing against it            The dark joke here of course is the late s and early s and thesocial disorder we are alleged to have inherited from that period Set in thepresent  th Heaven is nonetheless a revisionist view of thepastwhat that era of cultural upheaval might have looked like if theWeekly Standard had had its way with it It is not a coincidence thatwhen the show flagged in its second season the network hired a publicist toflack it to Christian groups or that reruns are shown on Pax TV  Never has ashow so skillfully exploited contemporary retrochic to rewrite our visualimage of history Everything in its universe is s revival from thesartorial styletight buttondown shirts clingy pants long straight hair forgirls floppy mops for boysto the lighting design which is warm and dim inthe manner of Family and The Brady Bunch  to the staticcamerawork as deftly evocative of early s television as anything QuentinTarantino has filmed I hadnt grasped how square and stolid the framing wasuntil last night when while filming a concert by the pathetic dregs of areal s band the camera tilted sardonically just for an instantEven the casting functions as a form of allusion Barry Watson as eldest sonMatt has the soulful eyes cleancut yet girlish features and long dark shagof Keith Partridge Jessica Biel as eldest sister Mary has the center part andsymmetrical eyes and mouth of a Marcia Brady The middle daughter Lucy is thereincarnation of Jan And on it goes the show doing battle against our dourmemories of those socalled anni horribili with a selfreferentialperkiness that would do Disney proud            The difference between then and now though is that while family life inthose real s shows was unrealistically goofy in this fake s show itsstrangely isolated and defensivea little too warm on the inside a little toobesieged by countercultural horrors on the outside Consider the absurdlyanachronistic flowerpower band that visited its old buddy Dad in lastnights episode for instance and how afraid he was that theyd bringmarijuana into his home Or how the childrens friends are always turning upwith strange addictions illegitimate babies or the need to slicethemselvescautionary examples of family disintegration for the Camden kids tosteer clear of or at least try to staunch The Camdens arent raising afamily theyre fighting a culture war no matter how gentle the fathersChristianity may seem and underneath the popcultural giddiness theres amissionary zeal that comes off as more High School Confidential thanBrady                Bunch What do you imagine happens to Marys friendwhen she ignores the warnings issued by the good reverend to her father and thepreaching of Mary herself and defiantly keeps popping ephedrine She nearlydrops dead of a heart attack            The most troubling character of all however is the mother Annie playedby Catherine Hicks with a notquitecomic tension that never seems to achieverelease Wielding her Windex bottle like a weapon smashing Kleenexes into theyearolds mouth to retrieve illicit pieces of chewing gum Annie is acounterfactual from hellwhat American housewives would probably be like ifBetty Friedan had never published The Feminine Mystique  Anniesmothering is loving but grim and shes prone to irrational outbursts the restof the family has to tiptoe around Theres the time her widower father showedup with his new girlfriend and Annie refused to speak to her The theme thatepisode was How can we get Mom to behave Her husband couldnt have been moreunderstanding but his wifes emotionalism was so impervious to logic it becamedisturbing In fact Annie is always slightly more disturbing than any othercharacter is allowed to be a sense of inexpressible rage hovering somewhere inthe vicinity of her brightly upturned mouth She makes you realize withgratitude that not even the shows creator Brenda Hampton can force theAmerican family back into its box without having a little female frustrationleak out             Judith Shulevitz
