        well on this subject of invasion of privacy yes its very easy for anybody to find out about you your   well i dont really like that very much      yeah uh the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast i think last week or so ago it detailed how this one person went about finding out this particular person from this particular person his home mortgage how much he pays for it what his payments are uh his uh social security number drivers license any kind of records he may have uh their credit card and the status of their credit   what was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff   it was just as a demonstration to show   oh   those who were watching it how easily obtainable information is on any single person and it was mostly it dealt with uh marketing companies these uh direct marketing   oh yeah umhum   associations that was the primary subject thats how they obtain information about segments of society and group them into age brackets uh their habits their hobbies their income   um   and theyre able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer   thats not really good i dont know i guess thats an invasion of privacy im not sure that thats an everyday thing though at least not for you know an individual   umhum   something that i feel is a is a pretty much an invasion of privacy is something thats really so common that its accepted as the norm now is the open the open office concept   the open office   uhhuh where they have the you know the little partition dividers throughout a a large room and and people have little cubicles well thats all fine and good but you dont really have any privacy at all   yeah not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody i suppose suppose because it you can easily be overheard overheard   right   and they get i suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen   yeah   yeah theres there is   and and its not its not just that its uh the whole thing about you know if if youre trying to concentrate well its rather hard sometimes its almost impossible to do   umhum   because um you know youre uh youre time and youre space is is not your own space   umhum   and ive work in a situation like that and i well kind of have a problem with that   do you work with uh mixed company male and female or   oh yeah is there anybody who doesnt   well there there are a few out there its i suppose it depends on who youre working for and where at   yeah   but um my own environment is open totally there are no cubicles theres nothing to block anything   hm   so yeah but um i guess were changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybodys record or   yes   the computer is the the big advent of that i believe because it they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button and it appears   umhum   in front of them and you dont have to i i know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families   umhum   thats no secret and it shouldnt be that way i dont think   yeah i dont i dont think thats thats quite right either   i mean its not really government for the people and by the people ill tell you that   yeah    hm   so   what do you think could be done about it   uh the only way it can change is um if if everybody bands together its just like we need to get rid of these clowns thats serving in the office the only thing really that can be changed is for us to everybody to say weve had enough of you out you go but uh i dont see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that it has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done um i dont know its its still a a free i suppose country insofar as were were able to obtain information and i wouldnt be for total banning of uh all information or its mostly the private information that were all concerned about but its its hard to define   yeah   uh a lot of those boundaries   it really is its something that something that ive just had a a dealing with is like a credit bureau   uhhuh   well they take they take my name which is a very common name and my last name is even more common   uhhuh   and they they check that name against uh their list and they find several and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all they just report everything under that name   so youve received a lot of uh flack   they dont they dont even check my social security number   um   and companies are paying them good money to report accurately and theyre not theyre so lazy theyre just not doing it i mean they just find your name and they match it up   umhum   you know and  that just drives me crazy because theyre and then they want then you know to get it removed they say well you know you have to write this write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them you know and then it takes three weeks and all and im like baloney   umhum   you messed it up you fix it   is that usually what you tell them in the letter   no what ive taken to doing lately is calling the company that they report   umhum   like uh uh recently i was reported as having JC Penney accounts and i dont so i called JC Penney and i said uh i just wanted to let you know that the credit agency youre using is incorrectly reporting the information that youre providing to them and they say uhhuh because they really dont want to pay for services thats not being done properly either so then they can call   umhum   the credit bureau and say hey you know were paying you good money to report this properly and youre not doing your job   good idea   so thats what ive taken to doing lately and it seems to work pretty well so far   umhum oh thats good any other problems   not that i can think of   yeah  i i guess ive just about run out of   yes     i i can probably go on but its its uh im clouding up right now   oh yeah probably better let you get back to work   well its nice talking to you   okay   maybe again   alrighty byebye   byebye
