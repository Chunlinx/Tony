                                 The Bandwagon Defect                        Hello Fred            Well after our moment of concord lets give the crowd what it came forAre you ready to rummmmmmmmbbbbbllle            Actually lets talk about concord a little more Maybe the most surprisingthing about Michael Linds book is what has not occurred When I heard that itwas coming out and what its title was I thought Oh no here we go again Iwas remembering the rancor that followed two previous revisionist works onVietnamby Norman Podhoretz and Richard Nixon to say nothing of RobertMcNamaras yearsafterthefact revelation that hed made a little mistakeback in the s Each of these books seemed to zoom us straight back in timeto all the anger of that era Disclosure I was really in a lather aboutMcNamaras book and did a very bitter denunciation of it on NPR I saidessentially if you didnt speak up when it could have made a difference MrSecretary you should have the decency to remain silent now Chances are Iattacked the other books too Bonus disclosure As is no secret I was in theantiwar protest movement in the s and avoided being drafted in  bydeliberately failing a physical In fact Linds book has received mainlypositive reviews and not all from publications in the stab in the backcamp            Its conceivable that the calmer reception has to do strictly with the bookand its author These other writers were public figures during the war Lindwas a schoolboy They wrote as if they had scores to settle reviewers oftensettled scores right back But factors like these cant be the wholeexplanation One of the things I dont like in the book is a long chapterdebunking myths of Vietnam eg that the Khmer Rouge were OK until USbombing of Cambodia drove them berserk Many of Linds specific points arereasonable but its the one place where he has a categorically dismissiverather than explanatory tone The journalists were all dupes so were thelefties this is a picture of the antiwar movement similar to the protestorsmental picture of Johnson McNamara and Rostow That this hasnt yet created aflap may mean that people havent noticed Or it may mean that the emotionalsteam has gone out of the whole subject If so I think the rise of John McCainhas a lot to do with it Or it could just be actuarial forces The median agein the United States is just over  so most Americans have no personal memorywhatsoever of this episode            On to the disagreement There is so much in this book that Id like to gointo  different themes that it raises But one is most importantand itsthe main one where I disagree both with you and with Lind            To recap The two great axioms of the book are  Great powers constantlytest each other for dominance and if one side shrinks from a fight even asymbolic one as in Vietnam its perceived weakness will cascade into realweakness as other countries classify it as a loser But also  the UnitedStates will stomach wars other than total wars against Hitler only as long asthe casualty rate is low            On No  for reasons we just dont have space for here I think that Lindpresents the bandwagon effect of weakness in too sweeping and mechanistic away But thats because I belong to the camp hes specifically arguing againstthe minimal realists who think the country doesnt have to accept everysymbolic challenge Lind presents No  not as a failing of Americaas hehardly could having written before about the evils of an overclass thatavoids military service and public obligationsbut as a realistic factor tobear in mind when the country makes commitments As an important corollary toNo  Lind arguesunlike many conservativesthat the United States couldnthave fought Vietnam in a really really casualtysparing way with alloutattacks on the North because China and the Soviet Union would have backedNorth Vietnam up            When you put these together you end up with the contention that it wasbetter to have gone in casualties and all than to have avoided the fightearly The clinching evidence is supposed to be that Southeast Asia is inbetter shape than if we hadnt fought            Now I love Southeast Asia I lived for two years in Malaysiawhich beatits own Communist uprising a decade before Vietnam But even accepting forpurposes of argument that Americas war spared Malaysia and its neighbors frominvasion it wasnt worth it We are marveling at an end to rancor after years  which shows how terrible the damage was within the UnitedStates            The clinching argument on my side comes you will be pleased to hear fromRonald Reagan Lind presents the Reagan years as the time of a revived ColdWar which he endorses as a way to offset the bandwagon of weakness thatfollowed the collapse of Saigon But Reagan was unbelievably conscious of theneed to avoid US casualties This was the president who pulled out of Lebanonafter Marines were bombed there So he clearly found a way to project abandwagon of strength without putting US troops on the line Sounds likeeffective minimal realism to me
