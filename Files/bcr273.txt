                    Synopsis                  Introduction          Chemoprevention has been defined as the use of          noncytotoxic nutrients or pharmacologic agents to enhance          intrinsic physiologic mechanisms that protect the          organism against the development of mutant clones and          their progression to malignant cancer In a recent          landmark trial tamoxifen a hormonally active selective          estrogen receptor modulator SERM was shown to decrease          the risk of invasive breast cancer by  in          asymptomatic but atrisk women   The search is now          on for agents with improved riskbenefit profiles and          for agents that will prevent the subclass of estrogen          receptornegative tumors the incidence of which was          unaffected by the SERMS Retinoids have already shown          potential in this regard        Because it          will not be possible to test many agents in large          randomized clinical trials efforts are underway to          develop useful tissuebased surrogate endpoint          biomarkers that can be used to select only the most          promising agents and doses for largescale trials          Provocative mechanistic connections have been made          between the steroid hormone superfamily including the          SERMS and retinoids and the TGF family of          multifunctional growth factors   The TGF system has          tumor suppressor activity and loss of TGF response is          associated with advanced disease in many human tumor          types including the breast    Conversely          experimental overexpression of TGF in the mammary gland          protects against tumorigenesis   This strongly          suggests that interventions that enhance TGF function          early in tumorigenesis could delay or prevent the course          of the disease SERMs such as tamoxifen can upregulate          TGF production and activation by many cell types          including human breast cancer cell lines               Similarly retinoids can upregulate TGF production          and activation both in cell culture and in rats           in vivo    It is plausible          therefore that upregulation of endogenous TGF could          contribute to the chemopreventive efficacy of SERMs and          retinoids          In the present study we used a carcinogeninduced rat          mammary carcinogenesis model to test the hypothesis that          chemoprevention by tamoxifen and retinoids is associated          with local upregulation of TGFs in the mammary gland          and that TGFs might therefore be useful as potential          surrogate endpoint biomarkers of chemopreventive          efficacy in clinical trials                          Materials and methods          A standard protocol for induction of breast cancer in          female SpragueDawley rats using a single dose of           N nitroso           N methylurea NMU at  weeks of          age was used    Chemopreventive agents were          incorporated into powdered lab chow   and fed           ad libitum  beginning  week after          injection with NMU The rats were fed cRA Kuraray          Company Osaka Japan at  mgkg of diet tamoxifen          Sigma Chemical Co St Louis MO USA at  mgkg of          diet and HPR RW Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Unit          Spring House PA USA at  mgkg of diet          Rats were weighed and palpated for the presence of          mammary tumors weekly and six rats in each experimental          group were sacrificed after  and  weeks of treatment          with chemopreventive agent For experiments to determine          the effect of high doses of tamoxifen administered over          shorter periods of time rats were given  mg          tamoxifenkg body weight per day intragastrically or           mg tamoxifenkg in the diet and were sacrificed after           day or  weeks of treatment All palpated tumors were          confirmed at necropsy and mammary glands were fixed in          neutral buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin The          number  first thoracic mammary gland was sectioned for          histology and immunohistochemistry          Immunohistochemical staining was done using rabbit          polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides          that correspond to regions in the mature forms of TGF             TGF            and TGF             antiTGF            LC and antiTGF            CC   antiTGF            sc Santa Cruz Biotechnologies          Inc Santa Cruz CA USA and anti            LC   respectively Antilatent          TGFbinding protein LTBP Ab was raised against the          purified fulllength platelet LTBP   The antibodies          were affinity purified against the immunizing peptide          antiTGF             or against protein A sepharose          antiTGF            LC antiTGF            CC and antiTGF             Immunohistochemical staining was          performed using an indirect immunoperoxidase detection          protocol Vectastain Elite kit Vector Laboratories          Burlingame CA USA Staining intensity was scored on a          scale of  using the mouse embryo control section as          a reference standard for each run Ducts and periductal          stroma were scored independently Staining was scored in          a blinded manner by two independent observers and          discrepancies were rescored by consensus Staining          intensity was plotted as the mean  standard deviation          for each experimental group                          Results          Palpable mammary tumors were first detected after          approximately  days following initiation of NMU and by           days incidence had reached  in rats not treated          with chemopreventive agents Fig a Tamoxifen alone          or in combination with retinoids decreased tumor          incidence by more than  by the end of the study          whereas cRA alone decreased it by  HPR alone had a          relatively modest effect on tumor incidence in the          present study However it significantly decreased tumor          multiplicity Fig b indicating that the dose used was          efficacious There was minimal toxicity associated with          the chemopreventive intervention except in the tamoxifen           HPR group in which mild toxicity was observed as          judged by the weights of the experimental animals Fig          c          None of the chemopreventive agents used alone or in          combination were found to affect expression of any of          the TGF isoforms or the LTBP in either ductal          epithelium or periductal stroma after  weeks of          chemopreventive intervention Fig  The week time          point was chosen as representative of the period of          preneoplasia as the majority of the animals had no          palpable tumors at this time Fig  In the study set          eight out of   of the slides showed histologic          evidence of hyperplasia one out of  had a ductal          carcinoma           in situ mammary intraepithelial          neoplasia   and one out of  had a carcinoma We          further investigated the effect of tamoxifen at higher          doses and earlier time points In rats that received          tamoxifen at  mgkg per day intragastrically          equivalent to  mgday for a human or  mgkg per day          intragastrically equivalent to  mgday for a human          for either  day or  weeks again no consistent changes          were seen in TGF expression using either the TGF            CC or the TGF            antibodies data not shown                          Discussion          One major goal in the field of prevention is the          identification of surrogate biomarkers that might rapidly          predict the effect of a given agent on the primary          endpoint of cancer incidence The most informative          markers are those with modulation that is likely to be          directly related to the preventive effect and a          compelling argument can be made that TGFs may fall into          this category However the present data in a          wellestablished preclinical model of breast cancer          employing a variety of highly effective chemopreventive          regimens suggest that this is not the case          Most of the previous studies on the regulation of          TGFs by tamoxifen and retinoids have been done in          tissue culture      The lack of effect on          TGF expression in the present           in vivo study may reflect the          dependence of the response on contextual cues that are          only present in the artificial           in vitro environment In an           in vivo study   all           trans retinoic acid was shown to          cause an upregulation of TGF isoforms in rats with          kinetics and isoform selectivity that varied with the          target tissue However the rats were vitamin          Adeficient and it is not known whether the same effects          would be seen in vitamin Areplete animals such as were          used in the present study In a small study in humans            tamoxifen treatment was shown to cause a consistent          induction in extracellular TGF in breast cancer          biopsies when compared with pretreatment biopsies from          the same patients and complex effects of tamoxifen on          induction of TGF            in the plasma of patients with          metastatic breast cancer have been described   It is          possible that tamoxifen is only effective in inducing          TGF in the context of a tumor and not in the normal or          initiated tissue that was the subject of the present          study However an optimal surrogate endpoint biomarker          in a prevention setting needs to be modulated in normal          or premalignant tissues Although we cannot eliminate the          possibility of more subtle effects of chemopreventive          agents on TGF bioavailability or cellular          responsiveness in our preliminary analyses we have seen          no effects on the expression of type I and type II TGF          receptors data not shown          There is considerable evidence to suggest that at          late stages in tumorigenesis TGFs can actually promote          the tumorigenic process particularly if the epithelial          cells have lost responsiveness to the growth inhibitory          effects of TGF by this time   While the present          work was in progress a study was reported   that          showed that loss of the type II TGF receptor can          already be seen in a significant fraction of hyperplasias          without atypia in the human breast Furthermore loss of          the receptor correlated with increased risk of subsequent          development of invasive breast cancer Thus loss of          TGF response may be a very early event in the          development of human breast cancer Because locally          elevated TGF levels could select for TGFresistant          cells and because TGFs can have oncogenic effects on          the stroma it may actually be important for the safety          profile of chemopreventive agents to demonstrate that          they do not increase TGF levels in the atrisk breast          In this regard this demonstration that the expression of          TGFs in the preclinical rat model is unaffected by          tamoxifen cRA or HPR may actually have positive          implications because all three agents are already in          clinical use          The NMUinduced rat model of mammary tumorigenesis is          widely used for chemoprevention studies and yields rapid          development of hormonally responsive mammary tumors with           incidence     To do this the initiating          agent is given at  weeks of age and the chemopreventive          agent is started a week later during the period of          active development of the mammary gland We observed that          the histology of the tamoxifentreated mammary glands          differed significantly from control glands when examined          after  weeks of tamoxifen treatment showing fewer          terminal endbuds and less tertiary branching Part of          the chemopreventive efficacy of antiestrogens and          retinoids in this model may therefore be due to a          generalized decrease in ductal development Since          chemopreventive agents are unlikely to be given to humans          during the pubertal period this form of preclinical          model may not accurately reflect the degree of          chemopreventive benefit that could be achieved in humans          Although the accelerated time course and high penetrance          of disease reduces the costs of this model it may be          advisable to confirm efficacy of promising agents in a          model that delays application of the chemopreventive          agent until the mammary gland is fully developed          In conclusion we have shown that treatment of rats          with tamoxifen or retinoids results in effective          chemoprevention of mammary tumorigenesis without any          detectable effect on local expression of TGFs Although          we cannot rule out more subtle effects on TGF activity          such as the activation of latent forms the data suggest          that TGFs are not involved in the underlying molecular          mechanism of chemoprevention induced by these agents          This agrees with           in vitro work   that showed          that blockade of TGF signaling did not abrogate the          growth inhibitory effect of tamoxifen on breast cancer          cells Given the very limited breast tissue available in          clinical trials we do not recommend testing for TGFs          as a surrogate endpoint biomarkers at this time          All three TGF isoforms and the LTBP part of the          naturally occurring latent TGF complex showed broadly          similar immunostaining patterns in the mammary glands of          untreated rats at  weeks of age Fig  They were          present both in the ductal epithelium and in the          periductal stroma suggesting that the TGFs are          synthesized by the epithelial cells and possibly stromal          cells and are sequestered in the extracellular matrix          This staining pattern is consistent with a role for the          TGFs in the maintenance of normal mammary          homeostasis          After  weeks of treatment we noticed that mammary          glands from tamoxifentreated rats were less developed          than those of untreated control animals having fewer          tertiary ducts and terminal end buds and they could          consistently be identified from a blind data set Fig           By  weeks of treatment all three chemopreventive          agents had a significant effect on glandular histology          with tamoxifen and cRA showing the greatest suppression          of ductal development and lobule formation and HPR          showing a relatively mild effect                            Full article                  Introduction          Chemoprevention has been defined as the use of          noncytotoxic nutrients or pharmacologic agents to enhance          intrinsic physiologic mechanisms that protect the          organism against the development of mutant clones and          their progression to malignant cancer   Members of          the nuclear receptor superfamily are considered to be          particularly promising targets for chemoprevention          because of their pivotal role in the regulation of          metabolic developmental and differentiation pathways            In a recent landmark trial   tamoxifen a          hormonally active SERM was shown to decrease the risk of          invasive breast cancer by  in asymptomatic but          atrisk women Another SERM raloxifene also shows          promise   These studies validate the concept of          using pharmacologic agents for prevention of human breast          cancer in apparently healthy individuals          The search is now on for agents with improved          riskbenefit profiles and for agents that will prevent          the subclass of estrogen receptornegative tumors the          incidence of which was unaffected by the SERMS          Retinoids a family of compounds structurally related to          vitamin A have already shown potential in this regard                 Since it will not be possible to test          many agents in large randomized clinical trials efforts          are underway to develop useful tissuebased surrogate          endpoint biomarkers that can be used to select only the          most promising agents and doses for largescale          trials          Provocative mechanistic connections have been made          between the steroid hormone superfamily including the          SERMS and retinoids and the TGF family of          multifunctional growth factors TGFs are potent          inhibitors of the growth of many epithelial cell types            Recent work has implicated the TGF system as an          important tumor suppressor pathway and loss of TGF          response is associated with advanced disease in many          human tumor types including the breast               In mouse models overexpression of TGF            in the mammary gland protects          against tumorigenesis   whereas local inactivation          of the type II TGF receptor enhances tumorigenesis            This strongly suggests that interventions that          enhance TGF function early in tumorigenesis could delay          or prevent the course of the disease          Antiestrogens such as tamoxifen have been shown to          upregulate TGF production and activation by many cell          types including human breast cancer cell lines               Similarly retinoids can upregulate TGF          production and activation both in cell culture and in          rats           in vivo    Therefore it is          reasonable to propose that some of the chemopreventive          efficacy of these agents against breast cancer           in vivo could be mediated via a          local upregulation of TGFs with concomitant          enhancement of tumor suppressor activity          In the present study we used a carcinogeninduced rat          model of mammary carcinogenesis to test whether          chemoprevention by tamoxifen and by two different          retinoids HPR also known as fenretinide and cRA          is associated with local upregulation of TGFs in the          initiated mammary gland If this were the case TGFs          might be useful as potential surrogate endpoint          biomarkers in clinical trials However the results show          that TGF levels as detected immunohistochemically are          not affected by tamoxifen or retinoids in this          preclinical model of earlystage breast cancer                            Materials and method                  Mammary carcinogenesis studies          A standard protocol for induction of breast cancer in          female SpragueDawley rats was used    with          initiation induced by a single intravenous dose of NMU           mgkg body weight at  weeks of age Retinoids and          tamoxifen were incorporated into powdered laboratory chow          as described previously   and fed           ad libitum  beginning  week after          injection with NMU Rats were fed cRA Kuraray Company          Osaka Japan at  mgkg of diet tamoxifen Sigma          Chemical Co St Louis MO USA at  mgkg of diet and          HPR RW Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute at           mgkg of diet          Rats were weighed weekly and palpated for the presence          of mammary tumors Six rats in each experimental group          were sacrificed after  and  weeks of treatment with          chemopreventive agent The week sacrifice time was          chosen for the immunohistochemical studies to represent          the period of premalignancy because the incidence of          palpable tumors is less than  for all experimental          groups at that time By  weeks all rats that have not          received a chemopreventive agent have tumors so the          primary purpose of the week sacrifice time was to          allow an accurate determination of chemopreventive          efficacy for the particular experiment          For experiments to determine the effect of high doses          of tamoxifen administered over shorter periods of time          rats were given  mg tamoxifenkg body weight per day          intragastrically or  mg tamoxifenkg in the diet and          were sacrificed after  day or  weeks of treatment          All palpated tumors were confirmed at necropsy and          mammary glands were fixed in neutral buffered formalin          and embedded in paraffin The number  first thoracic          mammary gland was sectioned for histology and          immunohistochemistry                          Immunohistochemistry of TGFs          Immunohistochemical staining was done using rabbit          polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides          that correspond to regions in the mature forms of TGF             TGF             and TGF             Antibodies to TGF            were raised against a synthetic          peptide corresponding to residues  of the mature          protein in either the Laboratory of

preparations of          the  peptide and they recognize different epitopes          of this peptide   The LC antibody usually stains          intracellular TGF             whereas the CC antibody stains          extracellular TGF             AntiTGF            sc Santa Cruz Biotechnologies          Inc was raised to a peptide corresponding to residues           of the mature TGF

      crossreactivity with TGF            on Western blots          Immunohistochemical staining was performed using an          indirect immunoperoxidase detection protocol Vectastain          Elite

staining of the ducts          and periductal stroma were scored independently For          samples after  weeks of chemopreventive treatment          staining intensity was scored on a scale of  using          the mouse embryo control section as a reference standard          for each run Staining was scored in a blinded manner by          two independent observers and scores never differed by          more than one point Discrepancies were rescored by          consensus Staining intensity was plotted as the mean           standard deviation for each experimental group                            Results                  Chemopreventive efficacy          Palpable mammary tumors were first detected after          approximately  days following initation with NMU and          by  days incidence had reached  in rats not treated          with chemopreventive agents Fig a Tamoxifen alone          or in combination with retinoids decreased tumor          incidence by more than  by the end of the study          whereas cRA alone decreased it by  HPR alone had a          relatively modest effect on tumor incidence in the          present study However it significantly decreased tumor          multiplicity Fig b indicating that the dose used was          efficacious These incidence and multiplicity data are          consistent with previously published studies using this          model     The mean weights of the rats in the          various experimental groups differed by less than           from those of rats not treated with a chemopreventive          agent except for the rats treated with a combination of          tamoxifen and HPR in which the mean weight was          approximately  lower than the that in untreated group          by the end of the study Fig c This suggests that          there was minimal toxicity associated with the          chemopreventive intervention except in the tamoxifen           HPR group in which mild toxicity was observed                          Effect of chemopreventive agents on TGF          expression in initiated mammary gland          Figure shows the typical immunohistochemical staining          pattern for the TGFs and the LTBP part of the          naturally occurring latent TGF complex in initiated          mammary glands of weekold rats that had not been          treated with chemopreventive agents All three TGF          isoforms and the LTBP showed broadly similar staining          patterns They were present both in the ductal epithelium          and in the periductal stroma suggesting that the TGFs          are synthesized by the epithelial cells and possibly          stromal cells and are sequestered in the extracellular          matrix This staining pattern is consistent with a role          for the TGFs in the maintenance of normal mammary          homeostasis          None of the chemopreventive agents used alone or in          combination were found to affect expression of any of          the TGF isoforms or the LTBP in either ductal          epithelium or periductal stroma after  weeks of          chemopreventive intervention Fig  The week time          point was chosen as representative of the period of          preneoplasia because the majority  of the rats          had no palpable tumors at this stage Fig  Human          clinical material for biomarker analysis in primary          chemoprevention studies is also likely to comprise normal          and initiated atrisk epithelium with some early          preneoplastic changes but without evidence of major          neoplastic change          In the week study set eight out of   of the          glands sampled showed histologic evidence of hyperplasia          In addition one out of  glands sampled had a lesion          with the appearance of a ductal carcinoma           in situ focal necrosis marked          atypia and abundant mitoses placing it in the category          of mammary intraepithelial neoplasia by the Annapolis          naming convention   and an additional one had an          invasive carcinoma Both the           in situ and the invasive carcinomas          were in the control group However both samples also had          histologically normal ducts on the same slide which were          scored for the analysis There was no difference in          staining between the ducts that were proximal to the          tumor and those that were more distal and neither were          there any differences in staining observed between          histologically normal and hyperplastic ducts in any of          the samples analyzed data not shown Since the focus of          the present study was on TGF expression changes in the          preneoplastic gland staining of the tumors was not          scored for the analysis but in the two cases present          the staining did not differ significantly from that of          the surrounding normalappearing ducts not shown          Assuming that a rat weighs approximately  g and          eats  g of chow each day the equivalent human doses to          those used in this study would be approximately           mgday tamoxifen  gday HPR and  mgday cRA The          human doses that are currently being used in clinical          trials are  mgday for tamoxifen  gday for          HPR and  mgday for cRA The different doses          of tamoxifen and HPR used in humans and rats probably          reflect interspecies differences in pharmacokinetics          However because the efficacious dose for tamoxifen was           times lower in the rat than the dose that has          previously been shown to upregulate TGF            expression in human breast tumor          tissue   we looked at the effect of a higher dose of          tamoxifen in the rats Furthermore because one study            showed that TGF may be transiently upregulated          early after administration of tamoxifen we also looked          at earlier time points In rats receiving tamoxifen at           mgkg per day intragastrically equivalent to  mgday          for a human or  mgkg per day equivalent to  mgday          for a human for either  day or  weeks again no          consistent changes were seen in TGF expression using          either the TGF            CC or the TGF            antibodies data not shown                          Effect of chemopreventive agents on the histology          of the mammary gland          While scoring the immunohistochemical slides we          noticed that the mammary histology appeared to be altered          in rats treated with chemopreventive agents Hematoxylin          and eosin stained sections from the samples after  weeks          of treatment were analyzed by a veterinary pathologist          MAE The mammary glands from tamoxifentreated rats          were less developed than those of untreated control          animals having fewer tertiary ducts and terminal          endbuds and could consistently be identified from a          blind data set Fig  By  weeks of treatment all          three chemopreventive agents had a significant effect on          glandular histology with tamoxifen and cRA showing the          greatest suppression of ductal development and lobule          formation and HPR showing a relatively mild          effect                            Discussion                  TGFs as candidate biomarkers          One major goal in the field of prevention is the          identification of surrogate biomarkers that might rapidly          predict the effect of a given agent on the primary          endpoint of cancer incidence There is an extensive          literature showing that steroid hormone superfamily          members such as antiestrogens and retinoids can          upregulate TGF activity in a variety of systems                    This suggested that the          chemopreventive action of these agents against breast          cancer could be mediated in part through enhancing the          tumor suppressor activity of the endogenous TGF system          and thus that changes in TGF expression might serve as          useful surrogate endpoint biomarkers of chemopreventive          efficacy However here we used the NMUinduced rat model          of mammary carcinogenesis to show that the          chemopreventive effect of tamoxifen and two retinoids is          not associated with any consistent changes in TGF          levels at least as determined immunohistochemically                          Comparison with earlier studies          Most of the previous studies on the regulation of          TGFs by tamoxifen and retinoids      have          been done in tissue culture Thus the lack of effect on          TGF expression in the present           in vivo study might reflect the          dependence of the response on contextual cues that are          only present in the artificial           in vitro environment In one          previous           in vivo study   all           trans retinoic acid upregulated          TGF expression in rats with kinetics and isoform          selectivity that varied with the target tissue However          the rats were vitamin Adeficient and it is not known          whether the same effects would be seen in vitamin          Areplete animals such as were used in the present          study or whether the response would vary with the          specific retinoid used          There are some data that support an effect of          tamoxifen on upregulation of TGFs           in vivo in humans Three months of          tamoxifen treatment was shown to cause a consistent          induction in extracellular TGF in breast cancer          biopsies when compared with pretreatment biopsies from          the same patients   Furthermore complex effects of          tamoxifen on induction of TGF            in the plasma of patients with          metastatic breast cancer have been described   It is          possible that tamoxifen is only effective in inducing          TGF in the context of a tumor and not in normal or          initiated tissue which was the subject of the present          study This issue could be reassessed in preclinical          models using the same agents to treat established          proliferative intraepithelial neoplasia However for          ease of tissue acquisition an optimal surrogate          endpoint biomarker in a prevention setting needs to be          modulated in normal or premalignant tissues                          Alternative levels of regulation of the bioefficacy          of TGFs          Interestingly in cell culture both tamoxifen and          all           trans retinoic acid have been          shown      to increase the fraction of TGF          in its biologically active as opposed to its latent          form The current method for discriminating between          active and latent TGF in tissue samples requires the          use of frozen sections and immunofluorescence techniques          which are not practical for routine clinical use            As simpler assays become available however the issue of          possible changes in TGF activation status should be          readdressed Retinoids can also affect cellular          responsiveness to TGFs at the level of receptor          expression and downstream events    To date          expression of TGF receptors and downstream signaling          components such as the Smads have not been          wellcharacterized in this rat model but in our          preliminary analyses we saw no effect of retinoids on          type I and type II TGF receptor expression in the          mammary gland data not shown At this time however we          certainly cannot rule out the possibility that tamoxifen          and retinoids may be having subtle effects on the TGF          system at levels other than the regulation of TGF          expression                          Lack of effect of chemopreventive agents on TGF          expression may have positive implications          There is considerable evidence to suggest that at          late stages in tumorigenesis TGFs can actually promote          the tumorigenic process particularly if the epithelial          cells have lost responsiveness to the growth regulatory          effects of TGF by this time      Thus          advanced human tumors show increased levels of TGF          expression     and TGFs are known to          suppress the immunosurveillance system to enhance          angiogenesis invasion and metastasis and to increase          drug resistance               In the colon loss of the type II TGF receptor          occurs at the late adenoma to carcinoma transition            suggesting that early premalignant lesions retain TGF          responsiveness and would be amenable to interventions          that enhance TGF activity However while the present          work was in progress a study was reported   showing          that loss of the type II TGF receptor can already be          seen in a significant fraction of hyperplasias without          atypia in the human breast Furthermore loss of the          receptor correlated with increased risk of subsequently          developing invasive breast cancer Thus unlike in the          colon loss of TGF response may be a very early event          in the development of human breast cancer          Since locally elevated TGF levels may select for          TGFresistant cells and because TGFs can have          oncogenic effects on the stroma it may actually be          important for the safety profile of chemopreventive          agents to demonstrate that they do not increase TGF          levels in the atrisk breast For example tamoxifen          resistance in a xenograft model of advanced human breast          cancer was recently shown   to be associated with an          increase in TGFs and concomitant immunosuppressive          effects on natural killer cells In this regard our          demonstration that the expression of TGFs in the          preclinical rat model is unaffected by tamoxifen cRA          and HPR may actually have positive implications          because these agents are already in clinical use                          Limitations of the NMUinduced rat model of mammary          carcinogenesis          The NMUinduced rat model of mammary tumorigenesis is          widely used for chemoprevention studies and yields rapid          development of hormonally responsive mammary tumors with           incidence     To do this the initiating          agent is given at  weeks of age during early puberty          and the chemopreventive agent is typically given          continuously starting  week later Since sexual          maturity is achieved at approximately  weeks of age in          rats this means that the chemopreventive agent is given          during a period of active development of the mammary          gland          In the present study we observed that the histology of          the tamoxifentreated mammary gland differed          significantly from control glands when examined after           weeks of tamoxifen treatment Specifically there were          fewer terminal endbuds and less tertiary branching          which are indicative of a delay or arrest in normal          mammary development This is consistent with the known          requirement for estrogen for proper mammary development            We saw a lesser effect with HPR although this          type of phenomenon has also been described in the          literature for retinoids   Thus part of the          chemopreventive efficacy of antiestrogens and retinoids          in this model may be due to a generalized decrease in          ductal development Because chemopreventive agents are          unlikely to be given to humans during the pubertal          period this form of preclinical model may not accurately          reflect the degree of chemopreventive benefit that could          be achieved in humans Although the accelerated time          course and high penetrance of disease reduces the costs          of this model it may be advisable to confirm efficacy of          promising agents in a model that delays application of          the chemopreventive agent until the mammary gland is          fully developed                            Conclusion        We have shown that treatment of rats with tamoxifen or        retinoids results in effective chemoprevention of mammary        tumorigenesis without any detectable effect on local        expression of TGFs Although we cannot rule out more        subtle effects on TGF activity such as the activation of        latent forms the data suggest that the underlying        molecular mechanism of chemoprevention by these agents does        not involve increases in TGF expression This agrees with                in vitro work showing that blockade        of TGF signalling did not abrogate the growth inhibitory        effect of tamoxifen on breast cancer cells   Given the        very limited breast tissue available in clinical        chemoprevention trials we do not recommend testing for        TGFs as surrogate endpoint biomarkers at this time
