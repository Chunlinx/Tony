                            Epidemics of overt toxicity following widespread environmental contamination from        commercial toxins heralded the discovery of childrens enhanced vulnerability to lead        methyl mercury polychlorinated biphenyls PCBs and tobacco  Box  Over the        past three decades researchers have found that remarkably lowlevel exposures to these        toxins are linked with less overt symptoms of toxicityintellectual impairments behavioral        problems spontaneous abortions or preterm births           Moreover        there is emerging evidence that decrements in intellectual abilities and low birth weight        linked with lead or tobacco are for a given increment of exposure greater at lower levels        than those found at higher levels         The consequences of exposure to many other chemicals or mixtures of chemicals such as        insecticideschemicals oftentimes specifically designed to be toxicare largely unknown         Many of these chemicals or their metabolites are routinely found in the        blood and body fluids of pregnant women and children                     Childrens Vulnerability to Environmental Toxins        The developing fetus and young child is particularly vulnerable to certain environmental        toxins  Critical neurodevelopmental processes occur in the human central        nervous system during fetal development and in the first three years of life These        processes include cortical functional differentiation synaptogenesis myelination and        programmed apoptosis         Childrens exposure to environmental toxins is insidious Environmental toxins covertly        enter a childs body transplacentally during fetal development or by direct ingestion of        house dust soil and breastmilk and other dietary sources during early childhood         Our ability to directly measure the actual levels of environmental        chemicals in human tissues and body fluids using biologic markers biomarkers enables        scientists to more effectively link exposures to environmental toxins with disability or        disease         Despite our increased knowledge of the toxicity of environmental chemicals testing for        developmental neurotoxicity DNT and reproductive toxicity is rarely done DNT testing        uses animal experiments to provide information on the potential functional and morphologic        toxicity to the fetal nervous system that results from the mothers exposure to toxins        during pregnancy and lactation Paradoxically DNT testing of a chemical is seldom        requested and then typically requested only if there is preexisting evidence that it is        neurotoxic                    The Prevalence of Diseases and Disabilities Linked to Environmental Toxins        Based on parental reports one in six United States children has one or more        developmental disabilities from a subtle learning disability to overt behavioral or        emotional disorders  Exposures to environmental toxins have been linked with higher        rates of mental retardation intellectual impairment and behavioral problems such as        conduct disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder                  One in ten US babies is born preterm and about  have low birth weight  Preterm        birth defined as birth at less than  weeks of gestation is a major determinant of        infant mortality and morbidity throughout childhood  Exposures to environmental        toxins such as lead tobacco smoke and DDT have been linked with an increased risk for        spontaneous abortion low birth weight or preterm birth  The        rate of occurrence for many of these diseases or disabilities has been rising as has        treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression in children                Multiple risk factors including both genetic and environmental influences interact in        complex and often unknown ways to cause disease and disability in children But efforts can        be undertaken to prevent or reduce environmental exposures linked to disease without full        elucidation of the underlying mechanism  Thus conducting some sort of test to        identify pesticides and industrial chemicals that could cause reproductive or        neurobehavioral toxicity before the chemical reaches widespread use is essential to protect        pregnant women and children                    Origin and Evolution of DNT Tests        The process for testing potential developmental neurotoxins in laboratory animals        evolved out of a series of tragic epidemics Widespread use of the drug thalidomide during        the s led to an epidemic of phocomelia an absence or deformity of limbs and other        congenital defects in children exposed in utero to the drug  Subsequently in         the Food and Drug Administration FDA developed the Teratology Guidelines Because        thalidomide induced gross defects in rabbits but not in rats these guidelines called for        toxicity tests in two species Moreover these guidelines focused on gross abnormalities        they did not require testing for behavioral or DNT        Following the outbreak of methyl mercury poisoning in Minamata Bay Box  Japan and        the United Kingdom added behavioral DNT guidelines to their teratology requirements in         and  respectively  In  the Collaborative Behavioral Teratology Study        CBTS was conceived to standardize and evaluate methods for DNT testing in the US         The final report was issued in  and shortly thereafter Dr Donald Kennedy who was        then Commissioner of the FDA supported the adoption of the CBTS recommendations But the        FDA failed to implement these recommendations after Kennedys departure                  Childrens exposure to environmental toxins is insidious                In  the US Environmental Protection Agency EPA identified nine developmental        neurobehavioral teratogens for both humans and animals lead PCBs methyl mercury        cocaine alcohol phenytoin heroin methadone and ionizing radiation and developed rules        for DNT testing in laboratory animals  By  the Developmental Neurotoxicity        Test Guidelines OPPTS  had been established for use when submitting chemical data        to the EPA  In  the National Research Council recommended that DNT data be        included in the EPAs evaluations of pesticides which include classes of chemicals        specifically designed to be toxic                     The Precarious US Framework for Protecting Children        Despite numerous attempts to upgrade the regulatory system such as the CBTS the        framework to protect children from environmental toxins is precarious Under current        regulations manufacturers of commercial chemicals excluding pesticides are not required        to supply any toxicity data before selling their products Nor are pesticide manufacturers        obligated to supply basic premarket toxicity and exposure data necessary to ensure that        children will be protected from exposure and potential harm from use of those pesticides        Indeed the vast majority of chemicals have not been tested for DNT The most basic        toxicity tests in animals are lacking for  of the  highest production volume        chemicalschemicals for which annual production exceeds  million pounds per year         The US EPA has entered into an agreement with the American Chemistry        Council the chemical manufacturers trade association to provide basic toxicity screening        tests for the highproductionvolume chemicals by         httpwwwepagovchemrtkvolchallhtm but this is voluntary        For new pesticides intended for use on food cropsone of the areas in which regulations        are most stringentregulations require only that DNT testing be evaluated for substances        already known or suspected of being toxins Further neurotoxicity testing need be        conducted only in adult animals The EPA acknowledges that over  registered pesticides        are neurotoxic ie specifically designed to act against pests by interfering with        neurotransmitters or other processes shared by mammals and insects but the EPA has        received DNT testing using validated protocols for only nine pesticides         There is no general requirement that pesticides or other chemicals be tested for        potential DNT prior to their registration and use  For pesticideswhich undergo more        premarket testing than other chemicalsthe EPA has relied on a tiered system of toxicity        testing The assumption underlying this system is that positive findings on earlier more        basic tests of neurotoxicity in adult animals will trigger the EPA to request more        extensive testing by manufacturers including tests in immature animals Unfortunately        this tiered process has failed to result in appropriate DNT testing In  an internal        EPA Toxicology Working Group concluded that these triggers may not be sufficient to        identify all chemicals that have the potential to produce DNT  Moreover this tiered        system discourages industry from conducting testing in immature animals because the        findings could necessitate further costly testing and hinder a chemical from reaching the        market                    The European Framework REACH        In  the European Commission affirmed that the European Unions legislative        framework did not provide adequate information about the adverse effects of chemicals on        human health and that when hazards were identified the regulatory agencies were slow to        assess risks and to introduce measures to reduce those risks  Indeed chemical        manufacturers are not required to prove that a chemical is safe before marketing it The        European Commission proposed a new regulatory framework for chemicals REACH Registration        Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals  Figure         Under REACH chemical manufacturers would have to assume a much greater burden for        showing the lack of harm from use of their products Specifically REACH would require both        European and nonEuropean manufacturers doing business in Europe to submit more extensive        toxicity data for about  chemicals on the market including reproductive and DNT data        for those chemicals produced in highest quantity Chemicals found to be hazardous would be        subject to an authorization procedure to show that they can be used safely or that there        are no safer alternatives This registration process would not guarantee that chemicals are        safe but it is a step in the right direction        The American Chemistry Council has objections to REACH stating that the proposed        regulation is burdensome costly and impractical        httpwwwaccnewsmediacomsitepageaspTRACKIDVIDCIDDID        The pharmaceutical industry used similar objections to ward off regulations before the        thalidomide epidemic ushered in requirements for pharmaceutical agents to undergo extensive        premarket testing in clinical trials                     Limitations of Existing Animal Tests for DNT        The US EPA has been slower than the EU to adapt to the overwhelming evidence that        lowlevel exposure to environmental toxins can be harmful The EPA continues to rely        heavily on data from animal toxicity testing conducted on only a single animal species        and in adult animals Furthermore EPA guidelines for a general developmental toxicity        screening test typically examine only crude toxicological endpoints such as death body        weight or organ dysfunction In contrast the DNT includes tests of locomotor activity        acoustic startle learning and memory But as currently designed the existing tests may        miss important effects such as mood changes impulsive behaviors and attentional problems        that in humans have been shown to result from exposures to environmental toxins         While these effects might seem subtle they can seriously interfere with        a childs social and emotional wellbeing It is also uncertain whether tests conducted        under current EPA guidelines will detect subtle deficits in key human skills such as        reading        There are other problems with relying principally on adult animals to signal the        potential for DNT in humans The structure and development of the cerebral cortex of        animals commonly used in these studies differs markedly from that of humans A chemicals        effects on one type of animal may differ from its effects on other animals and on humans        In the case of thalidomide highdose fetal exposure had adverse morphologic effects on        rabbits but not rats functional effects have only recently been described         Although there is some concordance of human and animal data for the adverse effects of        lead mercury and PCBs intake limits for these compounds established exclusively on the        basis of rodent studies have not been sufficiently protective of human health compared with        epidemiologic studies  Indeed there is compelling evidence from epidemiologic studies        of widespread contaminants such as lead tobacco and PCBs that human studies are essential        to ensure that children are not harmed by low levels of exposure                         From a scientific standpoint data from epidemiologic studies represent the gold        standard for detecting subtle effects of environmental toxins on humans But        epidemiological studies are expensive to mount difficult to execute and take years to        complete Using observational studies to disentangle the adverse consequences of a single        toxin from other environmental influences and to promulgate regulations is a difficult and        painfully slow process There is also a financial disincentive for chemical registrants to        voluntarily fund such studies because a positive epidemiological study could lead to        stricter regulations More importantly if society continues to rely on epidemiologic        studies to evaluate the toxicity of chemicals only after they are marketed many children        will first be harmed                    Steps to Protect Children from Environmental Toxins        Children must be better protected from both new and existing chemicals that are known or        possible toxins  To protect children from existing toxins such as lead mercury and        tobacco the US EPA and FDA need more authority and resources to regulate and reduce        emissions and exposures Under our current system efforts to enhance regulations to        protect children from confirmed toxins are costly and protracted Indeed countless        communities across the globe suffer from widespread environmental contamination If there        is any lesson from our experience with environmental toxins it is that we need to identify        environmental chemicals that are toxic before they are marketed or widely disseminated        For new commercial chemicals toxicity testing in animals should be required before they        are marketed For all new chemicals including pesticides extensive premarket testing        should be required in multiple animal species of both sexes and at different developmental        stages These tests should be designed to have adequate statistical power to detect subtle        differences within the ranges of exposure that occur in human populations If implemented        these testing requirements would represent a dramatic departure from existing regulations        while providing a powerful incentive for industry to develop less toxic chemicals        Toxicity testing in animals is essential but insufficient to protect pregnant women and        children For one thing uncertainties about the safety of a chemical for humans will        persist even after toxicity testing in animals is successfully completed One additional        safeguard that deserves further debate is whether prevalent environmental chemicals to        which children could be exposed should undergo more extensive testing in human trials        before they are marketed If done these trials should examine exposure uptake using        biomarkers and adverse effects among children or other populations only when the product        is used as intended For example once animal toxicity testing of a residential pesticide        is complete including DNT and reproductive toxicity testing a pesticide could undergo        further testing in the home environment Using an experimental group and a control group        researchers would compare levels of pesticides found in settled dust on childrens hands        and in their blood urine or hair Children would be followed when indicated to ensure        that an excess of neurobehavioral problems or other relevant outcomes did not develop among        those whose homes were assigned to receive the pesticide application        If such trials were undertaken families would need to be fully informed about the        purpose potential benefits and risks of participating The trials should be conducted by        the federal governmentor other independent entities that do not have any ties to the        chemical industryand funded by an industry fee or tax Community representatives would        need to be involved in the review and approval of such trials and ethical standards would        need to be established regarding for example the role of data safety and monitoring        boards Many families would undoubtedly find it objectionable and would choose not to        participate Indeed some products might never undergo testing if they failed to offer        meaningful benefits to families in which case the product would either be taken off the        market or never reach the market        This type of trial sounds extreme but it is quite rational when compared to the        existing approach of disseminating a potential toxin into childrens environments without        any human data about exposure uptake or toxicity Furthermore under our existing system        families are neither informed nor given an option to decline involvement in what ultimately        are experiments exposing millions of pregnant women and children to potential toxins Thus        we need to thoughtfully deliberate about whether these types of trials can be done in an        ethical fashion We also need to have further debate about whether it is ethical to        continue to disseminate chemicals of unknown toxicity into childrens environments or to        allow children to continually be exposed to prevalent toxins like lead despite        considerable evidence that they are toxic  Too often it is left up to a few        investigators or community leaders to discover and quantify the adverse effects of toxins        and advocate efforts to reduce childrens exposure                    Conclusion        In contrast with the EUs proposed REACH program which would require industry to        conduct more tests or analyses to demonstrate that highproduction chemicals will not cause        harm to fetuses or children the Bush administration has arguedin unison with the American        Chemistry Councilthat such regulations would harm industry  It is time to        acknowledge that the existing requirements for toxicity testing and regulations are        inadequate to safeguard pregnant women and children Until a formal regulatory system is        developed to effectively screen and identify new and existing chemicals that are toxic to        pregnant women and children we are left to await the next epidemic to warn us about an        environmental disaster Unfortunately by then we will have once again fouled our nest
