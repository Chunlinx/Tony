                                 Auf Wiedersehen Pat            Leading figures in the GOP have been doing their utmostto persuade Pat Buchanan to stay in their party George W has sent goodwillemissaries Republican National Chairman Jim Nicholson has been begging for ameeting According to a New York Times story the Republicans are near togiving up hope of changing Buchanans mind This is the wrong attitudeentirely For moral and tactical reasons conservatives should be cheering theprospect that the bum might throw himself out            Since Buchanan first ran for president in  thepress has largely treated him as a legitimate candidate rather than anextremist canker on American politics  la David Duke or Louis Farrakhan Partof the explanation for this is that hes one of us Though few journalists haveany sympathy for Buchanans views some find it hard to reconcile evidence ofhis bigotry with the friendly guy they know For those covering his campaignsthere are other disincentives Once you brand him an antiSemite a racist anda fascist its not much fun riding around New Hampshire with him in a minivanWhats more there is a dimension of selfconscious theatricality to Buchanansperformances that makes his views easier to dismiss Hell uncork a zingerabout not buying any more chopsticks until the Chinese quit dumping cheapimports and then cackle at his nono You can write this kind of thing off asjust Buchanan tomfooling around and building his brand for TV rather thandyedinthewool bigotry             Yet the bigotry is there all right You can follow itsregular eruptions through his career from Buchanans  memo to RichardNixon suggesting that he link a primary opponent with New York Jewish moneyto the now infamous  column I excavated some years ago from the archives ofthe St Louis GlobeDemocrat in which Buchanan offers qualified praise forHitler to dozens of subsequent utterances that mitigate fascism and castaspersions on nonwhites Buchanan is our Zhirinkovsky our JeanMarie LePen            His prejudice is not the genteel country club varietythat may linger in patches elsewhere in the GOP People who know him say hegives no sign of disliking Jews or blacks in person His variety of bigotry isfar stranger and in its way much more alarming Buchanan is a kind of fascistfellow traveler who dabbles in an anachronistic style of populist demagoguerythat points to cosmopolitan Jews and to a lesser extent nonwhite immigrantsas the source of the countrys problems In  profascism is such a bizarrestance that its almost easier to believe Buchanan isnt saying what he seemsto be saying than to recognize his views for what they are            The charge that Buchanan is an antiSemite often beginswith his penchant for defending accused Nazi war criminals While this mightseem an eccentric crusade theres nothing intrinsically wrong with it Indeedthe urge to defend the rights of deeply unpopular people is admirable Buchananclaimed a measure of vindication when John Demjanjuk who was accused of beingIvan the Terrible a sadistic killer at Treblinka had his convictionoverturned by the Israeli Supreme Court But the problem was never Buchananstaking on the case of accused Nazis per se It was that in defending them hetried to cast doubt on the Holocaust itself In one of his columns aboutDemjanjuk Buchanan asserted that Jews couldnt have been gassed to death atTreblinka This isnt just an erroneous view Its a staple of the literatureof Holocaust denial Since I wrote about this in the New Republic in  moreinformation has emerged about Buchanans bizarre argumenta speciouscomparison of the gas chambers at Treblinka and an accident in whichschoolchildren survived inhaling diesel exhaust fumes in an underground tunnelAn article posted on the Web by Jamie McCarthydemonstrates persuasively that Buchanan borrowed the analogy from thenewsletter of a Holocaustdenying group that calls itself the German AmericanInformation and Education Association            If dabbling in Holocaust denial doesnt convictBuchanan of antiSemitism on its own it makes a powerful case in combinationwith the many things he has said and written pointing to Jews as asurreptitious sinister force in American life The fuss about Buchanan firststarted in  when he blamed Jewish neoconservatives of dragging the countrytoward the Gulf War In a similar vein in his  campaign Buchanan wouldhint that Jews were to blame for much else sarcastically enunciating the nameof Ruth Bader Ginsburg when complaining about the Supreme Court Or he wouldattack New York bankers often singling out the firm of Goldman Sachs butnever Bear Stearns or Salomon Smith Barney Or he might complain about theglobalist economic policies of Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspannot those ofLloyd Bentsen and Bill Clinton In Buchanans neos protectionism andisolationism it isnt hard to hear the echoes of the radio priest FatherCoughlin who associated Jewish bankers with rapacious capitalism            I expected that Buchanan who took a lot of grief forusing this code in  would be more circumspect this time around Not achance His new book A Republic Not an Empire makes his complaints against the Jews more explicit than ever A brief forisolationism the book includes a pocket history of Jewish Influence in USforeign policy from  to the present Buchanan who blamed Jews for draggingAmerica into the Gulf War thinks they also pushed us into World WarIImistakenly His words echo those of Charles Lindburgh a leader of theAmerica First Committee who Buchanan thinks was unfairly labeled anantiSemite for warning the country about Jewish influence in Hollywood and themedia Buchanan whose campaign Web site sports an America First logoechoes Lindbergh when he decries the growing domination of US foreign policyby ethnic groups and media elites able to focus public attention and incitepublic hysteria Instead of agitating for entry into a specific war he thinksthese ethnic groups and the media elites read Jews are pushing us towardgeneral policies of interventionism and internationalism            Of course Buchanans bigotry isnt limited to Jews Inthe Nixon administration he wrote memos arguing against integration He stayedon in the White House after Nixon resigned in hopes that Gerald Ford mightnominate him ambassador to South Africa a position that would allow him helpforestall what he once called the idiotic idea of oneman onevote One ofBuchanans most famous lines is about how Zulus just wouldnt fit in inVirginia but he has said far more explicit things about America being awhite nation In a  column he defends flying theConfederate flag over the South Carolina capitol because the Civil War did notbegin over slavery He says the peoples symbols shouldnt be chosen byelites and modernistsI wonder whom he could mean Buchanan doesntwelcome Hispanics any more than Zulus He says in his book that we should spinoff Puerto Rico as an independent country because most people on the islanddont speak English But as David Broder notes in a WashingtonPost column Buchanan would like to offer US statehood to Canadiansincluding Francophone Quebecois who happen to be white            The more you learn about Buchanans views the more thequestion becomes why Republicans have tolerated a semifascist in their midstfor so long Saying good riddance to Pat makes political sense too If asseems likely he bolts and mounts a thirdparty campaign the GOP would do wellto depict him as a hater from the fringe and not merely a conservative whorefused to compromise According to one recent poll Buchanan gets  percentof the vote in a threeway matchup with Bush and Gore Would that many peoplesupport Buchanan if they knew what he really thought I dont think so Butperhaps the Republicans do
