                                 Why Cant a Woman Be More Like a Man            Imagine a tropical island onwhich some of the girls at adolescence magically turn into men Think of thescientific possibilities Finally we could tease apart nature and nurture andsee whether men and women differed because of how they were brought up aschildren As the twig is bent we say so grows the branch we expect theseteens to have girls minds in boys bodies and to suffer from a painfulconfusion of gender roles            As ithappens this is not a thought experiment In a few Dominican villages somefamilies carry a gene that leaves newborn boys with undescended testicles and astunted penis resembling a clitoris They are raised as girls until pubertywhen the new rush of androgens gives them normal male genitals and a masculinebody complete with facial hair The villagers call them guevedoces eggs or ballsat The child switches genders wears male clothingbegins to date and turns into a normal man without fuss or trauma So muchfor bending the twig Gender identity comes either from the effects of hormoneson the brain or from the way people are treated as adults or both childhoodnurture makes little difference            Ballsat is just one of the fascinating discoveriesbrought to light in Deborah Blums excellent book Sex on the Brain TheBiological Differences Between Men and Women  This is the real EverythingYou Always Wanted to Know About Sex or The Sexes Why are there sexes Tochange our biochemical locks every generation and keep a step ahead of therapidly evolving pathogens that try to pick them How different are mens andwomens brain structures Not very Do raging hormones turn men intotestosteronepoisoned rapists and women into weepy premenstrualhusbandstabbers No both times Are men and women biologically different inways other than the obvious anatomical ones Yesmen are shorterlived morecerebrally lopsided more violent better at some spatial abilities worse atverbal abilities more competitive but more forgiving of their competitorsmore sexually jealous more socially obtuse and more promiscuous at leasttheyd like to be            Not onlyare we learning more about sex differences but we also have an elegant theoryto explain them In the s the biologist Robert Trivers showed how all themajor differences between the sexes in the animal kingdom flow from adifference in the size of their investment in offspring The female begins withthe bigger antean egg that is far bigger than a spermand usually commitsherself to even more such as yolk or in mammals blood and milk The malecontributes a few seconds of copulation and a teaspoon of semen The number ofoffspring in each generation is limited by the females contribution one foreach egg she produces and nurtures            That has two momentous consequences First asingle male can fertilize several females forcing other males to go matelessMales must compete for access to females by beating each other up corneringthe resources necessary to mate or persuading a female to choose them Seconda males reproductive success depends on how many females he mates with butnot vice versa for a female one mating per pregnancy is enough That makesfemales more discriminating in their choice of sexual partners            Humanshave added some twists to the mammalian pattern Men generally invest in theirchildren by providing food protection and care So females also compete formates though they look for the ones most willing and able to invest not theones most willing to copulate those are never in short supply Females likemales may be tempted by infidelity though their genetic motive is qualityrather than quantity A discreet adulteress can get the genes of the fittestmale and the investment of the most generous male An easily cuckolded malewould devote his efforts to the genes of a competitor which is Darwiniansuicide hence mens intense sexual jealousy            Blum is a superb science reporter who presents just theright amount of complexity tries to explain findings rather than just reportthem and writes in a consistently clear and pleasant style Sex on theBrain is such a good window on the state of the art that its only flaws arethe flaws of the researchers themselves            UnlikeRobert Wright and Matt Ridley who have also written excellent recent books onthe biology of sex Blum does not ground her own story in rigorous evolutionarybiology but rather lets the laboratory scientists speak for themselvesUnfortunately many good bench scientists are mediocre theorists often bychoice Why questions are thought to be an indulgence appropriate only formusings over beer at the end of the day Blum reports and occasionally echoessome sloppy evolutionary explanations including casual analogies betweenarbitrary species and Homo sapiens the equation of evolution with progressthe idea that contemporary changes in Western society are the vanguard offuture evolution and repeatedly the error that our adaptations are for thegood of the species            Adaptations are for the good of the genes thatimplement them and one of the best demonstrations is right in Blumsterritory the  ratio of males to females If organisms were designed tobenefit the species they would not waste half the available food on sons whocant directly replenish the species with babies Any necessary geneticvariation could easily be supplied by a few studs Organisms pump out sonsbecause whenever females are more plentiful the genes of mothers and fatherswho bear sons have a reproductive field day and the mixture settles at If the species suffers thats just too bad            Blum notonly fails to share these explanations but also sometimes repeats ones thatare downright wrongsuch as that men die young because the species needs themless A better explanation is that males reproductive fate depends morestrongly than females on competing when they are young So any gene thatbuilds a man with a strong young body at the cost of a weak old body willprosper            Blums informants also mislead her in their appeal tochemistry as an ultimate explanation of sex differences Blum masterfullyexplains why the effects of hormones are more complicated than pop sciencewould have us think They are produced by several organs in both sexes may beconverted into one another and can have varying effects in different speciessexes and individuals The moral is that it is not hormones themselves but theneural circuitry shaped by natural selection and modulated by the hormonesthat explains our thoughts and feelings The role of particular hormones may belike the role of green wires in an electronic device The answer to thequestion How does the device work depends on which wires connect whichchips not on the fact that a given wire is green            Thisundermines explanations that assume ironclad effects of hormones Take the ideathat men became less competitive because women insisted on monogamy whichlowers testosterone Natural selection is a resourceful tinkerer and could haverewired mens brains to respond to lowered testosterone in any number of waysnot necessarily by becoming less competitive A better answer would appeal tothe tradeoffs males face between investing in their current offspring vscompeting with other males to sire new offspring with other females            In many circles The Biological DifferencesBetween Men and Women are fighting words It seems a short step from sayingthat men and women are biologically different to saying that women areinferior Moreover if obnoxious behavior like aggression rape andphilandering are biological that would make them natural and hence goodorat least in the genes where they cannot be changed by social reform Theresult has been an angry rejection of the research Blum reports and an attemptto disseminate a feelgood alternative in which boys and girls are identicaland infinitely malleable            Blum rejects these nonsequiturs She does recount the sexist pres research which isoccasionally hilarious as when scientists were obsessed with testosteronewhich they treated as the essence of masculinity and sometimes tragic as whenharebrained theories led to horrifying surgical procedures on women Blumdismisses bad research with the right touch of scorn but does not feel a needto neutralize it with politically palatable agitprop She believes that sciencecan approach the truth and that we are best off if we know it and deal with itthoughtfullywhich she does Sex differences she points out offer no supportto invidious stereotypes are not a guideline for what is right do not applyto every individual and never justify the restriction of opportunity Theignoble impulses of both sexes are part of a complex mind that can oftenoverride them and social arrangements from individual marriages to entirelegal systems can change for the better
