        yeah are you there     yes   okay do you know the question for today   uh yes its about why there arent more people that are voting and participating in   and what is your feeling do you think this is vital importance   oh absolutely   okay do you   um i think that uh its kind of discouraging to um i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing and its really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not a lot of them are so ill informed they have no idea you know even theres theres an election or and these are people that are registered   i it  i have worked in some campaigns and its the most discouraging thing in the world im originally from Oklahoma and up there if they miss three elections then they have to reregister and i have often wondered if if maybe that would help the situation i dont know   well thats a thought   well can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people   hm  i dont know i i like that idea um oh i had a though just a second ago but it slipped my mind um   oh thats  its   one thing that i that i think probably one of the reasons that people dont vote more is because they dont know the candidates and i think sometimes you know thats one thing that i have learned in working working in elections and things is you know sometimes even when you work for someone you dont really know what theyre like i know theres been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for and when they got in office it was just a disaster   well   uh and and im not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them   im im im not sure the only thing is if they dont vote they have no right to complain   absolutely   it is um i dont know why we are so complacent but im gonna vote each time right or wrong im gonna cast a ballot and then if im unhappy with it i have the right to express my opinion   thats right   so uh there was something else i was gonna and im like you ive just lost a train of thought that i had but they have been more little more effective in Oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it   now if you just lose if you just skip one election   no three you have to  you have to skip three   three umhum   and um course those can be they can be oh a long time apart but um   i think thats an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it   of course what do you think and this is not one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting   no excuse i im not sure if im familiar with that or not   okay im sure all over the state of Texas now you have three weeks to go for absentee balloting   umhum   and you dont have to have be sick out of town or anything there there is no excuse anyone can go and vote   oh i think thats great uh   do you   actually you know my husband has run for office before and sometimes its nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because you know if youre gonna be tied up that day uh campaigning or whatever it might be um that kind of just kind of takes that load off you know you can just go ahead and get that taken care of and   but that is an excuse and that would i could live with   umhum   but this idea of anyone well i just i am so bitterly opposed to this if youre busy that has always been a legitimate excuse   umhum   if you are incapacitated ill health but to have the expense of lets see they have five six people at my polling place they can come from all over the city and i dont know why we couldnt have duplicate voting on some of this   well hopefully once they have uh you know once theyve checked them off the list they they do have to check them off a list   yes i know   when they vote so hopefully they couldnt   but is there is every list checked as thoroughly as a you know we back in it when i lived
