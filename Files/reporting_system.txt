The LSC Matters Reporting SystemAugust  IntroductionStarting on July   all LSC grantees began collectinginformation on noncase activities using the Matters ReportingSystem LSC had long noted that grantee programs provide referralsand community legal education that they engage in outreach andthat they work cooperatively with other groups to address the needsof the low income community We recognized that this work oftenentails a great deal of effort and produces significant resultsWith the Matters Reporting System in place an important tool hasbeen created for use by legal services leaders at the nationalstate and local levels in describing the full scale and scope oflegal services being delivered in communities across thenationAlthough the  data reported in March of this year should beregarded as preliminary it covered only half a year and reflectedthe usual kinds of startup problems one would expect of a new datasystem it already has produced a wealth of information thatallows the Corporation to provide a more complete picture of legalservices practice than has ever before been possible on anationwide basis For example we can already say that The total number of people being served annually by LSCgrantees is several times the number of cases being reported on theCase Service Report CSR A conservative estimate of just thepeople receiving services that can be easily counted such asreferrals and legal education presentations shows that more thantwo million people were provided with these services in the lastsix months of  alone Many more were provided with otherservices using delivery vehicles whose reach is more difficult toquantify such as web sites weekly radio and TV shows and legalinformation columns in newspapers More than  percent of grantees are providing various formsof pro se assistance These include workshops courthouse helpdesks forms pleadings selfhelp packets and other resources forselfrepresentation in simple legal matters In addition toproviding an important service to people who cannot afford lawyersLSC grantees are playing a significant role in helping courts todeal with the flood of selfrepresented litigants appearing incourtrooms across the nation Increasingly LSC grantees are important gatekeepers orhubs in referral networks of agencies and service providersserving low income people These are addressing a wide range ofneeds of the poor including access to jobs education shelter andpersonal safety Many LSC grantees operate intake systems thatsystematically diagnose each applicants problems and makereferrals through a network of legal and nonlegal serviceproviders in the community who can provide the most appropriatetypes and levels of serviceWith the implementation of the Matters Reporting System theCorporation has created an asset offering significant dividends forstakeholders at all levels of the civil justice system Along withthe CSR system which quantifies case services the MattersReporting System provides an expanded capacity to produce numericaland narrative data describing the full range of services providedby the core network of legal services programs serving communitiesacross the nation With further refinements underway to improvereliability this system will enable program leaders at all levelsto provide Congress client groups state legislatures barleaders courts funders and other stakeholders with a moreaccurate picture of how many people are being served by LSCfundedprograms It will help to identify innovative bestpractice modelsthat point the way toward more efficient and effective methods ofaddressing the legal needs of low income people It will inform LSCgrantees about the range of methods being used by their fellowprogram managers to deliver more and better services and to assistpeople with the precise level and type of service appropriate totheir legal situation It will enable leaders to do a better job ofmarketing legal services by telling the story of what LSCgrantees are contributing to their communities through thepartnerships they have created and the wide range of solutions theyhave put in placeIn the next section of this report we describe in more detailthe picture that emerges from the  Matters Service Reports Inaddition we outline some changes that the LSC Results Group aworking group of senior LSC professionals plus Ken Smith anoutside consultant that designed tested and is currentlyevaluating and refining a system for reporting matters services isconsidering for improving the reliability of the data obtained for and Overview of Matters Services Provided by LSC GranteesA More than two million people received significant Mattersservices from LSC grantees in the last half of This figure is conservative It only includes the counts thatthe LSC Results Group deemed reliable based on a review of the dataand followup interviews with a sample of grantees See Exhibit for a summary of reliable versus soft numbers The actualnumber of people provided various noncase services by LSCfundedprograms is almost certainly several times higher Refinements inthe guidelines provided to grantees planned for distribution inOctober  will provide more reliable figures to be generatedcovering  and  servicesB Matters services were of six types Community legal education  LSC grantees  percentreported providing community legal education services to low incomepeople in their communities According to matters reports bygrantees in the second half of  more than  peoplereceived these services Among the services delivered were thefollowing Presentations at gatherings of low income people for exampleresidents of a local senior center Legal education brochures distributed at community centershelping agencies and other community sites Legal education videos distributed through librariescourthouse kiosks public access TV and community sites Legal education materials downloaded over the Internet bypeople visiting web sites maintained by LSC granteesCommunity legal education is a crucial service provided by LSCgrantees It informs low income people about their legal rights andresponsibilities connected with various situations they mightencounter as consumers tenants parents spouses employees andcitizens It equips people to handle simple matters themselvesreducing the strain on alreadyoverburdened courts and legalassistance programs It is preventative helping people to avoidmistakes that can lead to more serious legal problems and the needfor representation in the future Pro se assistance Legal services programs provide a broadrange of generalized information and assistance to people wishingto handle simple legal matters themselves without extensiveassistance from an attorney  LSC grantees reported that in they provided pro se assistance services They indicated that inthe second half of  more than  people were served Thenumbers of grantees providing different types of services were asfollowsNumber of Grantees Selfhelp workshopsor clinics   Help desk at court   Self help materialsposted on web sites   Other eg self helpmaterials posted on kiosks  Referrals People come to legal aid offices with a wide rangeof problems some of them falling within the scope of the programspriorities and others that do not Referring people to otherorganizations that can help them is a crucial service that mostlegal aid programs provideAny referral which is not a case as defined by the CSR systemcan be counted as a matter Examples of matters referrals wouldbe criminal matters or civil problems excluded under a granteespriorities  for example divorces not involving domestic violenceor childrenIn the second half of  grantees reported providingmatters referrals to  people The table below indicatesthe kinds of help to which these people were referred Outreach LSC grantees seek to increase visibility in theclient community in several situations  for example whenlaunching new services for example a tollfree phone hotlinetrying to reach specialneeds populations the elderly homelesspeople families reaching the end of their eligibility period forwelfare people in nonEnglish speaking communities or expandingservices into hardtoserve communities for example to smalltowns far from legal aid offices percent of LSC grantees reported that they conducted outreachefforts in  The method used most often by  percent ofgrantees was referral agreements with other agencies These areagreements made with other service providers such as domesticviolence shelters to refer eligible clients to our grantees Thisis a very effective way of letting the public know we arethereOther outreach methods used were informational notices printedin local media  percent TV spots or public serviceannouncements  percent radio spots or announcements percent newsletters of other organizations  percent how toreach us information on web sites  percent and other methods percentIncreasingly grantees are using targeted outreach methodsrather than shotgun approaches like general media advertisingThese are designed to reach people specifically having criticallegal needs addressed by special legal aid projects such asdomestic violence clinics eviction prevention programs anddisability advocacy units An example of targeted outreach is theposting of an advertisement for orderofprotection clinics indomestic violence shelters and family counseling agencies Indirect servicesNumber of GranteesSome legal aid programs tap the significant resources of othercommunity organizations in an effort to expand their reach Theyare doing this by providing legal training and support tononlawyer helping personnel such as social workers ministersteachers and shelter staff who apply this new knowledge to helptheir clients find appropriate legal information and advice whenthey have a legal problem One hundred sixty nine grantees reportedthey used such indirect service delivery models in This has a multiplier effect one lawyer trains  socialworkers each of whom helps  clients resulting in  peopleand families getting legal information materials or referrals theymight otherwise not have hadApplying this principle legal aid programs are beginning toform collaborations with other agencies to provide holisticsolutions for complex problems such as domestic violence that raiseother issues such as the need for income support health care andchild care services Legal aid lawyers and paralegals increasinglyare partnering with social workers medical people job counselorsand other specialists to provide the right mix of legal andnonlegal services people need to get back on their feet Other services In addition to the above there are a numberof newer kinds of services that grantees reported as matters in These include the followingNumber of Grantees Mediation  alternativedispute resolution   Other In the last six months of  LSC programs reported providingsuch other  Matters services to over  peopleC Significance Matters services have major impacts on ourcommunities courts and low income population Community legal education prevents small problems from gettingworse and reduces the strain on our legal system Pro se assistance empowers people to help themselves and makesour court system work better Referrals help people find the help they needIt is clear from the Matters Service Reports that LSC granteeshave dramatically expanded the range of strategies available foraddressing the legal needs of low income people The datacollection system provides LSC with the capacity to track theexpansion of these methods and to better describe their scale andimpacts as this expansion continuesThe Matters data includes some people who were not eligibleclients It is impractical to restrict grantees to counting onlymatters handled on behalf of clienteligible people However webelieve that the number is a small proportion of the total LSCgrantees go to considerable lengths to focus services on theclienteligible population In the first instance this is done bypresenting the services as being for the poor including thetargeting of outreach efforts on groups and areas in which poorpeople congregate and live The subject matter of written materialsand of events for example legal education workshops is on issuesof particular concern to our clients The sponsorship and locationof events and location of grantee offices contributes to thistargeting And where ineligible persons participate anyway thegreat majority of them are nearpoor often those who are eligibleunder nonLSC funding programs such as IOLTA and Administration onAgingEven with webbased services which are notoriously difficult totarget exclusively to a particular segment there is some evidencethat the majority of users are clienteligible people For exampleweb visitor survey data from Pinetree Legal Services in Maineindicates that twothirds of its site visitors are low incomepeople or persons seeking information on behalf of low incomepeopleImplementation of the System A Status ReportPlanning for the matters service reports process was severalmonths in the making In designing the instrument consultant KenSmith and the LSC Results Group examined existing data collectionmodels that state IOLTA funders and individual programs had usedThe group then drafted an instrument and pilot tested it with avolunteer group of  programs in January  Their experienceled to the version that was implemented in all LSC grantee programsin July Whats working what issues need to be addressedThe general concept of matters is working well The data systemseems to have been well accepted by field programs The systemincludes a narrative component as well as statistical reportingproviding the Corporation with a strong capacity for describing thecharacter as well as the volume of services and delivery models inuseThe  reports have enabled the LSC Results Group to identifyadjustments for improving reliability of the numerical data beingprovided by grantees These include Clarification of definitions For example web hits werecounted in the  version of the system but this proved to be avague concept that produced huge numbers but little useableinformation Definitions will be clarified for measures to be usedin  for quantifying the reach of webbased legal education andpro se assistance models Additional questions Considering the difficulty of changingdata collection systems in midstream few changes are beingconsidered that would require grantees to revise their forms orprocedures However in a few areas small changes will be proposedthat are relatively easy to implement For example in grantees will be asked to report the number of newspaper articlespublished rather than the number of people reached by newspaperarticles which is nearly impossible to quantify in a usefulway Improved guidelines For example more guidance will beprovided to grantees on quantifying the numbers of brochures andmaterials packets they have distributed Clearer distinctions willbe drawn between newsletter articles which are targeted towelldefined audiences and newspaper articles which are broadcastto the general population Additional guidelines will be providedfor estimating numbers that cannot be directly countedThese changes are expected to lead to greater reliability in thematters data for  and  Some of the figures which granteesestimated in  will be measured in  as data collectionsystems become better established and guidelines get widerdistribution to program staff Figures which the Results Groupdeemed too soft to be used in  will eventually be moved tothe reliable columnConclusionThe data from the Matters Reporting System can be used for avariety of important purposes These include Producing materials that provide Congress bar leaders andother stakeholders with a more accurate picture of how many peopleare being served by LSCfunded programs Describing the benefits that services such as community legaleducation pro se assistance and referrals to community agenciesprovide to the communities served by LSC grantees Identifying programs that have developed innovativebestpractice models pointing the way toward more efficient andeffective methods of addressing the legal needs of low incomepeople Informing grantees about the range of methods being used bytheir fellow program managers to deliver more and better servicesand to reach more people with the precise level and type of serviceappropriate to their legal situation Doing a better job of marketing legal services by telling thestory of what LSC grantees are contributing to their communitiesthrough the partnerships they have created and the wide range ofsolutions they have put in placeThe Matters Reporting System represents an important asset nowin place in LSCfunded programs It will provide a stream ofinformation about legal services practice serving the civil justicecommunity well into the future
