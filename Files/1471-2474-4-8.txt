                    Background        Statins potent compounds that inhibit cholesterol        synthesis in the liver by blocking        hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A HMGCoA have been        reported to induce osteoblast activity and lead to bone        formation both in tissue culture and in rats and mice                 These findings if confirmed and extended to        include humans have the potential to introduce immediate        new treatment options to patients with low bone mass and        osteoporosis Such treatment is readily available since an        estimated  million patients in the US alone take statins        daily to treat hyperlipidemia with few side effects            Osteoporosis is increasingly recognized as an eminent        public health problem as the mean age of populations in        most Western countries increases and costs related to        osteoporosis are expected to grow sixfold by the year             Data from the National Health and Nutrition        Examination Survey using a definition of osteoporosis        developed by the World Health Organization estimate that        in the United States up to  of Caucasian women over         have osteoporosis and up to  have low bone mass        Noncaucasian women and men tend to have lower rates of        osteoporosis but contribute up to  of the fractures        annually            The only bone anabolic agent known to increase bone        mineral density in both animal models and clinical settings        is human parathyroid hormone  PTH which has recently        been approved by the FDA in patients with advance        osteoporosis     Bonerelated basic and clinical        research has been searching intensively for alternative        anabolic agents for the treatment of osteoporosis        Due to the potential clinical impact of statins as a        treatment option for patients with low bone mass and        osteoporosis it is essential to evaluate its anabolic        activity in several         in vitro and experimental animal        models We have recently reported the anabolic action of        PTH in an ovariectomized OVX SwissWebster mouse model        which like the rat model displays a substantial amount of        trabecular bone in its femoral metaphyses and a        quantifiable loss of bone following OVX     The aim of        this study was to investigate the effect of simvastatin on        the microarchitecture of bone in an established mouse model        of osteoporosis and compare its anabolic action with PTH        We also verified the presence of systemically administered        simvastatin in the mouse serum as this has previously not        been reported and is likely to be of critical importance        when evaluating the effect of simvastatin on bone                    Methods                  Animals           elevenweekold virgin female SwissWebster mice          were purchased from Taconic Farms Germantown NY and

Switzerland equipped with a  m focal            spot microfocus Xray tube as a source     For            image acquisition the specimen was mounted on a            turntable shifted automatically in an axial direction            over   plus half fan angle on either side            taking  projections To scan the entire femoral            width  mm including the femoral head a total            of

administration          In this study SVS was administered by gavage and          requires hepatic conversion to the metabolically active          hydroxy acid SVSOH Because SVS failed to have any          effect on any static CT parameter measured at either          site in mouse femur we conducted separate experiments          designed to detect the presence of SVSOH in mouse serum          after SVS gavage by liquid chromatographymass          spectrometry LCMS          Reversephase high performance liquid chromatography          RPHPLC tandem electrospray ionization mass          spectrometry ESIMS method published by Wu et al             was used to analyze samples of mouse serum for the          presence of SVS and SVSOH The identity of the eluted          peak in RPHPLC was established by the determination of          the mass associated with it by ESIMS The retention          times for SVS and SVSOH were    and             min respectively Threshold of detection on the

area under the curve in the HPLC          profile was linear in the range of  ng These curves          were used to quantitate the drug and metabolite levels in          mouse plasma Based on the spiking of mouse plasma           exvivo with known amounts of drug          and subjecting the samples for the extraction procedure          the efficiency of drugs recovery was estimated to be           for SVS and  for SVSOH Figure is a          representative example of the LCMS analysis of a sample          collected from a mouse  min after treatment with           mgkg SVS In this sample both the RPHPLC tracing and          the ESIMS analysis of the peaks corresponding to the          drug and its metabolite confirm the presence of both in          the serum          Both residual SVS and its           in situ generated metabolite          SVSOH were detected in the mouse plasma as early as           min after gavage administration of  mgkg of SVS the          shortest sampling interval The levels of SVS and SVSOH          in the plasma  min after administration were  and           ngl respectively These findings establish the          bioavailability of the drug following this route of          administration                            Discussion        The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of        Simvastatin on bone in an established mouse model of        osteoporosis This SwissWebster outbred mouse strain        utilized in this study has proven to be a valuable model        for investigating the efficacy of both anabolic and        antiresorptive therapies for the treatment of        osteoporosis Here we have used PTH as a positive control            and compared its effects to SVS While PTH        demonstrated the expected anabolic effect on bone SVS        failed to stimulate bone formation despite our        verification by LCMS of the active SVSOH metabolite in        mouse serum        The SVSOH metabolite is first detectable in mouse serum        by  minutes after gavage administration and serum levels        of SVSOH continued to be observed by both        massspectrometric and UV measurements through the last        serum samples collected at  minutes postgavage Other        experiments failed to detect SVSOH at longer postgavage        timepoints of  and  hours These data are in general        agreement with studies in both rats and canines that        calculate peak serum levels of SVSOH at  minutes        after gavage administration     Thus although we        failed to document any bone anabolic activity of SVS in a        mouse model of OVXinduced osteoporosis LCMS analysis of        the SVSOH metabolite in mouse serum document the efficacy        of our gavage administration of SVS to experimental        mice        Extrapolating from mice to humans the dose of SVS        administered in this study was approximately fold        higher than the average dose given to humans The results        suggest that Simvastatin does not enhance bone formation in        this mouse model         in vivo  despite our ability to        verify the presence of the SVSOH metabolite in mouse serum        by LCMS analysis Furthermore the osteocalcin assay did        not suggest any increase in osteoblast activity in SVS        treated mice consistent with its failure to increase bone        density        It is generally accepted that the hydroxy acid form of        statins are potent inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl        coenzyme A HMGCoA reductase an enzyme that plays a        critical role in cholesterol metabolism where they block        substrate accessibility to HMGCoA reductase effectively        subverting cholesterol levels of HDL       In        addition to lowering cholesterol statins seem to have a        number of additional effects such as the nitric        oxidemediated promotion of new blood vessel growth            protection against oxidative modification of lowdensity        lipoprotein as well as antiinflammatory effects and a        reduction in Creactive protein levels     All statins        limit cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the committed        step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids and sterols                   Considering the enormous potential impact of statins on        the treatment of osteoporosis several groups have further        investigated the skeletal effects of statin use Several        groups have failed to confirm the initially reported        anabolic effect of systemically administered statins         in vivo in rats       One        obvious criticism of the negative data in these studies is        that they did not verify the actual presence of statin in        the animal serum This limitation may be of importance as        Crawford et al    could detect an increase in cortical        bone when statin was administered locally Our study        demonstrated the presence of systemically administered the        SVSOH metabolite in the mouse serum by LCMS analysis        The exact mechanism by which statins perform their        effects on bone cell function is a central issue It has        been hypothesized that statins mediate their effects by        increasing the expression in bone of the growth factor bone        morphogenic protein BMP which in turn leads to        osteoblast differentiation and bone formation     This        mechanism of action has been addressed by Baumann et al in        rats where the anabolic effect of lovastatin on bone was        at least partially due to their inhibiting effect on        osteoclast development     Similarly in the mouse        calvaria model Gasser et al failed to detect any anabolic        activity of statins in bone and suggested that the        disruption of the capillary integrity and local bleeding        might explain some of the previously reported bone        responses            Several studies in humans reported a decreased risk of        fracture after statin treatment       However        larger human studies failed to confirm statins beneficial        effect on bone LaCroix et al found the risk of hip and        arm fracture to be similar among women who used statins and        those who did not take lipid lowering medication            Van Staa et al examining  individuals with a        fracture in the General Practice Database in the United        Kingdom and found no relationship between statin use and        nonspine fracture     Interestingly a report by Meier           had used the exact same database as van Staa et al            but sampled a much larger cohort         individuals with fracture than Meier  and in        addition selected an age and gender matched control        patient for every fracture patient The clinical data        available at the moment does not allow the conclusion that        statin treatment has a postive relationship with fracture        risk        Similarly as described in the clinical trials the early        animal studies reported data supportive of the initial        findings          These results however were        not substantiated in later studies in rodents where SVS        had no or little effect on bone mineral density            However none of the studies has verified the actual        presence of the active SVSOH metabolite in the animal        serum as shown in this study In combination with the        osteocalcin data this report provides strong evidence that        simvastatin does not have an effect on bone in an        established Swiss Webster mouse model of OVXinduced        osteoporosis                    Conclusion        In summary the currently available data on the effects        of statins on bone has done little to confirm the finding        that statin therapy increases bone mass and thereby lowers        fracture risk Few of the studies in animals and humans        have been able to show a predictable beneficial effect on        bone mass and bone turnover This report verifies the        presence of the active SVSOH metabolite in the mouse serum        yet failed to demonstrate
