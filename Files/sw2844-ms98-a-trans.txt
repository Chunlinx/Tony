              okay well i heard Dallas is pretty bad with the crime   well you know you last night i was listening to the uh ten oclock news   uhhuh   and for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings the number of drug deals that were going on and crime and and its so depressing just to even listen to the news anymore   umhum the same way here in Dennison i mean uh back a couple weeks ago they found uh   umhum   some people i dont remember at some fast food restaurant they had been i cant remember if they been shot or if they just been thrown in the freezer but im pretty sure theyd been shot and put the freezer at the fast food restaurant   uhhuh uhhuh   and ive worked in fast food restaurants they dont have that much money on hand they really dont   yeah yeah i did too i remember used i used to work at uh Kentucky Fried Chicken and uh and i just couldnt believe um you know that now i would hate to work at a fast food restaurant or even have my children work in one   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh because of the the crime that they would uh just kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there uh in their cash drawer     yeah right my husband worked at a gas station when he was a teenager   umhum   and he well i dont know he decided not to work one night or something and one of the guys that was working was shot and Kenny quit the next day he just he couldnt deal with it   umhum umhum yeah yeah oh i understand what your talking about so yeah i have uh uh you know a real problem uh even though i live further out in the suburbs the crime follows you anywhere it it doesnt matter if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this   uhhuh everywhere umhum   um so but i just think about all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from   it just seems like a lot of people are attracted to the bigger cities though the worst part of it   umhum umhum   um i lived in Louisville Kentucky for a while i i lived on the outskirts too but Louisville was pretty bad especially during like the uh   umhum   Kentucky Derby at this time of the year its horrible to live in Louisville   yeah umhum umhum yeah so i dont know um you know its asking about what kind of steps we can take um   but uh   uh you know just as citizens to try and um uh protect ourselves i know i have um you know a home security system plus i have the uh the special lights uh on on the outside and i have this   uhhuh the ones that blink off and on for the self i mean   yeah that uh yeah yeah by themselves uh if you if theres some kind of movement then theyll automatically come on um but i mean its just that i constantly think about keeping us safe and protected verses um   right uhhuh how many kids do you have   two two   oh a boy or   one of each umhum yeah yeah   oh thats what ive got it is scary are your babies are they babies or   no no theyre teenagers now   oh well good that theyre a comfort to you ive still got babies ive got   yeah     ive got a four a four year old hell be four and a three month old and its scary  sometimes   oh wow yes thats a problem yeah   im used to living in uh which we dont live in the city but we just   umhum   its still more crowded than what im used to im used to having you know eight or ten houses on one street and this ones got houses on either side and you know real close together and just   umhum yeah yeah       its different yeah living down here now now the nice thing uh i feel a little bit more comfort since were so close together like this um uh i feel like that theres going to be uh less crime or your neighbors going to be watching out for you um because its its practically its in their backyard too   right oh oh well we think our neighbors are stealing from us actually my husband they uh well the one of thems a teenager lives next door and her friends are pretty wild   umhum   theyve stolen gas out of our vehicles and well he went and got a locking gas cap for his they werent stealing it out of mine so much because my car the gas thing is kind of weird where its hard to siphon gas out   oh goodness umhum uhhuh uhhuh   so he went he went and got a locking gas cap and they cut tried to break that off he   oh my goodness   excuse me   umhum   he went down to Uba and noticed that it was hanging off where they had tried to break it off and they stole our tailgate off his truck   uhhuh oh goodness   well we cant say they did but   someone did yeah   were pretty yeah it had to be somebody that you know could do it in the middle of the night and you know theyd seen it earlier   umhum umhum yeah i know that uh its uh its a real problem it doesnt matter really where you are anymore its uh more of a matter of what you the steps that you do to keep yourself safe   umhum   and um so thats thats what i try and uh do   well the only things that we can do as citizens is you know like those uh watch groups that theyll have walking but they can be dangerous too and ive thought about it you know uh   umhum umhum really uhhuh   this isnt like walking around and looking for somebody you can get yourself into trouble   yeah yeah you know i was uh going home the other day and i saw um a guy who who looked like he was breaking into a window and i thought gee whiz you know i dont know if hes really doing that or not or if hes the hes the person who lives there   uhhuh   uh you know and and i was thinking well i need to call the police when i get back home and because it was about oh about four or five blocks from where we live and uh and i thought no you know   uhhuh   because i wouldnt know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight but anymore you know the crime happens in daylight as it does in at night   yeah well i watched it on TV oh i guess last year sometime theyll break in at the day in the daytime and   umhum   i hear that you know it if if you lock yourself out of your house and you try to get in your house itll you give that half the time it takes you to break in uh a professional could break in in in half that time   umhum uhhuh in half that time wow and thats so scary so scary you you think youve got yourself all locked in and safe and and uh somebody could break in a nd uh well i have a dog thats the one thing that i like is   yeah it is uhhuh im getting me uh i want a German Shepherd um i dont want any of those ones that will  up the kids but i do want a German Shepherd   umhum umhum right umhum umhum   because my husbandll leave every once in a while for he works on the railroad and im scared here by myself so   umhum uhhuh oh yeah oh yeah so thats another uh we just a little dog now but he is just as vicious as if you know if you if somebody and loud   and loud     you know and i thought that uh you know wed have to have a big dog but we dont need a big dog we got this little bitty dog that uh part Dachshunds and part uh Cocker Spaniel and he um hes very protective   umhum uhhuh yeah Cocker Spaniels are loud  well there   yeah very protective   now thats one of the best deterrents for a robber is a noisy neighbor even if the neighbors got a noisy dog thats a deterrent because they know that that dogs going to bark   umhum umhum thats right   but its easy to fool a dog too you know throw them meat or   yeah umhum   uh its a real intense burglar can just get another dog thats in heat   right   from what ive hear you know saw on TV   umhum oh wow gosh well it was nice talking to you   yeah it was   okay well   and uh maybe well meet up again alrighty byebye   okay byebye
