                yeah yes i talked with um i talked with people from Richardson and Plano and uh the first three days and then yesterday i talked with someone with from Pennsylvania so its the   yeah because ive only been made this is only my third call i i tried to make calls two different days and i couldnt get through   oh oh i know sometimes i just im in it just takes a very long time so   does it yeah ive been trying to you know do that and and sometimes i just cant wait that long so i just hang up because it keeps going through the thing over and over again   yeah i know well this is hilarious  oh well tell me what books have you read lately   but i knew as soon as i heard your voice i thought Kathys its Kathy Kenser  well well lets see i um  gosh i cant even think i havent read any and youre such a reader i know that and i   well i dont read all that much for enjoyment i mean i read a lot for school but gee i just dont have much time for enjoyment reading   yeah the the last book i picked up was a book by Judy Bloom and it was um it was called um  Smart Women i think   uhhuh um   um or something like that and it was it was kind of i really didnt like it at all it was it was written back in the early eighties and it was all this this um divorced woman syndrome of the   yeah huh oh yeah oh yeah   um it was almost like a a pre AIDS scare kind of thing   interesting   it was really an interesting because i i right away looked at when it was copyrighted   uhhuh   because i could tell by the theme of almost when it was written   yes yes yeah   and it was all about women searching for themselves   umhum   and um you know a lot of  hankypanky going on   yeah yeah that kind of was um kind of a pop psychology time for when when a lot of books like that were coming out i think   thats right   and so that makes real sense that thats um when it was written um i havent wasnt really aware that she had written anything for um adults i was always just more aware of her journal you know for her young people her books uhhuh   yeah yeah umhum yeah and shes more famous for that but she has been writing for adults also and so i thought hey ill just try this you know and see what it was like it was very um  the style was very conversational   ill be darned yeah uhhuh   you would have lots of conversations between people rather than any description   yeah right yeah yeah   you know how that is and and um   yeah i wonder if shes written anything really recently if shes got anything printed in print   yeah she has because i i remember seeing a new book by her that was out and i think it was a it was an adult book   uhhuh ill be darned   so anyway but thats the last thing i ive read and um   yeah yeah well its im trying to think the last actual book i read that wasnt lets see i think i read oh when i was on vacation um between semester break and summer and you know on semester break between spring and summer   yeah   and i went to my mothers i read a book that i have should have read when i was probably in high school i read um Jane Eyre  no wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute Jane Eyre no no no no it wasnt Jane Eyre no it was um   i Wuthering Heights   uh Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen thats what it was yes and um you know i i didnt know what to expect except i had heard that that Jane Austen was such a wonderful novelist and   oh yeah by Jane Austen yes yes   she really was good i mean i was was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so intricately and um   umhum   and you know i just but i as i say i was pretty much ashamed that i hadnt read something before then   yeah because i i think i was i think i read it in college or had to write it read it in high school or college but i dont remember it and then when Jennie had to read it at Gettysburg and i got her the i got her someone i think it was um   umhum yeah yeah uhhuh   oh some actress reading it you know they had an abridged version of it on tape and so i got that for her and she loved doing that but i remember that was the book   oh how interesting yes oh ill bet yeah yeah   and now i i mean i think its around here somewhere im just going to have to put it in the car sometimes and listen to it      right i wouldnt be surprised yeah sure oh yeah well i read that and then im trying to think um usually i try to to find something long that im going to do   but um umhum   when if if i have long periods of time like Christmas vacation or you know when i know im not going to be doing anything for a while um   yeah oh thats what i do too   yeah and thats about it because otherwise im reading so much for school im um i have just started reading a book actually its for school but its for um theres a a literary journal well not a literary journal its a its kind of a journal of of the history of ideas thats thats starting to be published um from UTD the first issue doesnt come out until next year but um im doing some reviews of books just to   oh yeah   what to sort of recommend to whether whether or not a fullscale review should be done for the journal and ive yeah its really neat because these are brand new books and i just got a i got a this this one   oh how neat oh great   um most of the stuff is on uh literary criticism and philosophy and religion and all that this one is on Johann Sebastian Bach and its a a biography a biography   umhum umhum oh great   that is really interesting i mean it its fascinating it really is um but its so long i i dont really have the time to read the whole thing but i think eventually ill go back to it but it   oh thats fascinating oh yeah yeah   it was written i mean the the copyright is nineteen ninety one so its a brand new book yeah uhhuh yeah and he really this man really shed some light on um   oh its a brand new book oh that that would be wonderful to read something like that yeah   some aspects of of Bachs genius and and and you know the and more sociological things you know like the the idea that um that music to be a musician was as much um of a family occupation as anything i mean you know that was it was families had just loads of musicians  yeah thats right   yes yeah and they just went from generation probably to generation just with these with these all passing it from one to the other   yes uhhuh and um   yeah thats the way it was im sure back then yeah oh thats interesting   yeah yeah so um it was just really interesting if thats you know thats kind of what but i have to not only am am i reading reading it to decide whether or not it should be reviewed but also um because the board of advisors for this um journal doesnt have right now doesnt have a really respected name um whos a um a scholar on on music um and im supposed to decide whether i think this man might be a worthy person to be a you know in that position on the board so   umhum oh yeah   i dont know if i want to take that responsibility or not but  but at least i can tell them what i think so um its real interesting   wow thats rough thats real rough yeah well thats a neat thing to be involved in because i think our i think my alma mater um Gettysburg i think they were just starting a magazine   yeah it is uhhuh   that was similar to that i think thats probably a sort of a thing to do in small colleges but um   yeah yeah yes yeah that it you know you see you see a lot of small colleges doing things like that right uhhuh because it attracts really a a lot peoples interest thats one way its really good public relations for small schools i think so   umhum yeah oh yes yeah   but uh another one of my projects this summer is actually its part of my research assistantship is um its helping a professor uh compile a bunch of translations of of various poems for a book that hes writing   oh   and so im learning the names if not the actual contents of a lot of different poems and a lot of French people   now translations what do you mean translations of of   um well where where for instance um a Baudelaire poem that was written in the French and then has been translated into English by various people and the translations are all so different from one another umhum   yeah umhum oh i see all different oh thats interesting   so its multiple translations of single works and and thats right now right now pretty much what im doing as far as um my work is just kind of compiling all that for him so   gosh thats great   its real interesting   boy you really lift me up to a different i mean here i im dealing with uh cleaning the stove and you know im  i wish i were dealing with Baudelaire  that would be nice  but i     oh well let me tell you there are days when i would be prefer really doing that  i dont know if ive told you but um this is not on the subject
