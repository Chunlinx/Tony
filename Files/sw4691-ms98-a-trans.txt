        okay im not as ashamed to claim them this year as a has been so   oh so well it lets put it this way weve got the New England Patriots up here so   oh yeah right well   theyve had some serious problems in the past couple years   really why   yeah um well uh partly due to ownership you know uh Victor Kiam owned the uh the Patriots uh for a period of a number of years and   uhhuh   he always had this uh this wonderful quality of quality being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something and uh theyve had some financial problems with the team and so forth and it recently was sold to uh some other people so hopefully this ownership can set up new direction and uh keep uh the Patriots in the New England arear anyways   yeah well itll be fun for you to watch up there anyway to see what happens now you   oh yeah ive been to a couple of ive been to a few games before   uhhuh   now you youre youre from Texas so youve got two football teams down there   right well it depends on where youre from in Texas i live right by Dallas so we have one football team as far as were concerned thats how its is its divided yeah it really is so   uhhuh oh i see theres that type of segregation huh wow   weve got our Cowboys here and and uh i dont think anybody roots differently   uhhuh do you   but i have a boyfriend that lives in Fresno and he is for the L the uh Raiders LA Raiders so   umhum do you follow professional sports at all   well i just started to this year because of these silly Raiders that didnt do very well  but ive been trying more this year i think i know a little more than i used to i never knew very much at all so     yeah   im trying   well its its a good past time   yeah   you know particularly football they say uh it football attracts more men because of the you know you the you see the the physical aggression on the field and supposedly psychologists say that uh that um men take out their frustrations by watching football and you know they get together with a bunch of guys and they um uh and they have a good time and everything and thats suppose to be some of the uh male bonding and the and the uh the male instincts i guess or something about uh   so i shouldnt even try to do it huh   well no its a its good as in terms of in terms of uh of a contest i think that uh i personally like hockey better because it has contact its a contact sport it has the speed   yeah right   and the hand eye coordination and it takes a certain skill to play hockey not everybody can play hockey   yeah   so we and thats were a big hockey area up here hotbed up here in New England as well as you know in in the Minnesota area but   really i dont even think we have that in Texas but we might do we   what hockey     i mean no  you probably know i dont know nobody talks about it so i dont think we do   no theres no hockey theres no theres no professional hockey teams in in in in Texas it just its   no uhhuh and we have a soccer team that comes and goes we dont even have that very much so   yeah i think though that professional football in particular is becoming so diluted now like they have this World Football League   umhum   you see we have the NFL that that Dallas and Houston are in and New England Patriots and LA Raiders and those teams  there are those teams that play in professional the National Football League   yeah   but uh now they have whats called the World Football League and they have all these teams from theres a team in London and theres a team  theres a theres a uh teams in other European teams and theres teams in the United States   oh   and and and theyre playing now during the summer months and its really  you know overkill you know theres only so much football you can watch   oh yeah yeah well i like to do i dont like to watch i dont like to watch anything   yeah thats good   so it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a TV and watch all this stuff i think its an excuse to do nothing and i i can see what youre saying about the male bonding and the guys get together and thats kind of cool thats fun you know     yeah umhum   but it can get really overdone   now have you ever been to a professional football game   yeah i have yeah yeah i have   have you did you do the whole big the the whole thing the tailgate party and the whole   uh  no actually no um   well see now see now thats what you got to do see now we talked our wives   ive done that for college football yeah   yeah yeah you the same well the same thing we we talked our wives theres about six or eight guys that we used to go out for these games and uh we talked our wives into going with with us one time and they had a real good time and it was basically for the social atmosphere   yeah right and thats the thing yeah   you go you know three or four hours before the game you go set up we set a table up we do some cooking some barbecueing have a few drinks and then go in and see the game and see the Patriots lose and then go home and eat drink some more   yeah     but but that whole it its not so much sure the contest itself and the game itself but its the whole atmosphere of playing uh of going to a game   yeah   it that you miss sitting home in your parlor you know uh with a with a a six pack of beer and some uh potato chips you know you you miss that and and any professional sport i think you miss that   thats right yeah thats right uhhuh   the atmosphere of being there you know   yeah well in high school i went to every football game and       well i twirled you know and i you know i didnt i still dont know that much about football obviously but i still had a good time you know i   yep well football
