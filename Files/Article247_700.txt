                                 Quotations from Chairman Al            The LosAngeles Times and USA Today lead with Fed Chairman Alan Greenspanssuggestion in congressional testimony Wednesday that he foresees a cut nextweek in the fed funds rate which determines the cost of money throughout theeconomy The New York Timesputs Greenspan on its front in column five The big story at the Washington Post is that Newt Gingrich has publicly rejectedwhat the Post calls a pleabargainstyle deal with the White House tohead off formal impeachment proceedings in favor of some quicker but lesserpunishment such as censure The LAT and NYT fronts also report onthese developments The NYT leads with the pledge by Pakistans primeminister that he would sign a nuclear test ban treaty within the next year astory no one else runs on their front page But there is a chickenandeggcontextthe Times goes on to explain that Pakistan says it will signonly if the US lifts the economic sanctions imposed on Pakistan and Indiaafter their surprise nuclear tests last May but that the US will not do sountil Pakistan makes a formal decision to not test its nukes The story does goon to point out some hopeful developments in the relationship between the tworival Apowers at meetings in New York yesterday their prime ministers agreedto resume highlevel talks about the region in dispute between them Kashmirand also to setup a communications hot line            Todays coverage of Greenspan on Fed rates is like all the others youveever read with this difference its about rates going down not up Thelikely move is said to be in response to what the LAT calls a drumbeatof pleas from economists and it could be added from columnists The paperssay that the cut is likely to be a quarter point down to  percentUSAT quotes bigshot economist Allen Sinais prediction that theupcoming cut is but the first of many The LAT points out however thatthere do not appear to be any similar coordinated cuts forthcoming from thecentral banks of Europes leading economies By the way USAT says asurvey it took among  top economists rates the chances of a US recessionnext year as one in four            The Post reports that during closeddoor meetings Gingrich signaledhis intent to expand any impeachment inquiry into Whitewater campaignfinance abuse and technology transfers to China The White House immediatelyresponded says the Post by accusing congressional Republicans of tryingto prolong the Lewinsky matter so as to maximize gains in the Novemberelections The paper describes the atmosphere around the scandal as escalatingpartisan tension            The Wall Street Journal has been running a good first draft ofhistory series all week on the current global economic crisis Todaysinstallment about US missteps compares the ineffective US and IMF aid toThailand to the fatal mistakes of the best and the brightest in Vietnam evengoing so far as summoning Robert McNamara to explicitly make thecomparison            The NYT front and an inside story at the WP  reports thatyesterday Hillary Clinton made a rare and particularly vigorous campaignappearance on behalf of New York senatorial candidate Charles Schumerduring which she characterized Schumers opponent Al DAmato as a Jesse Helmsclone The Times says that the appearance leaves little doubt that inthe current campaign season Hillary will fill the role that in normal timeswould have been filled by Bill The paper also reports that at times the firstlady appeared dazed and distant especially when a reporter standing directlyin front of her twice tried to ask her a question            The WP reports that more than  leading intellectuals and artistsfrom around the world have signed a petition defending President Clintonagainst inquisitorial harassment by a fanatical prosecutor with unlimitedpower Signatories include Desmond Tutu Gabriel Garcia Marquez and EmmaThompson            Todays coverage reminds one that Alan Greenspan maintains the mystique ofhis brilliance by a sort of Delphic vocabulary favoring oblique metaphor overdefinite policy pronouncements Or as the Times puts it MrGreenspanas usual left himself some wiggle room Yesterdays testimony wasepic Chauncey Gardiner featuring talk of rain drops storm clouds andcontagion As a result in any newspaper article about his testimony thedirectly quoted material is almost always meaningless without gobs ofexplanatory text For instance the WSJ quotes Greenspans comment thatWe have to bring the existing instabilities to a level of stability reasonablyshortly I think we know where we have to go I do not think we underestimatethe severity of the problems with which we are dealing and then says thatinvestors widely took this as indicating the quarterpoint rate cut And theJournal says that Greenspans statement If we give indications toworld financial markets that the fiscal structureis being dismantled Ithink there is a price to pay should be translated as warning Congress thateating into the budget surplus with either tax cuts or spending increasescould rattle investors
