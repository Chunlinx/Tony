                    Background        Given the epidemiology of smoking initiation a great        deal of public health policy and programmatic attention has        been directed at youth smoking in the United States            Approximately  of tobacco users initiate use before         years of age and if this trend in early initiation of        cigarette smoking continues estimates are that  million        children aged less than  years who are alive today will        die prematurely as adults            In an effort to discourage initiation of tobacco use        several youth tobacco education programs have been created        and are currently available for presentation to elementary        school students Many of these approaches are schoolbased        programs and a number are cited in the evidencebased        literature as demonstrations of what actually works        Surprisingly however despite some good research studies        and important dissemination efforts by several government        agencies relatively few schools appear to have adopted any        of the recommendations Clearly much additional work is        needed to increase the use of evidencebased prevention        approaches in school settings as well as doing a better        Job of communicating the results of research to the media        and in turn to the general public            A large number of schoolbased programs have been        implemented over the last several years with most of those        efforts targeting elementary andor middle school students        The evaluation results of several metaanalyses of tobacco        and other drug prevention programs strongly suggest that        approaches based on the social influence resistance model        are the most effective Additionally programs that are led        by peers and that are more interactive and allow for        active rather than passive learning have produced the        best results              Several individual studies have highlighted mechanisms        that are effective These have ranged from schoolbased to        communitybased programs they have employed mediadriven        efforts and they have used coordinated combinations of        multiple approaches Reports have described both single        session and multisession interventions with some research        designs extending out over several years       Some        innovative strategies engage students in oneonone        interactions     while others expose students to        tobacco prevention theater productions     Obviously        the more involved the program the more costly it becomes        and the greater the requirements are for logistical        coordination These more extensive programs also require a        greater time investment and sustained commitment on the        part of participants schoolscommunities and        researchers        This present study describes a quantitative evaluation        of the Tar Wars tobacco use prevention program delivered        to a cohort of fifth grade students in western New York        State Focus is directed at baseline measures of        tobaccorelated knowledge attitudes beliefs and        behaviors of the students and subsequent changes that        occur after this brief intervention                    Methods                  Design          Tobaccorelated knowledge attitudes beliefs and          behaviors among a cohort of fifth grade elementary school          students was examined in a longitudinal fashion through          use of a pretest and twostage posttest design The Tar          Wars program offered by the American Academy of Family          Physicians was used as the structured tobacco use          prevention program e g intervention program This          program is designed as a single interactive           minute inclass presentation where students are provided          with a series of dynamic exercises The children actively          learn about the shortterm effects of tobacco use they          contemplate and discuss reasons why people use tobacco          products and they are prompted to think critically about          tobacco advertising The program is often delivered by a          Family Physician or other health care professional               The Tar Wars program content is highlighted in table          and a printed curriculum is available at no charge          httpwwwtarwarsorg In brief the students discuss          tobacco prevalence data the shortterm effects of          tobacco including smelly clothes yellow teeth bad          breath coughing or hacking and difficulty breathing          Additionally they learn to calculate the costs involved          with weekly monthly and yearly tobacco use as well as          possible alternative ways to spend their money They also          have an interactive discussion about the reasons people          start to use tobacco which focuses on awareness of          mediaadvertising images and peer pressure that they are          exposed to Finally through the use of tobacco          advertisements they review misperceptions generated in          the public at large and children in particular related          to tobacco use including  that smoking is related to          obtaining  romance having good looks attaining a          cool image and making friends The program is          reinforced through the creation of individual posters          emphasizing the positive effects of remaining tobacco          free          Comparisons of tobacco use knowledge attitudes          beliefs and behaviors of fifth grade students are made          within a randomly assigned at the level of the school          primary intervention group study Group  across three          points in time  pretest immediate posttest and          delayed posttest          Responses were also compared among children in other          randomly assigned groups Group  and Group  who took          pretests the intervention and immediate          posttests but at different points in time than Group           see Figure  Although Groups  and  can not be          considered true control groups since they also received          the educational intervention they are used in this          paper in certain situations in an attempt to address          issues of testretest bias since only one measurement          instrument is used for both the pretest and the          posttest surveys and historical effects since          other factors besides the intervention may have          influenced the outcomes of the delayed posttest                          Subjects          Following Institutional Review Board approval           elementary schools were recruited to participate in the          study Fifth grade students from  of these schools          explanation below participated in the research          described in this paper The study design and group          comparisons are summarized in Figure  Twentyeight          schools were initially separated into Group A and Group B          using a randomized block design by school size in order          to achieve roughly equalsized groups Group A which          contained  schools was subsequently separated into two          groups by random assignment with each group containing           schools Group B contained  schools The first group of           schools N   will be referred to as Group  the          second group of  schools N   will be referred to          as Group  and the group of  schools N   will          be referred to as Group           In the Fall of  Group  started with  schools          N  Seven of these schools were public and  was          private while  were in an urban setting and  from a          suburban setting All of these students were scheduled to          take a baseline pretest however one school private          urban could not schedule the time for the          intervention and thus did not participate further in          this research effort The difference between  and           students represents the missing school and anyone who was          absent at the other  schools on the day of the posttest          completion Thus  of the  schools  N            completed the baseline pretest and the intervention          The immediate posttest was completed by   of          the  students with baseline data          During the Spring of  after a delay of          approximately four months the schools in Group  were          contacted again so that they could complete a followup          delayed posttest Two more schools were unable to          schedule this followup survey The difference between           and  students represents the two missing schools          and anyone who was absent when the delayed posttest          was administered Thus a total of   out of           schools note N   or  of the students in the          original  school cohort in Group  completed delayed          posttest evaluations These five schools in Group  of          which all were public and  of which were in an urban          setting and  from a suburban setting ended up          completing all study components ie pretest          intervention posttest and delayed posttest and          represent the primary group for analyses          Group  also started with  schools N   of          which  were public and  was private and  of which          were in an urban setting and  from a suburban setting          All of these students completed the same baseline          pretest during the Fall of  This Group was then          scheduled for the intervention during the early Spring          of  about  months later and to complete an          evaluation posttest immediately following the          intervention Five of the eight schools were able to          schedule the intervention and the immediate posttest          during this time The difference between  and           students represents the missing three schools and anyone          who was absent on the day that the immediate posttest          was administered Thus a total of   out of           schools note N   or  of the students in the          original  school cohort in Group  completed all          requested components of which  schools were public and           private and  of which were in an urban setting and           from a suburban setting          The  schools in Group  N   of which  were          public and  was private and  of which were in an urban          setting and  from a suburban setting completed a          baseline pretest during the Spring of  This          Group was then scheduled for the intervention and the          immediate posttest approximately  months later          Three of the twelve schools were unable to schedule the          intervention and the immediate posttest during this          time Thus a total of   out of  schools note N            or  of the students in the original  school          cohort in Group  of which  were public and  private          and  of which were in an urban setting and  from a          suburban setting ended up completing all requested          components          For this study the participation of both students and          schools was voluntary No exclusionary criteria were          employed for any of the groups                          Analyses          Proportions of correct responses to survey items were          compared at the school level using WilcoxonMatched Pairs          Signed Ranks Tests for analyses of data from Group           schools baseline immediate posttest and delayed post          tests and for analyses of aggregate data from the           schools completing baseline surveys the intervention and          immediate posttests Pvalues were identified as          significant if they were less than or equal to  thus          rejecting the null hypothesis of no change from baseline          following the intervention          To examine whether significant differences were          present between groups at the time of completion of the          baseline survey the proportion of correct responses were          compared at the group level aggregated schools for each          group using the MannWhitneyWilcoxon Rank Sums Test          unpaired independent groups Pvalues were identified          as significant if they were less than or equal to            halved for a tailed hypothesis thus rejected the          null hypothesis that the proportions were not          significantly different from each other          Due to skewed data for the proportion of correct          responses to each survey items at the level of both          school and group median values are presented in the          tables and nonparametric procedures were used as          described above                            Results        Responses to the baseline survey for knowledge and        attitude items among all schools were compared across all        combinations of groups  versus   versus  and  versus         No significant differences were noted suggesting that        randomization created comparable groups Also in looking at        the comparison of Groups  and  at baseline we are able        to rule out historical effects that is the presence of        any systematic tobacco programs or policies that might have        impacted our dependent variables In other words there        were no significant differences in baseline measures even        though the surveys were administered four months apart        Moreover these results did not change after the loss of        schools from each group indicating that the final         schools were comparable within and across groups to the        original  schools excluding one school from Group         which dropped out prior to the baseline survey        Table presents longitudinal results for the five        schools in Group  which completed all study components        baseline surveys intervention immediate posttests and        delayed posttests Baseline median scores for correct        responses to survey items range from  up to  with        several values in the mideighties and above suggesting a        ceiling effect Nonetheless following the educational        intervention program significant improvements are noted on        both the immediate posttest and delayed posttests for        items relating to recognition that smokers have yellow        teeth and fingers and costs associated with tobacco        use        Knowledge of tobacco use prevalence for these five Group         schools is shown in table  The median percent scores        for correct responses at baseline are much lower for all        three items ranging from  to  A significant increase        from  at baseline to  correct on the immediate        posttest is noted for the item examining the percent of        adults who use tobacco on a regular basis however the        delayed posttest scores fall back to baseline levels         No other significant findings are apparent for this        group of items        Table and present pooled aggregate data for students        from all  schools  schools from Group   schools from        Group  and  schools from Group  that completed baseline        surveys the intervention and immediate posttests        Although baseline median scores for the pooled data in        table generally range between  and  significant        increases are noted for all items relating to knowledge of        the shortterm effects of tobacco use and half of the items        examining attitudes about tobacco use eg the influence        of peer pressure and the awareness of advertising        imagesdistortions All of the median scores of the items        related to epidemiological knowledge of tobacco use table         showed significant increases between baseline and        immediate posttests although posttest values were sub        optimal in that a number of students still were not        reporting correct responses                    Discussion        These results identified immediate and sustained        improvements for  of  knowledge and attitudebased        survey items on tobacco use following exposure to an        single session inclass youth tobacco education program        These two items related to the powerful image of tobacco        users having yellow teeth and fingers and the costs        associated with tobacco use        These findings hold important public health        significance First unlike other programs that require        multiple sessions and considerable coordination Tar Wars        is a single session structured interactive intervention        program These results suggest the presence of modest and        sustained responses as a result of this single session It        is possible that these key concepts could be reinforced        and even expanded through repeated exposures to and        participation in other complementary tobacco prevention and        health programs Thus Tar Wars can contribute as one        element among a variety of educational strategies In        addition the ultimate success of these educational        programs requires the implementation of a comprehensive        tobacco control strategy including legislation taxation        and modification of social norms        A number of potential limitations warrant discussion        First in assessing postintervention changes in knowledge        and attitudes the potential of a ceiling effect among        variables with a high level of correct responses at        baseline can complicate interpretation Statistical        significance was not achieved for all items showing an        increment in correct responses which may be due in part to        a limited number of schools and the choice to complete        analyses at the level of the school The inclusion of        additional schools in the analysis would have resulted in        significance for additional items        Because student identities were anonymous a repeated        measures design could not be used Also the school groups        sampled at the delayed posttest may not contain the same        students who completed the pretest intervention and        immediate posttest during the Fall of  Also there        was some nonsystematic loss of schools in each group that        were unable to complete all requested components due to        scheduling difficulties and competing demands for classroom        time However the observed response rates were reasonable        given the followup interval of several months Further        these analyses relied upon nonparametric tests at the        level of the school As a result the median scores for        some of individual schools are variable making the        ordering inconsistent over testing occasions which in        turn results in the extreme pvalues from the Wilcoxon        tests        Another potential limitation relates to testretest        bias Theoretically the delay of several months between        completion of the baseline survey and the intervention and        immediate posttest in Group  could be used to examine the        potential issue of testretest bias In using the same        survey instrument for the baseline and posttests we would        tend to show an impact from the intervention where there        might not be one However delaying the intervention and        posttest should create a less pronounced testretest        bias if it exists In other words we would expect to see        a greater increase on the immediate posttest in Group         However a subanalysis demonstrated no significant        differences between Groups  and  at baseline or on the        immediate posttest for any of the ten knowledge and        attitude items Thus the issue of testretest bias does        not seem to be a significant issue        Also through the comparison of baseline surveys for        Groups  and  we were able to rule out historical        effects that is the presence of any systematic tobacco        programs or policies that might have impacted our dependent        variables of knowledge and attitude Moreover these        results did not change after the exclusion of schools that        failed to complete all components indicating that the        final  schools were comparable with and across groups to        the original  schools excluding one school from Group         which dropped out prior to the baseline survey        Knowledge levels regarding tobacco use prevalence among        selected age groups jumps at the immediate posttest but        drops back to baseline levels at the time of the delayed        posttest  months later These results in combination        with the aggregate data comparing baseline and immediate        posttests suggest that Tar Wars is having a positive        impact on these children However virtually all program        components would need to be reinforced through repetition        and recall efforts at some identified interval The active        learning model of Tar Wars which includes interactive        demonstrations and classroom group discussions helps create        the dynamics for longterm retention        This study design assessed changes in health beliefs        eg knowledge and attitudes rather than actual        behavior An assessment of changes in tobacco use behaviors        would require a much longer period of followup Also        health behaviors represent the manifestation of        interactions between attitudes knowledge and beliefs        occurring within an environmental context Thus changes in        attitudes and knowledge are likely to yield corresponding        shifts in behavior Another potential limitation is that        some students were lost to followup due to competing        demands for classroom time        The most effective educational programs are structured        to include a social influence intervention             Moreover associations between cigarette smoking and social        norms peer influences and perceived tobacco use prevalence        have been reported among a group of middle school students         th thgrades     The social influences model        includes dimensions reflecting both normative beliefs        eg pressures to achieve peer acceptance and        informational influences eg advertising    to        enhance awareness of potential health effects and prevent        adoption of unhealthy behaviors The Tar Wars tobacco        prevention curriculum includes elements from both of these        social influence dimensions with discussions of tobacco use        prevalence physical consequences costs and        misrepresentations used in advertising Together the Tar        Wars themes emphasize an enhanced recognition of social        pressures used to influence initiation of tobacco use        A recent study    has reported no effects from        application of a careful constructed social influences        model for a school based tobacco prevention program from        grades  through  These findings were generally        unanticipated and have resulted in ongoing deliberation        about how to assess the impact of youth prevention programs           While the findings from Peterson et al  are        disturbing it would seem foolhardy to simply abandon all        school based tobacco prevention programs                    Conclusions        Only a limited number of tobacco prevention materials        for elementary school children are available from        nonprofit sources     However the tobacco use        prevention program presented in this study eg Tar Wars        appears readily transferable to other communitybased        settings This educational program is available for        presentation by Family Physicians other health        professionals or by other group leaders at no charge and        yielded measurable improvements in tobacco use knowledge        and attitudebased survey items This tobacco use        prevention program is also consistent with guidelines by        the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control    which        recommend inclusion of content which addresses the short        term effects of tobacco use social influences of tobacco        use marketing of tobacco products initiation of        educational programs in elementary school and soliciting        community support Moreover Tar Wars appears to meet        criteria established for the programs that work process        developed by the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control        for selecting tobacco use prevention curricula        httpwwwcdcgovnccdphpdashrtccriteriahtm        It is important to acknowledge that youth are exposed to        a variety of sources advocating tobaccofree lifestyles As        with other educational and motivational efforts in public        health tobacco prevention messages require repetition and        reinforcement via slightly different but parallel        approaches These exposures to parallel messages likely        reinforce or boost the educational impact Other        educational interventions reinforcing the Tar War message        of healthful tobaccofree lifestyles include school health        classes science classes alternative tobacco use        preventioneducation programs and communityreligious youth        groups Tobacco prevention programs represent interventions        designed to increase awareness of the social influences        facing youth In isolation any single prevention program        is probably inadequate to induce behavioral change        However together complementary messages may result in        positive behavior changes through reinforcement of        comparable information        Overall we are looking at modest effects resulting from        this single intervention However Tar Wars and other        complementary program should be viewed as interlocking        pieces of a puzzle not independent processes Also within        the field of public health one of the most important        insights is the understanding of Roses theorem whereby if        a large number of people in this case schoolchildren are        exposed to an intervention and change only a lit bit for        the better then the population health ramifications can be        quite dramatic Certainly the results from this study        suggest that a logistically uncomplicated and low cost        program such as Tar Wars should be included within the        educational armamentarium to aid in preventing youth from        using tobacco products                    Competing interests        Dr Mahoney previously served as a former member and        Chair of the Tar Wars Advisory Board American Academy of
