DearPrudence                                                      This is a politicalconcern not personal Each time I see the erectile dysfunction ad with BobDole I cringe What happened to his statesmanlike demeanor Is it entirely acoincidence that we have a president who can get it up for each and every onewho asks instead of a president who cant Do we need to know about Bobspenile trouble in order to go forward Must we be a party to all hiswitherings Surely someone agrees with me                                       Ricespring                        Dear Rice            Prudie guesses Mrs Doleand her campaign aides agree with you And Prudie is reminded of the oldvaudeville joke about an older gentleman who tells a friend that he finds sexat his age terrific Especially the one in the winter            Prudie neutrally                                             DearPrudie                                                      Your advice to theseemed fair and balanced How rare I thought however I might take theopportunity to chime in and mention that I have got wind of the existence of anherb indigenous to Thailand which reportedly stimulates the actual growth ofexisting breasts Ive heard only scattered reports about it and those mostlyrelating to the Thai governments efforts to quell its export Your readers whoare currently considering artificial augmentation which as a man I findrepugnant may just want to wait a while Im sure a fistful of American moneywill have the Thai people throwing seeds over the border in no time                                       Ameer                        Dear Am            After an inquiryregarding Bob Doles  well anyway your letter is most interesting Prudiehas heard nothing of the Thai herb It is hard to imagine though why anygovernment would embargo such a product unless the plastic surgeons lobby hasalready got to them Prudie hopes your information is correctif only so somehealth food company can market a product called Gingko Bilbooba            Prudie naturally                                             DearPrudence                                                      I grew up beingtaught that people should not make loud noises when eating in public I amquite bothered by coworkers who eat loudly at their desks which are very nearto mine It is common practice in our office to eat at ones desk sincetheres no nice place to eat on the premises One person in particular alwayscomes over to talk while loudly snacking on potato chips and other itemsTrouble is I cant think of any remotely acceptable way to convey myunhappiness with this behavior Id be very grateful if you could                                       JW in Massachusetts                        Dear J            You are correct that youcannot come right out and say It is gauche to come over and serenade me withyour potato chips so please go away Here are a few options that are notconfrontational You might have something to read during lunch sort of a defacto Do Not Disturb sign You could hook up to Walkman earphones You mightinform everyone that you are meditating or simply say youd love to visitduring a coffee break but lunch is when youve decided to catch up on yourcheckbookItalian lessonsletter to Momfill in the blank Prudie sees noreason to be held prisoner to a potato chip As for the sounds from otherdesks use earplugs or the abovementioned Walkman to drown out the sounds ofcelery            Prudie tactfully                                             DearPrudence                                                      My wife and I aregearing up for our daughters third birthday party We had a blowout people for her first a pretty large todo for her second  people andhave decided that this party will be for yearolds and close relatives onlythank you Many of our friends are relieved I think not to have to give up asummer Sunday afternoon But of course there are those who expect to beinvited and I dont know how to break it to them that they are not welcome Tomake things worse they have already told me about the ridiculously expensivegifts they have purchased for our irresistible little birthday girl I amlooking for a delicate way to get the gifts but stand firm on theinvitations                                       Not EntirelyUnselfishly                                       Daddy                        Dear Dad            Prudie will try not tobe too judgmental about your delicacy though your wish to grab the gifts withno party attached leaves something to be desired In addition to lookingaskance at your rather material approach Prudie has long disapproved ofelaborate birthday parties for tykes  going back years ago to a celebrationfor a yearold child where the parents engaged a chimp and a trainer andthe animal bit the birthday girl But back to your deal Since people havealready mentioned their gifts and their plans to launch your darling into yearNo  you may be stuck for one more overthetop party Prudie suggeststherefore that you say on the invitations Shirley Anns Last Birthday PartyWith Grownups The inference will be clear that next year when the child is she will have her own circle of friends from  well somewhere If you areabsolutely not up to having dozens of chums this year tell them that its justplaymates from now onand be prepared to forgo some loot            Prudie directly                                             DearPrudence                                                      My daughter recentlygraduated from high school after a successful year of captaining the winningsoftball team During the softball season my husband and I got to know many ofthe team parents and were particularly taken with the extended family of aninthgrader a new player on the team At the end of the school year I calledto invite this family their young daughter and her older brotheralso agraduating seniorto our house for a cookout with the softball coaches beforeour daughter left for summer study abroad I did not intend this party to be agraduation or a bon voyage party for our daughter We were quite taken abackwhen various members of this other family brought gifts and graduation cardsfor our daughter  including cash totaling about  We had prepared nograduation gift for their son whom my husband and I do not know well Mydaughter expressed gratitude and is writing thankyou notes and plans to bringthe family a gift from France I wonder if I should have done thingsdifferentlyperhaps whipped up a card and cash between serving courses Shouldwe send a gift as the son prepares to go to college Should I have anticipatedthe interpretation of my invitation as a gift solicitation given the timingOr should I just relax and consider their gifts a generous expression of theirappreciation for my daughters leadership and mentoring of the younger playerthroughout the year                                       Julie                        Dear Jule            Prudie votes forrelax Your motives were pure and a good time was had by all It may be apersonal bias but Prudie has long wished the tit for tat principle would fallby the wayside The giving of gifts simply to even things up is just anotherversion of You look lovelySo do you Your daughters present from Francewill be very meaningful and the timing will be perfect            Prudie genuinely                                             DearPrudie                                                      You missed something important about theproblem of  Vague or unintelligible phone messages with a clear replynumber are now a tool of telemarketers Some of them do this just to get thevictim to call an expensive toll number Many refer to correcting a creditproblem which is fictitious                                       Of course SlurredOff could have had a simple garbled message I suppose How boring                                       Jim S                        Dear Jim            What an interesting takeyou have offered Because Prudie harbors hostility toward intrusivetelemarketers she is most happy to pass the word And she does not want oneletter from the offending telephone pests arguing with her She knows its atough way to make a living but unsolicited pitches are just junk maildelivered by a human voice            Prudie feistily
