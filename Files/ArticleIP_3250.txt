                                 Pillow Talk            It was only a decade agothat Stephen McCauley published his first novel The Object                of MyAffection  and startled his readers by having his gay protagonist Georgemove in with a flaky Brooklyn social worker Nina and agree to be a father toher unborn child It wasnt that either of the two plot strands the end ofGeorges affair with a selfabsorbed professor and start of another with aVermont exhippie Ninas decision not to marry the blowhard father of herbaby broke new ground only that the mixture raised modern and entertainingquestions Why would this woman feel more comfortable raising a child with ahomosexual man than with a heterosexual one Could two adults who love eachother but arent in love with each other stay together under suchsexless circumstances Could the gay guy convertand if so would theconversion take  McCauleys writing is mild and rather shapeless but hegropes honestly for some new design for living He wins the reader over as muchfor what he doesnt dotake cheap shots at his charactersas for the breadthof his observations The book is gratifyingly unslick            The filmthat Nicholas Hytner has directed from a screenplay by the playwright WendyWasserstein is slick sweet and disastrously unmovingeven people who liveto cry at the movies will find themselves depressingly dryeyed Hytner anEnglishman who made his name in theater his  revival of Carousel atthe Lincoln Center had real weight and scope hasnt figured out how to createintimacy with his characters onscreen or how to direct his actors so theyexpose themselves in the myriad microscopic ways stage actors cant Hytnerdoesnt overhype his images or call attention to his own directorial hand ashe did in The Madness of King George  and The Crucible But the film is just as stagy and armslength Its anyones guesswhat The Object is supposed to be about            A big part of the problem is Jennifer Aniston who playsNina as if her confusion is a consequence less of so many modern splinteredparadigms than of plain simplemindedness Aniston can pout and let her eyescrinkle up in fatuous happiness and look moistly maternal But thats aboutit When she tells George Paul Rudd directed to be dear that the father ofher child isnt home to her that George is home and that they need tothrow out the old ways and invent some new ones the scene has no urgency shecould be talking about where to go for dinner She isnt a phonyshe doesntrisk enough to be phony Actresses get attention for their hair when they dontdraw you in with their features To demonstrate their growing closeness Hytnerleads the pair through jazzy swingdance montages along with scenes in whichthey hit each other with pillows a common cinematic sign of a couplescloseness but not necessarily accurate as an experiment I hit my wife with apillow and she threw me out of the room            People I respect were reducedto puddles by Wassersteins The Heidi Chronicles  although I found it acollection of stereotypes Still her stereotypes in that play broodengagingly over whether their behavior is too stereotypical For The Objectof My Affection  she has invented an entirely new cast of supportingcharacters but they add little that anyone other than a development executivecould think this story needs Allison Janney plays Ninas stepsister whosehusband Alan Alda is described glibly as the most powerful literary agentin the world These two are intended as a foil for the nonjudgmental maincharactersthe sort of fake liberals who proclaim tolerance out of one side oftheir mouths and issue snobbish putdowns of gays blacks and Brooklyn out ofthe other Someone could write a monograph on the role of Brooklyn in moviesIt would surely include this one which ends with a liberalutopian vision ofbiracial bisexual unity in Park Slope Wasserstein also brings in a wearyaging critic Nigel Hawthorne who can echo Ninas plight watching the objectof his own affection drift into the arms of a younger man and deliveringelegant monologues on the subject            Elegant monologues dont helpan audience bond with a movie however Compare The Object of MyAffection with that grisly sitcom tearjerker As Good as It Gets  inwhich James L Brooks manages to generate an emotionally compelling movie outof a situation that has nothing nada to do with any reality I know ofBrooks doesnt worry much about composing a frame or giving you a sense ofplace he came from television made it big with a TVstyle tearjerker Terms of                Endearment  and knows how to pull you in whether youwant to be pulled in or not Detached ironists such as Hytner might pridethemselves on not stooping as low but sometimes its the stoopers whom youwant to take home for the night
