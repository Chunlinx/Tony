Care FinancingAdministration Interim Rules for Mental Health ParityPursuant to section aA of title  United States Codethis is our report on a group of rules which constitute major rulespromulgated by the Department of theGAOOGCTreasury Internal Revenue Service Department of Labor Pensionand Welfare Benefits Administration and the Department of Healthand Human Services Health Care Financing Administration entitledInterim Rules for Mental Health Parity RIN AVAA AI We received the rules from the Department ofthe Treasury on December   the Department of Labor onDecember   and the Department of Health and Human Serviceson January   They were published in the Federal Register asinterim rules on December    Fed Reg The interim rules govern parity between medicalsurgicalbenefits and mental health benefits in group health plans andhealth insurance coverage offered by issuers in connection with agroup health plan The rules implement changes made to the InternalRevenue Code of  the Employee Retirement Income Security Actof  ERISA and the Public Health Service Act PHS Actcontained in the Mental Health Parity Act of  MHPA and theTaxpayer Relief Act of We note that the interim rules have a listed effective date ofJanuary   which is less than the day delay in theeffective date required by the Small Business RegulatoryEnforcement Fairness Act of  SBREFA The agencies have citedthe good cause exception to the day delay requirementcontained in section  Section  states thatnotwithstanding section  any rule which an agency for goodcause finds and incorporates the finding and a brief statement ofreasons therefor in the rule issued that notice and publicprocedure thereon are impracticable unnecessary or contrary tothe public interest shall take effect at such time as the federalagency promulgating the rule determines The agencies took thisaction in order to have rules in place when the statutorilymandated effective date occursAlso the agencies invoked the similarly worded good causeexception contained in the Administrative Procedure Act APA atsection bB which allows an agency to forego issuing anotice of proposed rulemaking and receiving public commentsIn the past we have concluded that the exception to the daydelay contained in section  cannot be used when a notice ofproposed rulemaking and a public comment period are used inconformance with the provisions of the APA See Department ofHealth and Human Services Health Care Financing AdministrationMedicare Program B B December  GAOOGC While in this case there was no notice of proposedrulemaking we note that the Mental Health Parity Act of  wasenacted in September  and the agencies requested comments onthe legislation in July   months after enactment Based onthese time periods alone it appears likely that the agencies couldhave obtained comments earlier and issued the interim rules in timeto permit SBREFAs day delay period for congressionalreviewPage  GAOOGCEnclosed is our assessment of the agencies compliance with theprocedural steps required by section aBi through ivof title  with respect to the rule Our review indicates that theagencies except as noted above

Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services performedan economic impact analysis on the effects of the interimrulesUtilizing figures from the Congressional Budget Office it isestimated that the total annual direct impact of the MHPA would beto increase aggregate health plan expenditures by  billionnot accounting for plan sponsor responses to reduce that impactConsidering those responses the actual increase in annualaggregate health plan expenditures would be  millionThe preamble to the interim rules contains a further discussionof additional analyses considered and performed by the Departmentsincluding an analysis prepared by Coopers and Lybrand The analysesutilized different assumptions and generally resulted in smallerexpenditure impact estimates than noted aboveii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and Since these rules are being issued as interim rules and were notpreviously published through a notice of proposed rulemaking
