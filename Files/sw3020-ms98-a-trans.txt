                so where was your last vacation   uh actually my last vacation was in Connecticut um we went home to visit family before that we were in Hawaii   oh i id well actually i did visit Hawaii once but i never made it off of Oahu which ive heard is not the nicest of the islands   oh it wasnt actually it when when we were in Oahu Oahu uh i couldnt wait to get off  we we took a cruise and we went to four different islands and it was a really nice Kauai was nice and Maui was nice we had we had a great time we were there for ten days     uhhuh oh thats wow yeah   yeah yes so where have you been   oh ive been  ive been lots of places my last vacation was actually in Morocco i guess we that one would count uh that was about a year and a half ago and   Morocco really no kidding and what what did you just decide to go there or     uh well my husband is French and we were living in France at the time and we decided that i ive never been to Africa and i needed to get that continent   uhhuh     hadnt been there yet and it its actually its a fairly common vacation place for for French people to go and they speak French and so uh you know in that sense is just a little bit easier and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go and   uhhuh yeah oh im sure it was wonderful   so we we didnt really have enough time we had about a little bit less than two weeks and as always it dont it seems a bit uh rushed we do a lot of traveling around we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere   uhhuh was it hot   no in fact some of the days we froze it was well we were there in the winter in January uh January or February i dont remember which uhhuh   really uhhuh uhhuh i was born in Saudi Arabia and uh when my father worked there we they used to travel quite a bit all around you know in in Europe and whatnot but i was very young so i dont remember that and   uhhuh at what at  excuse me at what age did you   i was three when we moved back here so i dont remember but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been  and that i was when i was a baby but so Morocco i think would be wonderful because thats you know thats   oh thats too bad because uhhuh   that area of the world i think would be great   yeah it was a very interesting vacation the only thing i didnt like was in some of the more touristy areas uh um   uhhuh   the it would just be besieged by people wanting to be your guide and you there were some places where people definite there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off   yeah uhhuh   and we had nothing taken because we knew and we had things in inside pockets and in you know in jacket underneath a coat type of thing but   really we we found that in Jamaica it was the same way that people would come up and try and sell you well try and sell drugs and things like that but they   uhhuh   they were so destitute and i guess they they make all their money on tourism and and they would come up and ask you you know if if you want to buy different things and really after awhile it really gets annoying you know it its a little scary too when theyre coming up and theyre all over you   yeah the the worst place was in Marrakech   uhhuh   in the other cities it wasnt nearly as bad and a couple of them it was what we did in some of the other cities and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide   uhhuh   it doesnt matter who it is and they keep everyone else away from you and its worth it and its like ten dollars a day or something and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you   oh really really   and you feel stupid doing that but we did it and we were much happier and you also get in to see things that you might not get into if you were alone uh   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh well thats great where else have you been   uh  yes no actually i havent been all through Europe like i havent been to Italy yet uh were going to go for a conference in September and so   well you lived in France so youve been all through Europe no really   hopefully well get to travel a little bit too uh my more exciting spots have been ive been to the Galapagos Islands   uhhuh really   uhhuh that was one of the most wonderful vacations ive ever had yes if you like wildlife its a fabulous vacation   lots of wildlife huh yeah uhhuh   if you dont like wildlife its probably not of interest  but it that was really really fabulous and just the photos i have of it and gosh incredible and be so close um August eighty eight     now when was that when were you there uhhuh   and then actually after there i went to um Hawaii a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings   uhhuh   and so i went to Hawaii and then to Australia   uhhuh   and Japan and China   did you go on the Barrier Reef did you see the Great Barrier Reef and and go snorkeling   i i actually i didnt go diving i im a diver and so thats thats actually been another of my   oh diving   favorite vacations has been taking little diving trips   uhhuh   but uh no i didnt get to the Great Barrier Reef i drove from Sidney down to Melbourne and over to Adelaide Adelaide its gorgeous absolutely gorgeous the coastline was just incredible its huge   uhhuh is it really yeah yeah did you have shrimp ive seen in you know they they show all this wonderful seafood and and great big prawns you know the big shrimp and   Australia yeah uh but i dont remember if i had shrimp   no didnt have shrimp there huh  i remember food   i dont think so oh i like that too but uh in fact i didnt eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car it would have been i think much more fun to do it like in the van with a bunch of people but uh   uhhuh uhhuh oh youre adventurous you went by yourself really   uhhuh and i was by myself in China too yeah   really oh wow   China was a little bit more uh of a challenge but it it wasnt more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time and so i never you know got out by myself or not much   uhhuh uhhuh was it very expensive   no actually i paid about either a thousand dollars or a little bit no maybe it was about a thousand dollars maybe a little bit less i dont really remember for ten days including all my meals a guide a car the airfare and sorry but this is from Hong Kong   youre kidding no kidding uhhuh   because i was already in Hong Kong and um but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there and i went to Beijing Shanghai Chengdu and actually then i too k a train up from Shanghai to a little Quingdao i think is the name of it its a little uh sort of getaway retreat village not far from Shanghai its just a train ride and that i had two internal one yeah two internal plane flights   uhhuh   and a couple of other things   all for a thousand dollars wow that really surprises me i guess i relate it to to Japan where things are very expensive arent they yeah yeah   oh Japan Japans ridiculous and i stayed i didnt stay in t he top of the line hotels but i stayed in they were all completely clean and you know they were newly built and   uhhuh   they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line hotels because they said you cant stay in the cheap stuff   uhhuh yeah yeah and you dont want to stay in the very very very exclusive because you dont really even get a flavor of the country if youre yeah yeah wow   right right uh but yeah that was that i highly recommend that way to go if youre ever interested in going the route i dealt with this woman her name was Rita at China Tours in Boston   oh really   yeah um and a friend of mine who had gone for a business trip to China and she just gave me this womans name to contact and it would really be fun i think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver   uhhuh uhhuh   and a guide and then
