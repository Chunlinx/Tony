        okay     well how many children do you have   well i have three they are all grown but i have three grandchildren that live very close by that  i spend a lot of time with   yeah well thats great thats good how old are your grandchildren   oh see oldest ones fourteen then the youngest one is six   well good my we have five children and our oldest one uh will turn uh fifteen next month and the youngest one uh will turn       uh eight the end of April so theyre about the same uh range as your grandchildren umhum uh and so uh theyre pretty busy right now we  the oldest is in uh   right     uh the ninth grade school here uh the second one is in uh junior high third one is in uh what they call it intermediate school fifth and sixth grades   umhum right   and the last two are in uh an elementary school and it looks like uh were gonna have them in at least four different schools for uh you know three more years so that keeps us busy running around some times   uhhuh oh yes   are your are are yours in school near there your   yes yes they are in fact you know i pick them up from school their mother is also going to school shes in nurses school and ought to be finished in May so that leaves me a lot of time with the grandchildren   hum what kind of things have you done with the kids   oh well like they are in dance class and things like that and i pick them up from school and i take them there um which its all right for one of them i think  because she enjoys it and seems to have a talent for it but the other one i wonder about i think shes just pushed into it   yeah well thats possible for now   to have something to do  and uh are   yeah i guess that trade off between uh you know letting them just do the things they enjoy doing or pushing them kind of just a little bit of a nudge so that they they uh you know get into something far enough that they do enjoy it by themselves you know is is a tension for most parents   yes uhhuh well i i can can sympathize i know i i would go when mine were growing up uh from one extreme to the other you know either i we didnt do anything or we did too much  its its hard to decide and uh   yeah right right   decide when theyre old enough to make their own decisions that uh you are i wanted them to have the opportunities to do what they wanted but   thats right we umhum   wasnt sure what that was   yeah well we found out particularly with piano we wanted the kids to take piano for a few years you know and i said well you need to take it for for at least six so that you know whether you wanna do it any more you build up enough enough skill that you can you make a a reasonable choice so we pushed for a few years but then uh then we moved and and dropped it i hope some get back into something into something   well they may pick it up a little bit later and uh   i hope so     all that but uh i know my oldest one he is well hes an honor student and just wins all the awards at school but hes not really outside of school involved in anything other than the church activities so uh hes not a baseballer or anything like that but he seems very well adjusted and   well umhum   most of our focus is either on some school activities or going to or our church activities and they uh we just moved here uh this summer and so we uh were sort of getting into things uh theyve got a       good number of of activities and uh we enjoy you know transporting them to that because we really hope theres gonna be some benefit from those things you know and uh   oh right yes thats that is good   so theyre theyre doing that  we uh uh havent gotten into too many civic activities where we were before they were playing soccer and uh   umhum   did a little bit of gymnastics uh things like that uh here we havent really gotten into it too much uh we may later on sometime if you know they show particular interest   yeah i imagine imagine it takes a while to settle down and let children settle in school and   sure   find out friends and what what it is theyre wanting to do   thats right yeah   so   well i uh i dont know about the time we spend with them it seems like were with them all the time  if were not here you know not working you know uh       but um im sure theyd like more and its hard for us its hard to balance it you know theres some that sort of uh i dont know about demand but you know sort of just take up more time just by their nature and uh we we struggle to uh i do any way not to work so much that i i dont give them time you know being with them and stuff like that   oh yes uhhuh   uh sometimes itd be just nice to come to the office and and work straight through without you know uh spending time with them but i like you know i like to spend time with them and and be with the kids and all like that i   well yeah well its   uh do you take them over say to see
