by  pathologist                              Endearment Elucidation or Love By Any Other Name            A news item published in a British nationalnewspaper in February  gave details of aban applied to a northern England city councilstelephonists working in the environmental servicesdepartment by a senior director stating the telephonistsshould no longer add the endearment luvwhile greeting a caller  The citys first citizen theLord Mayor a woman was forthright in her condemnationof the ban as petty  She said the wordwould stay firmly in her vocabulary and added  Iuse the word all the time  When I come into theCivic Hall I say Good morning luv to whomever Imeet from the cleaning ladies to officials  To banluv would be like stopping the Geordies using theterm pet and Nottingham folk addressing people asduck  My dad was a Yorkshire miner and he addressedfolk as old luv whether they were young orold  Its a term of endearment and a word we haveused for years            This situation brings to public notice whatwords are used as terms of endearment in direct addressbetween the sexes more so a man to a womanSome examples however are not quite what theyseem  It is more than likely that at least some of themale humans using them are innocently unaware ofthe true meaning of a word or words they perhapsuse daily  The word or words so used may not suitthe person being addressed in character or anatomicaldescription but fortunately the person thusspoken to may also be equally unaware                           Sweetheart was two words known to Chaucer inTroylus  as swete herte and in general cannow logically be accurate in statements Yes Iknow sweetheart  when applied to a person withwhom one is in love be she girl friend or wife or afemale who by her actions and looks sweetens theaffection in a mans heart  However a previousmeaning is given in Groves Dictionary of the VulgarTongue  sweet heart a girls lover or amans mistress  Not quite the same thing the OEDtakes this further as one who is loved illicitly aparamour  Few married sweethearts will considerthey are loved illicitly as a paramour or mistressSweetie or sweety is a short corruption of sweetheartbeing in this sense a lovable person a sweetie or awilling person in certain situations Be a sweetieand fetch me the mail  Sweet was also used as dearYes my sweet  I will do so my sweet  That othersweet commodity sugar got itself associated withendearments for women with combinations as sugarbaby sugar babe sugar pie                                       Baby is still often used in endearing address asslang chiefly in the US for a young woman or girlfriend as in sugar baby babe                            Honey fits here into an endearment classificationperhaps also used more in North Americawhere the British equivalent is darling  Yes Iagree honey Yes I agree darling   Formerly itwas chiefly Irish and Scandinavian used in the formof hinnie hinney  but back in  Chaucer in TheMillers Tale wrote of Alisoun his honey deareAs with sugar there are also honeybaby honeybunch honey bun                                       Dear is very very common in use and overhearddaily in many street supermarket or shopping centerconversations  It was formerly applied to awoman who had an endearing personality who wasbeloved esteemed a person on whom to lavish affectionthe mans cherished dear  But do they alwaysmean this when a man uses it now  Or is it asseems to be often said Yes dear  No dear toobtain uncontradictory agreement with the partner            Now as dear darling is in common use by anybodyfor anyone Yes I know darling it is such abore  It is also used in the same context as sweetieBe a darling and fetch me the mail  A darling wasa young lovable charming usually young womanwho was admired and desired prized among eligiblemen because the woman was supposedly of goodmorals thus chaste and a good catch to woo andwin as a wife  Dearing and dearling are both formsof darling but much less often heard nowadays                           Popsy popsie popsywopsy may sound NorthAmerican in origin because of their use in radio andmusichall songs but they are much older than thatPopsies date back to  as an endearing designation Popsy have you seen my toothbrush  andaccording to the OED is a kind of running extensionof pop  an endearing appellation for a girlfriend woman a casual female acquaintance Pop have you seen my toothbrush does not havethe same endearment to it somehow possibly becauseof its use as a term of address for father or anold man  It is also possible they are a corruption ofpoppet poppit poppette poopet from the Frenchpoupette doll an endearment still used though ancientpoppet being the name for a pretty child ora dainty young woman  Just a minute poppet and Iwill mend it  In  Chaucer in Sir Thopasstates This were a popet   For any wommansmal and fayre of face            Yes my precious is a term of endearment occasionallyused precious being from the Old Frenchprecios precieus valuable having a high price and abeloved person held very dear  When applied to awoman could this be what the Bible means when itstates A good woman is above rubies            As a term of endearment girlie and girly are inthe same category as popsy Girlie have you seenmy toothbrush  in the sense of being less oftenheard although it goes back to the th century  Areference to it is in a book The Artist and Craftsman which has a mysterious comment The littlehalf clad girlies ran off to hide themselves  Withtongue in cheek I am tempted to suggest this may bethe origin of the name for certain publications thatfeature halfclad and nude young women and knownnow as girlie magazines            The Geordies do use pet as an endearment forwife or girl friend I wont forget pet also inmore general terms in conversing with people of allages  Pet is a name for a woman treated with specialkindness indulged as a favorite companion  SamuelJohnson possibly had something similar in mind forhis Dictionary  when he classified  peat  adarling a little fondling a dear plaything                           Duck as in Nottinghamshire and elsewhere inBritain seems an odd word to use as an expression ofaffection  However it has been around a long timetoo  In  Shakespeare used it in his A MidsummerNights Dream v i  O dainty ducke adeere  Duck sometimes ducks tended to be usedby older men to a girl friend or wife sometimes awoman of casual acquaintance such as a barmaid orwaitress  Duckie duckey ducky is a diminutive ofduck  Today it is used occasionally in affected familiarspeech Yes I know duckie exactly how youfelt here being in place of dear or darling   Asweet pretty affectionate girl or young woman wassaid to be duckie                        So we come back to where we started with luvand love  It has had a varied history  Originally alove was only a widow the love of the dead husbandOld English church burial records often contain entriesas paid to John Stokeleys love two pence  Alater use was for an attractive lovely woman then inanother context as a paramour from the Old Frenchpar amour by love a woman of passion  Then itcame into general use as it still is for a belovedperson in particular a sweetheart but also as a termof endearing address to a casual acquaintance as thelady Lord Mayor of the northern city            There are of course many words used by menin actual reference to women such as bird dolly doll tart boot plum strumpet jade quean and soon  Being a gentleman I wouldnt think or dare toexplain them here                              Crossing            Crossing language boundaries is not uncommonin literature the performing arts or for thatmatter in everyday speech  There is more than oneway of doing it  The comedian Sid Caesar used toutter gibberish that sounded like Japanese or Germanwithout meaning anything in any language  ErnestHemingway in such books as For Whom the BellTolls and The Old Man and the Sea wrote somedialogue in language that was phonetically Englishbut suggests Spanish by its simpler more formalgrammar            More common however is the insertion into awork in one language the words phrases or passagesfrom another language  In literature this kind of inclusionbesides having snob value for writer andreader or audience lends authenticity  These are thevery words eg Eli Eli lama sabach thani  Matthew  Shakespeare included some dialogue inFrench in Henry V Act III Scene VKATHE  Alice tu as este en Angleterre et tu bienparlas le LangageALICE  En peu MadameKATHE  Ie te prie m ensigniez il faut que ie apprenda parlen comient appelle vous le main enAnglois                        The errors in this French dialogue as it appears inthe First Folio some or all of which may be typoshave been edited out of subsequent editions such asThe Annotated Shakespeare edited by AL Rowse            Tolstoi introduced whole pages of impeccableFrench into the Russian text of War and Peace  as didGoytisolo for a more recent example into his Seasde Identidad   French perhaps because it is a languageof prestige seems to be transplanted morecarefully than other modern languages  Ramn JSender has quotations in three languages on thefrontispiece of his novel La Tesis de Nancy               Es tarea de discretos hacer rerCervantesJe me presse de rire de tout de peur dtreoblig den pleurerBeaumarchaisSo far so good butDoes thou laugh to see how fools are vexedT Dekker                        English generally fares rather poorly in Spanishtexts and vice versa            Ezra Pound for all his provincial pedantry inhis Canto LXXXI as printed on p  of The NewOxford Book of American Verse writes didacticallyHay aqu mucho catolicismo pronouncedcatolithismo y muy poco reliHion                        The o in reliHion ought to carry a written accent asdoes the i of aqu  and poco ought to be poca                        As far as I know the most recent example ofextensive switching to Spanishor for that matterto any foreign languagein an Englishlanguagetext is to be found in the two already publishedbooks of Cormac McCarthys muchacclaimed BorderTrilogy All the Pretty Horses and The Crossingespecially the latter  McCarthy excels in the laconiccolloquial dialogue of his Texas and New Mexicocowboys and the untranslated lingo of his Mexicancharacters generally rings true as well  He doesoccasionally err though and one cannot help wonderingwhat arrogance keeps an author like Senderor McCarthy from having his text proofread by acompetent native speaker  First let us scan the firstnovel of the trilogy All the Pretty Horses               Cunto said John GradyPara todo  p                                        Por todo is correct and usual  Since almost anygrammatical rule that can be broken in any languageis sometimes broken I cannot say that McCarthy hasnever heard a Mexican say Para todo meaning forthe whole purchase  But I tested the two phraseson a New Mexico Hispanic of about the same type asthe clerk in the book and confirmed that por  notpara  is not only the correct word but also the usualword in Spanish meaning for in the sense of in paymentofSoy comandante de las yegunas  yo y yoslo  Sin la caridad de estas manos no tengasnada  p                         I see no reason to use the present subjunctive  tengas here  No tendras or possibly even no tuvierassounds more grammatical and more likely  HereMcCarthy spells comandante right but on pages and  his English misleads him into misspellingthe Spanish word with two ms Digame he said  Cul es lo peor  Que soypobre o que soy americanoThe vaquero shook his head  Una llave de oroabre cualquier puerta he saidTienes razn said John Grady  p                         Here and elsewhere in the two novels we find ashuttling between familiar and formal verb forms DigameTienes  that certainly happens in Spanishas it did in Elizabethan English as evidenced in KingHenry IV Part II Act II Scene IVDol  Captain  thou abominable damned cheaterart thou not ashamed to be called captain  Ancaptains were of my mind they would truncheonyou out for taking their names upon you beforeyou have earned them  You a captain                        And I once heard a Segovian graduate of SalamancaUniversity say Venga to a small timid dog  Still inMcCarthys Mexican dialogue he shuttles betweenfamiliar and formal verb forms with an abandon thatI find a bit excessive  There are other examples ofthis inconsistency on pages  and  in the firstnovel            On page  and on pages  and cinaga the Iberian form of the noun appears insteadof the Mexican form cinega   Also the placename that McCarthy has as Cuatro Cinagas appearson the AAA map of Mexico as Cuatrocienegas               Quin s usted  p                         The written accent on the verb is wrong here  As weshall see McCarthy gets quite wild with his accentsin the more extensive Spanish of his second novelGraciasDe nada  p                         I have heard Mexicans say de nada youre welcomebut por nada is particularly Mexican  I havehad Spaniards identify my Spanish as of the Mexicanvariety more or less because of my saying por nada the more typical expression in MexicoCal caballo  p                         Now here is an expression where McCarthy is atodds with grammarbook usage which would prescribeQu caballo  but right for popular Mexicanusage            In The Crossing McCarthy hits his stride in dialoguein colloquial Mexican Spanish and does himselfproud  Some readers might think him a bit presumptuousI am not sure that his Spanish here anymore than in the first novel is faulty at all exceptfor incorrect written accents in the sense that Mexicanswould never say what he has them sayingSometimes as noted above his Spanish dialogue inbeing technically ungrammatical faithfully reflectspopular usage as is the case with his English dialogueFor instance Estoy regresndole a mi pasp   The Pequeo Larousse Ilustrado dictionarybrands this transitive use of the verb regresar as a barbarismo   But McCarthys characters are barbaricsometimesnobly soif nothing else andregresar is exactly right here  And speaking of popularexpressions on page  we find blanquillos  theeuphemism for eggs that has been the subject ofthree recent EPISTOLAE in VERBATIM            On pages  and  appears the more commonMexican expression por nada instead of de nada             On pages  and  matrz  There should beno written accent here  McCarthy who seems to becontemptuous of punctuation in any languagerarely writes accents where they are not needed butoften omits them where they are eg mia pp  borrachon p  mascara p  perdidap  asi p  haran pt  and quep Tan como preguntar lo que saben las piedrasp                         I think that the substantive tanto ought to be hereinstead of the adverbial tan Todos que vengas alrededor p                         To agree with its subject the verb should be vengan The secondperson singular form is probably a typographicerrorEs lejos p                         I think that est for location should be here as it is ina similar context on page No le molesta p                         I cannot say that Mexicans never use the secondpersonimperative negatively in real life as here andon pages   and   But correctly and popularlytoo and as on page  No te preocupes  thesubjunctive is used for a negative imperative in thesecondperson singular  Canta y no llores  theold song goesTengo miedo es verdad p                         Here the subjunctive sea is called forLos hombres han salido por Madero p                         Is the Madero here the same place as the Madera onpage   In any case if Madero is a place para orpa  should be here instead of por   The leader Maderodied in Ya nos hemos encontrado la mujer y el hombrep                         Here on page   no podemos ver el buenDios  and on page   Busca el herido no  bothgrammar and custom call for an a before the personalobject of the verbLos aspectos de las cosas son engaosas p                         Here the adjective fails to agree in gender with thenoun it modifiesQuizs hay poca de justicia p                         Either the de should be omitted or poco instead ofpoca should be hereQue joven tan enforzado p                         The adjective here may be a dialect form unknownto me but more likely it is a typographical error foresforzado                        In a way this essay is complimentary  If McCarthysMexican dialogue were not so close to perfectionas it is one would not be challenged to nitpickthrough it but would simply dismiss it as incompetent                              English Arrivals in Hungary            Hungarians have always been fiercely proud oftheir language a non IndoEuropean island ina sea of Slavic Germanic and Romance tongues  Itsorigins are obscure but we know that it is distantlyrelated to Finnish and belongs to the FinnoUgricgroup of languages            Part of the fun for the visitor to Hungary is thebattle to understand anything at all whether thewords are spoken or written  I remember howdelighted I was on my first visit to Budapest someyears ago when I spotted the word szendvics on themenu of a small restaurant  Yes it meant sandwichand was at least one word I could recognize  Mindyou it was difficult to find a restaurant in the firstplace the word for restaurant being tterem inHungarian            Until recently the Hungarians accepted foreignwords only grudgingly preferring to create newones of their own  At one time they even invented aHungarian word for telephone tvbeszl literallydistance talker a calque of German FernsprecherBut although this word can be found inthe dictionary it is hardly ever heard  Telefon is themore popular term and the one which fortunatelyfor the tourist can be seen on every kiosk            Since the fall of the Berlin wall and all that cameafter there has been an unstoppable flood of Englishwords pouring into Hungary  It is no surprise tofind that the new language of computers has beenfully integrated into Hungarian words like hardverand softver are commonplace  But over the last fewyears a stream of everyday English words hasstormed through the language barrier  This is notonly because the country is now bombarded withEnglish language TV programs on various Europeanchannels but also because western pop culture hastaken such a strong hold among the young            A random selection

reflecting current preoccupations in Hungarywill be accepted permanently  I think most ofthem will and I for one regret this  Something ofthe uniqueness of the Hungarian language will belost for ever

elsewhere asexamples of wit without causing anyone to cringeperhaps the moment has arrived to make some distinctionsand straighten out the nomenclature amongthose terms that fall under the umbrella of elicitinglaughter            We might start with the criteria for classic wit the highest form of humor that is set up by WalterNash in the Oxford Companion to the English Language According to Nash true wit must meet thefollowing standards  The practitioner must havea quick mind  The witticism must be statedwithin a very tight framework and  It is characterizedby four common rhetorical devices parallelismantithesis definition and quasiphilosophicalpropositions an example being Woody Allens lineNot only is God dead but try getting a plumber onSunday  One might add that classic wit is usuallymotivated by malice which must be stated artfullyand the malice is frequently at someone elses expenseTo this I would attach my own definition Toqualify as wit a retort must be no more than fivewords            Clearly then what sets wit apart from humor isits cerebral quality and its verbal conciseness  Otherterms that elicit laughter are lower on the peckingorder because although they may display quickthinking they may lack the tight framework  Otherspass the conciseness test but may be too contrivedGentle or kindly humor fails the test for obviousreasons            Scores of lines that meet these criteria come tomind  My favorite is a retort by former college footballcoach Duffy Dougherty to a remark that footballis a contact sport  Duffy cracked  Dancing isa contact sport  Football is a collision sport  Thisstrikes me as remarkable because although Doughertywas not a literary person he managed to combinean ironic analogy and parallelism to come upwith a line that could be called pure wit            Another broad term under the eliciting laughterpremise is joke   In a way a joke in its structureis the antithesis of a witticism in that is usuallyplaced within a narrative framework and withholdsany response until the punch line is reached  In thissense timing is extremely important  We know thatif any joke begins with A guy walks into a bar withan iguana on a leash sits down and orders a zombie we may be in for a long detailed narrative thatmay or may not be funny            Two terms that come close to being classic witare quip and wisecrack  both of them AmericanismsThese slangy expressions meet Nashs standard ofconciseness in that they are pointed comebacks to asituation or a remark  However they fall short inthat their tone is sarcastic rather than maliciousDorothy Parker once noted that Wit has truth in itwisecracking is simply calisthenics with words  Althoughthe quip and the wisecrack are usually quiteshallow George S Kaufman a member of the AlgonquinRound Table managed to turn the wisecrackinto an art form  At one point he told GrouchoMarx that a line he was supposed to deliver in amovie which Kaufman had scripted was not funnyGroucho urging patience replied Rememberthey laughed at Fulton when he invented the steamboatTo which Kaufman cracked Not at matines            Even farther down in the pecking order is theterm gag  Again some distinctions are called for  InAmerican theater parlance the term gag is used frequentlyto differentiate funny lines in a moviescript or stage comedy from mere jokes that are exchangedindiscriminately in everyday life  Neil Simonthe chief practitioner of the theatrical gag hasgiven this form of humor a new respect if only becauseof its frequency in his comedies  In factpunchy ripostes are sprinkled so heavily throughoutSimons comedies that people have been led to believethat he writes the gags first then fleshes outthe rest of the play around them  All this has placeda monkey on Simons back  He would like to be considereda wit perhaps the Samuel Johnson of Americanletters but he will never achieve such eminenceso long as he churns out gags assemblyline fashion            Two terms now considered somewhat archaicthat fit into the category of eliciting laughter arejest and sally   Most people associate jest with Shakespearesclowns and that overquoted line from Romeoand Juliet  He jests at scars that never felt awound  In current American usage the term resembleswhat we call kidding that is making funof someone or some thing in a frivolous mannersuch as in the obligatory banter at roasts of famouspeople  What separates a jest from a witticismis its lack of malice  A jest is never uttered at someoneelses expense            A sally is defined in the American Heritage Dictionaryas a sudden quick witticism  In otherwords it is a line that is uttered off the top of oneshead and therefore may or may not be funny            In the last few years the expression onelinerhas developed into an allpurpose usage  It seems tobe an outgrowth of sound bite  a phenomenon oftelevision communication in which politicians andpundits are required to reduce complex ideas to oneconcise sentence  For example Ross Perot expressedhis disapproval of NAFTA and GATT by sayingthat relative to jobs in this country these tradeagreements would create a giant sucking soundIn a political context Youre just rearranging thedeck chairs on the Titanic is another sound bitethat now seems firmly established in the languageWhile the leap from a sound bite to a witticism appearsto be easy to manage few politicians havebeen inclined to take the risk and be labeled as awiseguy or a smartass             To conclude we might note that there is noshortage of Americans who have an urge to saysomething funny  What is missing is a standard forjudging funniness  Perhaps these distinctions Ihave made will help in that direction                              No Nicknames in the Valleys            Jones The Meat Dai Scab and Evans Above shouldbe preserved for posterity says a leading sociologistTraditional Welsh nicknames on the declinewith population changes and the breakup of communitiesonce dominated by the coal industry needto be collected before they are lost forever saysChristie Davies Professor of Sociology at ReadingUniversity  Increased migration with Welsh peoplemoving out and English people moving in hasplayed a large part in the demise of the nicknameswhich were once in widespread use and which manyregard as a unique art form            Humorous nicknames such as Dai Bungalow fora man with little upstairs mentally Dai Bolical theminer who never washed and Evans Above the undertakerare the most savoured examples  Othersstem from events or habits like Dai Scab whosegrandfather worked during a strike  years ago andAmen Jones who made the loudest responses inchurch            Traditional nicknames in England like DustyMiller and Chalky White tended to disappear sometime ago and it is simply happening later in Walessaid Prof Davies  There is not the need for themthat there was  I would very much like to see themrecorded            The nicknames developed from the need to distinguishbetween people in the same village with thesame name  It was not unknown for a single communityfor instance to have  men called DavidJones largely as a result of the limited choice of surnamesJones Williams and Evans coupled with apassion for Biblical Christian names David Johnand Thomas            As a result of this need to distinguish somevery humorous names developed  There was oneman who had only two front teeth in the middle andwas known as Dai Central Eating  Another man wasone of those people who keep repeating the sameword in almost every sentence and he as known asEvans Absolutely said Professor Davies  In manyof the valley communities the nicknames usually reservedfor men rather than women arose from theirjob or an unfortunate incident or a physical orspeech defect            Robin Gwyndaf assistant keeper at the WelshFolk Museum said In the old coal mining communitiesyou had to distinguish between the DavidJoneses  They were characters and they did notmind being called nicknames it added colour to lifeAreas where people have moved away or commuteto work outside the community are the most likelyto be affected            John Walter Jones chief executive of the WelshLanguage Board says that widened horizons mayalso be to blame The world has widened and someof the things that used to be local have been lost inthat widening process            Gus Jones a retired lecturer in Cardiff who hasstudied the nicknames said They are on the declineThese days people jump into their cars go towork out of the community and you dont have thiscloseknit society which breeds these nicknamesHe added We have quite a few examples of humorousnames  There was for instance a miner inthe Swansea valley who  years ago started playinggolf which was something unheard of  He was everafter known as Dai Swank  There was also a fashionthat men with common surnames were known bytheir mothers names  There was a mine managerDavid Evans who was known as Dai Hannah  Oneday he was working underground and ordered theminers to replace all the ventilation doors  Afterthat he was known as Dai Hannah Dors            An example that I particularly like is a manwho got married during the Thirties recession andwore daps or plimsolls during the ceremony  Hehas always been known as Dai Quiet Wedding

John Richard Green describedthe profound moral and cultural change thattransformed the country in the late th and earlyth centuries  England became the people of abook he wrote and that book was the BibleAlthough he does not specify it seems likely Greenmeans the  Authorized or King James Versionfor he goes on As a mere literary monument theEnglish version of the Bible remains the noblest exampleof the English tongue while its perpetual usemade it from the instant of its appearance the standardof our language            Green was neither the first nor last to sing hosannasto the AV and most extollers have especiallypraised the awesome consistency of its excellenceconsidering it was the work of  scholars and diversdivines  Astonishment is still voiced that the dignitaries spoke so often with one voice says Biblescholar David Daniell professor emeritus of the Universityof London  And the reason Daniell quicklyadds is that it was virtually one voice that of WilliamTyndale one of the most influentialand certainlyone of the least knownwriters in English historyUnsung Tyndale certainly is  According to a chronologyof significant literary works only one importantbook was published in the s John Skeltons TheGarlande of Laurell  in which the author allegoricallyenthrones himself among the great poets of theworld  But in  smuggled copies of Tyndalesheretical translation of the New Testament beganappearing in England to the great consternation ofthe establishment including Henry VIII CardinalWolsey and Sir Thomas More and to the lastingglory of the English language            To those lucky and adventurous citizens who gottheir hands on copies before they were seized andburned the books that is but also sometimes thecitizens this was a Bible with a belt  It was livelyand colloquial meaningful and memorable  But mostof all it was in plain but powerful English  Until thispoint the only Bible that anyone knew was the VulgateLatin version translated by St Jerome a millenniumbefore  John Wycliffe had rendered this in Englishin  but that was preprinting press andhand copies of this stilted verbatim Lollard constructionwere scarce            But here in the spring of  was a book thatrang out the scriptures as sounding brass  Herewas gospel that cut to the chase Ask and it shall begiven you seek and ye shall find filthy lucreEat drink and be merry salt of the earth signsof the times a law unto themselves  In the beginningcame five years later when Tyndales similarlycontraband Pentateuch started arriving from EuropeIn this too the stunning simplicity of Tyndaleswords caught the publics imagination            If England became the people of a book and thatbook was the Bible then that Bible was for the mostpart Tyndalesa claim argued persuasively and passionatelyby David Daniell in William Tyndale A Biography published in the fall of  the quincentenaryof the translators birth  Daniell warmed up tothe task by publishing modernspelling versions ofTyndales New Testament and Pentateuch also producedby Yale University Press in  and Daniells book the first serious biography since JFMozleys William Tyndale in  travels familiarpaths  But it is like cruising a smoothly paved freewayin a Mercedes as opposed to jolting down acountry lane in a ModelA Ford  The same can besaid of Tyndales poetic prose  In the Vulgate Genesis says Dixitque Deus Fiat lux  et facta estlux  Wycliffes painfully literal first edition has thisAnd God said Be made light and made is lightCompare that to Tyndales enduring rendition ThenGod said Let there be light and there was light            Tyndale was born in Gloucestershire and attendedOxford and Cambridge where the spirit ofthe recently departed Erasmus still glowed  He becamea priest but his reformist zeal soon earned himenmity in high places  He believed religion was atrophyingunder the deadly dogmatism of the Romanchurch  What proved even more dangerous to hishealth was his frequently and loudly aired opinionthat the truth lay in the scripture not in the popeThe only way to regenerate a flagging faith was toallow people to read The Word in their own languageThis could not safely be done in Englandnor in the end even in Europe in spite of its moreadvanced reform mainly under the influence of LutherTyndale had finished the Book of Jonah on hisway to completing the Old Testament when he wasbetrayed arrested and convicted of heresy  On Oct  he was strangled at the stake and his bodyburnt  His last words were Lord open the King ofEnglands eyes  Shortly afterward Henry VIIIwhether in answer to that prayer or because of hisown marriagerelated difficulties with Rome madehimself head of the English church  One of his firstacts was to commission an Englishlanguage Bible  Itand all its successors bore the unmistakable imprintof Tyndale            What distinguished Tyndales work from earlierEnglish efforts was that he translated the New Testamentstraight from its native Greek and his Pentateuchfrom Hebrew without the distorting filter ofJeromes Latin  Aside from setting down dozens ofenduring clichs  Tyndale wrote in a timeless vernacularnot all of it echoed in the AV  When Noahssurvivors decide to climb to heaven the AV tells it inthis archaic Elizabethan way And they said to oneanother Go to let us build a city and a tower  InTyndales version the builders of Babel with surprisingmodernity say Come on let us build atower            Fortunately and contrary to King James instructionsthe compilers of the AV did keep a lot of Tyndalewhile taking care not to divulge that sourceSome say up to  per cent of that glorious text isfrom the pen of the great but uncelebrated translatorOthers say that of the really glorious parts it is per cent            Robertson Cochrane

be interesting tostudy which senses have been omitted in the CIDE             As can be seen from even this cursory descriptionof only one short entry the CIDE contains agreat deal of information that might well prove usefulto a learner of English  Those who are not familiarwith this type of dictionarythat is one that provideslearners with grammatical collocational andidiomatic information far beyond what might be expectedin an ordinary monolingual dictionaryshould familiarize themselves with the wellknownprecedent the Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionaryof Contemporary English  by AS Hornby long aclassic in the field  It is that dictionary and theLDOCE  chiefly with which the CIDE was designedto compete            The attempt to cover British American and AustralianEnglish in a single work creates occasionalproblems  I am not enamored of the treatments oflift and elevator  for instance where the former isdefined as a boxlike device which moves up anddown carrying people or goods from one floor of abuilding to another or raising and lowering peopleunderground in a mine and the latter as a piece ofequipment which moves things from one level to another  Am  An elevator  Br and Aus  lift is a smallroom which carries people or goods up and down intall buildings   An elevator can be a moving stripwhich can be used for unloading goods from a shipputting bags onto an aircraft moving grain into astore etc  If they are the same why are they defineddifferently  And isnt that moving strip more properlyA conveyer belt is a continuous moving stripor surface that is used for transporting a load of objectsfrom one place to another  And the preferredspelling in British and American English is conveyor One would have expected the same treatment seenfor boottrunk and bonnethood   But matters getmore complicated when British lexicographers assumethat American English pavement means thesurface of a road if it has been specially put thereesp  if made from concrete or tarmac  That is betterthan the treatment in Questions of English see thereview elsewhere in this issue but it ignores the factthat the word is used in AE to describe any pavedsurface when an American says I remember nothingafter my head hit the pavement the site of thepaved surface could be a road sidewalk or any otherpaved area  Also AE uses washing powder or liquidand soap powder as well as laundry detergent   Eithera poor choice of American editor was made or as isoften the case the British editors didnt believe whatthey were told            Of great interest is the defining vocabularywhich is said to be limited to  words  These arelisted in the back matter pp  where it isrevealed just which senses of the forms are used inthe definitions  Here we find for example thatback  presumably one word is used in four sensesreturn farther away farthest part and bodypart take is listed with five act accept holdmove and need  As there are more than items in the list one must

but it must be concededthat defining  words and phrases usinga vocabulary of even only  is no mean feat            Those who accept the rationale behind teachingforeigners to learn English using a

  A dozen years ago the Oxford dictionary departmentlaunched The Oxford Word and Language Service OWLS  devoted to answering queries about allaspects of the English language  Inevitably a largepercentage of questions received could have been answeredby referring to a dictionary even a relativelymodest work  But some have dealt with subtler mattersand in some cases questions relating to detailsof the language not readily derivable even from themassive OED  in either of its editions            In this book the editors have occasionally undertakento answer questions that have not been askedspecifically but might reasonably be anticipated likeWhat is the difference between American and BritishEnglish  As they acknowledge the subject ishuge not encompassable within the six or so pagesgiven over to it here the main areas are toucheduponpronunciation spelling vocabulary and a biton grammerwhich is all one might expect in a briefwork  Still it would have been wise to have

said aftersomeone else has said I havent any money Ive notgot any money or I dont have any money whenconfronted with having to pay for something as inThats okay I have money  AE speakers are less likely to say Im goingto have a wash but they certainly do say Imgoing to wash up before dinner                        The problem with the way these distinction havebeen presented is that the BE speaker might be unlikelyto use the forms listed under AMERICAN butwhat is implied incorrectly is that the AE speakerdoes not use those listed under BRITISH which is incorrect            The

closer in time one gets to theputative earliest use of a word the more tantalizinglyobscure its connections become  Take jackeroo  forinstance the name given to a young Englishman ofindependent means who came out to Australia togain colonial experience by working in a supernumerarycapacity on a sheep or cattle station whoenrolled in the nineteenthcentury equivalent of asenior management course either genuinely to learnselfreliance or gracefully to take himself off his familyshands  In this sense it dates from the sand of the several conjectural etymologies thosethat link it with the Spanish vaquero or the EnglishJacky Raw seem at least possible  But then an earlierlife was revealed from the s and in Queenslandespecially jackeroo had been used of a whiteman who lived beyond the bounds of close settlementand had taken on some of the not so savouryconnotations of frontiersman  The possible modelof kangaroo suggested an Aboriginal origin and inthe s one of the more indefatigable recordersof the Aboriginal languages Charles Meston cameup with an etymology that fitted the chronologyand the geographyperfectly  He suggested that itwas a transferred use of the Queensland Aboriginalword for a particularly noisy bird and that the connectionwas made by percipient Aborigines who appliedit first to the German missionaries of having noted their garrulousness  From the specificto a general application was but a logical and consequentstep  This rather pleasing etymology stood fora while but was discredited when RMW Dixonfailed to find an etymon in a Queensland languagedespite a brave attempt to locate the origin in a putativeJagara word which was glossed as wanderingwhite man  And so we were back to square one andone of the more colorful words in Australian Englishhad to suffer the indignity of having an uncertainorigin                           Wowser is another case in point  And again thehistory has thrown up more than the odd red herringThis time a prominent journalist claimed theword as his own invention and the lack of any evidenceto the contrary meant that the claim restedunchallenged  The editor of the Sydney Truth duringthe period  John Norton was one ofthose dynamic one man bands who not infrequentlyseemed to have written whole issues on hisown and who was certainly very influential in determiningthe style by which Truth came to be knownOne of the features of this style was the alliteratingpunning phrase often used as a headlinewastedwowsers vied with watery wowsers and indeedwith weird and worried wowsers and the exercisewas often carried to extremeswitness collocationslike pious Puritanical pragmatical pulpitpoundingselfpursuers whom we call wowsers orbaldheaded badbreathed biblebanging bummerwho ought to be banged with a bowser  And certainlyhe overworked the word in the sense it hasnow of one who is publically censorious of the behaviorof others            But there was an earlier sense in that for as littletime as a decade it has been shown to have beenused in Australia still as a pejorative term but withmuch less definition more as a label for someonewho is in some way disruptive of social mores a publicnuisance whose field of activity was left openThe word was clearly felt to be a low word and thereremains the possibility that Nortons role was morethat of a promoter than of an inventor that therewas an existing word probably a regional dialectword that he brought to the surface and to which hegave a new currency  Rather like the more recentscungy which after years of use in Scots and Irish fora sly or vicious person a sponger suddenly founditself in vogue as a word connoting the general sordidnessof modern youth  In the case of wowserthere is the tantalizing possibility that a conjecturaluse of the word occurs in  in just the sort ofcontext that would fit this theory and make its subterraneanexistance a reality but all we have to goon is ws  and not many lexicographers wouldchance their arm on that  For the quotation see theAustralian National Dictionary AND whose editorhad a bit both ways            Like scungy  and possibly wowser  is spoof  aslang word for semen

Sound and SenseXXI  says that the childish exclamation Peeyoo probably stems from a distorted rendering of Phew Where I grew up the expression phew was one ofrelief Phew  I passed the test Peeyoo  was anexclamation of disgust upon smelling a bad smell            Years later I read that the expression comesfrom the first two letters of Puteoli Pozzuoli nearNaples whose refineries produced such a stench inancient times that seamen entering the Bay of Naplescould smell the town long before they set eyeson it  This of course may be purely apocryphal                              You write in your

MatreCrche a Parisiancopywriter sentenced to eight years in prison for usingthe imperfect subjunctive case of a prohibitedverb jumbo frankfurter  in a series of ads posted inthe Paris Metro  Specifically he received his sentencefor causing to appear in print the sentence  Quejeusse bien aim jumbo frankfurter aujourdhui             I have of course no sympathy for M MatreCrcheAs Calvin Coolidge once advised that thosewho do not share the American dream ought not tosettle in America and as in Singapore one does notvandalize cars so in France one does not use convenientexpressions  Cest la vie  one might say andthose who disapprove are free to leave            However if M MatreCrche is to serve eightyears the judges must get life or even death  Forwhat M MatreCrche used was not the imperfectsubjunctive of the verb jumbo frankfurter but of theverb aimer                 Aimer then serves in the imperfect subjunctiveas the auxiliary verb and is followed byjumbo frankfurter  which is of course an infinitive            Who indeed shall guard the guardians                              I was intrigued by William Doughertys commentXXI on Martyn Ecotts article The

have lived all mylife until now in London including a number of yearsin the East End  Even now here in Clerkenwell fiveminutes walk from the northern edge of the SquareMile I am less than a mile from Hackney  I havewillynilly frequently been nudged into the use ofsuch slang simply in order not to stick out like a sorethumb among others using it            First perhaps we ought to establish what is theEast End roughly it covers Hackney Stepney nowknown as Tower Hamlets the Isle of Dogs andparts of Bow and Poplar  Postwar slum clearanceand rehousing broke up the old Jewish communitiesand these have been replaced by subsequent wavesof immigrants  Hackney now has many Cypriots andeven more West Indians and Stepney houses anenormous number of Pakistanis and other AsiansNone of these groups has contributed to rhymingslang  There are therefore no neologisms in rhymingslang and it is definitely moribund  NonEnglishreaders should take very much cum grano salis MrDays claim that Finsbury Park is just down theroad from Mile End it is a crowsflight distance of miles away and consequently probably nearlytwice that by road given the nature of Londonsroads and its density of housing            Most of the expressions cited are totally unfamiliarto me and I suggest that Mr Day has playedwith a rhyming dictionary and dreamed many ofthem up for himselfharmless enough but heought not to pass them off as being in common usageOf those that are known to me I would pointout that even his usage of them is not what onewould meet in everyday conversation with EastEnders  Potatoes in the Mould

utterly inconsequential little endeavorsRecently I have joyfully spent at least two hours inintense research into the word gotten   It is not aword I use but I recently heard a Canadian broadcasteruse it and that has set me to delving andgrubbing in dictionaries and other reference booksAnd here is some of what I have got or gotten outof my research            I have not conducted any kind of survey on thisbut I can report that I have rarely been aware ofgotten in written Canadian English in conversationor on radio and television  But then I havent reallybeing paying attention to such things            The verb get has two distinct variants betweenBritish and American uses as a past participle  AmericanEnglish generally prefers gotten  whereas EnglishEnglish is ordinarily content with simple got And the Brits tend to use have got as meaning tohave acquired or to possess or even to ownwhereas in American usage that is considered somewhatinformal in speech and not generally used inwriting            Although gotten seems to have disappearedfrom English English except in some dialecticalforms it is still used in forgotten and begotten   Butthe word is very much alive in American usage  InThe American Language  Mencken has seven referencesto gotten  which he says is now  almostabsolete in England  And he contends that gotten is one of the hallmarks of American speechMargaret Nicholson in her  book A Dictionaryof AmericanEnglish Usage based on Fowlerpointed out that  Gotten still holds its ground inAmerican English and she adds that there is apopular superstition that got is less refined thangotten                            The Concise Oxford defines gotten simply as USpast part  of GET  That seems the position in allOxford dictionaries  The Collins English Dictionarytakes the same position  A third British dictionaryLongman Dictionary of Contemporary English edition points out that the word is standard inAmerican English but is not used

feels that it is an improvement onmere got which he says is a nasty verb                           Gotten was standard English as late as  butsomehow came to be abandoned  James OrchardHalliwells

days both famousand infamous have enriched English vocabularythrough their names  When you use boycott bowdlerizeor bloomers  you must remember that thesewords owe their origins to the persons who lived inthe past under the names Charles Cunningham Boycott Thomas Bowdler  andMrs Amelia Jenks Bloomer  respectivelyBesides these personswords commonly known aseponymous words there are also

attention because it had something to dowith my native place Kannur City   Today billingsgateis used to mean foul and abusive languageThe Chinese themselves have not yet got aroundto denouncing

Billingsgate  a former fish market in Londonwas known for the abusive language heard thereThe fishwives and their fishmongering husbands gota reputation for their lusty and lurid eloquence ofspeech  Thus Billingsgate became so notorious thatin  it became a common word in English  Todaywe use billingsgate to mean any kind of profane andabusive talk or language            There is a conspicuous connection between billingsgateand my native place  I am a native of KannurCity  a thicklypopulated Muslim area in KannurMunicipality Kannur District Kerala State  OutsideKerala Kannur is known as

a fish and meatmarket in the heart of Kannur City  now known asCity Center  The language heard there at that timewas just like that heard at Billingsgate   So KannurCity got a reputation for her bad

cousinsdied in Auschwitz  This it was arguedis themost common and the most outrageous of empathicclaims  It is most certainly outrageous  It is alsoincredible  And it left unexplained how anything canbe at the same time the most common and the mostoutrageous the latter strongly suggesting somethingquite outside the usual  This was the least of myquibbles            The article began by stating there is a GreshamsLaw of Language in which bad words drive out goodOh really  The thcentury financier ThomasGresham was talking about money not language  Theword phenomenon is called pejoration  or degeneration and it usually involves a change of meaningrarely the disappearance of a word  But the articlesillustration of this assertion is even more fallaciousBecause of the search for false importance it allegesthe useful old English words burgle and burglarhave led by inflation may be this was after all aneconomics essay to the unnecessary verb burglarize The fact is that burgle and burglarize saw thelight of day at about the same time  and it isthe useful old burgle  not burglarize that has beendisparaged by usage critics many of whom have arguedthat rob could have served for all of them            While sympathy is the most important word tohave been murdered in the late th century wewere also given the sad socalled facts surroundingthe recent demise of discrimination and disinterestedDiscrimination we read was the first to goin modern times  Fact the word was already takingon prejudicial overtones a century and a half agoOn March   US President Andrew Johnsonsaid Thus a perfect equality of the white and coloredraces is attempted to be fixed by federal law inevery state of the union over the vast field of Statejurisdiction covered by these enumerated rights  Inno one of these can any State ever exercise anypower of discrimination between the differentraces  This pejorative sense has been used regularlyever since but it has not succeeded in drivingout the discerning sense of discriminating              Disinterested went next the eulogy continuedbecoming a posh synonym for uninterested  becausewe no longer choose to believe that anyone can putaside their own interests to review a situation dispassionatelyYet the author proceeded to give recentexamples of disinterest impartiality fairness dispassionneutrality unbiasedness in actionprovingthat behavior can continue to exist unaltered even ifour words for it change and disproving the writersown contentions  Fact Disinterested went a longtime ago and not in the direction deplored  Whenthis word was first used in the late th and earlyth centuries it meant unconcerned lacking interestapathetic uninterestedthe very senses it hasbeen struggling to return to in this century againstgreat opposition  The sense of impartiality or an absenceof selfinterest did not develop until the middleof the th century after which the original sensedisappeared for about  years            Why is it as etymologist Walter Skeat asked frequentlyin the last century that people will not hesitateto proffer publicly their guesswork on word originsand other language matters when they wouldnot similarly dare to explain the ordinary facts ofbotany and chemistry            On the question of empathy versus sympathy  Iam not competent to comment except on their etymologicaland semantic distinctions  But I seem torecall reading more than once that people copingwith various forms of distress do not want sympathyInstead we are urged to walk a mile in their shoeswhich I believe is a metaphor for empathy or atleast an understanding based on something moreprofound than armslength pity  In any case thewriter seems to have based his case more on etymologythan sociology  Empathy  he maintained is a legitimatetechnical term but only in psychotherapyand in the arts  And we were admonished that toclaim empathy outside those two special areas is anenormitya word he described as another deadword but used anyway            While were at it why not outlaw all words andexpressions weve purloined over the years fromspecialized fieldssuch as melancholy hecticchronic  and allergic medicine leading question time is of the essence law by and large high anddry slush fund round robin aloof sailing ego extrovertcomplex phobia psyche depression traumasubconscious same place as empathy and manymore of what Fowler called popularized technicalitiesBut I doubt that will deter some legitimatelyinterested sympathetic altruistic caring peoplefrom trying to get inside other peoples heads andhearts in order to share their pain  It may not bepossible to do it but I dont see anything wrong intryingno matter what word we use to describe theattempt                              Full Thirkell            Just as speakers of British English are mistaken intheir assumption that Americans never say railwaybut always railroad  Americans and others are mistakenif they believe that Briticisms are used byspeakers in Great Britain to the exclusion of wordsused in say America  It is wrong to think that Britishspeakers never say truck for lorry escalator for movingstairway  and so forth  Not only do they know thewords and phrases to which they have been exposedthrough travel tourists movies television readingand ordinary commercethe properly descriptiveword intercourse  comes to mind only to be

Britishenjoy twitting Americans about some of their taboosCertainly one of thedare I sayprominentexamples is cock  which means both male bird andpenis in both dialects the situation arises becauseit meant male bird more commonly in British Englishand penis more commonly in American Englisha fairly clear case of distribution  This gave rise towhat Brits who evidently had little to laugh atthought was hilarious roostertail for cocktail   Onenotes today though that American prudery mighthave had some effect in Britain where one now encounterscockerel as often as cock in direct referenceto male bird  While at one time the sense of peniswas relatively far down the awareness scale of thosewho had occasion to refer to cocks as male birdsits sense of penis has increased in frequency andawareness level in recent years  Proof of this can beseen in a recent Diary article by Ruth Dudley Edwards The Independent   January  p  inwhich she quotes with inexpressible joy the followingpassage from
