in Malaysia offer a key activity travelers will be        searching for such as exploring Malaysias culture and history or        engaging in a sport like fishing but often there is an added bonus a        nearby jungle for trekking or a beachside resortand this is true        throughout the country        Malaysias well developed transportation        infrastructureboth road and airalso offers the chance to step        away from rigid planning if you desire to stay an extra day by the        beach or want to do some more extensive shopping Caution is needed if        you are not used to a hot and humid climate a constant but not        necessarily hostile factor and often requires a little extra planning        when heading out on tour trekking or just lazing by the pool        At the back of the book our helpful A to Z section provides        detailed practical information on how to handle your stay in Malaysia        Here we provide some general touring strategies before describing the        places you will be visiting        Some Touring Strategies        Starting in Town        The towns hold a mirror to Malaysias ethnic blend of Malay        Chinese Indians and Eurasians living side by side or in their        separate neighborhoods This takes on a metropolitan dimension in Kuala        Lumpur In true Malaysian style we will refer to the capital by its        abbreviation KL  The northeast coast of Malaysia especially between        Kota Bharu and Kuantan is one of the best places to see traditional        Malay life with its rich Muslim culture particularly evident in the        kampungs villages of the interior Step back into Malaysias history        in the port towns of Melaka or Kota Kinabalu where colonial rivals        once battled for supremacy and where princes and sultans dealt in        palace intrigue You will also be caught by the beauty of the many        mosques temples churches and shrines as the countrys faithful        practice their beliefs their places of homage often existing within        steps of each other in harmony But remember when visiting places of        worship to dress in an appropriately dignified manner and to slip off        your shoes before entering a mosque or a Hindu temple In Melaka        observe the way of life of the Babas the oldest Chinese community and        its more modern manifestation in Penangor indeed elsewhere as        Chinatowns throughout Malaysia offer chances to explore browse or        buy        The museums while being few in number provide an excellent        chance to gain insight into the path the country has taken as well as        offering a sense of the countrys culture and folklore The major ones        are in KL Melaka Penang Kuching and Kota Kinabalu And the picture        of life on the peninsula is best completed with a visit to Singapores        national museum if you happen to be passing through        Heading Out to the Country        Beyond city limits you will find myriad opportunities to        enjoy the rural and forested Malaysia But finding your way around the        riches of rainforest coral reef or marine reserve can be bewildering        if you plunge in unprepared Unless you already have some experience in        the region we recommend that you use the services of the many        firstclass local tour operators For jungle tours they provide        experienced Englishspeaking guides most of them with a good knowledge        of the rainforest Offices of the Malaysian Tourist Development        Corporation in your home country can provide guidance to the most        reputable companies see page  Most operators have their        headquarters in KL and organize tours nationwide They may subcontract        to smaller but equally reliable companies in outlying regions        Malaysia has done a fine job of giving visitors access to        its natural treasures without taming them too much At the heart of        the peninsula the huge Taman Negara gives you the most comprehensive        view of the countrys animals and plants in their wild state A more        compact approach is possible on the islands notably with excursions        into the wilderness of Tioman or Langkawi If you are attracted by the        egglaying habits of turtles head for Rantau Abang in July and        August        On the island of Borneo the great natural attractions are        Sarawaks caves at Niah and Mulu river cruises with a visit to tribal        longhouses Sabahs national parks of Mount Kinabalu and the offshore        islands and the Sepilok wildlife sanctuary If your desire is to        escape the coastal heat highland retreats will refresh and invigorate        offering a chance to enjoy what was once the exclusive domain of        colonial administrators        And Then the Beach        White sandy beaches and gentle sea breezes are for many the        perfect recipe for a holiday from the stresses of modern life and in        Malaysia the offerings are plenty Whether on the Peninsula or at the        marine parks of Sabah and Sarawak youll find many opportunities to        bask and laze under the tropical sun Just remember to use        sunscreensunburn and possible dehydration are never too far away                On the west coast the best beaches are at the island        resorts of Penang and Langkawi Unspoiled stretches of fine sand can        also be found on the east coast from Pantai Chinta Berahi north of        Kota Bharu down to Beserah north of Kuantan Farther south are the        resorts of Tioman Island and Desaru In East Malaysia Kuching and Kota        Kinabalu both have fine hotel resorts        Speaking the Language        Though the official tongue is Malay or Bahasa Malaysia        English is still the common language of communication between Malays        Chinese and Indians After an initial nationalist resistance to using        English to accompany Malay road signs a new effort is being made to        accommodate foreign drivers But you may still like to use a few words        of Malay as a courteous gesture to your hosts        You will find a comprehensive list of useful phrases in the        back of this book        The Center        Malaysias prosperity in recent decades is most evident in        the central region of the peninsula where the signs abound From the        new international airport to KLs dramatic skyline to the middle class        seen driving Malaysianmade Proton sedans on sixlane highwaysall        are

Lumpur        At times Kuala Lumpuroften referred to as KLappears        to be a crisscross of pedestrianunfriendly overpasses and        expressways But the city opens to islands of almost junglelike        treecover before descending again into lively market centers        surrounded by the buildings that look down upon the citys busy        streets Visitors may initially be drawn to the story Petronas Twin        Towers or the KL Communications Tower which are potent symbols of        modern Kuala Lumpur But the more fascinating splendors of the past are        closer to street level where distinctive NeoGothic styles are        beautifully preserved        As in other Malaysian cities the population is        predominantly Chinese The Chinese community is prominent in the modern        business world Chinatown itself remains a hive of bustling activity        standing cheek by jowl with a Little India of pungent spice shops and        ornate Hindu temples Ethnic Malays are present in the upper echelons        of the government civil service and tourist offices        The Historic Center        KLs main historic quarter lies near Jalan Sultan        Hishamuddin where on the east

fine copper oniondomes One tops a m ft high        clock tower that suggests inspiration from Big Ben in London That is        perhaps not a surprise since the building was designed by British        architect A C Norman At the other end of this building youll also        find Infokraf where the Malaysian Handicraft Development Corporation        has a permanent exhibition of national craftwork with many exhibits        for sale Near this building is the old City Hall at Lebuh Pasar        Besar which now houses the Textile Museum        Among the many impressive skyscrapers one of the most        striking is the story Dayabumi Complex  southeast of Dataran        Merdeka The soaring white tower successfully integrates traditional        Islamic architectural themespointed arches delicate open        tracerywith its otherwise modern design Included in the        southernmost end of the complex is the adjoining Pejabat Besar Pos        General Post Office in a similar Islamic modern style and a        shopping mall        On the western side of the boulevard is the Dataran Merdeka        Freedom Square In the colonial days the sound of a cricket bats        willow would have been heard as the afternoons sunrays stretched        across the field It was here that members of the mockTudor Royal        Selangor Club  also designed by A C Norman took time off from        the affairs of the Empire to play cricket On the wide span of lawn the        cheers of independence were heard on  August  The square now        hosts National Day state parades On the squares northern side the        Anglican St Marys Church dates to         A C Norman was rivaled in commissions by A B Hubback        whose work is reflected in the Malaysian Railway buildings and        headquarters located south on Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin The main        station completed in  and extensively renovated in  resembles        nothing so much as a gleaming sultans palace and is more attractive        than the somber brown headquarters building across the street It is a        fine example of Moorish architecture reflecting the Ottoman and Mogul        glory of the th and th centuries The north wing was bombed in        World War II and the second floor was gutted by fire in         Mr Hubbock also designed the Masjid Jamek Since  this        building has marked the confluence of the Gombak and Klang Rivers        where tin miners loaded supplies to be sent upriver and unloaded their        tin for shipment west to Port Klang and where the citys roots were        set down It was designed

of southwestern Malaysias southwest        coastline Nowadays the rich tapestry of history lies in the monuments        and homes as well as the descendants of the Malay and Indian the        Chinese Portuguese Dutch and British colonizers In the far north        Pulau Penang is both holiday destination and commercial center while        closer to the border with Thailand Pulau Langkawi is the

see the tribes of Sarawak in their        forest homes is a privilege not to be missed However tours to some        longhouses have acquired the artificial character of a tribal theme        park  Unfortunately as tourism rises and the popularity of such        expeditions increases it is a trend difficult to escape the only real        alternative being to travel even farther into the forests at added        expense But the adoption by some villagers of western clothing or such        items as televisions and radios shouldnt daunt the visitor        On offer for the soft adventure traveler is a choice        between a day trip an overnight stay at a guest house near a        longhouse or a stay in a longhouse itself Tours from Kuching usually        start very early and involve a two to fivehour road journey to the        river and then a onehour cruise by longboat Tour operators usually        have exclusive arrangements with particular longhouses        The format of the visit varies but it may include        cultural performances soon after arrival for daytrippers or at the        days end as evening entertainment for those staying longer The        standard tour is an initial orientation to the longhouse highlighting        the bilik apartments as distinct from the ruai communal areas Tour        groups are often greeted with tuak a sweet wine made from glutinous        rice and a welcome dance The musical and cultural performance        includes a ngajat a traditional Iban dance Demonstrations of the        blowpipe and cockfighting are also likely to be on the

stopovers earlier        in the day Malaysian tourism authorities may also be able to offer        advice on reputable tour operators in Kuching who organize visits on a        small scale so as not to offend tribal dignity        Around Kuching visitors are likely to visit a longhouse of        the Iban tribe but tours are also available to Bidayuh longhouses        found in the hill regions

of the caveroof birds nests The caves        and surrounding hectare acre park are  km  miles        up the coast from Kuching hidden within the Miri Forests        Adventurer A Hart Everett came across the caves in the        s but it was not until  that local explorer and Sarawak Museum        curator Tom Harrison made the important discovery of a human skull        dating back some  years together with yearold red        hematite rock paintings The fragments of the Deep Skull socalled        because it was found deep within an ancient pile of bat guano        together with tools earthenware pots jars and later bronze jewelry        found nearby are on display at the Kuching Museum        The park near the town of Batu Niah is midway between        the towns of Bintulu and Miri a boomtown known for its oil exploration        and recovery The caves are accessible by road from either town taking        at least two hours from Miri and three hours from Bintulu The parks

intense        The Traders Cave is the first to be seen socalled        because of its role as a meeting place of birds nestgatherers and        merchants The original Niah peoples decline is something of a        mystery their forefathers may be the nomadic Penan who traded the        nests and hornbill ivory for Chinese porcelain and beads        The main or Great Cave is a hollow  m  ft up in        the sandstone Subis plateau Besides some giant crickets and scorpions        from which the extension of the boardwalk through the cave keeps you        safe the Great Cave is home to millions of bats and swiftlets The        Deep Skull and other relics were discovered here        The bats daily droppings furnish one ton of highly valued        guano fertilizer But more lucrative than the guano are the swiftlets        edible nests for which Chinese merchants are prepared to pay hundreds        of dollars per kilo of about  nests reselling them for thousands        to make birdsnest soup Park authorities are increasingly concerned        about the impact of the ongoing harvest on the swiftlets survival        The rush of nesting swiftlets flying into the cave at days end while        the nocturnal bats rush past into the evening sky is a spectacular        sight        The boardwalk continues through the Great Cave down to the        Painted Cave also accessible without a guide Discovered in  along        with the Deep Skull its wallpaintings representing red stick figures        of spreadeagle dancers were executed in a mixture of betel juice and        lime around ad  This cave was probably also used as a burial        chamber        Nearby are the several jungle trails with the Jalan Bukit        Kasut and the Jalan Madu both clearly marked Be on the lookout for the        longtailed macaques together with a range of birdlife such as        bulbuls tailor birds crested wood partridges trogons and        hornbills        Gunung Mulu National Park

Sungei Tutoh and Sungei        Melanau to the parks headquarters This is the only alternative to the        air trip and requires almost a full day of travel by bus and boat        while still availableand recommended for the return journeythe        flight from Miri over rainforest in a seat Twin Otter plane is        considered the best way to begin your stay at Mulu        There are four main show caves at MuluDeer Langs        Clearwater and Windas well as countless other wild caves which        are either too dangerous or too ecologically fragile to visit without        special permits and qualified guides        Away from the show caves expect some crawling around on        hands and knees or wading chestdeep through underground streams The        best guides will provide

this chamber        be sure to ask when making your arrangements to see if it can still be        visited        Nearest to the parks headquarters are the Deer Cave and        Langs Cave The Deer Cave with an enormous entrance and a passage         km about  mile long and up to  m ft high had been a        shelter for deer It is uncertain whether it was also used as a human        burial ground as other caves in the system were used Like many other        large open caves it is home to millions of bats which fly out in a        cloud at dusk in search for food Noteworthy is Adam and Eves

like petrified hooded        ghosts above the dark green canopy of the forest Extra time too is        required if you with to attempt the climb up Mount Mulu  m        ft whose summit was successfully reached by Lord Shackelton in         after earlier known attempts in the nineteenth century had failed The        climb of Mount Mulu can alone can take up to five days although
