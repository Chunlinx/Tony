New York TimesLaw Schools Urge Graduates to Start Small and Think LocalBy Greg WinterMonday December  Life for the partners of Cates Katalinic  Lund holdslittle of the glamour one might expect from a career in lawInstead of lunches at Lutce they caucus at the Palace Diner inQueens Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street cornersnot securing box seats at Madison Square Garden To make ends meetone partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbingwarehouse Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab A signof failure of a feeble economy perhaps Hardly They are heedingthe call of a growing pool of law schools which are for the firsttime pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how toget there Forget the lure of large firms the security of agovernment post Here is how to grapple in the service ofjustice as many of the schools put it insteadConvinced that corporate largess and government programs barelydent the nations legal needs the law schools are urging graduatesto buck tradition pass up big salaries and ignore mushroomingstudent debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply starttheir own all with an eye toward charging no more than theirclients can affordThis is not pro bono legal work it is low bono a term theschools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they aretraining students for While its practitioners do charge for theirservices they are also dead set on turning no one away  or atleast as few as possibleWhen you go into this kind of social justice law its reallybrutal and youre almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple ofyears before theres a light at the end of the tunnel said FredRooney director of the Community Legal Resource Network at CityUniversity of New York School of Law from which the lawyers of thenewly formed Cates Katalinic  Lund graduated last May Butif our graduates dont do it the millions of people who cannotaccess justice in this country will continue to soarThe movement primly called the consortium started four yearsago by CUNY Northeastern University the University of Marylandand St Marys Law School in Texas St Marys later dropped outSince then it has drawn seven additional law schools to its ranksthe University of Michigan Rutgers and Syracuse Law Schools NewYork Law School University of New Mexico School of Law Thomas MCooley Law School and Touro Law School It has elicited at leastinitial interest from  more Mixing foundation money with theirown to go beyond the standard curriculum the schools are teachingthe nuts and bolts of running a business setting up clientreferral networks for fledgling practitioners and holding seminarsto tackle the mundane cha llenges of going it alone that are oftenconsidered superfluous to the study of lawAs further encouragement for the  or so followers they havepicked up already the consortium schools have given theirgraduates Palm organizers paid for companies to help with theirbilling and offered free legal research and even yoga andmeditation classes almost anything to help make life a littleeasier for those trying to hang out their shinglesWere talking about training real community lawyers said Stuart L Deutsch dean of the Rutgers School of Law in Newark Theperception is that the solo practitioners are the ones who got Csthe second string who didnt excel enough to get to the big firmsWere trying to say that solo practice can be among the highestforms of public service and is the only channel possible toserving lowincome peopleTrue or not there is little debate that most lowincomeclients and many in the middle class find lawyers well outsidetheir financial reach Even at the smallest of firms the medianhourly rate starts at roughly  an hour and passes according to a  survey by Altman Weil a legal consultingcompany For firms with more than  lawyers in tow the range isfrom  to more than  an hour the survey found not countingthe dinners taxi rides and other extras that are often tacked ontothe billAt those rates perhaps it should come as no surprise that percent of lowincome people and  percent of moderateincomepeople with civil troub les end up without representationaccording to the American Bar Association For the truly poormeaning they earn no more than  a year there aregovernmentfinanced legal aid agencies to turn to  in all butthese offices are so overwhelmed that only one in five people whoqualify for help actually gets anyBy contrast big law firms are slowly stepping up theircommitment to free services after  years of pulling back Yettheir lawyers still spend less than  hours a year doing pro bonowork far short of the professions guidelines to perform at least volunteer hours each year Even during more charitable timesthe bar association says most of the free or less costly work ishandled by small firms and solo practitioners making the m anatural target for the consortiums sightsA lot of students still go to law school because of theirideals and theyre willing to bite the bullet drive old cars notbuy a home and keep living a students life for a few more yearsuntil they get settled said Lovely Dhillon the former SanFrancisco assistant district attorney who heads the consortiumIts incumbent on us to help themThe consortium certainly has a lot to overcome most notably thepull of big law firms Twenty years ago three times as many lawschool graduates went into solo or tiny practices as went to firmswith more than  lawyers according to the National Associationfor Law Placement By last year the two poles had flipfloppedwith the biggest firms attracting  percent more graduates thanthe smallest and given the difference in pay it is not hard to seewhyJoining a firm with fewer than  lawyers means starting at a year the association says The bigger a practice getsthough the higher its starting salaries climb topping out around a year at the largest firms Considering that law schooltuitions have roughly doubled in the last decade pushing themedian student debt past  it is understandable why somequestion how far the consortium can spreadIts a great idea but the pressure of academic debt reallyleads people to big firms in big cities said Theresa J Bryantexecutive director of the career development office at Yale LawSchool which is not part of the consortium When youre standing in debt going small may present a bit of a challengeFair enough the consortium says Not all graduates will be ableto scrounge for the years it may take to build a clientele norshould they But since as many as  percent to  percent of thegraduates at schools like CUNY go into small or solo practiceswithin a few years of graduating the deans argue it seems follynot to teach them how to stay afloat financially and take onlowincome clients at the same timeHow do you advertise How do you bill clients and perhaps eventrickier get them to pay How can you remain affordable and stillpay your rent What kind of office software will you need Howabout malpractice insurance Such are the sobering questionsrarely highbrow enough to find their way into legal pedagogy thatthe consortium seeks to help their graduates tackleImportant as they are these issues are low on the academicpecking order and not what get most faculty recognized saidDeborah L Rhode former president of the Association of AmericanLaw Schools and a professor of law at Stanford University alsooutside the consortium The truth is legal education is partiallyresponsible for the disconnect between what ordinary Americans needand what educated lawyers can supplyEven for the most intrepid and socially conscious of graduatesstarting a practice requires a giant leap of faith and more than alittle guesswork Charging slidingscale fees means coming up witha new wage for almost every case one takes and seldom canpractitioners rely on anything more solid than their ownjudgmentHow much will we charge Tristan Da Cunha one of the newgraduates starting Cates Katalinic  Lund asked with a shrugfurrowing his brow as if the question had never come up I thinkits fair to say well be heavily discounted
