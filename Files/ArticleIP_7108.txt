                         Extramarital Chatter                        Not only did Timothy NoahsNov  Chatterbox contain major factual errors the comparisons it drewbetween the presentday situation and that of Thomas Jefferson is verydisheartening There are fewer similarities than this rush to analyze and spinrealizes            Most glaring was Noahsstatement regarding the basis for his conclusion Chatterbox bases this on theconfirmation of his extramarital affair with Sally Hemings This was not anextramarital affair under any circumstances Jeffersons wife Martha wasdeceased This makes extramarital very difficult In addition Hemings wasthe halfsister of Jeffersons wife Jefferson and Hemings engaged in alongterm and perhaps monogamous relationship for almost  years She evenaccompanied him during his tenure in France Where is the correlation to ourmodern day president            I find it easier tounderstand Noahs claims of Jeffersonian hypocrisy However even a minuteunderstanding of Jeffersonian history would inform Noah that scholars fordecades have considered the inconsistencies among Jeffersons statements andactions a hot topic for study            Yourinaccurate presentation of history is dangerous Slow down take a deep breathand be careful if you plan to play historian             DavidStarmer                        Charlottesville Va

David Plotz states Inglis is so principled in fact that hevotes against funding pork projects in his own district In one famouscase Inglis helped kill federal funding for a needed highway requiring thestate to build a toll road instead He has not been forgiven            I have certainly forgiven BobInglis Im a native New Yorker who relocated to Greenville SC  yearsago In the eyes of my conservative neighbors I am a liberalI consistentlyvote Democratic and will probably vote for Fritz Hollings The one thing thatinclines me to vote for Inglis is his attempts to kill the Southern Connectorthe needed highway of Plotzs example            If there ever was a highwayproject that could be defined as pork its the Southern Connector Its ahighway connecting two areas already well connected to the Interstate HighwaySystem and will only benefit people traveling from the area southwest ofGreenville to the area southeast of Greenville and vice versa Those two areasare already connected by I and I It seems to me an unnecessary expenseto spend many millions of dollars to reduce a few peoples travel time by fiveminutes The only people in Greenville who support the Southern Connector arethe highway contractors who will benefit financially from the project            While Idisagree with Inglis social agenda I must admit its nice to have arepresentative who recognizes that there is no such thing as good pork             AlVyssotsky                        Greenville SC                           The Kingand Microsoft                        It mightbe useful to your readers of the Nov  Explainer to know the reason that actions in equity dont get ajury trial Cases in chancery or equity wereare different from suits broughtunder the law In a lawsuit you are relying on established rights that theking had laid down the jurors used to be  men from the community whowere familiar with the subject and who when shown or told what the statutesaid could make a fair decision and resolve the controversy Chancery matterswere more like personal problems taken up before the king or his chancellorchiefofstafftype guy In these cases you were asking the king for aspecific particularized kind of help a divorce apportionment of an estateetc and the kings ruling was more narrowly applied to you So for examplein this case the governments lawyers want the chancellorjudge to enjoin orforbid certain Microsoft practices or conduct You cant point to a brightlinerule to make the decision rather the judge is asked to weigh the equities andsay This or that doesnt seem fair to me and so I order you to dodifferently In law you say The contractstatutewhathaveyou says yourremedy is X In chancery you say This seems about right to me             DianneCarr

is not to the House of Lords with its mixture ofhereditary and appointedforlife peers the hereditary part is soon to beswept away by New Labor The appeal goes to the law lords who sit in the Houseof Lords They are our equivalent of the Supreme Court and are made up of thecountrys most distinguished judges Their average age is similar to theSupreme Court justices which makes them relatively aging as you wouldexpect but it is a mistake to think they are necessarily conservative Infact they are pretty liberal these daysthough it does not follow thatPinochet will lose the appeal
