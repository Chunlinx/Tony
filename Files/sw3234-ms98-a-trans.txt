        Carolyn i have a little Schnauzer little miniature Schnauzer     oh   what do you have   well its kind of a mixed breed that we got from the Humane Society   uh you know those make the best animals uh pets best pets my uh son has a uh oh its a real mixture its part uh Doberman and part Husky yes and they gentlest dog you ever met and they got him from the uh Humane Society here in Oklahoma City   oh my oh   and shes just turned out to be a jewel my my little Schnauzer is is my friend she is so spoiled shes a year and a half old now       and being single shes become very important in my life   uhhuh   its so nice to have come home and find something or someone whos really so happy to see you   well my children are the ones that wanted our pet and this one is probably the best one that we have had um as i say we got it from the Humane Society and uh we had lost a pet and we really went there looking for the one that we had lost it got out under the fence while we were on vacation and we just looked all over for it and couldnt find it but uh when we walked in to the       to the Humane Society this little dog was uh in the office and would sit up and beg and just oh he was so cute and the kids just fell in love with it we just couldnt leave without it but its um whoever had it before must have trained it real well because its just you know its uh a good house dog ive never had one that i could keep in the house before and tolerate it   sometimes i wish i had not gotten this one as a puppy because i work and im not home   uhhuh   and unfortunately shes not as well trained as as i would like her to be   umhum   and i realize its my fault im not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian but uh   its hard to do that when youre not there constantly   it is it is shes you know shes real good i can leave her all day in the bathroom with her toys and her food and everything and and not one mess does she make and then we go outside   hm oh   and shell stay outside for oh thirty minutes to an hour come inside and use the restroom   hm   i just want to kill her at those times   oh   but shes a doll shes a love she really is   about the only time we have well i shouldnt say the only time but most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night and uh she usually stays inside at night we try to take her out right before we go to sleep but uh sometimes it doesnt work   you know i i we always had a pet when i was growing up oh always had a dog my mother did not like cats so we always had a dog and and then course when my children were growing up we always had a dog and always said its because the children wanted the pet   umhum   and i find that im enjoying this one far more than i ever did when it was the childrens dog   oh   i uh in fact my children gave me this this little puppy for Christmas   what a cute idea   yeah i think so   well we got one one year for Christmas and uh i had a baby the next day     oh my goodness   and uh so  that one wasnt really well trained   two babies huh oh   oh i just didnt have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time so     that that is really probably bad timing   yeah i think it was it really was The older kids had wanted one though and you know we thought well that would be a fun time for them to have it you know get it at Christmas time it was a little Spitz with a little white   oh yes   fluffy and you know looked like it came right from the North Pole and that was fun but um i I sure wasnt good at training it   uhhuh do you   i think you have to have time you know to to do those things   and patience and you have to you really have to be just like your children when you set a rule you have to stand by it and be consistent   thats right   and
