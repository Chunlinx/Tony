                    Background        Vitamin E is an essential nutrient the main lipid        soluble antioxidant and plays a significant role in        protecting biological membranes and lipoproteins from        damage caused by free radicals generated during lipid        peroxidation       Recent information suggests that        vitamin E also has functions unrelated to its role as an        antioxidant     Vitamin E is often equated only with        alphatocopherol since this form is the most potent in        protecting the fetuses of pregnant female rats from death        and resorption Vitamin E is however not a single        compound and refers to at least four tocopherols alpha        beta delta and gammatocopherol and four tocotrienols        alpha beta delta and gammatocotrienol        Alphatocopherol and gammatocopherol see Figure  are        the two major forms of vitamin E found in human plasma and        tissues Under         in vitro conditions alpha and        gammatocopherol have very similar abilities to inhibit        lipid peroxidation in large unilamellar liposomes            The dietary intake of gammatocopherol is at least two        times that of alphatocopherol in Western diets The levels        of alphatocopherol in human plasma are nevertheless        about four times higher than those of gammatocopherol        Both alpha and gammatocopherol are absorbed from the        intestine and secreted into chylomicrons equally well             The selective retention of alphatocopherol in plasma        is attributed to a number of factors such as the hepatic        alphatocopherol transfer protein alphaTTP which        preferentially incorporates alphatocopherol over        gammatocopherol into very low density lipoprotein              Indeed the affinity of the different forms of        vitamin E for the alphaTTP protein appears to be a primary        determinant of their plasma levels     In addition        there is evidence suggesting that gammatocopherol is        preferentially catabolized to a watersoluble form         trimethylbetacarboxyethylhydroxychroman or        gammaCEHC by side chain oxidation             It is also possible that a more rapid cellular uptake of        gammatocopherol and removal from plasma could contribute        to the preferential maintenance of alphatocopherol in        plasma A more rapid cellular accumulation of        gammatocopherol compared to alphatocopherol would also        have major physiological consequences The protection of        subcellular organelles and cellular DNA from free radical        damage is likely to be primarily dependent upon        intracellular vitamin E levels as opposed to plasma vitamin        E levels Surprisingly there have been very few studies        comparing the cellular uptakes of alpha and        gammatocopherol Tran and Chan    found a        preferentially uptake three fold higher after four hours        of incubation of gammatocopherol compared to        alphatocopherol in cultured human umbilical endothelial        cells In contrast Jiang         et al    found a similar        incorporation of both alpha and gammatocopherol into        RAW macrophages and only a slightly higher         incorporation of gammatocopherol compared to        alphatocopherol in A endothelial cells        In this investigation we studied the uptake and        depletion of alphatocopherol and gammatocopherol as well        as their quinone oxidation products see Figure  by        RAW murine macrophages There are no previous studies        on the cellular uptake tocopheryl quinones We found that        gammatocopherol was taken up more rapidly and accumulated        to higher levels than alphatocopherol in RAW        macrophages In addition we found that presence of        gammatocopherol dramatically increased the cellular uptake        of alphatocopherol We also describe a novel high pressure        liquid chromatography HPLC method for simultaneously        separating and quantifying levels of alphatocopherol        alphatocopheryl quinone gammatocopherol and        gammatocopheryl quinone

  Uptake and depletion of tocopherols or tocopheryl          quinones in cells          To define the time course of tocopherol or tocopheryl          quinone accumulation adherent cells    well          were subcultured in  well falcon tissue culture plates          with medium enriched with about  M tocopherol or about           M quinone  mlwell After  hr the uptake          phase the medium was replaced with fresh medium without          tocopherol or quinone and the depletion of tocopherols          or quinones followed for an additional  hours the          depletion phase During the course of the cell culture          experiment a  l aliquot of medium was removed every           hr and placed in a glass vial for tocopherol or          quinone measurement and the remaining medium removed

containing  gml          ditertbutylmethylphenol BHT and          racdimethyl tocol as an internal standard The          racdimethyl tocol internal standard was found to be          very useful since it did not elute in the same position          as gammatocopheryl quinone as does tocol          methyltrimethyltridecylchromanol which          is typically used as an internal standard After

of tocopherols separately          and together          Confluent RAW macrophages were incubated with          either  M alphatocopherol or  M gammatocopherol          Figure A or with both tocopherols together Figure          Bwith alphatocopherol at  M and gammatocopherol at           M and the uptake of tocopherols measured during           hours of incubation Uptake is defined as the net          difference between tocopherol transported into the cells          and loss due to catabolism andor           in vitro oxidation After  hours          the medium with tocopherols was removed and replaced with          medium not containing tocopherols and depletion of          tocopherols followed for  hours          After  hours of incubating macrophages with either          alpha or gammatocopherol Figure A the intracellular          levels of gammatocopherol were at least six fold higher          than the levels of alphatocopherol p   A          major goal of this research was to determine if          alphatocopherol and gammatocopherol interacted with          each other so as influence their uptake and depletion          Figure Bshows the uptake and depletion of          alphatocopherol and gammatocopherol when both were          incubated together with macrophages It is clear compare          Figure Ato B that the presence of gammatocopherol          considerably enhanced the uptake of alphatocopherol p            The presence of alphatocopherol did not          however markedly enhance the uptake of gammatocopherol          After washing with fresh medium without tocopherols the          macrophage levels of both alphatocopherol and          gammatocopherol decreased but the depletion of          gammatocopherol was always faster than that of          alphatocopherol          The changes in tocopherol levels expressed as          nmoleswell in the medium were also measured during both          the uptake and depletion phases and these data are          provided in Tables for alphatocopherol or          gammatocopherol and for alphatocopherol plus          gammatocopherol In order to make meaningful          comparison Tables and also provide the cell content of          tocopherols expressed as nmoleswell The data in Tables          and indicate that only a small percentage of the          tocopherols lost from the medium during the uptake phase          are recovered in the macrophages This suggests that a          considerable amount of tocopherol is lost during          incubation by catabolismoxidation The recovery of          alphatocopherol during the uptake phase was however          greater when gammatocopherol was present          It is interesting that the depletion of          alphatocopherol from the medium during the uptake phase          was always greater than that of gammatocopherol yet the          cellular uptake of gammatocopherol was always greater          than that of alphatocopherol Tables and also indicate          that gammatocopherol decreases from RAW macrophages          more rapidly than alphatocopherol during the depletion          phase          Tocopheryl quinones see Figure  are likely products          formed by the oxidation of tocopherols Table shows the          initial distribution of alphatocopherol or          gammatocopherol and their quinone products both in the          medium and in cells as well as the distribution after           hr of incubation in the cell system These data show that          the nmoles of tocopherol that accumulated in cells after           hr is very small compared to the amount in the medium          For the data in Table  for example the original amount          of alphatocopherol in the medium was  nmolewell          but the amount present in cells after  hr was just           nmolewell ie less than  of the original amount          in the medium The original amount of gammatocopherol          was  nmolewell and the amount present in cells          after  hr was  nmolewell which is  of the          original amount in the medium          If tocopheryl quinones were the only          catabolicoxidation products formed during incubation          with the macrophages then the nmoles of tocopherol plus          the nmoles of tocopheryl quinone in the medium and in the          cells should be constant Table clearly shows that the          sum of the tocopherol and its quinone product decreased          over the  hr experiment suggesting that products other          than the tocopheryl quinone were formed during the          experiment Moreover these data show that after  hr of          incubation  cellular alphatocopheryl quinone levels          were generally higher than those of gammatocopheryl          quinone  cellular tocopheryl quinones levels were          always much lower than cellular tocopherol levels This          latter point suggests that the low cellular levels of          alphatocopherol compared to gammatocopherol levels          shown in Figure A as compared to Figure B cannot be          explained by the simple cellular oxidation of          alphatocopherol to alphatocopheryl quinone with no          further catabolism or oxidation After  hr macrophages          incubated with both alpha and gammatocopherol          accumulated about  nmole more alphatocopherol than          did macrophages incubated with alphatocopherol alone          If in the absence of gammatocopherol  nmole of          alphatocopherol were converted to alphatocopheryl          quinone and no further catabolism occurred than this          should be recovered in cells The data in Table          indicate however a cellular accumulation of only about           nmoles of alphatocopheryl quinone Moreover          macrophages actually had a lower content of          alphatocopheryl quinone when incubated with          alphatocopherol alone then when incubated with both          alpha and gammatocopherol together Although          gammatocopherol promotes the cellular uptake of          alphatocopherol it clearly did not do so by          dramatically protecting alphatocopherol from oxidation          to alphatocopheryl quinone with no further          catabolismoxidation of alphatocopheryl quinone                          The uptake and depletion tocopheryl quinones          separately and together          RAW  macrophages were incubated with  M          alphatocopheryl quinone or  M gammatocopheryl          quinone alone Figure A or with both together Figure          Bwith  M alphatocopheryl quinone and  M          gammatocopheryl quinone and the uptake and depletion          measured as described above Figure indicates that          alphatocopheryl quinone accumulates to higher levels          than gammatocopheryl quinone eg at  hours the          difference is significant at p   Similarly          alphatocopheryl quinone was lost from the cells more          rapidly during the depletion phase These results are          consistent with those in Table  which always indicate a          higher intracellular concentration of alphatocopheryl          quinone compared to gammatocopheryl quinone          Table shows the initial distribution of          alphatocopheryl quinone or gammatocopheryl quinone in          both the medium and cells and the distribution after  hr          of incubation with each quinone separately or both          quinones together Only a very small fraction of the          gammatocopheryl quinone lost from the medium was taken          up by the RAW macrophages ie   when          gammatocopheryl quinone was incubated by alone and            when gammatocopheryl was incubated along with          alphatocopheryl quinone In the case of alphatocopheryl          quinone there was substantially greater recovery ie            when alphatocopheryl alone was incubated with the          macrophages and   when alphatocopheryl quinone was          incubated along with gammatocopheryl quinone The data          in Table clearly show that gammatocopheryl quinone was          oxidized andor catabolized more rapidly than          alphatocopheryl quinone The data in Table also          indicate that cellular quinone uptake of was not          influence by an interaction between alpha and          gammatocopheryl quinones                            Discussion                  The uptake and depletion of tocopherols separately          and together          Our results consistently show that gammatocopherol          was taken up more rapidly and accumulated to higher          intracellular levels than alphatocopherol Moreover the          presence of gammatocopherol markedly promoted the uptake          of alphatocopherol by macrophages When macrophages were          incubated with alphatocopherol or gammatocopherol          individually the macrophage level of alphatocopherol          was just  of that of gammatocopherol Figure A          In marked contrast when macrophages were incubated with          both alpha and gammatocopherols together the cellular          level of alphatocopherol were  after  hr that          of gammatocopherol Figure B There were no marked          changes in the levels of gammatocopherol caused by the          presence of alphatocopherol          Tocopherol quinones were considered to be likely          oxidization products of the tocopherols The increased          cellular uptake of alphatocopherol caused by          gammatocopherol could be caused by gammatocopherol          protecting alphatocopherol from           in vitro oxidation to its quinone          form However the data in Table show that          gammatocopherol does not slow the oxidation of          alphatocopherol to alphatocopheryl quinone In the          presence of gammatocopherol the cellular levels of          alphatocopheryl quinone were even higher than in its          absence Table  It is possible however that          gammatocopherol may protect alphatocopherol from          catabolism or           in vitro oxidation into products          other than quinones The data in Table certainly suggest          that products other than quinones were produced when          the macrophages were incubated with tocopherols Those          metabolites could very possibly be watersoluble          products such as alphaCEHC or gammaCEHC that were not          measured in this investigation          It is not clear why our result differ from those          reported by Jiang           et al     who also measured          the uptake of alpha and gammatocopherol separately in          RAW macrophages but not both together Since          gammatocopherol is depleted from macrophages more          rapidly than alphatocopherol the time interval between          removal of the tocopherol enriched medium and cell          harvesting could be an important variable Our results          are however qualitatively very similar to those          reported by Tran and Chen    for human endothelial          cells although these investigators did not directly          compare the results from incubating cells with          alphatocopherol and gammatocopherol separately or          together                          The uptake and depletion tocopheryl quinones          separately and together          When macrophages were incubated tocopheryl quinones          see Figure  the cellular levels of alphatocopheryl          quinone were always found to be higher than that of          gammatocopheryl quinone independent of the presence of          gammatocopheryl quinone The data in Table suggest          that alphatocopheryl quinone is fairly stable in the          cell incubation system compared to gammatocopheryl          quinone                          Physiological significance of the results          It is not known if the           in vitro results of this study are          relevant to the           in vivo conditions It is          interesting however that in an animal model graded          levels of dietary gammatocopherol in a diet containing a          constant level of alphatocopherol were found to increase          the levels of alphatocopherol in serum and most tissues              This remarkable result has yet to be reproduced          in humans but certainly suggests an interaction between          dietary gammatocopherol and alphatocopherol similar to          that reported here on the cellular level The potential          health related significance of gammatocopherol is being          increasingly recognized                                Conclusions        Our data suggests that gammatocopherol could play a        significant role in modulating intracellular antioxidant        defence mechanisms Moreover we found the presence of        gammatocopherol dramatically influenced the cellular        accumulation of alphatocopherol ie gammatocopherol        promoted the accumulation of alphatocopherol If these        results could be extrapolated to         in vivo conditions they suggest that        gammatocopherol is selectively taken up by cells and        removed from plasma more rapidly than alphatocopherol        This could in part contribute to the selective        maintenance of alphatocopherol in plasma compared to        gammatocopherol                    List of abbreviations        TOH RRRalphatocopherol TOH        RRRgammatocopherol TQ
