                                 Splat Spackle Plop                           posted Saturday Oct                         The firstpowerful experience I remember having while looking at art was in the JacksonPollock room at the Museum of Modern Art I was  or so and we were on afamily visit to New York Overwhelming everything else in the museum was the foot long One Number    a painting that amazed and thrilled mewith its scale its spontaneity and the intensity it radiated I had the samefeeling again when I saw Lavender Mist Number   at the National Gallery inWashington soon thereafter            But Pollock has left me coldas an adult and often bored His paintings looked hollow and often sloppy andgarish Did I respond to him as an adolescent because Pollock was a misbehavedgrandiose adolescent himself Maybe we all just had a teen crush on Pollock theart world delinquent Or was it entombment in museums being surrounded by thework of nonaction painters that muffled his force and left him dead on thewall I have been awaiting a show that would settle the issue            The Pollock retrospectivethat opens at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City this weekend ought toresolve all such ambivalence With more than  workspretty much everyimportant painting Pollock didit is a complete and authoritative presentationof his life and work Occupying the entire third floor of the museum itincludes both a fullscale replica of Pollocks studio in the Springs on LongIsland and a continuous showing of the fascinating films that Hans Namuth aGerman migr photographer made of Pollock painting at the peak of his careerThe long catalog essay by the Moderns chief curator Kirk Varnedoe is a modelof its kind covering the salient facts of Pollocks biography artisticdevelopment and the critical debate about him As an exhibition this is oneof the best I have ever seen And it did make up my mind            In the early roomsskepticism cant but prevail From the time Pollock arrived in New York in at the age of  until about  he was casting about for a style Heloved the idea of being an artist but his vast ambition wasnt coupled withmuch or even any talent Through the first four rooms we see him find andmimic mentors some living some dead He first fell under the sway of ThomasHart Benton his teacher at the New York Art Students League and AlbertPinkham Ryder essaying moonlight seascapes and moody swirls of Americana suchas Going West  Then Pollock apprenticed himself to theMexican muralists Siqueiros and Orozco as in UntitledNaked Man With Knife  Next he ate Picassos dust as inStenographic Figure  then Mirs as in Untitled Blue Moby Dick             By  when the ungiftedPollock was still struggling with the greats the critic Clement Greenberg wasalready heralding him as the baby Jesus of American art noting that he is notafraid to look ugly Greenberg liked Pollock because of the evidence heprovided for Greenbergs Marxian view of art history as a series of developingstages in which the picture plane was destined to flatten empty anddisappear Today Greenberg is much derided for his dogmatic views and imperialpronouncements But as far as I can tell he was correct in every respectright that Pollock was ugly right about where American Modernism was goingand right that Pollock had genius trapped inside him What is amazing is thatGreenberg could see how good Pollock would become given how bad he wasPerhaps the most famous picture from that period is  After  years ofpractice Pollock was void in color sense draftsmanship composition andhandling of his materials The painting is a kind of red herring With itssuggestive title glyphs and symbols it is designed to make you think itcontains more than meets the eye            But in  somethingsuddenly happened Pollocks nauseous swirls and lugubrious slatherings steppedinto a phone booth and reemerged as his mature allover style You see thisfirst in three paintings known as the Sounds in the Grass series the best ofwhich is Shimmering Substance Pollock has said goodbye to content andseems to have found his selfconfidence at last A year later he is flickingdripping pouring and splattering creating mediumscale works of great beautythough still interspersed with fits of unappealing blotchiness You donthave to read the elaborate taxonomy of his technique in the catalog torecognize that what sometimes appears as chaos is in fact the product of greatcontrol and finesse Pollock came at the canvas with a range of toolssticksbrushes basters and paint cans with holesthe effects of which he hadmastered There is chance in his paintings but it occurs within a welldefinedstructure            How did Pollock arrive sosuddenly I think what happened is that he threw off the heavy influence ofothers and stopped worrying about his lack of conventional technique Insteadhe began to express himself in the way he could basing his craft on hisabilities The year  yields a bounty of expressive work such as thegorgeous  which has the quality of a musical nocturne its orange yellowblack and white filigrees spun on a thin surface of silver and unprimedcanvas In Full Fathom Five the murk grows more evocative theenticing detail is a kind of small crossbow shape in yellow and orangeglimpsed through the submarine tangle of a surface encrusted with nailsbuttons coins and cigarette butts In these paintings the feelingsmirthecstasy confusion awe whateverseem intense and distinct            It stays that way over thenext few years as Pollocks scale expands toward the vast masterworks of The three greatest of his monumental canvases hung together in a single roomhave an almost overwhelming presence Curiously these paintings dont repayprolonged viewingor at least they didnt for me One follows the arcs andarabesques across the canvas but they dont lead the eye anywhere When youtry not to follow lines you find you cant get any purchase on the whole Thisis the opposite of the experience you have looking at a Mark Rothko You soakin a Rothko as in a warm tub Its a meditative spiritual experience Pollockby comparison is a splash of cold water on the face The power lies in beingconfronted by his paintings not in looking for meaning in them            For some reason I wasntmuch moved by the old One Number    But  a  foot longmonochrome work on loan from Dsseldorf Germany took my breath away This isthe distilled essence of Pollocks genius a mysterious calligraphy stripped ofthe distraction of color or the accretion of layers of paint In theextraordinary photographs and films Namuth made of Pollock working in  youcan be mesmerized by his act of creation The agonized expression on his facelooks like a kind of rapture His dance around the canvas looks like its ownhidden language            What follows the incrediblespree of productivity that lasted from  is a kind of brownout In thefinal two rooms of the exhibition you see Pollock who was suffering fromdepression and had relapsed into alcoholism struggling to regain a gift thathad vanished as swiftly as it had arrived By  he was pretty much washed upHis career took the shape of a palindrome looks like Untitled Easter and the Totem collapses back to TotemLesson   Here Pollocks camouflage palette as Varnedoe notesgives way to carnival The only really arresting work he did after  is With its electric brightness this huge painting which Pollocks friendsstarted for him is stunning but sad a big smile for the camera and perhaps akind of requiem for his earlier work In his final painting Search Pollock seems to have drifted back even further to the period beforehis talent began to emerge In his final year he binged painted nothing anddrove his car into a tree            You can explain this flameoutwith whatever theory appeals to you In clinical terms Pollock had aproductive manic phase and he was overtaken by black dog in the days beforeantidepressants In art historical terms he flattened the picture planeemptied it and then had nowhere to go You can view him as the classic case ofthe doomed artist his genius and selfdestruction bound up together My ownadmittedly romantic preference is to see his career as a quest for inspirationand to say Pollock sought it long found it briefly and couldnt live withoutit
