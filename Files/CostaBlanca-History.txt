A Brief HistoryNothing has had a greater impact on the Costa Blanca than foreign invasion Iberians Phoenicians Greeks Romans Visigoths and Moors had moulded Spains Mediterranean shores centuries before international tourism gained a foothold But before any of these were the Costa Blancas first inhabitants Known as Neanderthal men they lived primitively and spent a large part of their time hunting Then as the Stone Age came to an end short darkskinned Iberians started to make their way from North Africa to the Spanish Peninsula These fierce fighters skilled in guerrilla warfare roamed the Mediterranean foothills painting a vivid record of their battles on the walls of their rock sheltersThe Celts began to flood into Spain from the north sometime after  bc They settled in the north and west of the country never penetrating as far as the Costa Blanca In central Spain they were slowly absorbed by the reluctant Iberians but elsewhere both tribes kept fiercely apart establishing from the first the renowned independence that still characterizes Spains provincesEarly TradersThe Phoenicians ventured across the Mediterranean from presentday Lebanon reaching Spain by about  bc They founded many trading settlements in the remote or hidden land they named Span or Spania The Costa Blanca was soon dotted with such Phoenician towns as Elche and JtivaAfter about  bc Greek traders arrived on the coast to compete for Spains rich mineral deposits and fertile land The influence of Greece was shortlived although the olive and the grape Greek legacies are cultivated in the regionThe Carthaginians a people related to the Phoenicians came from North Africa and subsequently took over much of southern Spain beginning with Cdiz in  bc The town had sought help from the Carthaginian army in its war against local tribes and the invited guest decided to stay The main centre of Carthaginian power in Spain was located on the Costa Blanca Carthago Nova now Cartagena followed in prominence by AlicanteCarthage challenged by Rome in the First Punic War  bc lost most of her neglected holdings in Spain through Iberian attacks But Carthages luck changed with an initial victory in the Second Punic War  bc Hannibal the Carthaginian general led one of historys greatest military marches the length of the Costa Blanca to France and Italy crossing the Pyrenees and the Alps in the hope of surprising an unsuspecting Rome The Romans riposted by invading Spain to cut off Hannibals supply route and staying there  yearsUnder Roman RuleIt took the Romans almost  years to subdue the Iberian tribes Outpost duty was decidedly unpopular with the legionnaires but the Roman army finally prevailedTheres no doubt that the Roman presence in Spain had a great influence on the country bringing the gifts of engineering and architecture Stability and unity were promoted by the introduction of Latin from which modern Spanish developed Roman law still the basis of Spains legal system and eventually ChristianityBut the Roman empire overstretched and increasingly corrupt began to crumble The Romans withdrew from Spain leaving the country to be overrun by various barbarian tribes especially the Vandals These tribes were eventually subdued by the Visigoths who controlled much of southern Spain for some  years But they did not integrate nor did they learn the lessons of history in a palace intrigue one faction invited the Moors into the country as their alliesMoorish DominationIn ad  the Arab chief Tariq landed at Gibraltar with  Berber troops Thus began an year epoch of Christian opposition to the newly arrived Muslims The Moorsthe name commonly given to all Muslims in Spaincarried all before them Within ten years their greencrescent standard flew over most of Spain Kartajanah Mursiyah and Xativa are still known by their Moorish namesThe Moors were relatively tolerant rulers who taxed nonbelievers rather than trying to convert them They introduced the manufacture of paper which is carried on today in Jtiva They laid out a system of irrigation still in use in the Guadalest Valley and filled the huertas orchards of the Costa Blanca with oranges peaches and pomegranates Rice cotton and sugar cane were also first cultivated on Spanish soil by the MoorsNumerous Moorish fortifications on the Costa Blanca survive to this day and the pottery of the region still reflects the influence of Moorish craftsmen Learning was considerably advanced by the Moors and a medical treatise written by an Arab physician in Crevillente is recognized today as revolutionary for its timeThe Tide TurnsBut like the Visigoths the Moors ignored history Feeling the rising strength of Christianity and weakened by constant fighting among themselves they sought outside help from the Almohades These fanatical Berber warriors from presentday Morocco quickly reduced Moorish Spain to a province of their North African empire endowing it with enough strength to resist the Christian forces a while longerFortunes swayed to and fro for centuries but it was not until  at Las Navas de Tolosa in northern Spain that the Christians gained their first decisive victory The Christian provinces gradually captured and annexed former bastions of Moorish rule Ferdinand III conquered Murcia for Castile in  Denia and Jtiva fell to James the Conqueror of Aragon in  though it was not until  that he secured Cartagena The Moors were on the retreat withdrawing to the almost impregnable mountain fortress area of Granada where they held out until The Golden AgeSpains golden century began under the Catholic Monarchs a title conferred by Pope Alexander VI on Ferdinand II and Isabella who united the country under the Christian kingdoms of Aragon and Castile after the fall of Granada in  That same eventful year Columbus seeking a western route to the East on behalf of the Catholic Monarchs arrived in the Americas And Ferdinand and Isabella consolidated Christian rule by decreeing that all Jewsthe banking and business expertsmust adopt Catholicism or be exiled The Moorsthe source of cheap labour and vital agricultural knowhowwere given the same alternative in The Segura Valley was the last part of Spain to be inhabited by Muslims who abandoned their fortresses there in  As the Inquisition established its reign of terror to stamp out heresy converted Jews conversos and Muslims moriscos were looked upon with suspicion and many left the country or were condemned to death Agricultural productivity was to suffer considerably after the official expulsion of the moriscos in The conquest of the New World brought Spain fame and immense wealth especially under Charles I and Philip II but much was squandered and wasted slowly the decline set in In  the immensely powerful but badly led Armada set out to invade England only to be beaten by Drake and a providential storm Another important defeat took place at Rocroi in Flanders in  when Spanish troops never to regain their former glory were routed by the FrenchFrench AscendancySpanish internal affairs became the concern of other great powers after Charles II died in  without heirs The Archduke Charles of Austria rivalled Frances Philip of Bourbon designated to ascend the throne in the ensuing War of the Spanish Succession On the Costa Blanca Murcia was defended from the invasion of Archduke Charles by its bishop with the help of local people Jtiva fought the succession of Philip so fiercely that when resistance was finally overcome in  the towns name was changed to San Felipethe former name was not to be restored until the th century Philip finally gained the Spanish throne under the terms of the Treaty of Utrecht in Nearly a hundred years later during the Napoleonic wars Spanish ships fought alongside the French fleet against Lord Nelson at Cape Trafalgar southeast of Cdiz But as the wars continued Napoleon distrustful of his ally forced the Spanish king to abdicate in  and imposed his brother Joseph as king of Spain He sent thousands of troops across the Pyrenees to subdue the Spaniards who then revolted Aided by British troops they drove the French out of the Iberian peninsula Denia held by the enemy was blockaded for eight months in  What the world knows as the Peninsular War  is referred to in Spain as the War of Independence and the countrys first though shortlived constitution was drafted during this periodFrom Decline to ChaosHopes of setting up a constitutional monarchy were quickly dashed and Spain was plunged into a century of power struggles at home Overseas her American colonies revolted and gained independence Soon there was little left of the once great Spanish empire and an attempt in  to form a republic failed In  Alfonso XIII became king at the age of  His reign was a difficult time for Spain prosperity and stability eluded the country which remained neutral during World War IIn  assailed by economic problems and with catastrophe imminent the king accepted a general Miguel Primo de Rivera as dictator Six years later the opposition of radical forces resulted in Primo de Riveras fall Neither reform nor the maintenance of order seemed possible In  the king himself went into exile following antiroyalist election results and another republic was foundedParliamentary democracy was impeded by the ideological commitment of various political factions and compromise was rare There was a succession of rightwing attempts to govern and Spain floundered in a sea of political strikes and violence Then the Left won the  elections and was immediately in violent collision with the RightIn July  a large section of the army under General Francisco Franco rose in revolt against the government On Francos side were monarchists conservatives the Church and the rightwing Falangists Against him was a collection of republicans liberals socialists communists and anarchists The ensuing Civil War became one of the great crusades of the th century Germany and Italy supplied Francos Nationalists with arms and air power and the Soviet Union gave aid to Spains communistsTo many people in Europe often unaware of or indifferent to the particular Spanish origins of the struggle the Civil War was seen as a crucial conflict between democracy and dictatorship or from the other side as one of law and order against social revolution and chaos The bloodshed lasted for three years and cost hundreds of thousands of livesEven after the war the hardship continued But despite pressure from Hitler Franco Spains new caudillo leader managed to keep his exhausted country out of World War IIModern TimesDuring the years of postwar reconstruction Franco encouraged tourism on a grand scale as a way to bring currency into the country Profoundly affecting the economy and the people this transformed Spains most attractive coasts though not always for the betterWhen the caudillo died in  Prince Juan Carlos the grandson of the Bourbon King Alfonso XIII succeeded to the Spanish throne The new king firmly led the way from totalitarianism to democracy A new constitution granted wideranging powers to the regions In  Spain entered the European Community ending decades of isolation While membership brought muchneeded funds into the country troubles like inflation unemployment crime and pollution led to the Conservative Partys defeat of the Socialist Party in the  elections after  years of dominance
