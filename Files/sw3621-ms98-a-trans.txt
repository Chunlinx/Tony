        gonna go first     no go ahead  you called   all right um right now im a college right now im a college student as a matter of fact so im pretty fresh with it i just think a lot of it depends on a variety of thing it depends on for me it was a combination of finance   uhhuh   um being in a place where i would enjoy the atmosphere and where id feel comfortable as well as just the general type of education that the school gives   yeah well i i dont know i think it depends a lot on um well all those things decided thats true but i had got my daughter into college last year and it was really a major decision   uhhuh   but there were just so many things to consider and i dont really think we even considered all of the things we should have   umhum   uh so shes out in California   oh is she   yeah but what we didnt consider was coming back and forth and things like that you know  yeah really so thats kind of   yeah exactly yeah   that was kind of hard so i dont know i think its always confusing its hard to make a choice   oh absolutely i think you know like you said a lot of it there a lot things for example i go to school out in Utah and my family lives here in Texas and so its kind of like you said uh i never realized what an expense it would be trying to come home and   uhhuh it really is and you dont get to come home as much as you think you will   no i maybe have been home oh twice in the last two years for Christmas   yeah yeah yeah so its really hard to do that   yeah it is and i think to theres theres a lot of times like you said thats one of the major considerations is you know how much do you want to be with your family or how much do you wanna and thats something that i didnt think about until  i was already out there   and i dont think you even know that answer until you go either   yeah exactly   you know everybodys anxious to get going and get away and go do their thing but then they really want to come home and they cant always   uhhuh yeah yep thats for sure   so thats kind of hard too but   you learn to appreciate what you had   yeah thats true isnt it  yeah it is i know   it is  so what other points did you guys look at when you were trying to find her school   well the size of the school because we live in Plano so the schools are really big here very crowded so she didnt want a school that was really too big   uhhuh right uhhuh   and we looked at that and i dont know that thats really relevant because youre gonna end up with your little group anyway   yeah   so im not sure that it makes too much of a difference although we did find that like down in Texas um at UT you know down in Austin   uhhuh   that those classes are so full like you can have two hundred kids in a class   yeah and see i think that makes a huge difference where i   so that would be horrible you know   it is where im going my freshman year i didnt have a single class with less than nine hundred students   thats horrible oh my gosh   yeah and it was it was frustrating youd see a TA once a week and even the TAs rarely knew who you were so   yeah   it became a thing like you said where youre where youre competing either to you know to get someones attention to get help or you just kind of if youre not self motivated where im going its really hard to   wherere you going   um to Brigham Young University   and its that crowded is it really   um in the freshman classes that are you have theres  about twenty four thousand students   oh   and so its kind of  its a lot of fun when you get in the upper level upper level classes its a lot easier but   yeah yeah wow gosh   and thats something that i hadnt considered because i was i was raised in Plano as well and i went to Plano East and i never you know theres lots of students but there wasnt that many you know thirty or thirty five in a class i didnt mind   yeah where are you in college now   im a junior   junior yeah   umhum   my daughter went to Plano East too she twirled   oh did she oh cool   yeah but she was the only twirler theyve ever had  so but thats what shes doing out in California thats why shes out there     great   because we had to consider where a good spot was too and   yeah and that should you know i think a lot of it depends on like you said i think for me what i wanted to get out of the college experience had a lot to do with it it wasnt it was a combination of academics as well as other things so   yeah yeah well but a lot of times kids arent sure what they want to be like she started out with sports psychology so we looked all over that was a hard thing to find   uhhuh right   and then she changed her mind anyway and i think most most people do that i think these days you know yeah see and they say that thats average   yeah uh i have three or four times yeah   because thats very common so maybe thats not such a great reason to look at a school i dont know   yes i think for me personally when i was choosing i was looking more the overall experience instead of just   yeah   you know but the specific field that i was looking into at that time so   yeah well she was too when you live in Plano you know you sort of have everything you really spoiled everybody here at school we all are all our kids are you know to be honest and we went out to USC because they wanted her to twirl for them   yep   uhhuh   and she was terrified she was just terrified of living in LA   uhhuh   she was too scared to go there so i guess you have to look at that too   yeah   and i understood it at the time when we went to the campus and visited i thought oh gosh it would just
