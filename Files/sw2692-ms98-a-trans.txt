        are you a TIer   uh yeah i am yeah yeah ive been uh   oh good yeah uh she had a hard time getting a few folks uh i thought well every all these TIers have gone home uh at one oclock on Friday   i uh it is Friday yeah thats for sure well uh i guess im trying to think the last thing i did to a car     i i i do it a lot i have i kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid   oh wow okay   uh so and my father and brother were in it and and my brothers still in it and i had periods when i didnt do anything but in the last ten years ive uh my car doesnt go to a shop you know it it i just do it all do i uh theres hardly anything that other than putting tires on that ill do i did take it to a transmission place to put in a new transmission but i change the oil and transmission and   uhhuh yeah sure   uh uh i just essentially do it all i dont know uh uh if theres anything specific in fact i could advise people uh i happen to be a M E besides but i do it for fun really and to save money and i guess thats diversion uh   uhhuh right right   i ive ive tried a few groups uh you know where you i can recommend it for people to take their cars Like i think Sears is probably the best place because ive heard when i used to go there   yeah yeah   and when i i just overheard what they did for me very little because i didnt take it that much but what i heard them tell other people was always right   right   you know when i sat there i you know i dropped my car off for tires or something like that   right   and so i respect they seem to actually have mechanics there   yeah yeah   i was pretty impressed with Western Auto but they didnt do a great job of changing my transmission uh oil last time and when when i did it the next time i realized the filter was loose and everything and i didnt like it So im just doing it all myself i i   really yeah thats thats the aggravating thing yeah i i try to do as much as i can i uh i grew up on farm so ive got that uh you know take care of yourself attitude and uh oh ive done   you had to do it yeah right   ive done various things ive got an ive got an eighty three T Bird and ive ive changed out uh heater core and uh oh timing belts and things like that um   oh uhhuh   um i guess the last thing i took to anybody to have done was on my wifes car um when we went in for inspection it didnt it didnt quite pass so we had to have uh thats uh thats a Mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out to get to it and uh   oh yeah well you like Fords apparently huh   yeah yeah ive uh im kind of stuck on them right now i guess but  you know thats its partially because i can work on them thats uh thats thats thats a big part of my decision but uh yeah we ran into some problems with uh   yeah   having them to work on that carburetor i mean they get they got everything tuned up right you know but they we got i got it home and uh and they had left the uh oil filter uh cap off and it was rubbing on a belt and it rubbed a notch in that little little things like that that really start to aggravate you that thats a lot of the reason i do my own stuff   really my goodness yeah i wonder always wonder when you have little things like that happen why even here at TI why we dont inspect im in facilities why we dont inspect areas and and guarantee it so to speak uh   umhum   we always fix things and  put things in and walk away we there needs to be a time of inspection and check out and and some thing like that with a car there ought to be someone there that inspects it before its turned there ought to be an inspector inspector or quality insurance guy after after an oil change you know just in case uh they didnt put the oil in or whatever i i always wonder about that when when someone does repairs or little things like that uh   sure sure thats right sure yeah any anything that gets that thats in uh gets to be an an assembly line type operation youre youre always risking that if theres too many people that get their hands on one little project you know that things theyre you get you you miss that overlap sometimes and and they miss things yeah ive ive had a hard time   yeah   finding anybody i can trust like like you say it my old transmissions things like that im obviously im not going to im not going to tear apart a automatic transmission try rebuild it   no no i dont either i dont either yeah   but uh it its its real stressful to try to find anybody that i thinks going to do me right and and uh you know have an idea of whats going on   yeah you need to really uh i i do uh a lot of the simple things i i think i do most of the things better than the average person you you have Fords and i i uh i have three Chevys which   uhhuh okay   i worked my way into having the same engine i dont know how long im i like a V and im im sold sold on small block Chevy Vs and i i bought one car new and i almost accidentally   yeah oh yeah yeah   got the next car although i was kind of looking for it when i got a used a used car with the same engine   uhhuh   well then the next the truck i got next i definitely looked for the same engine so i buy filters you know three or four at a time and essentially the engines are different you the cars are different years but the same Chevy V   sure sure uhhuh   and the part the carburetors is the same almost everything is the same the the course is two are eighties and one eighty six you know so you can learn a lot that way i theres no way i could i could fix every car in the world you know   uhhuh well yeah that that the biggest you know thats the three biggest things to me you know i i number one youve got to have the tools around if you dont have the the special tools or   yeah   well any more the the testers that you know  i i dont have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting in my garage you know so obviously if it starts   yeah right   my car start missing or something like that that its almost impossible to track that down any more without a diagnostics but at the tools and the space to do it that that can be a big problem if its if its under carriage or something like that but   yeah   then its experience you know you can you can look through a a Chiltons book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it but you better figure on multiplying that time out about by at least by five or so   yeah   just just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart   yeah   that was that was the biggest thing when i did uh the heater core in my T Bird that is got to be the worst location for it and and the only reason i did it i   yeah i think theyre all bad really theyre   yeah yeah the the only ones ive ever heard good good things about are are the old Lincolns and Cadillacs where they had the little door underneath the hood You just open the door and pop it out yeah but but uh   uhhuh is that right   i i had i had taken this in to have it done originally and uh   yeah what did they want to charge you for it   oh it it was it was tremendous well it was about seven hours labor so it it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so   yeah yeah   and they looked it over and they they they thought they could patch it up a little bit you know and what not so they   this is your little water uh heater in there for the uh the heat inside   yeah yeah yeah and it was it was leaking inside the car in the condenser unit so uh they they did a little patch on it   yeah   and it last it held for about four to six months and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself and it its a matter tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff but hey it was not   yeah   uh it was not a seven hour labor job for me it was about a week before i finally through   yeah did you get it inside or outside i i took one off my little Buick i had and i pretty much took it loose on the inside but it came out from the you know underneath the hood it came from yeah   yeah oh really no this this was the only thing that sticks in inside the engine compartment on this are the two uh hose fittings   maybe youre right maybe youre right i its been a long time since i took one out   yeah it its i ive never heard a good story about uh   course i broke mine you know so im always very careful when i change hoses on it i dont know whether you did yours   yeah   not to really pull on those i when i take those hoses i cut them off   right okay   very gingerly because if you you know pull on that and ive always done that as a kid you know just yanked on it and they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time   yeah uhhuh sure   but i broke one on my on my Buick and i always remembered it was my own fault and i thought well im going to to going to carefully take those hoses off   you bet well that thats what ended up being the real problem on this was the uh it the the pipe wasnt busted but the it wasnt soldered in good enough and it had it had broken loose enough to where   oh really yeah   if it got hot   It it spread out yeah   and and not just normal driving didnt do it but if if if it was an especially hot day the pressure would get high enough and it would start blowing the water out inside   yeah yeah   it was real aggravating but uh i i couldnt even even a weeks a weeks time is is worth a whole lot less than four than four hundred dollars to me you know than to have somebody else do it   yeah sometimes if youre a tinkerer you luck out My wifes   uhhuh   uh Chevy uh it was a Caprice air conditioning stopped i i just heard it i realized that the air conditioning wasnt cutting in   uhhuh   and i went out there for five minutes and i just pushed on the wires And sure enough just pure dumb luck that the connection over by its not the evaporator the big filter on one side   uhhuh   i just pushed that in and i heard it click   yeah   and so sometimes you have dumb luck i i was you know you could have taken something like that and thought well the compressors not working or it would have taken me all day probably if i didnt do that but sometimes you have some dumb luck If you have a little curiosity   right thats true   and you have enough knowledge to check things out i know i feel bad for people who just when anything goes wrong a fuse you know they just have to take it And i know thats tough if you dont uh at least give it a shot ive got girls daughters and   uhhuh   ive always said id teach them And my my one daughter was fairly interested And i really havent gotten around to i learned because i i just uh learned you know and i feel bad about not at least showing them some of the things And im going to do that i i told my daughters in college this year   yeah   i said This summer were definitely going to spend a little more time on the car i said so you can learn the basics you know   well yeah and and and not only from a from an economic standpoint just just pure safety you know if you can if she can get yourself out of a bad situation   yeah   without having to to go to a phone booth and stand around and wait it it it can it can save a lot of time and trouble   right i have the theres one expression i dont like uh the country expression you know if it aint if it aint broke dont fix it
