                                 Speech and Spillover                           The Supreme Courtprobably will overturn the notorious Communications Decency Act But the issuesare not as cutanddried as some might suggest                                       By EugeneVolokh                                        words postedThursday July  to be composted Thursday July                         One of the great recurringproblems in freespeech law is spillover Free speech the Supreme Court hasheld has limits Some speech is so harmful and so lacking in redeeming valuethat it may be restricted Threats blackmail and false advertising areobvious examples Theres no right to say Your money or your life to astranger in a dark alley theres no right to spread intentional falsehoodsabout your product or your enemys character            The Supreme Court likewisehas held rightly or wrongly that minors have no right to see very sexuallyexplicit material and that people except perhaps the minors parents haveno right to distribute such material to them Psychologists and philosopherscan debate this but as a constitutional matter the question is settled            Butits often impossible to keep such materials from children without also denyingthem to adults Bookstores can check customers ages but TV broadcastersmuralists or people who post things on the Internet cant The law can allowpublic display of this material protecting adults access but also making itavailable to children or the law can prohibit public display insulatingchildren but also restricting adults Either way theres spillover Either therestriction spills over onto speech that should be free or the freedom spillsover onto speech that in the judgment of most legislators voters and judgesshould be restricted            This spillover problem is a recurring question in FirstAmendment law The law cannot restrict all harmful valueless speech and at thesame time protect all valuable speech A classic illustration of the spilloverproblem is the Communications Decency Act passed earlier this year in anattempt to stop indecency on the Internet A threejudge federal court wasprobably correct in striking down the CDA June  But the judges opinionsdont squarely face the spillover problem Perhapscontrary to the suggestionsof some Supreme Court casesspillover questions should always be resolved infavor of free speech Perhaps childrens increased vulnerability is a priceworth paying for extra freedom for adults But its important to confronthonestly both whats being lost and gained in the process            The most controversialpart of the CDA prohibits anyone from            usingan interactive computer service            todisplay in a manner available to a person under  years of age            anycomment request suggestion proposal image or other communication            that incontext depicts or describes            in termspatently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards            sexual or excretoryactivities or organs            Virtually any sort of speech in the public areas ofcyberspace is available to minors so the law really applies to all such areasincluding Web sites Internet newsgroups email discussion lists chat roomsand bulletin boards            Andpatently offensive can cover a lot of territory Many profanities might beconsidered patently offensive descriptions of sexual or excretory activitiesor organs especially under the standards of some conservative communitiesPutting a David Mamet play on your Web site thus might be a crime The termpatently offensive is vague enough that no one knows for sure but the wiseuser will take a conservative approach Given some recent Supreme Courtdecisions it seems unlikely that the vagueness alone would make the actunconstitutional But theres no doubt that the laws vagueness does indeedmake it more likely to stifle someones freedom of expression            The CDA though ostensibly intended to protect childrenclearly has a spillover effect on adults Adults generally have the right tosee material thats patently offensive There are two exceptions to thischild pornography sexually explicit pictures made using child models andobscenitybut both are much smaller categories than the CDAs indecencyMay the government in its quest to shield children restrict the onlinechoices of grownups Or to look at it the other way Must the courts in orderto protect the freedom of grownups restrict the governments ability to shieldchildren            TheSupreme Court precedents are unclear In a  case called Butler vsMichigan  a state law barred distribution of material that might beunsuitable for minors The court concluded that such a ban wasunconstitutional The law it said reduced the adult population of Michiganto reading only what is fit for children  Surely this is to burn the houseto roast the pig The court agreed that the state could bar distribution ofsuch stuff directly to children But clearly such limited restrictions dontwork as well as a total ban The court apparently was willing to tolerate someperceived harm to children in order to protect the freedom of adults            But in some recent cases the court has taken a differentapproach One such case is the oftcriticized FCC vs PacificaFoundation  The Pacifica court upheld a ban onindecencyGeorge Carlins Seven Dirty Words monologueon radio andtelevision broadcasts when there is a reasonable risk that children may be inthe audience The spillover was clear Adults were deprived of access tocertain materials on certain media radio and television during most hoursBut the justices were willing to allow such a restriction of adults access tospeech in order to shield children                           Pacifica is a narrow decision and theres language in it suggestingthat it only applies to overtheair broadcasting But in this years cableindecency case known as Denver Consortium  four Supreme Court justiceswere willing to use Pacifica as a guide for cable television as well asovertheair broadcasting The CDA courts decision was written beforeDenver Consortium was handed down And during the last  years somelower courts have upheld bans on public display of sexually explicit materialthats not technically obscene on the grounds that the law may shieldchildren even if this keeps say a wouldbe muralist from communicating toadults The Supreme Court hasnt spoken on these specific statutes            Another important though somewhat ambiguous precedent isSable Communications vs FCC  in which the court struck down aban on dialaporn The government argued the ban was needed to protectchildren But the court pointed out that there might be less restrictivealternatives that would insulate children without entirely banning the mediumFor example the court said the government could require services to takecreditcard numbers or require phone companies to let parents blockareacode phone calls            Still the court waswilling to tolerate some spillover after all even the alternatives itsuggested would deny access to some adults And it also hinted that it mighteven allow a total ban if such alternatives could be shown to be inadequateDenver Consortium followed the same pattern It struck down arestriction on indecent speech because there were other effective alternativesavailable but it suggested that such a restriction might be constitutional ifit were in fact the only effective way to shield children                           Sable and Denver Consortium make clear that the court wonttolerate unnecessary spillover onto adults But on the toughquestionwhat happens if its impossible to shield minors without burdeningadultstheres an unresolved tension Butler says that the speech mustbe allowed Pacifica  Sable  and now Denver Consortiumsuggest that the speech may be restricted            On the Internet is it possible to shield children withoutrestricting adults Parents can get softwareSurfWatch is one popularbrandthat keeps their computers from accessing any place thats on a list ofdirty locations a list selected and frequently updated by the softwaredesigners If the government wanted to it could buy SurfWatch for a fractionof what it would cost to enforce the CDA and give it away to parents Couldthis be the less restrictive alternative that the government could useinstead of CDAs total ban Well it depends on how much shielding of childrenyoure willing to sacrifice The SurfWatch solution is limited by the softwaredesigners ability to keep up with the latest dirty places Dozens of Websites are being added daily and you never know what will get posted tomorroweven on existing sites or newsgroups Some things will inevitably bemissed            The purely technologicalfix then is less restrictive than the CDA but its also less effective TheCDA of course wont be perfect eithermany will flout it and Web sites inother countries wont be bound by itbut the ban plus the technologicalfix probably will shield children better than the technological fix alone Doesthis extra protection justify the considerable spillover The precedents dontanswer this            Theresa hybrid technological and legal approach that might be more effective andthus more likely to be the sort of less restrictive alternative that wouldmake the total ban invalid The law might demand that online material beratedthat any sufficiently sexually explicit text or image be marked dirtyin a way that computers can easily recognize Parents could then set up theirchildrens computers to block access to these pages Alternatively thesoftware could assume that any page is dirty unless its labeled clean withthe law making it illegal to falsely mark clean a page thats actuallydirty            Many people of course might misrate theirmaterialintentionally or accidentally But the CDA will be intentionally oraccidentally violated too In fact a rating requirement might be moreeffective than a total ban People may be more willing to comply with therating law since it would let them continue selling their wares or expressingtheir views Still ratings wont shield children using computers that donthave the rating software turned on And no one knows how often this willhappen            The CDA is now in thehands of the Supreme Court Some say the justices should simply rule thatsexually explicit material isnt as dangerous for children as its cracked upto be and therefore free speech should prevail But many people probablyincluding the justices are willing to accept that sexually explicit materialis indeed harmful to children Other CDA critics assert that the technologicalalternatives will shield children every bit as well as a total ban would andthat the CDA therefore is entirely unnecessary But that too will behard to prove            Ultimately then thejustices will have to make a hard choice sacrifice some shielding of childrenin order to protect the freedom of grownups or sacrifice some access bygrownups in order to shield children My guess is that the marginal benefit ofthe CDA over the technological alternatives is small enough and the burdenthat the law creates is large enough that the CDA will be overturned But itsa closer question than many might think
