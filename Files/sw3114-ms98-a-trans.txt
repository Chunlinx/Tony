        okay were on   okay well i just on on gun control i just always felt like that i think i dont think it hurts for anybody to wait for a week or two before they get a gun if somebody goes in to buy one so that they can check that person out um i dont believe that most of the criminal acts that are done are done by guns that are bought in a gun shop though i believe its probably bought across the market and i dont think gun control is gonna have any control over that at all   so uh youre youre for no restrictions or   uh uh sort of a a little bit of restriction maybe i might say        if a criminal if a criminal should go happen to go into a gun store i dont think it would hurt anybody to wait a week   uhhuh   to go back and pick up that gun so that they can check them out   yeah right   and if it is somebody like that then no but i really think that most of the criminals in our city who have guns do not go into a gun store and buy them i think they get them from other means   i what kind what what kind of means would those be   oh i dont know like from each other you know uh   uhhuh in other words youre saying that it would be hard uh to get rid of all of the guns      i think so   well doesnt it doesnt doesnt London have a ban on firearms England   jeez now i dont know   yeah dont they carry dont their policemen over there carry these billy clubs   thats right nobody over there carries guns   yeah   i dont know if we could get away with guns completely i guess   well it would be nice uh uh to be able to take your family out uh especially when theyre dependent on you and not worry about uh having to have a gun just to protect yourself and them   thats right i agree with that i agree with that i we do not own one um and i dont intend to buy one and im not a hunter i guess those people feel a little bit different but i dont believe in hunting either so  you know   well i have a couple of guns and uh one i always worry about somebody getting ahold of it that that you know wont know how to handle it   right   and uh probably never will do me any good because the bullets in one place and the firearms in another   uhhuh   and i carry one in the pickup uh and i worry about it being stolen and uh of course im like you i dont like to kill things   no i dont either  well it is terrible when you have to ride down the street and think somebody could just shoot at you for nothing which has been in the news a lot lately you know no apparent reason   so    oh yeah and and theres a lot the crazies are out there in numbers   right right   well you know i would love to see a ban uh on firearms and id have to rate myself as a number one however i worry that that the that the country could ever get to that point   hm   and then i worry about uh the fact that uh what if there was some sort of insurrection in this country in this country   yeah   then uh how would we as citizens uh band together and ever put down an uprising if there were no firearms   uprising you think we could ever get to that point where there would be no firearms   i dont think we ever will   i dont either thats the problem not in this country   yeah so somewhere somewhere along the line then uh you know there has to be a happy medium and uh i know the the uh oh whats the organization that uh   right   that the rifle association   oh yes   the gun the uh the gun association is is heavily for no bans whatsoever   yeah well i think we ought to have some   yeah well i think so too so id have to vote for uh uh maybe a five in uh and hopefully uh we could put some sort of restriction on the handling of firearms   right i could go for that   like like you suggested   yeah i think that would i think thats the only way   okay Betty well sounds good enough to me then   well ive enjoyed talking to you   well same here and uh one of these days that names gonna come back to me      oh me me too okay byebye   okay sweetheart byebye
