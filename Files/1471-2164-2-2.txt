                    Background        During the last five years the genomes of four diverse        eukaryotic organisms have been completely sequenced These        include         Saccharomyces cerevisiae   a        unicellular eukaryote two multicellular organisms         Caenorhabditis elegans   and         Drosophila melanogaster   and         Arabidopsis thaliana the first plant        genome to be completed   The sequencing of these major        groups of organisms allows comparative analysis of genes        gene families and genomes across phylogenetically        divergent organisms        A study of predicted gene families in various organisms        from singlecell to more complex animal and plant species        is of value in deducing functions of proteins and        developmental control pathways Comparison of family        members to proteins in its own genome and the genomes of        other organisms can lead to further characterization of the        proteins and provide clues to their function With the        information gained from these analyses experimental        procedures could be designed to determine the functions of        the proteins Budding yeast has  conventional protein        kinase genes   Using multiple alignment and parsimony        analysis of protein kinase catalytic domain sequences the        yeast protein kinases were categorized into subfamilies        based on structural relatedness This information led to        identification of yeast specific kinases and gave hints        about the function of unknown kinases An analysis of        proteins containing zinc finger domains in bacteria yeast        and         C elegans revealed that bacteria do        contain some proteins that bind zinc but lack large        families of zincbinding proteins found in eukaryotes          Between eukaryotes the presence and size of the different        zincbinding families vary   In a comparative analysis        of the genomes of         Drosophila C elegans and         S cerevisiae the number of proteins        for each of the  most frequently occurring protein        domains was identified for each organism   Among these        domains were various calciumbinding domains such as the        EFhand family In         Drosophila there are  proteins        with this domain while in         C elegans there are  and only         in yeast A BLASTP and TBLASTN search of the         Drosophila genome with members of the        cytoskeleton protein families identified  genes with        moderate to completely convincing homology to cytoskeletal        genes   New members of the families were discovered and        some proteins that are present in other genomes were        missing in the         Drosophila genome        Kinesins constitute a superfamily of microtubule MT        motor proteins found in all eukaryotic organisms Members        of the kinesin superfamily have a highly conserved motor        domain The first kinesin was identified in squid giant        axons as a protein involved in transport of vesicles           The conventional kinesin is a tetramer with two heavy        chains and two light chains The kinesin heavy chains        KHCs contain the motor domain with ATPase activity a        central coiledcoil region and a tail that binds the light        chains Historically proteins with homology to KHCs but        falling in different subfamilies have been called        kinesinlike proteins However KHCs are now recognized as        a subfamily of the kinesin superfamily and all members of        the superfamily are referred to as kinesins We have        followed that pattern in this paper KHCs have been        identified in fungi and animals and a large number of other        kinesins from other subfamilies have been identified in all        eukaryotes     All kinesins have a domain with        homology to the motor domain of KHC but little sequence        similarity outside of this domain Some kinesins have a        coiledcoil region but others do not The tail domain        which is believed to interact with specific cargoes is        nonconserved Kinesin bind MTs and a variety of cargoes and        perform forcegenerating tasks such as transport of        vesicles and organelles spindle formation and elongation        chromosome segregation and MT organization                  The motor domain of KHC is in the        Nterminal region but in other kinesins it can also be        located in the Cterminus or internally Motility assays        have been performed with a number of the kinesins The        Cterminal domain kinesins have been shown to have        minusend motility while the others have plusend motility             Nine subfamilies of kinesins have been        identified by phylogenetic analysis using the conserved        motor domain   Not all kinesins fall into one of the        nine subfamilies and may represent additional        subfamilies        The first two plant kinesins identified were found in        tobacco pollen tube pollen kinesin homologue PKH and        tobacco phragmoplast tobacco kinesin related protein        NtKRP      Another kinesin isolated more        recently from tobacco pollen tubes has also been        characterized at the biochemical level   Kinesins that        have been characterized at the molecular level in plants        include NtKRP in tobacco   four Arabidopsis        kinesins identified by PCRbased cloning KatA KatB KatC        KatD      KCBP kinesinlike calmodulin        binding protein found in Arabidopsis tobacco potato and        maize      PAKRP in Arabidopsis   and        DcKRP and DcKRP in carrot          With the complete sequencing of the Arabidopsis genome        it has become possible to search the Arabidopsis database        with the conserved motor domain of kinesins to identify the        kinesins encoded in the Arabidopsis genome We have        identified  kinesinlike genes in Arabidopsis and their        general location on the five Arabidopsis chromosomes        Surprisingly the Arabidopsis genome contains the largest        number of kinesins among all eukaryote genomes that have        been sequenced We have further analyzed the predicted        protein sequences for the presence of domains that might        lead to an understanding of their function By definition        all have a kinesin motor domain and several have a        coiledcoil domain that might indicate dimerization A        phylogenetic analysis of the  Arabidopsis kinesin motor        domain sequences with  other motor domain sequences has        revealed that there are Arabidopsis kinesins that fall into        seven of the nine recognized subfamilies of kinesins Some        do not fall into any family and there are some subfamilies        unique to Arabidopsis and maybe to plants                    Results and Discussion                  Identification of Arabidopsis kinesins          The recent completion of the Arabidopsis genome has          allowed the analysis of the first plant genome for          kinesins Using the sequence of the conserved motor          domain of kinesins database searches were performed using          BLASTP and TBLASTN at TAIR The Arabidopsis Information          Resource httpwwwarabidopsisorgblast The          sequences obtained from TAIR were compared to the          kinesinlike sequences identified by the Munich          Information Centre for Protein Sequences MIPS Analysis          of both these databases resulted in identification of           unique sequences that contain a kinesin motor domain as          identified by the SMART  wwwsmartemblheidelbergde          program  Table I In our analysis of these databases          we found some discrepancies between the two For example          some kinesins in TAIR are not identified as kinesins in          the MIPS database All  sequences had BLASTP scores          greater than or equal to  and E values equal to or less          than e and the next identified sequence had a score          of only  and an E value of  A TBLASTN search did          not identify any other kinesins nor did searches with a          representative member of each of the subfamilies of          kinesins In comparison           S cerevisiae            S pombe            C elegans and           Drosophila have    and           kinesins respectively Figure A Arabidopsis has the          highest percentage  of the total number of genes          as compared to           S cerevisiae and           S pombe with  and           respectively           C elegans with  and           Drosophila with  See Figure          A          Only six of the  Arabidopsis kinesins have been          reported in the literature   The other  sequences          obtained from the Arabidopsis Database or from MIPS have          been sequenced as part of the Arabidopsis Genome          Sequencing Project The sequences are therefore          predicted sequences that have not been verified by          complete cDNAs The three AtKRP kinesins          AtKRPabc Table I show homology to the          kinesin NtKRP isolated from phragmoplasts of tobacco            AtKRPb has  identity with NtKRP over the           residues they have in common NtKRP has           additional residues The average sequence length of the          Arabidopsis kinesins is just over  residues with the          shortest sequence prediction being  AtFA          amino acids and the longest are  AtMGD and           AtKE Besides the above two sequences no other          predicted sequence is over  amino acids Some of the          intronexon predictions may not be correct which could          reduce or increase the size of predicted proteins in the          databank and so the sizes may change as more          characterization is done for each kinesin A case in          point is the sequence that was isolated by Lee et al            for AtPAKRP which is  amino acids while the          predicted protein has  due to an intron predication          difference The number of known and predicted introns has          a wide range from  in AtFI to  in AtKE           Table I In the Arabidopsis genome the number of          introns ranges from  to  with an average of about five            More than  of Arabidopsis genes have  or less          introns while the Arabidopsis kinesin genes have an          average of  with only  genes having  or less          introns          Three highly conserved regions in all kinesins were          compared to the sequences of the identified Arabidopsis          kinesins We compared the conserved ATP binding site in          kinesins FAYGTGSGKT and two other sequences involved in          interacting with nucleotide phosphates NXXSSRSH and          VDLAGSE    The ATP binding site is highly          conserved in most cases and the divergence in other cases          is like that found in nonplant kinesins The VDLAGSE          sequence was most conserved in the DLAG residues with          very few substitutions in these residues V was often          substituted by I as is also found in nonplant kinesins          Three Arabidopsis kinesins did not have a highly          conserved NXXSSRSH sequence that is completely conserved          in other kinesins The predicted amino acid sequence of          AtMAA has only part of the ATP binding site and          lacks the NXXSSRSH domain However analysis of the          genomic sequence indicates that the genes contain the          coding region for the conserved domains but they are not          present in the deduced sequence due to inaccurate          prediction of introns Isolation of the cDNA for this          clone is needed to determine the correct sequence          Using the Arabidopsis Sequence Map Overview of TAIR          the location of each kinesin was determined Figure           The kinesins are distributed throughout the genome In          four cases pairs of kinesins were sequenced in the same          clone FH FP FK and FH One to  other          predicted proteins in the clones separate the members of          the pairs Interestingly two pairs of clones show          closest homology to a member of the other pair          AtFKAtFH and AtFKAtFH Figure           which suggests that this is a result of gene          duplication Analysis of the total Arabidopsis genome          revealed that a whole genome duplication occurred          followed by subsequent gene loss and extensive local gene          duplications   The duplicated segments represent           of the Arabidopsis genome The           S cerevisiae genome has also had a          complete ancient genome duplication and  of the genes          form duplicate pairs  Duplicated genes account for           of the total genes of           C elegans and           Drosophila                            Phylogenetic analysis          Using ScSMY a highly divergent kinesin   as an          outgroup the motor domain sequences of the           Arabidopsis kinesins and  kinesins from other          organisms were analyzed for phylogenetic relationships          using PAUP   Figures and  In other organisms          nine subfamilies of kinesins have been identified by          phylogenetic analysis using the conserved motor domain            Functional studies with members of three of the          subfamilies KHC KRP and UncKIF indicate          that they are involved in transport   Members from          the other subfamilies Cterminal Kip MKLP BimC          chromokinesinKIF and MCAKKIF have been shown to          function in nuclear movement chromosome segregation          spindle formation and stability and other cytoskeletal          processes associated with cell division   Seven of          the nine families are represented in Arabidopsis          However several Arabidopsis kinesins do not fall into          any of the nine subfamilies and are likely to represent          additional subfamilies that are unique to plants Figure          B and  Most of the Arabidopsis kinesins are more          closely related to another Arabidopsis or another plant          kinesin than to any other kinesin used in the          comparison          A comparison of the five eukaryotic genomes that have          been sequenced shows that not all organisms have all          types of kinesins Figure B The subfamilies that are          involved in transport are underrepresented in          Arabidopsis There are no members of the KRP or          UncKIF subfamilies in Arabidopsis while           Drosophila and           C elegans both have a few members          in each of these families           C elegans does not have a          Kiptype kinesin and yeasts do not have KHC MKLP          chromokinesin or MCAKKIF representatives The          Cterminal and BimC subfamilies are the only ones having          at least one representative in each of the five organisms          Figure B Each organism has ungrouped kinesins          However Arabidopsis has a larger number  out of           than in any of the other sequenced organisms Figure          B          The motor domain in kinesins is located either in the          N terminus C terminus or in the middle of the protein          Members of BimC subfamily which are Nterminal plusend          motors are present in all five eukaryotic organisms that          have been sequenced The three NtKRPlike Arabidopsis          kinesins AtKRPa b and c and AtFL are grouped          with the tobacco homologue in the BimC subfamily which          are involved in crosslinking and antiparallel sliding of          MTs Figure             Twentyone Arabidopsis kinesins fell into the          Cterminal subfamily Figure  This is an unusually          large number compared to the other organisms           C elegans has five and           S pombe has two while           Drosophila and           S cerevisiae have only one Fig           It is also unusual because phylogenetically they          group with other Cterminal proteins but structurally           have internal motors and five have Nterminal motors          The internal kinesins have a motor domain that is closer          to the Cterminus than the Nterminus but each has some          sequence Cterminal to the motor domain and could be          called internal depending on the parameters used to          define an internal motor Kat D AtB and          AtN which have earlier been classified as          Cterminal kinesins   and six other Arabidopsis          kinesins form a subgroup within the Cterminal family          See Fig  The other two kinesins AtTI and          AtTN having an internal motor which fall into the          Cterminal subfamily form a subgroup with one of the          kinesins with an Nterminal motor AtFA These          three are most closely related to a group of animal          Cterminal kinesins including HsKIFC and MMFIFC The          other four kinesins with Nterminal motors that fall into          the Cterminal subfamily form a subgroup that is most          closely related to three           C elegans Cterminal kinesins          As the phylogenetic tree was based on the motor domain          alone it will be interesting to find out the direction          of movement of these kinesins whose motor domains are          Nterminal or internal but are most closely related to          the Cterminal subfamily Kinesins in the Cterminal          subfamily translocate toward the minusend of MTs            The sequence responsible for the direction of movement          was recently determined     Cterminal          kinesins have a conserved sequence at the neckmotor core          junction Fig A   Endow and Waligora            determined that the GN residues at the neckmotor core          junction Fig A are necessary for minus end directed          movement Examination of the neckmotor core junction of          the  Cterminal class Arabidopsis kinesins shows          conservation of these residues in most of the Cterminal          Arabidopsis kinesins          KCBP a Cterminal calciumcalmodulinregulated          kinesin forms a distinct group within the Cterminal          subfamily Figure  A few of the Cterminal Arabidopsis          kinesins eg KatA KCBP have been localized to          mitotic MT arrays spindle spindle poles and          phragmoplast    suggesting a role for these          kinesins in cell division The motor activity of only two          Arabidopsis Cterminal kinesins has been demonstrated          experimentally and both as expected of Cterminal          motors showed minusend motor activity             The KHC subfamily conventional kinesins is made up          of two subgroups one animal and one fungus To date no          KHC has been found in any plant The phylogenetic tree          indicates that there is possibly one KHCtype kinesin in          Arabidopsis AtMAA falls into the KHC group with a          closer relationship to KHCs found in fungi Figure           Both           Drosophila and           C elegans have one KHC whereas the          yeast genomes do not have any KHCs Figure B Some          kinesin light chain sequences have been predicted in the          Arabidopsis genome but none have been studied          experimentally Experimental data suggests that fungal          conventional kinesins do not have light chains             The KHC binding site for kinesin light chain proteins has          been identified   The binding site consists of four          highly conserved contiguous heptad repeats which are          predicted to form a tight helical coiledcoil          interaction with the heptad repeatcontaining Nterminus          of the light chain The tail domain of AtMAA four          KHCs from vertebrates and invertebrates and two fungi          were aligned and compared for the presence of this region          Fig  The four vertebrate and invertebrate KHCs have          a very conserved sequence in this region while the fungal          sequences are conserved in respect to these KHCs in only          a few short stretches The AtMAA tail shows little          similarity and in fact has a very short tail that does          not show similarity to any other kinesin data not          shown However the binding domain is a coiled coil and          the tail of AtMAA does have a region of coiledcoil          from residues  As stated above there are          problems with the predicted amino acid sequence of          AtMAA and further work needs to be done in order to          determine if this is a KHC homolog          One Arabidopsis kinesin groups with the MKLP          subfamily Two internal motor Arabidopsis kinesins group          with the MCAKKIF subfamily also called the internal          family which have members involved in vesicle transport          chromosome movement and MT catastrophe   Three          Arabidopsis kinesins fall into a group with Kip          subfamily members in which ScKip is involved in nuclear          movement   Three Arabidopsis kinesins form a branch          off of the chromokinesinKIF subfamily members some of          which are involved in vesicle transport HsKIF and          spindle organization and chromosome positioning Xlklp                      Several Arabidopsis kinesins show some similarity to          other ungrouped kinesins Figures and  The ungrouped          centromeric proteins HsCENPE and UmKin cluster with          seven Arabidopsis kinesins CENPE binds to the          kinetochore throughout mitosis and to MTs of the spindle          midzone during late stages of mitosis   One          Arabidopsis kinesin is paired with HsKid an ungrouped          kinesin HsKid is a kinesinlike DNAbinding protein that          is involved in spindle formation and the movements of          chromosomes during mitosis and meiosis   Arabidopsis          PAKRP along with five other Arabidopsis kinesins are          grouped with XlKlp XlKlp is required for centrosome          separation and maintenance of spindle bipolarity            whereas PAKRP associates with the phragmoplast   and          is expected to function in cytokinesis Three Arabidopsis          kinesins form a subgroup separate from any other kinesin          but share a branch with CeLFF and DmNOD Eight other          Arabidopsis kinesins form a subgroup separate from          kinesins of any other organism In many cases a group of          Arabidopsis kinesins forms a separate branch within the          major subgroup in which they fall Since there are many          processes unique to plants it is likely that these novel          kinesins function in plantspecific processes                          Domain analysis          Analysis of Arabidopsis kinesins with domain analysis          programs identified different domains in many of the          kinesins Figure and  Table I In addition to the          motor domain most kinesins have a coiledcoil region          Only three Arabidopsis kinesins do not contain some          coiledcoil domain AtTE AtMGL AtTH          However as can be seen in Fig  some have very short          coiledcoil domains ie AtKRPb AtKatD TC          AtKatD was reported   to lack a coiledcoil domain          but the SMART program identified a small coiledcoil          domain starting just inside the Cterminal end of the          motor domain          Table I                              Table I          A few Arabidopsis kinesins have predicted domains that          are not present in other kinesins The SMART predicted          domains were listed as either confidently predicted based          on the Evalue or less significant than the required          threshold The confidently predicted domains may provide          some clues about the possible functions of plant          kinesins While the predictions that are below the          significant threshold may not be reliable some          consideration of them may be warranted          Some of the confidently predicted domains have a          connection with actin cytoskeleton in some way KCBP has          MyTH e  and talinlike domains e           present in some myosins suggesting that it has domains          of both MT and actinbased motors Such motors may be          involved in cross talk between MT and actin cytoskeleton            KCBP also has been shown to have a          calmodulinbinding domain     KCBP is unique          among kinesins in having these domains However a sea          urchin kinesin kinesin C has also been reported to have          a calmodulin binding domain but not the MyTH and          talinlike domains of KCBP   Six of the Arabidopsis          kinesins have a calponin homology domain e to            which is an actinbinding domain present in          the Ntermini of spectrinlike proteins The CH domain is          a protein module of approximately  residues found in          cytoskeletal and signal transduction proteins either as          two domains in tandem or as a single copy   Proteins          with a tandem pair of CH domains crosslink Factin          bundle actin or connect intermediate filaments to          cytoskeleton Proteins with a single copy are involved in          signal transduction    Perhaps the kinesins          containing a CH domain bind actin and are involved in          signal transduction or linking of actin and MTs          Some domains that are involved in proteinprotein or          proteinDNA interactions have been identified Three          Arabidopsis kinesins with armadillo repeats tandem          repeats that form a superhelix of helices form a group          on a separate branch from other kinesins except for a           C elegans kinesin that does not          have an armadillo domain The Evalues range from           to  and are above the significant threshold          Kinesininteracting protein KAP that has armadillo          repeats is thought to mediate cargo binding as part of a          heterotrimeric complex with two kinesins in the KRP          subfamily   One kinesin AtMRO has a          helixhairpinhelix DNA binding domain e  and          also a nuclear localization signal This kinesin may be          involved in signaling          Domains with less significant Evalues include six          kinesins which contain spectrin repeats e to e           There is some evidence which suggests that spectrin          facilitates Golgi membrane association with motor          proteins including cytoplasmic dynein kinesin and          myosin    Perhaps these kinesins may be related          to motor functions involving the Golgi complex In some          cases the coiledcoil andor SPEC repeats overlapped with          basic region leucine zipper domains AtZCF          AtTB AtKE andor homeobox associated          leucine zipper domains AtKE AtMCA          Other domains with less significant Evalues include          domains that are associated with the Rho family of          GTPases the RhoGEF domain e  HR domain e          and e  and FH domain e  Rho GTPases          control cellular processes including cytoskeletal          reorganization and transcriptional activation   A          RhoGEF protein was isolated that not only activates RhoA          but also directly interacts with MTs   The HR          repeat has been identified as a binding site for Rho            The FH domain ties to both Rho and the actin          cytoskeleton FH proteins control rearrangements of the          actin cytoskeleton and members of this family have been          found to interact with RhoGTPases Kinesins having these          domain may be involved in actinMT cooperation during          processes such as vesicle and organelle transport          spindle rotation and nuclear migration                            Why do plants have so many kinesins          Why do plants have so many kinesins What is the          function of each of these kinesins in plant growth and          development There are many MTassociated processes that          are unique to plants   For example during cell          division in plants several plantspecific MT arrays such          as the preprophase band and the phragmoplast are formed          that are important in determining the future location of          the cell wall and cell wall formation respectively          These unique processes are likely to require additional          plantspecific motors In addition centrosomes play an          important role in MT organization in animals whereas          plants have no welldefined centrosomes Hence MT          organization and dynamics in plants may also require          additional MT motors Also in plants there is cell to          cell transport of macromolecules such as RNA through          plasmodesmata and such transport may also require MT          motors   It is possible that kinesins may          participate in functions other than transport and MT          dynamics and organization   Functional redundancy          may also explain the large number of kinesins Three          different           S cerevisiae kinesins KAR KIP          and KIP are involved in nuclear positioning              The loss of one gene alone does not alter viability          but double mutants are lethal Each has a particular role          in positioning but lack of one step is not essential          whereas loss of more leads to nonviability   Six          subfamilies of kinesins have been shown to be involved in          some aspect of cell division    Three Arabidopsis          kinesins Kat A KCBP and PAKRP have been shown to be          associated with the phragmoplast     and so are          expected to be necessary in some way for cytokinesis          Immunolocalization and microinjection studies have shown          the involvement of KCBP in cell division             However KCBP mutants            ZWICHEL grow normally with no          apparent defects in cell division except that they          contain abnormal trichomes    It is likely that          KCBP function in cell division in           ZWICHEL mutants is compensated by          other Cterminal kinesins                            Conclusions        In summary Arabidopsis has a surprisingly large number        of kinesins among the five completed eukaryotic genomes        Many Arabidopsis kinesins do not fall into any known        subfamilies of kinesins and several Arabidopsis kinesins        are not present in yeast         Celegans and         Drosophila and are likely to        represent new subfamilies specific to plants Further        analyses of kinesins have resulted in identification of        several interesting domains in Arabidopsis kinesins that        provide clues in understanding their functions        Although the functions of most of the Arabidopsis        kinesins remains to be determined phylogenetic analysis of        kinesins and identification of functional domains in these        proteins provide clues to their function which can be        tested empirically Several knockout mutant libraries        obtained by TDNA insertions are available to screen for        mutations in kinesins  wwwarabidopsisorg An alignment        of the motor domains of the Arabidopsis kinesins revealed a        few very conserved stretches of amino acids in the motor        domain that could be used for designing a universal        degenerate primer set to screen for mutations in all        kinesins Once an insertion of TDNA is detected in a        kinesin the sequence of the amplified product could be        obtained to identify the kinesin involved Due to the        redundancy in function that has been seen with the        nonplant kinesins other strategies such as overexpression        of the kinesins may also be needed Proteinprotein        interaction studies using the yeast twohybrid trap and        expression analysis of all kinesins in different tissues        and cell types with microarrays can also provide valuable        information about the function of the kinesins                    Methods                  Identification of Arabidopsis kinesinlike          proteins          The motor domain sequence of AtKCBP a plant kinesin          was used to do BLAST Similarity Searches at TAIR           httpwwwarabidopsisorgblast Both BLASTP and          TBLASTN searches were done The sequences showing          homology to the motor domain were obtained from the           Arabidopsis thaliana Database          AtDB and analyzed using SMART Simple Modular          Architecture Research Tool          httpsmartemblheidelbergde which identifies          putative domains within the sequence Sequences          containing a kinesin motor domain were identified as          kinesinlike proteins The sequences from TAIR were also          compared to the proteins containing kinesinlike motor          domains as listed at MIPS           httpwwwmipsbiochemmpgdeprojthaldbindexhtml          Motor domains from other subfamlies were also used in          BLAST searches to identify any possible kinesins missed          using the AtKCBP motor domain sequence The subsequence          containing the kinesin motor as delineated by the SMART          program was generated from each kinesin and compared to          all other Arabidopsis motor domain sequences to see if          the kinesin was unique In some cases two groups had          sequenced the gene and the predicted intronexon status          was not the same We included the sequence with the          closest homology to other kinesin motor domains and          eliminated the other sequence Domains were identified          using the SMART program Location of the genes on the          chromosome was identified using the Arabidopsis Sequence          Map Overview of TAIR           httpwwwarabidopsisorgcgibinmapsSchrom                          Phylogenetic analysis          The motor domains of the Arabidopsis kinesins and           kinesins from animals and yeast with the myosin motor          domain of ScMMY as an outgroup were aligned using the          Clustal method in the DNA STAR program MEGALIGN The          alignment was saved as a PAUP file and used to generate a          phylogenetic tree using PAUP b A heuristic search          method with treebisectionreconnection branch swapping          and one hundred replicates was used The tree used in          Figures and is the consensus tree of  trees retained          in the search The score of the best trees was                             Note Added in Proof                            It has been recently reported that there are           kinesin genes in the human genome H Miki M Setou K          Kaneshiro N Hirokawa All kinesin superfamily
