                                  Viktor Chernomyrdin             Russian president Boris Yeltsin generally usespolitical appointments in two ways first to demonstrate that hes still theboss and second to catch people off guard Most recently he picked as hisspecial envoy to Yugoslavia a man known neither for an effective negotiatingstyle nor for foreign policy expertise but rather as a man of strong willfew convictions and a tendency to move slowly The Russian prime minister from until  a Soviet apparatchik before that Viktor Chernomyrdin remainsoddly a cipher To his supporters Chernomyrdin is a moderate who kept theRussian political machine steady for an unusually long time To his criticshes a politician who has never had a clear strategy or articulated anunambiguous position            His diplomatic experience is limited Chernomyrdinwas the cochairman of the GoreChernomyrdin Commission a biannual meetingthat addressed much and solved little aside from keeping Russias decrepitMir space station in orbit He also helped Russia out of the hostagecrisis that occurred in  when a group of armed Chechens took hostages at a hospital in a southern Russian town outside Chechnya Federaltroops surrounded the terrorists and hostages and Shamil Basayev the leaderof the hostagetakers demanded to speak with Yeltsin who was in HalifaxCanada with the leaders of the G nations            Chernomyrdin got on the phone and in a desperateand fragmented conversation broadcast live on Russian TV negotiated therelease of the hostages In exchange he allowed the terrorists to return toChechnya taking a busload of hostages with them as human shields they werelater released The incident was initially viewed as a triumph forChernomyrdinuntil the terrorists now Chechen national heroes used theincident to propel themselves to power His critics point out thatChernomyrdins order to the troops not to storm the hospital ensured theChechens ultimate victory Of course had Chernomyrdin authorized the attackhe would have been blamed for the deaths of innocent civilians            So what wasChernomyrdins position on Chechnya Nobody knows Although he was primeminister during the war in Chechnya which has more than surface similaritiesto the war in Kosovo It was a war against an ethnic minority seeking greaterautonomy a war that Russia could neither win nor negotiate its way out of fortwo bloody years Chernomyrdin has yet to take a stand on it or on what therepublics relationship ought to be with the Russian federation The agreementthat halted the war was negotiated by a presidential appointee who was not amember of the Chernomyrdin government            Inside Russia Chernomyrdin is remembered as the man whopresided over the countrys transition from a period of utter economic andsocial desperation to one of relative stability On the other hand whenYeltsin fired Chernomyrdin in March  the Russian economy was on the brinkof collapse The debate over Chernomyrdins premiership centers on whether hispolicies of gradual reform helped postpone the breakdown or whether his chronicinaction led to the stagnation that ultimately destroyed the economy Eitherway throughout his tenure he avoided making decisions instead deferring tothe president and playing different factions within his own government off oneanother            To the West Chernomyrdinis the man who moved Russia closer to the West and forged a friendship with theUnited States It may be tempting to read in Chernomyrdins appointment amessage from Yeltsin to the United States to the effect that Russia is finallywilling to behave as though loans were more important than a nationalistforeign policy But more likely the message was intended for a Yeltsinappointee turned rival Yevgeny Primakov the confrontational proSerbianprime minister who hopes to capitalize on the Kosovo crisis The nightOperation Allied Force began Primakov en route to the United States for loannegotiations turned his plane around in midair losing the money but gainingimmense popularity at home For weeks afterward his former aide and currentforeign minister issued a proSerbian antiNATO line and decried claims ofantiAlbanian atrocities as defamatory Yeltsins own public statements on theconflict were not all that different but now that Chernomyrdin has arrived onthe scene the rhetoric has become noticeably milder In the new envoys firstpublic statement on Yugoslavia he ruled out the possibility of Russianmilitary involvement            Yeltsins previous appointment of Chernomyrdin in December was another of Yeltsins inspired and unexpected moves BeforeChernomyrdin joined Yegor Gaidars reformist government half a year earlier hehad had the political profile of an apparatchik which is to say he didnthave one Born to a truck drivers family in the provincial city of OrskChernomyrdin worked his way up through party ranks He was a member of theCentral Committee of the Communist Party and briefly the minister of the oiland gas industries under Mikhail Gorbachev In  he lost a race forparliament He was mainly known in the Gaidar government for holding no viewsand taking no actions which meant he could be sold as the least of all evilsto all factions in the bitter political crisis of late             As a politicianChernomyrdin may seem awkward and indecisive but as a businessman he is saidto be ruthless Chernomyrdin is a member of a unique species of postSovietbusinessmanthe allpowerful and extremely wealthy head of a statecorporation As the first chairman of of Gazprom the Russian gas utility hepresided over the companys issuance of stock His tax returns estimate theworth of the stock he holds at  but other published reports place hispersonal wealth at  billion His position as the man in charge of thepipeline made him an effective negotiator with postSoviet republics whichdepend on Russia for natural gas and generally have huge unpaid gas debtsThough Russia also exports gas to Yugoslavia this fact seems unlikely to swayMilosevic any more than threats to cut off Serbias oil and electricityhave            Chernomyrdins most notorious trait is hisinarticulateness which may stem from an illsuppressed tendency to swear Hisbizarre pronouncements have been a source of endless joy to Russian politicaljournalists Here is what he had to say for example on the Russian financialcrisis last August There was a state The state retained The state began toaccumulate Results began to be had Speaking of his tenure as prime ministerhe claimed If one considers what could have been done and then what we diddo over this long time one can conclude that something was done Finally hisbestknown statement which in its eloquent ineloquence seemed to sum upeverything about Russian politics was We hoped for the best but it turnedout as usual            In appointing the bland seemingly slowpacedChernomyrdin as his envoy Boris Yeltsin is probably hoping that Chernomyrdinwill somehow pull off a settlement without really seeming to or without raisingtoo many hackles and that his ultimate success will be Primakovs loss Butlike many of Yeltsins recent appointments this one has the quality of beingsurprising without being brilliant Chernomyrdin is not all that qualified tosucceed in his new mission and he may not even be motivated to do so He hasalready announced that he plans to run for president in the year  the lawbans Yeltsin from taking part in that election but Primakov is another likelycandidate If Chernomyrdin succeeds in convincing Milosevic to accept enoughof NATOs demands to guarantee some sort of deal he will go down in domesticpolitical history as the man who sold out Serbia If hes worried about thefolks at home what he should probably do is take advantage of his own personalweaknesses and stubbornly and laboriously fail
