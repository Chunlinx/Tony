                                 Consulting the Stars            Just after World War IGeneral Motors asked a team of industrial engineers from outside the company tosurvey its business and recommend strategies for the future After carefulstudy these pioneer management consultants advised GM to rid itself ofChevrolet because it could not hope to compete in its field GM executivessomehow saw their way clear to disregarding this counsel and  years laterthe Chevy was the countrys most popular car            This is agood story So too is the one about consulting firm Booz Allen  Hamiltonsrecommendation in the s that gasoline companies not sell food in theirstations for fear of annoying local restaurant owners In fact the history ofconsulting is full of tales like these showcasing the hubrisshortsightedness and onesizefitsall attitude of firms like McKinseyDeloitte  Touche and Andersen If like James OShea and Charles Madiganwriters at the Chicago Tribune and authors of Dangerous Company you feel a growing sense of unease about the authority consultants enjoy intodays business world finding evidence to feed your anxiety wont be aproblem The Deloitte  Touche advisers who promised to turn a company intoa worldclass manufacturer in  to  weeks while remaining unable toexplain what worldclass meant the Andersen consultants whose fee was set byhow many jobs they eliminated the Bain consultant who got himself appointedcontroller of the company he was counselingtheyre all here and theyre allpreposterous            The history of management consulting though is morecomplex than these horror stories would suggest The profession originated inthe early years of this century with the application of the principles ofscientific management to production lines The first consulting firms sprang upafter World War I when consultants were regarded primarily as efficiencyexperts In the late s consulting came into its own The corporate needto understand the burgeoning consumer market a more general faith in the valueof expert advice and the demands of an unprecedentedly strong economy createda market for firms like Booz Allen and McKinsey In the last two decadesconsultants have benefited from anxieties about profitability and foreigncompetition Corporations looking to reinvent and downsize themselves have madeconsulting the new hot profession            Unfortunately little of this history makes its way into DangerousCompany  which is the first real study of consulting since businessjournalist Hal Higdons  work The Business Healers  Instead thebook is constructedunintentionally or notas a series of case studies thatecho the teaching methods of Harvard Business School prime consultant trainingground Each chapter is meant to illuminate a larger truth about consulting ingeneral The chapter on Deloitte  Touche shows how willing consultants areto assume absolute power the chapter on Andersen how readily they chop headsand the chapter on Gemini how successful consulting firms are at sellingthemselves In  OShea and Madigan paint a bleak picture of corporationsdazzled by snakeoil salesmen operating with a blind and sometimes fatalcertainty and of longterm financial health sacrificed to shorttermthinking But while the picture is bleak it isnt sharp or convincing Insteadof a serious analysis of the evolution of consulting or a discussion of thedifferences and similarities between consulting and traditional corporatemanagement we get argument by anecdote            OShea and Madigan take this approachultimately because they have no thesis to offer To be sure they want topersuade us that the work consultants do is too often not in the best interestsof their clients and they do reveal how often hubris and open checkbooks havebeen recipes for disaster in the past But they have remarkably little to sayabout why they think consultantsas opposed to any other managers withpowerare particularly dangerous Nor do they explain why consulting firmscontinue to enjoy the authority they do in the business world For theunderlying tenets of consultingfaith in the value of a disinterestedrationality the idea that what works in one place will work in anotherhavegiven way since the s to the idea that people with vested interests in acompany are the bestequipped to run it Thats why stock options forexample have become a preferred form of executive compensation So why haveconsultants who are asked to help companies in which they have no financialstake survived            These areserious questions and answering them would tell us important things about thetransformation of the US economy in the postwar period and specifically inthe last two decades Instead Dangerous Company often reads like aselfhelp book for executives who just cant stop picking up the phone to callArthur Andersen or James O McKinsey The last chapter even ends with apoint checklist of things to keep in mind when dealing with consultantsNever give up control were told Value your employees and Beware ofglib talkers with books            In a way though the sheer banality of this advice pointsup the lockhold that consultants have over the corporate mind After all noone would need to be told to never give up control unless there wereexecutives all too willing to cede authority in a crisis Nor would value youremployees be necessary counsel unless companies were routinely putting morestock in outsiders analyses than in the intelligence of their own people Onething Dangerous Company does show convincingly is how quick companiesare to look outside for solutions especially when these come with theimprimatur of a major consulting firm            And yet looking outsideisnt necessarily a mistake Executives are often too close to problems or toohidebound in their thinking to produce new solutions American business infact has a long history of bringing in outsiders to transform companiesthough these outsiders havent always been called consultants Taylorizationfor example shaped the auto industry assembly line even though FrederickWinslow Taylor developed his theories by studying carters Later in thecentury Ford was saved by the socalled Whiz Kids a group of managersincluding Robert McNamara who came to Detroit after World War II from theArmy More recently outside CEOs like Harvey Golub at American Express and LouGerstner at IBMboth McKinsey alumshave forced fundamental changes oncorporations seemingly stuck in longterm ruts As many corporations havefallen apart listening only to those inside as have collapsed from bad advicefrom those outside            Besides blaming consultantsfor companies failures seems in the end to be beside the point No oneforced ATT to pay  million in consulting fees over the course of fiveyears That doesnt mean ATT was stupid to do so but it does suggest thatMa Bell is the one responsible for its woes It also suggests that the realriddleand one that OShea and Madigan dont thoroughly investigateis whycompanies call in management consultants to begin with The answer probably hassomething to do with the needs of corporate America todaythe need to pass offresponsibility the need to appear to be on the cutting edge the need tobelieve that every problem has a readymade solution Dangerous Companylevies a powerful indictment against management consulting but in doing so itconfuses a symptom with the disease Consultants arent the real problem Theneeds theyre asked to fulfill almost certainly are
