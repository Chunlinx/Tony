                    Background        At least one third of the  human members of the        nuclear hormone receptor superfamily function as        heterodimers with the Retinoid X Receptors RXRs NRB            Some but not all of these heterodimers can be        directly activated by RXR agonists called rexinoids which        include the endogenous ligand cisretinoic acid        cisRA and a number of synthetic compounds The        rexinoid responsive complexes are referred to as permissive        and include the Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor        PPAR and the Farnesoid X Receptor FXR heterodimers the        Retinoic Acid Receptor RAR and Thyroid Hormone Receptor        TR heterodimers are nonpermissive                 The xenobiotic receptor CAR NRI     is one of        several RXR heterodimers that has not been assigned to        either category Initial results showed that CAR is an        apparently constitutive transactivator able to activate        gene expression in the absence of exogenously added ligands             The first CAR ligands identified androstanol and        androstenol are inverse agonists that block this        constitutive transactivation     More recently it has        been found that CAR mediates the characteristic response of        a subset of drug metabolizing enzymes to a variety of        structurally unrelated foreign compounds     These        xenobiotic activators are referred to as phenobarbital        PB  like based on the prototypic effects of the        antiepileptic agent on drug metabolism       The        most potent activator of murine CAR is the high affinity        agonist ligand TCPOBOP bis        dichloropyridyloxybenzene             The effects of specific RXR ligands on the CARRXR        heterodimer have not been characterized although high        concentrations of both cisRA and alltrans retinoic acid        have been reported to block PB induction of the CAR targets        CYPB and CYPB in primary rat hepatocytes     In        addition a recent report suggests that both compounds        decrease TCPOBOPdependent CAR transactivation     In        both cases these effects were primarily attributed to        sequestration of limiting amounts of RXR into        liganddependent homodimers or heterodimers with other        receptors        We have used several approaches to specifically examine        the responsiveness of the CARRXR heterodimer to rexinoids        Unexpectedly different responses were observed using        different methods Direct biochemical measurements        demonstrate that rexinoids can induce coactivator binding        but can also inhibit the effects of CAR agonist and inverse        agonist ligands In transient transfections the presence        of RXR ligands can also inhibit the effects of these CAR        ligands However different CARRXR heterodimer binding        sites show distinct responses to RXR activation Overall        these results significantly increase the potential        complexity of the response of RXR heterodimers to RXR        ligands and suggest a potential modulatory effect of        rexinoids on xenobiotic responses                    Results                  RXR ligands block effects of CAR agonist and          inverse agonist ligands on coactivator binding in          vitro          Initial functional results suggested that          transactivation by CARRXR heterodimers is not affected          by RXR ligands including cisRA or synthetic          rexinoids indicating that CAR is a nonpermissive RXR          partner However gel shift studies indicated that the          mobility of the CARRXR complex bound to a DR element          is increased by the presence of cis RA suggesting that          the RXR ligand can bind to the CARRXR heterodimer An          increase in the mobility of the CARRXR complex was also          observed in the presence of TCPOBOP or androstanol alone          or in combination with cis RA data not shown          To test the effects of rexinoids on coactivator          binding in a defined biochemical system surface plasmon          resonance was used to characterize the effects of the          various ligands on binding of CAR RXR and CARRXR          heterodimers to SRC also known as ACTR pCIP RAC          AIB TRAM an effective coactivator for CAR and many          other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily As          expected cisRA stimulated coactivator binding to RXR          alone and the basal interaction of CAR with SRC was          enhanced by TCPOBOP and decreased by androstanol Fig          AB The interaction of SRC with the preformed and          characterized CARRXR heterodimer complex was increased          by either TCPOBOP or cisRA Fig C Strikingly          however coactivator binding to the heterodimer complex          was decreased below the basal level in the presence of          both ligands In addition SRC binding to the          heterodimer was decreased by androstanol and this effect          was largely blocked by cisRA These effects of          cisRA on coactivator binding to the preformed          heterodimer contrast with the strong stimulatory effect          observed with RXR alone confirming the characterization          of this complex These results demonstrate that the          presence of the RXR ligand can significantly alter the          response of the CARRXR heterodimer to CAR ligands                          Effects of rexinoids on CAR responses to agonist          and inverse agonist ligands in cells          To examine the effects of RXR ligands on CAR          transactivation in a more functional context the          rexinoid LG was combined with the CAR inverse agonist          androstanol and the agonist TCPOBOP in a series of          transient transfection studies using different response          elements Initial studies were based on a well          characterized binding site for CARRXR heterodimers the          DR element from the promoter of the retinoic acid          receptor  isoform       In agreement with the          biochemical results the rexinoid blocked both the          stimulatory effect of the agonist and the inhibitory          effect of the inverse agonist on this element Fig A          In more detailed dose response studies  nM LG          decreased the inhibitory effect of androstanol by as much          as  and had an even stronger effect on TCPOBOP          activation Fig B Consistent with previous results              deletion of the helix  AF motif of CAR          eliminated both constitutive and ligand dependent          transactivation Deletion of the same motif in RXR also          strongly decreased transactivation but did not          completely eliminate ligand responses Fig A          To test whether the apparent allosteric effects of          LG on CAR transactivation vary with different          response elements the effect of the rexinoid on          transactivation directed by cytochrome P response          elements was examined In contrast to the results with          the DR site but in agreement with the biochemical          results LG alone had a stimulatory effect on the          ER CAR response element from the promoter of the CYPA          gene Fig  This effect was not due to RXR homodimer          function since no transactivation was observed with RXR          alone In contrast to both the DR and biochemical          results LG did not block the stimulatory effect of          TCPOBOP Instead the stimulatory effect of the two          agonists was retained when they were combined Combining          LG with the inverse agonist androstanol resulted in a          partial block in its inhibitory effect and an          intermediate level of activity Similar results were          observed with the tandem DR sites from the CYPB          gene except that LG did not have a significant          stimulatory effect on its own but did augment the effect          of TCPOBOP It is interesting that these two CYP elements          respond somewhat differently to RXR cotransfection which          increases responses directed by the CYPA element but          modestly decreases responses of the CYPB element data          not shown On both elements similar results were          observed when cis RA was substituted for LG data          not shown These results show that the negative effects          of rexinoids on TCPOBOP and androstanol signaling          observed with the DR site from the RAR promoter are          not observed with the DR and ER sites from the CYP          promoters Thus the CARRXR heterodimer responds          differently to retinoids on different elements                          Rexinoid inhibition of agonist activation of an          endogenous CAR target gene          A previously described HepG derivative stably          expressing mouse CAR    was used to determine the          effects of RXR agonists on CAR function in the context of          native chromatin Expression of CYPB a human relative          of CYPB is constitutively induced in this cell line          In contrast to the results with the transient          transfections with the CYP response elements CYPB          expression was decreased to a comparable extent by          androstanol LG and the combination of both ligands          CYPB expression was increased by TCPOBOP as expected          and this response was blocked by LG treatment                            Discussion        A number of RXR heterodimer complexes have been        categorized as either permissive or nonpermissive based on        their responses to RXR ligands     Although there are        some reported discrepancies the PPAR FXR and NGFIBNURR        complexes are generally considered permissive while the        nonpermissive group includes the RAR TR and VDR complexes        see          In the permissive complexes        coactivators can presumably bind to the AF surface of        both partners and binding to the RXR partner is stimulated        by rexinoid agonists This can result in distinct responses        depending on which of the two partners is activated In the        case of the PPARRXR complex for example activation with        PPAR or RXR specific ligands results in recruitment of        quite different coactivators            Among the nonpermissive complexes the RARRXR        heterodimer is the best studied Recent results suggest        that the Cterminal helix  of RXR exerts allosteric        effects on RAR function     However additional studies        suggest that corepressor binding to the apoRAR component        of the heterodimer blocks rexinoid induced binding of        coactivators to RXR     These results suggest that the        mechanisms that account for the lack of responsiveness of        the nonpermissive complexes are complex        As summarized in Fig  the results described here        demonstrate that the effects of RXR agonists on the CARRXR        heterodimer can be quite different in different contexts         In vitro studies in the absence of        DNA demonstrate that CARRXR heterodimers can be activated        by an agonist ligand for either receptor This positive        response to cisRA contrasts with the inhibition that        would result from the loss of RXR to liganddependent        homodimers     confirming that these studies reflect        the activity of CARRXR heterodimers and demonstrating that        such complexes can be permissive for RXR signaling        Remarkably however coactivator binding is decreased in        the presence of both of the activating ligands Similarly        the inhibitory effect of the inverse agonist ligand        androstanol on coactivator recruitment is blocked by        cisRA        In transient transfections the rexinoid LG shows        different effects on the ability of the xenobiotic receptor        to transactivate various response elements The rexinoid        alone has no effect on transactivation of the RARE but        strongly inhibits responses to both the agonist TCPOBOP and        the inverse agonist androstanol In contrast LG can        stimulate transactivation of the response element from the        CYPA promoter On that element it does not block the        stimulatory effect of TCPOBOP but decreases the inhibitory        effect of the androstanol somewhat On the tandem CYPB        elements LG does not have a stimulatory effect on its        own and does not decrease the inhibitory effect of        androstanol but it does increase response to TCPOBOP        Finally expression of the endogenous CYPB gene in CAR        expressing HepG cells is modestly inhibited by LG        alone androstanol alone and the combination of both In        this context the rexinoid blocks activation by the agonist        TCPOBOP        These rexinoid responses share the general theme of        inhibition of some of the effects of CAR ligands by RXR        ligands but are clearly quite disparate The differences        may be based on variations in experimental approach or on        more fundamental functional differences For example it is        possible that the inhibitory effect of LG in the stable        CAR expressing cell line is based on the sequestration of        limiting amounts of RXR into liganddependent homodimers        as has been suggested in previous studies using primary        hepatocytes     However similar effects were observed        with the relatively large amounts of RXR used for the        biochemical studies or with the transient transfections        which relied on cotransfected RXR It is also possible that        differences in the chromatin context could contribute to        the differences between the effects observed with the        endogenous and transiently transfected promoters However        such differences cannot account for the results with        reporter plasmids that differ only in the identity of the        response element Overall we conclude that binding of both        the DNA and the RXR ligands can result in allosteric        effects on the function of the CARRXR heterodimer        The disparities in these responses preclude a single        simple explanation for the effects of rexinoids on CARRXR        heterodimers Nonetheless one attractive possibility is        that binding of the RXR agonist exerts direct inhibitory        effects on either the binding or functional effects of the        CAR ligands Some precedence for a significant allosteric        effect of one heterodimer partner on another is provided by        the inability of the insect ecdysone receptor to bind its        steroid ligand in the absence of its heterodimer partner        USP            The outcome of this inhibition of CAR ligand binding        would be somewhat different depending on whether or not the        RXR agonist was able to activate the basal transactivation        of CARRXR heterodimer bound to a particular element On        the RARE for example the RXR agonist might bind but not        increase transactivation beyond that observed in the        absence of ligands In this case blocking TCPOBOP binding        would strongly inhibit TCPOBOPdependent transactivation        In the case of the CYPA response element however        activation by the RXR agonist is comparable to that        observed with TCPOBOP alone Thus blocking TCPOBOP binding        would not result in the net inhibitory effect observed with        the RARE but could account for the lack of additive        effect of the two ligands        A variety of factors complicate this relatively simple        model including the specific cytoplasmic to nuclear        translocation that is required for CAR transactivation in        the liver      Rexinoids by themselves are        apparently unable to induce this translocation process in        rat    or mouse data not shown hepatocytes and thus        cannot directly activate CAR targets More complex        combinatorial effects of other coactivators or corepressors        eg      could also contribute to the observed        responses Recent results suggest that CAR can interact        with NCoR or SMRT in the presence of inverse agonists            although such interactions appear much weaker than        those of other receptors Further characterization of        potential CAR cofactors as well as the development of        sensitive and direct ligand binding assays will be required        to define the molecular mechanisms that account for the        diverse effects of rexinoids on CAR transactivation                    Conclusions        Overall we conclude that the disparate effects of        rexinoids on CARRXR heterodimers in different contexts add        significantly to the potential complexity of the effects of        RXR ligands on such nuclear receptor heterodimers and        demonstrate that classifying a particular complex as        permissive or nonpermissive can be an oversimplification        The results described here also suggest that rexinoids may        have modulatory effects on xenobiotic responses and that        such effects may differ for different CARRXR target genes        A systematic examination of the effects of RXR ligands and        retinoid status on a number of the growing set of CAR        target genes will be required to explore this        possibility                    Materials and Methods                  Surface plasmon resonance          The effect of ligands on coactivator binding was
