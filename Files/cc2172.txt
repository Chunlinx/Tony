                    Introduction        Positive endexpiratory pressure PEEP is an important        component of the ventilatory management of acute lung        injury ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome        ARDS PEEP improves oxygenation by redistributing the        alveolar fluid and restores functional residual capacity by        keeping the alveoli open However PEEP can be detrimental        because it may particularly at high levels decrease        cardiac output by decreasing the venous return as a result        of diminished pressure gradient between the systemic veins        and right atrium     and consequently it may lead to        hypoperfusion of vital organs Ultimately despite        improving arterial oxygen content PEEP may decrease oxygen        delivery to various organs among which the splanchnic        vascular bed appears to be particularly at risk because of        its predisposing features and the influence of PEEP on        regional blood flow distribution        Maintenance of splanchnic blood flow is important        because splanchnic hypoperfusion may play a critical role        in the pathogenesis of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome             Mechanical ventilation has been suggested to        potentiate the adverse effects of underlying critical        illness on splanchnic vasculature and contribute to the        development of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome        particularly when injurious ventilatory strategies that        produce high endinspiratory lung volumes are employed            Experimental studies suggested that mechanical        ventilation with considerably high levels of PEEP can lead        to splanchnic hypoperfusion and marked reduction in hepatic        blood flow       Furthermore PEEP may decrease        splanchnic blood flow in patients with no underlying lung        disease      Most available evidence regarding the        effects of PEEP from animal studies has been extrapolated        to humans based on the assumption that the effects of        mechanical ventilation on humans and animals are similar        However a recent study conducted in humans explored the        effect of PEEP in patients with ALI    and did not find        a consistent effect on splanchnic blood flow        Because of the difficulties associated with measurement        of pressurevolume curves incremental titration of PEEP in        an attempt to find the best PEEP based on improvement in        oxygenation is common practice in the management of        hypoxaemic respiratory failure However it is unknown        whether this strategy has an adverse effect on splanchnic        perfusion The aim of the present study was to investigate        the impact of PEEP titration based on improvement in        oxygenation on gastric mucosal perfusion in patients with        ARDS as assessed by measurement of gastric mucosal pH pH         i                     Method                  Patients          The study protocol was approved by the Institutional          Ethics Committee of Istanbul University Hospital Written          informed consent was obtained from each patient or the          patients next of kin We consecutively enrolled           patients with ARDS admitted to the multidisciplinary          intensive care unit at Istanbul University Hospital The          criteria for eligibility were a diagnosis of ARDS based          on a consensus report     age older than  years          and mean arterial pressure MAP greater than  mmHg          with no haemodynamic support All patients were enrolled          within the first  hours following the diagnosis of          ARDS Patients with known cardiac dysfunction or          preexisting liver disease were not included in the          trial                          Protocol          All patients were ventilated using a Servo  Siemens          ventilator Siemens Elema Uppsala Sweden using the          pressureregulated volume control mode with a tidal          volume of  mlkg based on ideal body weight          frequency of  breathsmin fraction of inspired oxygen          of  and

Organon Oss The          Netherlands infusion during the study In addition to          employing a radial arterial catheter for blood pressure          measurement a pulmonary artery catheter Abbot labs          North Chicago IL USA was placed in all patients for          haemodynamic monitoring No patients received any          therapeutic intervention to improve haemodynamics ie          fluid resuscitation or catecholamine infusion throughout          the study          Baseline PEEP PEEP           baseline  was set at  cmH            O and titrated at  cmH            O increments until the partial          arterial oxygen tension PaO             reached at least  mmHg peak          airway pressure was  cmH            O or greater or MAP dropped by           or more from the baseline value Criteria for          overinflation of lung and therefore for discontinuation          of further titration of PEEP were reduction in PaO            of  or more and an increase in          arterial carbon dioxide tension of  or more Optimal          PEEP PEEP           opt  was defined as the PEEP that          achieved the best oxygenation whereas maximum PEEP PEEP                    max  was the greatest level of PEEP          achieved during titration in each patient          A nasogastric catheter TRIP Catheter Tonometrics          Division Instrumentarium Corp Helsinki Finland was          inserted into the stomach to measure pH           i  Correct placement of the TRIP          catheter was confirmed by radiography Enteral nutrition          was withheld throughout the study and all patients          received ranitidine  mg intravenously In order to          allow for equilibration pH           i was measured  min after injection          of  ml isotonic saline into the semipermeable balloon          of the TRIP catheter Partial pressure of carbon dioxide          in saline solution and bicarbonate level in arterial          blood were measured simultaneously using a blood gas          analyzer ABL Radiometer Copenhagen Denmark          immediately after sampling    and were corrected for          the equilibration time     The pH           i was calculated using the          HendersonHasselbach equation          All measurements including respiratory haemodynamic          parameters arterial and mixed venous blood gas analyses          and gastric pH           i  were taken at baseline and          following ventilation for  min at each level of PEEP          Haemodynamic parameters were monitored continuously using          an Horizon XL monitor Mennen Medical Inc New York NY          USA Cardiac output was measured in triplicate by          thermodilution technique using  ml saline solution at          room temperature Cardiac index shunt fraction oxygen          delivery DO             and oxygen consumption were          calculated at baseline and at all PEEP levels                          Statistical analysis          Paired analysis of variance tests were used to analyze          the differences between measurements           P   was considered          statistically significant All values are presented as

highest PEEP value        applied was  cmH          O Static compliance improved slightly        at PEEP         opt  but this did not achieve        statistical significance          P   Table  Changes in peak        airway and mean airway pressures at PEEP         baseline  PEEP         opt and PEEP         max were statistically significant          P   Table  Reasons for        stopping the titration of PEEP were reduction in PaO          from  to          n   reduction in MAP from  to                 n   adequate oxygenation PaO           mmHg         n   and excessive peak upper        ariway pressure          n          Although PEEP significantly improved shunt fraction and        consequently PaO           its greater effect on cardiac output        led to a reduction in DO          both at PEEP         opt and PEEP         max  However none of the changes in        haemodynamic parameters including those in central venous        pressure pulmonary artery occlusion pressure cardiac        output cardiac index and DO           achieved statistical significance        Table and Fig  PaO          values remained stable at each level        of PEEP The mean pH         i was    at baseline and           at PEEP         opt  it decreased to    at        PEEP         max  but this reduction was not        statistically significant          P   Similar to pH         i  alterations in the gap between        partial tissue and arterial carbon dioxide tension P         ta CO           were not significant          P          Although the increase in PEEP had no impact on the group        as a whole changes in pH         i and P         ta CO          during PEEP titration differed between        individual patients Table  The pH         i decreased in eight patients  it        increased in five  and it was unchanged in four         at PEEP         opt as compared with PEEP         baseline  The pH         i at PEEP         max was lower in   and higher        in five  patients as compared with baseline values        The P         ta CO          values increased in nine         patients at PEEP         opt and in   patients at PEEP         max as compared with PEEP         baseline Table  However there were        no statistically significant differences in P         ta CO          values between PEEP         baseline  PEEP         opt and PEEP         max          P   Table  Interestingly        DO          in those patients who exhibited a rise        in pHi did not increase Rather DO          in these patients also decreased        although this was not statistically significant at PEEP         opt and PEEP         max  to a degree similar to that in        patients who exhibited a drop in pH         i                     Discussion        The results of the present study indicate that        incremental increases in PEEP do not impact on splanchnic        perfusion as assessed by gastric tonometry when cardiac        output and consequently DO           are maintained        In animals PEEP decreases hepatosplanchnic perfusion in        a dosedependent manner with a limited effect at PEEP        levels of less than  cmH          O       Alterations in        splanchnic blood flow attributed to PEEP occur in parallel        to those in cardiac output and consequently can be reversed        with restoration of blood pressure      Despite        experimental evidence concerns regarding the effects of        PEEP on splanchnic perfusion remain theoretical because        large studies in humans are lacking Similarly in humans        without ALI or ARDS PEEP reduces splanchnic oxygenation        and this is accompanied by decreases in cardiac output        albeit with no change in lactate levels     Recently        Kiefer and colleagues    reported no change in        splanchnic perfusion when PEEP was titrated on the linear        portion of the pressurevolume curve in patients with ALI                   The results presented here which demonstrate a lack of        impact on splanchnic blood flow when PEEP is not        accompanied by decreased cardiac output corroborate those        from animal studies     and from the recent human        study conducted by Kiefer and coworkers     The lack of        change in pH         i at PEEP         opt  cmH          O is in agreement with our current        understanding that PEEP at  cmH          O has a limited effect on splanchnic        blood flow Furthermore the presence of ARDS limited the        relative impact of increased thoracic pressure on the        cardiovascular system        Perhaps more important these observations were valid        for a wide range of PEEP levels from  cmH          O to as high as  cmH          O We ascribed the lack of significant        changes in cardiac output and DO          in the patients to adequate volume        status and preload Relative hypovolaemia appears to be the        most likely explanation for the reductions in cardiac        output and splanchnic blood flow observed in animal        studies Gastric pH         i  and consequently splanchnic blood        flow remained stable at PEEP         opt and PEEP         max when cardiac output and DO remained        relatively unchanged Preservation of splanchnic blood flow        at PEEP         opt and PEEP         max was attributed to an increase in        oxygen extraction ratio that was sufficient to compensate        for the small insignificant drop in cardiac output and DO          that occurred during PEEP titration                   It is also noteworthy that there may be individual        variations in pH         i in response to PEEP Although        differences in pH         i response among individuals cannot        explained on the basis of changes in DO           they may be attributed to        differences in the relative impact of underlying critical        illness on splanchnic perfusion and variations in        splanchnic vascular response ie severity andor duration        of vasoconstriction extraction ratio to small changes in        DO          among individuals        Because of concerns about the reliability of pH         i for assessing mucosal perfusion we        also calculated the P         ta CO          because it has been proposed to be a        better parameter than pH         i     The pH         i level can sometimes be misleading        particularly in situations in which gastric tissue and        arterial bicarbonate levels are not equal In addition        unlike pH         i  which can change with the degree of        alveolar ventilation P         ta CO          remains a reliable parameter because        both components ie partial arterial and tissue carbon        dioxide tension are similarly influenced by changes in        alveolar ventilation unless they are associated with        alterations in cardiac output     In the present        study changes in P         ta CO          were not statistically significant and        correlated with changes in pH         i  Consequently we used pHi values in        our discussion because we believe that pH         i reliably reflects the accurate tissue        pH in patients        Our results corroborate those from the only other study        that evaluated the impact of PEEP on splanchnic perfusion        in patients with ALI Similar to Kiefer and colleagues            we found no change either in pH         i or P         ta CO          during PEEP titration However there        were several differences between two studies Whereas        Kiefer and colleagues used pressurevolume curves for PEEP        titration we titrated PEEP on the basis of improvement in        oxygenation which is a commonly used method in clinical        practice because determination of pressurevolume curves        can sometimes be cumbersome Furthermore the present study        was larger and we included patients with more severe        disease ratio of fractional inspired oxygen to PaO            in the present study versus         in that conducted by Kiefer and coworkers        However the present study has several limitations The        first and perhaps most important limitation of the study is        the liberal titration of PEEP in order to determine its        impact on pH         i  as described under Method see        above We acknowledge that in daytoday clinical        practice some of the patients would not have been managed        with such aggressive titration of PEEP and therefore would        not have received the levels of PEEP achieved in the study        rendering the clinical implications of these observations        quite limited Second we did not directly measure        splanchnic perfusion but assessed it indirectly by        monitoring pH         i using gastric tonometry Although the        diagnostic value of gastric tonometry has been questioned        because some methodological problems we believe that we        minimized most of these limitations and improved the        reproducibility of our measurements by immediate analysis        of samples use of H          blockers    and lack of enteral        nutrition     rendering it possible to use gastric pH         i to evaluate splanchnic perfusion        Third PEEP         opt in the study approximately  cmH          O was lower than levels reported in        other ARDS studies     Higher tidal volume  mlkg        leading to higher mean airway pressure the termination        criteria used in our study and the differences in        titration technique based on oxygenation versus        pressurevolume curve may account for this difference        Finally pH         i was measured after patients had been        exposed to different levels of PEEP for a short duration        Although shortterm application of high PEEP did not        significantly change pH         i  it is conceivable that longer        durations or higher numbers of patients would have led to        more prominent reductions and statistically significant        differences        Collectively the present findings indicate that        determination of PEEP         opt by titration of PEEP based on        improvement in oxygenation is a safe strategy with no        impairment in gastric mucosal perfusion when cardiac        output is preserved Maintenance of cardiac output during        mechanical ventilation with high PEEP may be adequate to        prevent its unwanted effects on organs in the splanchnic        vasculature Nonetheless the possibility that PEEP can        alter splanchnic perfusion when it is applied at high        levels and for longer durations cannot be completely        excluded                    Key message         Incremental increase in PEEP to identify the optimal        value does not affect splanchnic perfusion as assessed by        gastric tonometry                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        ALI  acute lung injury ARDS  acute respiratory        distress syndrome DO
