DearPrudence                                                         s disgusting letter concerning meal andgift parity along with her psychotically misguided ideas of the whys andwherefores of giving gifts are a great deal more than alarming I foundmyself deeply troubled by her fantastical notions and saddened by thepossibility that her children might be taught these same ideas Needless tosay I thought your response to RS was absolutely correct                                       Nevertheless I musttake issue with your slander of mercenaries A mercenary makes it clear hesheis fighting for money not attempting to hide the expectation of booty behind awedding invitation                                       Cordially ML III in Hong Kong                        Dear M            Prudie thanks you foryour support and regrets that she may have insulted official mercenaries IfRS our bride with the tally sheet is by any chance reading this weeksPrudie she may be interested to know that there was much mail essentiallycalling her a woman with a cash register where her heart ought to be            Prudie assuredly                                             DearPrudence                                                      As a young man approaching  I am confusedabout how I am supposed to react to womens fashions At a recent conference ofprofessionals we were seated around a Ushaped tableglasswith notablecloth Several of these professional women across from me were wearingAlly McBeal skirts They spent the entire meeting pulling their skirts down sotheir lingerie preferences were not so obvious Am I supposed to look at theceiling the entire meeting steal the occasional glance or just assume its as thing                                       Along these samelines I was recently in a retail store and the clerk had on a summer dress Asshe leaned over the counter to hand me my purchase it became clear that herlingerie preference was none at all I didnt know whether to stare at theceiling pretend I saw nothing or thank her for the free show In bothinstances these women had to know that everyone was getting an eyeful Imissed the era of free love while in grade school and am wondering if we arenow in the era of free looks                                       Somewhat Dazed and Confused                        Dear Some            You have nicely named our new era Fashion is deepinto spandex and seethrough with the offoneshoulder style occasionallyrevealing a stray boob Alas the s motto Let it all hang out has movedfrom emotions to body parts             Clothing is meant tocover or reveal The lookatme outfits say just that As for your particularquestion about Ally McBeal skirts and ladies minus underwear Prudie feelsthese people do not purchase their clothes in the dark so whatever is able tobe seen is fair game for whatever response feels natural You may even stare ifyou like Prudie gives you permission            Prudie permissively                                             DearPrudence                                                      Maybe you can help with this problem My wifeand I have a subscription to our citys symphony orchestra Sometimes thingscome up that prevent us from using our tickets When this happens we give themto friends who are also classical music fans We have made it clear to thiscouple we expect nothing in return as we have already paid for the ticketsthat would go to waste if they didnt use them However being polite peopleand good friends this other couple has as a gesture of thanks invited us tobe their guests at a minor league baseball game My wife and I are notenthusiastic about this especially since getting there requires a drive ofclose to an hour But we dont want to appear ungrateful to our friends or hurttheir feelings We cant use the Were busy excuse because theyve given usfour different dates to choose from                                       Is there a gracefulway of declining or have you some suggestions for handling thisdilemma                                       In Need of Help in Ohio                        Dear In            Prudie sympathizes with your feelings of ixnay onthe ballgame  she herself having been briefly shown on national TV readingthe New Republic at a World Series game and the Sunday papers at theRose Bowl            It is best to be upfront both to handle the mattertruthfully as well as to scotch baseball invitations on into the next centuryPrudie therefore suggests you tell your friends  you are most appreciativethat they wish to reciprocate  neither you nor your wife is a sports fan long car rides hurt your behinds and  a leisurely dinner just the four ofyou would be much more to your liking            Prudie believes thereare certain occasions when one plays along in order to spare someonesfeelings This is not one of them            Prudie decidedly                                             HelloPrudie                                                      The tone of  aboutthat geezer Hugh Hefner rather surprises me Really Confused seems to want tocriticize Mr Hefner because he is no longer a young man under  yet he stillmanages to attract the attentions of three young attractive women Would ReallyConfused be less confused if Mr Hefner were a GenXer Would you be lesscritical of the three women if Mr Hefner were under  In other words itappears that numbers are driving the argument here and I cant tell if itsthe number  any number over  or an interaction effect                                       Quantitatively Questioning the Quality of Life a k a SBB                        Dear Quant            Prudie cant speak forReally Confused so she will speak for herself If Mr Hefner were under the three uh companions would no doubt be an implied tribute to hisattractiveness At the age of something however this trio has about it thebarest whiff of selfserving motives Without the mansion the money thefamous friends and the publicity Prudie thinks the object of their affectionswould be just another eccentric old guy who stays in his pajamas As Prudie haswondered in the past in other publications why do geezers with younggirlfriends not know that they might as well glue an American Express Gold Cardto their foreheads Oh well As for the Viagra component lets not go thereas the kids say
