                                  Browser Bork Replies            Michael Kinsley seeks tofind a contradiction between the book I wrote in  The AntitrustParadox  and my representation of Netscape and other firms that support thegovernments antitrust case against Microsoft He goes on to suggest that Ihave become a disingenuous cynic and have endangered if not lost myscholarly reputation Though he reveals his own conflict of interest whichhardly requires confession since everyone knows that Microsoft owns                  Slate                his attack follows the Microsoft line That companysminions are masters of the ad hominem            Let us begin with mymotivation which Mr Kinsley questions When Netscape first approached me Isaid I thought I was on the other side All I knew then came from newspaperaccounts that described the case as an attack on tieins I continue to thinktiein law mistaken but this was not a case of extending a monopoly to acompetitive market Rather Microsoft as its own internal documents show wastrying to stamp out a product the Netscape browser that might compete withits monopoly operating system Netscape sent not only the reference to my bookThe Antitrust Paradox  but an explanation of why predation would work inthis market At about that time a lawyer for Microsoft called and inconversation and by letter tried to convince me that the companys practicescreated efficiency He offered me a retainer I have no idea how large thatmight have been because I did not ask or try to negotiate with him I said thatif he convinced me I would simply stay out of the case He did not persuademe and I went with Netscape charging the same hourly rate I charge allclients no more no less There was no reason why I should make that choiceexcept that I thought and continue to think Netscape is right The governmentseems to be proving that in the courtroom            Mr Kinsleys economic analysis fares no better than hispersonal attack The key question is whether predation including pricepredation can be an effective monopolizing technique As I recall MrKinsleys review of my book it was one of the less comprehending assessmentsThe ensuing  years have not improved his comprehension and it is too much toexpect that he will reread the work now My belief that Netscape has the betterof the argument with Microsoft rests on much more than the LorainJournal case To refresh Mr Kinsleys memory the relevant passage beginsat Page  where I wrote that The technique of predation rather than thequestion of reserves is likely to be decisive in the success of the tacticand the law should focus upon this issue            Price cutting willusually not be a successful technique I wrote because it requires thepredator to expand his rate of output in order to drive prices down In thecase I posited an expansion of output imposes increasing costs upon thepredator because his marginal costs will rise and the victims will not Thatwill be true in almost all industries It follows from the argument that pricecutting can be a successful predatory tactic if marginal costs are not risingI did not make the point explicit because it seemed obvious and a rarecase            Microsofts representatives have made it clear that afterdevelopment costs the production and distribution of software displays a flatmarginal cost The predator is at no disadvantage If his financial reservesare larger than the victims in proportion to their market shares thepredator can destroy the victims business This is especially true where thepredator is spending only a small fraction of its monopoly profits while thevictim has no such profits Nor will outsiders put up the capital to resist thepredator for they will know the victim is at a disadvantage in the fight            That in essence is thecase against Microsofts attempted destruction of the Netscape browser in orderto defend its monopoly in operating systems I trust the matter is now clear toMicrosoft                   Slate                and Mr Kinsley but it is too much to hopethat any of them will concede                                             Michael Kinsleyresponds                                       First of all thanks to Judge Bork for the aboveresponse Next a few points in reply             I consulted no one at Microsoft outside of                  Slate                in writing my piece The companys minions didnt evenknow I was writing it until it appeared I did read a document or two off thecompanys publicly available antitrust suit propagandapage as well as a similar page sponsored by the JusticeDepartment             One of the strikingthings about the Microsoft trial so far is the extent to which the JusticeDepartment and its lawyer David Boies have built their case around personalvilification of Bill Gates This may be justified or notwe like him wellenough around herebut it does seem unreasonable for a supporter of the DOJto suggest that ad hominen attacks are a Microsoft specialty            In his response Mr Bork fleshes out his earlierstatements about how he came to sign up with Netscape Until Netscapeapproached him he thought Microsoft was right and Netscape was wrongbased onhis general view that predation misuse of market power is largely a mythNetscape didnt merely point out a two page discussion in his book of a singlecase that pointed the other way Netscape also sent him an explanation of whypredation would work in this particular market If Netscape supplied Mr Borkwith the argument why his own theories supported Netscapes position whatdid Mr Bork supply              Mr Bork says that when Microsoft also tried tohire him he gave the companys lawyer a hearing with the understanding thatif he convinced me I would simply stay out of the case Bizarrely Mr Borkseems to think this arrangement allowed him to choose sides with completeneutrality Lets see If he chose Netscape he got the same hourly rate Icharge all clients no more no less If he chose Microsoft he got nothing Sure that sounds perfectly neutral             Im sorry Mr Borkrecalls my review of his book as one of the less comprehending assessmentsIt was as I said a favorable review Maybe thats why            Mr Bork says his argument against Microsoft is based onmuch more than his books two page discussion of the Lorain Journalcase I guess it depends on what you mean by the word much All he cites inthis reply is one additional passage from the book which he concedes doesnot make the point explicit Indeed it does not The discussion of predationin the pages following Page  does not contain a single word suggesting thatBork believes predatory pricing can ever be a valid antitrust concern In factthe only technique of predation that Bork in his book expresses any concernabout is misuse of government process He writes Misuse of courts andgovernment agencies is a particularly effective means of delaying or stiflingcompetition             The point is his current argument that hisearlier argumentthat predation by price cutting doesnt workonly applieswhere marginal costs are rising He says his current argument is impliedthough not explicit in the book and therefore by further implication hesnot a hypocrite Its true the book assumes rising marginal costs but it doesnot follow as he claims that predation by cost cutting depends on risingmarginal costs If you assume youre holding an apple and conclude from thatyoure holding a fruit it doesnt follow that if youre holding an orangeyoure not holding a fruit Mr Borks current argument may be right orwrong but its certainly not derived from his book             The assumption ofrising marginal costs in any but the shortest of short terms is widelyregarded as the weak link in the logic of neoclassical economics Software maybe an extreme example of marginal costs that plunge immediately to near zeroand stay there but learning curves and economies of scale are morecharacteristic of most modern industries than rising marginal costs Yet inorder to defend his current position Mr Bork nowdeclaresunnecessarilythat his whole theory of antitrust rests on this weakpoint His lifes great intellectual achievement he says in effect doesntapply in most reallife situations            On the merits of his current argument Mr Bork is rightto call me uncomprehending His original argument that predatory price cuttingcant work and therefore neednt be illegal was that it will always cost thepredator more than the intended victim because the predator is selling moreunits during the price war in which both parties are losing money I do notcomprehend why that depends on rising marginal costs Its true that risingmarginal costs increase the predators lossesbut even with flat marginalcosts the predators losses get bigger and bigger until the victim surrendersZero marginal costs if anything ought to make it even harder to drive acompetitor from the field with devastating losses Am I missing something             Andto finish the argumentif Mr Borksoriginal argument about relative losses doesnt depend on rising marginalcosts neither does its corollary that capital markets should be willing tobankroll a price war that the victim could win with an adequate war chestThis is actually the very point in context of the sentence Mr Bork quotesfrom Page  of his book I therefore do not comprehend why Mr Bork nowthinks it matters that Microsoft has more money than Netscape when he was sospecifically contemptuous of that argument  years ago             This is not to say that Mr Borks old theorywas right or that his new one is necessarily wrongonly that the two theoriesare irreconcilable And if what Mr Bork is arguing today cannot be honestlyderived from his seminal book  years ago this makes the question of whatNetscape is paying him for even more piquant
