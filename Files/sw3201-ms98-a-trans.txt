        so do you have any recycling programs there   um i dont really think we have anything in the works as of yet uh were pretty small town and um the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of WalMart   uhhuh oh uhhuh   that show you know plastics paper   yeah   liter bottles et cetera et cetera   weve progressed a little bit farther than that um actually they have uh parts of town   yeah   it may have even spread all over the whole town and um they have these green bins   umhum   and its just as standard as a a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump   yeah   and uh just along with a trash can you have this this green plastic bin and you put your bottles in it and paper and um you know all those things that  aluminum you know anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin   oh   and uh i guess you can also and a lot of the restaurants   yeah   they just have uh places where you can throw away especially beer places where you can throw away green bottles and then the brown bottles and uh   huh   oh i dont know i guess theyre you know clear bottles so um you know a lot of people do have those separated   yeah   and of course they have the um dumpsters uh the the igloos   yeah   uh and they have those strategically strategically placed around the city   oh   and uh theyre theyre actually gonna extend it i think one of these days maybe to apartment complexes and uh   oh thatd be good   yeah things of that nature so i guess when you live in a bigger city it it really becomes uh necessary   yeah see its not anywhere near that uh we uh you know as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans     oh yeah   but thats as far as we go because i take them to a girl at work and she goes and cashes them in because you know i just   uhhuh   i can do that for her and and i dont want the hassle because we have to go to another town to do it   yeah oh really hm   yeah see we dont have anything here in Belton its its a pretty small little town   yeah i remember my grandparents and i used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans and uh   yeah so yeah thats about all that that were doing here uh theyre uh getting a little bit more on they need to a lot a more community awareness of just what is it mean to recycle and what can you recycle and what you cant because   uhhuh   you know not a lot of people do  really know what you know   yeah theyre doing a real good job of uh separating it here and of course there you know you have a specific place to put your paper   what its for yeah   and uh they try to get you to go ahead and separate it but uh they actually have the door to door pickup um and its uh i think it started out to be um just kind of a test a pilot project and it went over so well that they just extended it and its almost uh i dont know if its done by a private company or not it may be   umhum   but uh they just go around to each uh door and pick it up   wow thats excellent thats good   yeah lets see oh and every year of course the phone books   yeah   um they tell everybody across the city to um put all their phone books in uh the uh recycle bins   oh   because you know phone books are pretty well for a bigger city theyre pretty thick and and sometimes you might have two or three   yeah they uh exactly   so uh thats thats a big savings right there in itself   yeah see ours just goes in the regular trash it just you know theres not a whole lot and there are you know some places that   yeah hm   well set up you know for old newspapers and stuff but usually its   umhum   it it hasnt caught on yet im hoping it will soon   umhum well the thing about newspapers and paper recycled paper is actually very expensive   yeah   so when you see something thats on recycled paper theyve actually gone to a lot of expense to do that its uh theyre not coming out ahead at all its uh its really a cost   hm  i wasnt totally aware of that   yeah   so   i mean it it sounds good to the public but theres really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something now aluminum i dont know they may be coming out ahead   yeah   but i know for a fact that the paper uh on that end theyre not  you know its its good to recycle but its uh not to their advantage and it costs less   yeah hm well   i cant think of anything else okay   i cant either because were were at a very you know beginning stages so   uhhuh   we look forward to it to get better but thats it   well i hope yall um uh come along a little farther in the future   yeah me too   it was nice talking to you byebye   you too bye
