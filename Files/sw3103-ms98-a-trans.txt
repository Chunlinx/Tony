        okay   all right well i am uh the product of uh i think as much the changing roles of women as anyone my mother uh we come from a my mother and i were uh really practice first generation divorce in our family   yes   my uh mother was divorced in nineteen uh fifty seven   uhhuh   when i was seven years old and was i was the first one of anyone that that anyone had ever known  to have a divorce   uhhuh uhhuh   of course now fifty percent divorces in the United States uh my mother uh was treated very badly uh in a by a lot of people family members um especially from my fathers side of the family and also uh uh uh we were uh ostracized by his family uh basically just you know uh we just kind of dropped off the face of the earth   uhhuh right   and they all felt that there there was never an issue that my father was the was the cause of the reason for the split up even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce   oh mercy   uh it was always my mothers fault she was not uh sufficient you know she just was not good enough what was wrong with her was she not attractive enough did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest it was that kind of an attitude   yeah that thats too bad   so uh yeah it was too bad it was really rough   um um thats sad it really is   uh so you know thats so changing some of the changing roles of women in that respect i have been a product of   uhhuh   um i think that there are people that i think that uh i was a i was first generation going to college in my family   uhhuh   uh first my mother had always had a quote career but always a career as a uh uh in a secretarial position she did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession profession in Des Moines Iowa   thats thats wonderful   she was a secretary to uh uh the judge as well as for him so that was a really high high status position she made over thirty thousand a year   uhhuh well thats wonderful that speaks well of your mother   well yeah she a real hard lady yeah hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back you know   she had high standards yeah oh bless her heart   but uh so i went to college and now since have completed two masters degrees and i am the director of music in a church um and but its interestingly enough i am still everyday confronted with   challenges   absolutely challenges that have to do with my sex uh for instance uh well you know i am just not taken as seriously you know at professions   uhhuh right uhhuh   as many of the woman as many of the men who are doing the same job i do and uh the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman they expect me to be more motherly they question my authority more uh than they ever would a man and i have experience with this because i work at both both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man   uh uhhuh   so i am pretty i am pretty obvious pretty constant i mean i am pretty aware of what goes on uh in the church so basically thats thats well i am done talking do you want to talk   surely well i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well uh Nickie and i can uh relate to that uh   uhhuh   uh i think its its the image that the woman has and uh in the world as uh   uhhuh   the lesser of the two   oh always   and uh i think things are changing but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to   uhhuh   like it to take and uh i think we are progressing at a snails pace but we are progressing   indeed   so thats the main point is that we are going ahead   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh i think that uh in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve and uh   uhhuh   men uh have a lot of them have uh come around and have seen the error of their ways   uhhuh uhhuh   but there are a lot of diehards out there that will never change so we have to uh face that reality also   uhhuh i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change why they can not bend i mean why they can not just accept you know competent women i i have never been able to understand that i guess its fear  i i mean what   it could be if they are after they are not sure of themselves   sure   the ones that uh go along with that they are sure of themselves   uhhuh   and they know that they can uh you know uh be on the same level   uhhuh   and they do not have any uh ego uh problems that they are fighting   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh i think that we are going to be uh on par with them in salary and in recognition in the long term   uhhuh uhhuh   uh and i what i would like to see happen futuristically is what we are discussing is that yes uh   uhhuh uhhuh   we each have our uh jobs in life and that we should recognize that and that we should support each other   uhhuh   and uh i think our problems would be fewer if we supported each other   uhhuh   and just looked at each other as equals and none lesser because we are equal   men have a lot of trouble with that though   uhhuh   they in their in their own peer relationships they do not treat themselves equal and so its really difficult for them to treat women as equals they are they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower uh it just seems that it seems it seems that they are more comfortable that way and i do not know if thats i mean thats its a militaristic point of view i guess you know somebody can not be colonel and everybody else is infantry but its just really interesting to me i am married to a wonderful man   uh   you know who treats me very you know with a with as i think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time but when he gets angry its always over control issues its always over power issues its never over you know its always you said you were going to do something and you did not do it as if he is the boss and i am the you know and i am the slave and it those are the only only issues we ever fight about   uhhuh uhhuh   i think its just i think its just difficult for men to uh to accept women equally even if they want to they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss  uh dictator dictatorships are real efficient   well i guess we would have to go back to the way that the Lord made us and uh   um   the women when they are married they are to be subjective to their husbands   um   and i believe that strongly   um   and uh but i think that they should be in harmony with what they are with what the subject matter is   um   and i think the issue should be settled before theres a conflict   huh   uh and i think that can happen in a very wonderful wonderful way   huh   and if we men and women would do as the Bible said that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves can you picture that   uhhuh uhhuh   i mean if your husband did that to you and you did that to your husband you would always be trying to please each other and not yourself   uhhuh uhhuh yeah its true   and uh thats really the the divine answer and and the right answer  so uh uh   uhhuh uhhuh   that would be a beautiful relationship   uhhuh it would be   and i think there are some people that have done that and i have seen it and its its just marvelous and i am just in awe to see this   uhhuh uhhuh
