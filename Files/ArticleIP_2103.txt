                                 A Snowballs Chance            Impeachment is still aminority taste In midAugust  percent of adults supported impeachment bythe beginning of this week almost  percent did But why is that numbergrowing at all The Starr report Clintons response or just the slowsinkingin of the story may all be factors But opinion polls themselves canchange the results of opinion polls They can even turn a minority view into amajority one without anyone actually changing his or her mind about the rightsand wrongs            Hereshow Start with a poll indicating that  percent of voters think Clintondeserves to be sacked Threequarters think he doesnt But of that  percentwho dont think he should quit or be impeached many are disturbed at thethought that he has lost the confidence of so many other citizens and somewill feel that whatever their own views the president should go because hehas lost the ability to govern effectively This argument is already asubtheme among the commentariat            How many will feel this way Impossible to say of courseIf everyone in the country except you felt that Clinton was disqualified onmoral grounds you would almost certainly conclude that he should go oneffectiveness grounds alone If half the country disagreed with you you mightor might not buy the effectiveness argument If  percent of the countryfavored impeachment you almost surely would not worry that this made thepresident ineffective            Lets suppose that at percent favoring impeachment one out of  of the remaining  percentbelieves that having a quarter of the population wishing him impeached makesthe president dangerously ineffective The next time a pollster comes aroundthis small group tells him or her they think Clinton should go Thus the nextpoll results show that an additional  percent of voters now want him outandthe total for ouster is now  percent            Of theremaining  percent one in  thinks that  percent favoring impeachment istoo much for effective governance and thus the next poll publicizes the newsthat  percent of voters think Clinton should go If an equal number ofpragmatic voters now one in  of the remaining Clinton supporters think that percent is enoughtheyll flip and the next poll will show that  percentof voters think impeachment is warranted Two iterations later  percent ofAmerican voters want to send Clinton to the showers And thats enough forCongress Clinton is impeached by a snowball A majority of Americans nowbelieves he must go even though only one in four actually believe he deservesto go            The dynamic eventually loses steam of courseThe halt comes when there is no one left who wishes Clinton would stay butthinks the current level of impeachment sentiment means he should go But isthe end north or south of  percent We dont know            Thisdynamic is perhaps easier to see in the stock market as explained in a famouspassage by John Maynard Keynes Keynes wrote of            Thosenewspaper competitions in which the competitors have to pick out the sixprettiest faces from a hundred photographs the prize being awarded to thecompetitor whose choice most nearly corresponds to the average preferences ofthe competitors as a whole  It is not a case of choosing those which tothe best of ones judgement are really the prettiest nor even those whichaverage opinion thinks the prettiest We have reached the third degree where wedevote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects theaverage opinion to be And there are some I believe who practise the fourthfifth and higher degrees            An example of Keynes point Suppose ATT stock tradesat  A group of optimistic but thickheaded investors suspects that a shareof ATT is actually worth  Most investors are skeptical correctlydivining that future earnings justify a price of only  But if some skepticssuspect that optimists will buy ATT for  then these skeptics will buyATT and drive the price to say  The fact that the market newlycontains optimists and speculating skeptics moves another group of moreconservative skeptics to start buying driving the price to even thoughthe new group believes the stock is only worth  After all its OK to buy astock you know to be overvalued as long as someone elseit doesnt matterwhether its a skeptic or an optimistwill pay even more for it            The process iteratesbringing more and more investors aboard until someone gets spooked aboutfinding a speculating skeptic or an idiotic optimist who will continue thegame The result is often a precipitous selloff Keynes writes The actualprivate object of the most skilled investment today is to beat the gun asthe Americans so well express it to outwit the crowd and to pass the bad ordepreciating halfcrown to the other fellow            Keynesbelieved that this kind of speculation was pernicious The reason is that itdiverts attention from something called enterprise by which Keynes means thedevelopment of real operating businesses Can a similar argument apply to thevoting example It is indeed troubling that Clinton could be driven out byvoters who dont necessarily deplore his conduct Something smells rotten aboutthe idea that you must surrender your opinion to your neighbor The realpolity like the real economy ought to be what counts
