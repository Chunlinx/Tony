                                 Que Happenin                        Good morning Jesse            Its no surprise to me that there are language issues in the news In myexperience everybodyexpert and amateur alikehas something to say about thestate of the language            For example todays Times has a story on the need to know Spanish ifyou live in New York front page above the foldcan it be that Spanish isreplacing French as the prestige second language And Education Weekreports today that the NAEP the National Assessment of Educational Progressis planning to test American schoolchildren on their knowledge of Spanish TheNAEP regularly tests reading writing and math issuing national report cardson how our schools are doing in these subjects The  Writing Report Cardwhich came out just last month reported this scary news The writing abilityof half the American schoolchildren is below average Anyway the proposed testof Spanish will be the NAEPs first foreignlanguage test Other minoritylanguages are also in the news Todays Arizona Republic reports on thefirst urban highschool class in the Navajo language a move to stem the lossof Navajo among the young Native Americans who move to the city YesterdaysNew York Times carried an article on minoritylanguage revival inEuropeparticularly Breton in France the head of the French Academy objectsthat this will only dilute the purity of French And the San FranciscoChronicle reports that Whatshappenincom is suing Quepasacom for trademarkinfringement arguing that Que pasa has become so transparent that we allknow it means Whats happenin As a predictable response to this resurgenceof interest in minority languages todays Toledo Blade runs a letterurging that English become the official language of the country As if a lawcould get people to alter their language            But back to your comments Yesterdays New York Times ran anotherarticle on Lewinsky and on political slang in general And I know that youcommented on Lewinsky in a recent New York Post story Speaking ofLewinsky I happened by sheer accident to be spacing out in front of the TVlast night watching a rerun on the USA Network of Law  Order SpecialVictims Unit  when I heard the Lewinsky reference that sparked the seniorLewinskys lawsuit I found it amusing that the writers of this new serieschose a euphemism where elsewhere they have been much more blunt Of coursethe series title Special Victims Unit  is itself a euphemism It refersto sex crimes something that didnt occur to me till I saw the first episodeClearly they used Lewinsky for political shock value and to draw attentionto their new showand why I ask you is a brandnew show already in reruns ona competing network Anyway I dont think Lewinsky as a verb or a noun hasthe staying power of something like Heimlich another eponym word named aftera person for those who are reading over our shoulders involving one persondoing something physical to another Of course while a future episode ofSpecial Victims Unit may choose to become more explicit about thismaneuver you wont see diagrams of how to perform a Lewinsky in restaurantsall over the country            As for the Margalit Fox article you mention I did read it and found it aninteresting summary of what we might call the linguists dilemma People wantlinguists to tell them how to be correct but at the same time they resistintervention taking the attitude Who are you to tell me what to do It mayseem like a nowin situation for us But its also possible to see this as anatural part of the linguistic give and take or what a theorist might call thesocial construction of language            I missed the angry response letters to the Fox essay Maybe they didntprint them in the Midwest edition of the Times  or maybe I was absentthat day But they dont surprise me I get angry mail every time I try topoint out peoples inconsistent language attitudes Last month I wrote an OpEdpiece about Louisianas new law requiring students to call their teachers Siror Maam The Louisiana state representative who drafted the law said therewas a similar requirement in the states prisons and he thought it worked sowell he wanted to extend it to the schools In my essay I pointed out thatlanguage is difficult to regulate People just dont want to use language theway other people tell them to I also observed that people used to want schoolsto be less like prisons but that now the trend seems to be to make them morelike prisons adding language regulation to crowd control uniforms metaldetectors and locker searches In response I got an angry letter from areader telling me I ought to be in prison for writing what I did            So I have come to realize over a long career of such angry letters thatpart of my job is to encourage people to look critically at language use andpart of my job is to get people angry            Dennis
