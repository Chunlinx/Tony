                                 Viagra Creep            The craziest idea comingout of the Viagra frenzy is that its somehow scary and wrong for healthinsurers to limit reimbursement for the drug Many insurers will pay for theerection wonder pills only for men who are tested by a urologist and proved tohave organicnot psychologicalerectile dysfunction Some insurers are alsolimiting the number of pills they will pay for to  each month some evenfewer and a few none at all            Commentators on talk shows and news programs are incensed by the limitsalthough no one yet complains that Medicaid programs are likely to refusereimbursement altogether Get the insurers out of our bedrooms is therallying cry But not so fast As Dr Michael OLeary a Harvard urologist andexpert on sexual dysfunction told the Wall Street Journal  Im notconvinced that its a Godgiven right to have an excellent erection            Viagra is just the latest in the boom ofquality of life technologies that aim to enhancerather than savelivesSuch treatments as Viagra Propecia for hair loss and fertility treatmentspose a distinct problem for insurers True the treatments address biologicallycaused problems but ones that are hardly incapacitating Still there is noclear distinction between these disorders and such accepted medical problems asacne or vitiligo a disorder of skin pigmentation If severe enough evenwrinkling or hair loss can be considered medical problems So these new drugserode accepted distinctions between worrisome abnormalities and the normalvariations of human life While the drugs push in one direction the insurerspush in the other            BeforeViagra the hoist and pull mechanics of previous impotencetreatmentsinflatable penile implants Caverject erection injections andvacuum devicesmade them unattractive to most men impotent or not Viagra bycontrast is simple and offers discretion Instead of creating erections on itsown it amplifies the signals mens bodies already have The mechanics ofViagra have been widely reported Click for a reminder The results inimpotent men are better longer lasting erections and more satisfying sex            These effects might also occur in perfectlyable men Some are already seeking the drug in the hope that they can sustainrepeat performancesand theyre filing claims One HMO executive even had aclaim from a young man for a Viagra prescription he had procured to enhance hisweddingnight performance At the very least insurers should be allowed todistinguish these kinds of claims from others            Toughercases became evident to me during a visit I made to OLearys urology clinicThat afternoon some two dozen patients ranging from  to  years of age werelined up for Viagra I joined him in seeing a few Each patient bashfully leftthe impotence literature and Playboy magazines in the examining roomsuntouched OLeary is one of the few Americans who can take a tax deductionfor pornography But the urologist didnt beat around the bush Are you herefor Viagra was his opening question to each patient Everyone replied yesseeming relieved to have the doctor raise the subject            One patient Ill call him George Davis wasaround  obese and hadnt had sex with his wife in over three years becauseof difficulty getting erections a problem almost certainly related to hisdiabetes At some age most people would say impotence is normal As many as percent of yearold men and probably over  percent of yearolds areunable to obtain andor maintain a satisfactory erection for intercourseBefore Viagra many werent quite ready to accept their decline but few wereready to accept the treatments Sex wasnt important enough So insurers werehappy to let men define for themselves whether their impotence was worrisome ornot Now a little blue pill might do the trick Davis wasnt sure if he waswilling to pay  a pop But he figured his insurance would cover it so whynot give it a try Davis was a walking demonstration of every insurersnightmare            We dontthink people should have to worry about cost when deciding whether to undergotreatment for cancer or arthritis But for the lifeenhancing technologiestheres nothing wrong if insurers say that at some point cost should comeinto play If Davis is willing to pay  for say a bottle of wine but notfor sex why should the insurer pay If these expensive new drugs were freepeople would demand amounts out of all proportion to the value they actuallyplace on them            But qualityoflife drugs have social sideeffects that are potentially more troubling than the cost strains The sneakything about Viagra for example is that its so straightforward it makesnot treating impotence seem as strange as not treating pneumonia Viagralowers the bar on whats medically abnormal Indeed all the qualityoflifedrugs do In a current ad barrage manufacturers encourage people to ask yourdoctor about drugs for unsightly nails The prescription skin cream Renova ishawked for wrinkles BristolMyers Squibb is testing a drug to reverse sundamage in skin And of course who can miss the ads for Propecia All thesedrugs treat problems that most people hadnt considered medical before            Insurers will try as they must to counter the tendency of qualityoflifedrugs to redefine abnormality upward But the insurers are fighting anirresistible force The drugs play on the inevitablesome say genetichumandesire for youth and immortality As each new drug is released on a wave ofhype insurers will fight the deluge but patients will clamor and doctorswill go along            The transformation of normal to abnormal maystart with a pill But the physicians need for diagnosis is what drives theprocess Since the new qualityoflife drugs can have adverse health effectsthe drugs need to come through physicians But we dont give out drugswillynilly We must provide a medical reasona diagnosis So we callimpotence erectile dysfunction baldness hypotrichosis and so on Therapid increase in attentiondeficit disorder is a striking example of diagnosiscreep The disorder hardly seemed to exist before the stimulant Ritalin camealong A core group of kids do have a distinct attention abnormality butRitalin worked so wellit can reduce distractibility even in perfectly normalchildrenthat now almost any difficult child is considered for the diagnosisand drug A  study found that  percent of children diagnosed with thedisorder didnt actually meet the definition Nevertheless the percentage ofchildren on Ritalin has doubled since then            Bygiving a patients condition a medical name we turn it into a medicalabnormality That creates a presumption that insurers must pay It also createsa presumption that it will be treated If I write a new diagnosis in apatients chart I have to indicate what I plan to do about it Itd bemalpractice not to More than that once a condition is established as adiagnosis society practically treats it as a crime not to do something aboutit            This raises an ironic prospect Qualityoflife drugs offernot just the pleasing possibility that you can do something aboutimpotence baldness blackened toenails They create a culture in which youmust fight against these conditionseven if it means risking seriousside effects the antifungal drugs for nails can damage the liver Propeciasantitestosterone action can

are less than perfectly endowed                           If youmissed the sidebar on how Viagra works click
