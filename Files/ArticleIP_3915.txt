                       The FactCheck Is in the Mail                        I disagree with my friendJack Shafer Glass Houses that fact checking doesnt protect magazines fromyoung writers who make things up It does just as it protects magazines fromold writers who get things wrong no matter how many years theyve been at itWhen someone reports a complicated story for many weeks or even months stuffhappensnotes get confused memories fail Once the story is turned in itsthe job of the editor to try to separate what is clearly not true from what mayor may not be Beyond that the fact checker is a safety net Anything theeditor doesnt catch the checker does from misspelled names to lapses inlogic that only a fresh set of eyes can recognize            When I was deputy editor ofthe New Republic during a sevenmonth period of apostasy in  therewere no fact checkers it was before the whole Ruth Shalit business so thefact checking department that Jack describes did not exist In fact havingcome from a magazine that rigorously fact checks every word of every story Ihad several conversations with fellow editors about why such a system wasnt inplace at TNR  No one could tell me but more than one person mentionedan article called Are You Completely Bald It had run in TNR in thelate s and it mocked the very notion of fact checking as unnecessary andstupid The coauthor of that piece was Rich Blow then a TNR internnow an editor at George  Rich dumped Steve Glass as a Georgewriter following last weeks revelations Its a small small world            If ChuckLane says that TNR now routinely fact checks stories I take him at hiswordbut it seems inconceivable to me that someone fact checked Glass HackHeaven story if the subject of the story wasnt called and the company heworked for wasnt contacted Simply consulting the writers notes aint factchecking             Evan Smith Deputyeditor Texas Monthly                                       Ahead ofthe Curve                        In a profile of Glenn LouryGlenn Lourys RoundTrip Paul Krugman writes Since The Bell Curve was published ithas become clear that almost everything about it was inexcusably wrong suspectdata mistakes in statistical procedures that would have flunked asophomore            While thisis true it misses the most interesting aspect of that very bad book Viewedsolely on the technical merits The Bell Curve is no worse than manymore reputable examples of social science research Many of the mistakes madeby Murray and Herrnstein are made routinely by scholars across the politicalspectrum The public policy literature is filled with confused causal modelingand the use of flimsy though grandly named variables such as socioeconomicstatus that dont mean what the authors think they do Murray and Herrnsteinare hardly alone in presenting sweeping policy conclusions based on the narrowcorrelations found in one limited data set It is only the largeness of thetopics explored that exposes the smallness of method Murray and Herrnsteinemployed This book masquerades as reputable social science which it is notHowever the ease with which The Bell Curve assumes this guise may be assobering as

assume some bias on the part ofits author Associate Editor Franklin Foer            The statement that CarynMann recovered her memory and estimated Parker Dozhiers payments to Hale at is contradicted by the very Salon article Foer cites to supportit Mann said that it was Dozhier who received approximately The authors claim that she backed down from that number in later interviewsnot cited is thus groundless            Foer also neglected tomention that Manns credibility is bolstered by the FBIs decision after apreliminary investigation of her charges to refer them to the JusticeDepartment            Thetheory that Hale was just hanging around Dozhiers bait shop looking for handouts is contradicted by another allegation that Foer failed to mentionHale and Dozhier met on several occasions with American Spectator boardmember Stephen Boynton and David Henderson vice president of theSpectator s funding foundation The FBI agents who escorted Hale on eachof his visits to Dozhiers bait shop should be able to testify as to whetherthose meetings took place if they did not it seems unlikely the FBI wouldhave referred the matter to the Justice Department             RobertLauriston                                       FranklinFoer responds Let me answer your criticisms in order                                        In the first Salon article Caryn Mann makes no specific estimateof how much money Dozhier received In the second Salon article which came six days later she givesthe  estimate for the first time Mann admitted to the WashingtonPost that the estimates she gave Salon were imprecise andinconsistent She told the Post  Im not an attorney I spent more thana year trying to forget this and now Im trying to remember it                                        My piece specificallymentions the letter written by Eric Holder of the Justice Department in whichhe called for a Justice Department investigation of Manns charges                                        The theory that Halewas simply hanging around Dozhiers bait shop isnt mine I credit it toother reporters who investigated the allegations                                        Onelast point My brief piece made it amply clear that Hale was thick with theAmerican Spectator crowd                                       TheFourth Letter We Printed This Week                        Why do youprint so few
