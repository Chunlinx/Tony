        you go ahead and start or i will whichever you prefer     okay um well i the thing i like to do the most is swim and i was doing that real regularly but i am expecting right now       and sick and uh so i have kind of slowed down a little bit but anyway thats the thing that ive found works the best for me is is just doing lap swimming   well me i play i love playing basketball and volleyball   oh do you   i do and i play well i played a lot until i hurt my shoulders this summer playing volleyball and they havent come back to full swing yet so i havent been able to play as much as i would have liked to but   oh did you play in high school   no in Texas they dont have um they dont have volleyball i played basketball but not on the school team   oh uhhuh   just played a lot recreational i didnt have i worked so so i didnt really have time but   oh yeah   its i love actually athletics is really for me its a great thing to do i do it one to keep in shape and two just to to not stress its my release of tension   oh well i know my husband likes to do that he plays racquetball too yeah uhhuh he still does some   oh does he   hes hes played it since i guess he was in college and then um he plays uh two or three times a week so hes a member of the Sports Mall in Salt Lake and hell go on his noon hour and   uhhuh   he still likes to do that so that i know that thats one thing that he likes to do and i think that relieves stress too   thats awesome   yeah   do you guys mostly just exercise to release stress or to relax or   oh well i think i do it for uh weight reasons i mean you know to   uhhuh   so you dont gain weight but        and also i i know i feel a lot better when i do   yeah   but i like i said i have just been really sick and and just cant im just almost too tired i i was going um in the mornings   umhum   and that   well i tell you having a kid is rough isnt it   what   from what i hear having a kid is rough   well yeah we we have also have an eleven month old and a six year old and and so its just kind of   oh my     um its finding the time for me to exercise is another thing but i really do like to do it   uhhuh   but   well great   anyway   youre a brave woman to do all that   oh jeez well the the kids kind of keep me exercising too   thats true there   just chasing after them i guess yeah so you do you have much time to do that since youre in college now     um i make time really if i if i dont make time my study habits or actually i dont my studying doesnt go as well i cant concentrate and so   and so it just kind of helps to work it in there huh   yeah and really its if i dont if i do it i i feel like i get a lot more accomplished in a day than if i dont   huh well   and so its its for me it just is worthwhile to find time to even if for half an hour just to get out and run   yeah i think thats probably true with anything when you work some exercise in it just seems like things seem to go more smoothly i dont know   yeah   that should be a part of i guess everybodys daily things   i tend to agree i think it makes it a lot better for the person as well as as for a couple if youre married or if youre anything like that it just helps to i dont know to have something to do   oh i know my husband wants me to take up golf thats another thing he does and uh you know i dont know that i see that as a real big exercise though     yeah   i dont know ive ive been a few times but thats something i am really bad  i mean you know       it takes me a million strokes to get it in so   thats right thats me too and im supposed to be good at it so   oh  so you do golf huh   i do no i try ill put it that way im not very good i i     uhhuh   i enjoy it just because again it gets me out it gets me away from every all the stresses of school and work and   oh yeah well do you ski   i do   uhhuh   thats something i really enjoy i especially now that the snows good this year   oh   been a few times and really enjoyed it its its amazing how each exercise works on a different part of your body i never realized you know i thought basketball basically covered it all but after i skied a few times ive just been dead   have you oh yeah you felt some muscles that you  oh i havent been skiing for years   uhhuh oh really   huhuh uh not downhill we do have cross country skies and     uhhuh   and i i enjoy that but i dont know downhill i was always real bad at that too and its just the thoughts of it kind of scare me       i was one of these out of control   uhhuh   skiers but       well   its
