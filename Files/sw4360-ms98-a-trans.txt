        um       lets see how about um lets see about ten years ago um what do you think was different ten years ago from now   well i would say as far as social changes go um i think families were more together they they did more things together uh they ate dinner at the table together um   umhum   the the parents usually took out time um you know more time than they do now to come with the children and and just spend the day doing a family activity   uhhuh   um although im not a mother i i still think that um a lot has changed since ten years ago um what do you think about that   what do you well uh actually ten years from today seems rather short   yeah   um but i do agree that uh generally its society has sort of uh lets see rushed everything ahead   umhum   and uh i dont know it leaves leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that in other words they just prioritize their lives differently but i think that has a lot to do with economic situations   yes what about like as far as um social changes in the individual do you think that the individual has as much time as they did lets say ten twenty years ago   uh hm it depends uh its hard to say because i think people were busy ten twenty years ago too   umhum   um i just   well how how old are you   im twenty eight   twenty eight okay im twenty three   yeah   so theres maybe a five year gap between us   yeah   so um   i just i think that things were a bit were have been busy all along its just a matter where priorities are at placed   huh yes   and that um usually as far as families are concerned there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home   umhum   and now uh its pretty much an economic necessity of for most in most places for both parents to work   do you think its an economic crisis necessity or do you think that were were uh all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living   i think thats part of it too but i do think   i mean do you think people really need two cars and     no no i dont   a house in the suburbs or   no i dont think that but then there are a lot of people that that dont have that   umhum   that that really do need to work   umhum   i think maybe those people that really do need to work both parents just to  survive and then there that is is that other group that is working to maintain a standard of living that um   yeah umhum okay   they think is is surviving  which is really more luxuries um but i i tend to think that   umhum   its less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive   you so you think its uh which group are you saying is the one trying   im saying that the uh the group that is just trying to survive from day to day where both parents are working   umhum   is more of the majority than the than the people that have the higher standard of living because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the uh decreasing um middle class in this country   umhum   i think that thats in my opinion the case     okay   so i mean i have met people that uh both that that just want to maintain a the standard of living and those that that really need the job   okay and then sometimes i i often uh find that   so   maybe theres so many different things available to us  a microwave a VCR a answering machine um   umhum   you know a special a dishwasher um a refrigerator and some of those items um for the for the um well i guess were sticking more to social changes but um   uhhuh   people want all of that and not all of those are necessities   right   so theyre trying to it has become a necessity
