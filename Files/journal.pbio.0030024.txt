                            Armed with billions of cells elaborate circuitry and a seemingly animate anatomy        capable of growing as it learns the brain is a marvelously enigmatic organ Much to the        chagrin of those that study it the brain remains perhaps too mysterious        Although genetic information exploded out of the Human Genome Project it has been of        little consequence to neurosciencea discipline still grappling with the boundaries and        names for distinct brain regions According to United States National Institute of Mental        Health Director Thomas Insel over  of the neuroscience literature focuses on only  of        the estimated  genes expressed in the brain David Van Essen a neurobiologist        at Washington University in St Louis Missouri likens the current genetic map of the        brain to a th century map of Earth A voyage around the Earth had already proven it was        round but landmass resolution was still vague at best        Magellans benefactors though never bankrolled a technical advance quite like the        Allen Brain Atlas Neurosciences unlikely sugar daddy Microsoft cofounder and the worlds        fifth wealthiest man Paul Allen created the  million dollar Allen Brain Institute in        Seattle Washington two years ago The first explicit goal of the institute was to create        an openaccess visual searchable online map of genes expressed in the brain as well as        of brain circuitry and cell location Roughly one petabyte of dataequal to the memory        necessary to hold the information held in about  Libraries of Congresswill be produced        as a result        In midDecember the first  genes were uploaded By  the Allen team plans to        have as many as  genes online While the ultimate goal is to map the human brain the        atlas ushers in a new era of neurogeneticsan attempt to make connections between        anatomical genetic and behavioral observations                    Of Mice and Men        The initial effort will focus on the standard inbred lab mouse strain known        affectionately as CBL Like it or not mice are remarkably similar to humanssharing         of our genes Humans at this time provide too many hurdlesnot the least of which is a        lack of willing brain donors that are the same age Since the CBL strain is inbred the        mice are also much more uniform than humansa key to constructing the most accurate        representative map possible of one species adult brain        With a map of mouse genes in hand scientists will be able to develop informed        hypotheses about genes that may affect human brain function and dysfunction People will        be able to look first in the mouse atlas then more selectively focus on human cases says        Gregor Eichele director of the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Endocrinology in        Hannover Germany Indeed researchers may do well to focus their efforts on those specific        cells in which homologous genes are expressed in the mouse Insel suggests an initial        mental health application find         dyspyndin  a gene linked to schizophrenia Insel is banking on the atlas        to locate genes linked to conditions including bipolar disorder schizophrenia and autism        Once identified such critical genes can be examined in detail and used in studies aimed at        disease cures or drug screens Presumably the atlas will be a boon for drug discovery and        development by providing information on drug targets present within brain cells        Eichele points out that the Allen Brain Atlas will eliminate time wasted testing        fruitless hypotheses If you think gene X may be involved in hippocampaldependent        memory but its not expressed in the hippocampus you shouldnt bother following that line        of research he says Insel agrees that where genes are expressed in the brain will be        most telling In the brain more than any other organ function follows form he        says        Cellular resolution of expression patterns will prove necessary to uncover as yet        unknown relationships between circuitry cell type and gene expression in the brain says        Arthur Toga a neuroscientist at the University of California Los Angeles and Allen Brain        Atlas advisor Ed Lein a neuroscientist at the Allen Brain Institute thinks that mapping        at the cellular scale will also redefine anatomy Traditionally neuroanatomists have        delineated brain regions pretty much by eye identifying clusters of cells and patterns of        connections that look the same Were starting to redefine boundaries of regions by cell        type says Lein defining cell type by gene expression pattern        The difficulty according to Allen Brain Institute scientific advisor David Anderson a        neuroscientist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena California is in        understanding how a gene mutation affects behavior It is impossible without a knowledge        of the circuits in which a gene is expressed he says Anderson himself studies innate        behaviors such as fear responses Specifically hes most interested in understanding the        function of different regions of the almondshaped amygdala Once he finds genes expressed        in neurons within regions of the amgydala implicated in fear he plans to determine neuron        function by creating transgenic animals in which specific neuron activity has been        silenced        Thus far Andersons laboratory has endured the slog of using microarray techniques to        identify genes with expression patterns linked to fear behavior followed by in situ        hybridization which traditionally involves twentyodd complex errorprone steps to find        just some of the genes expressed in different parts of the amygdala The Allen Brain Atlas        will identify a whole set of genes that we would have had to spend several years to find        he says Indeed locating where even one gene of interest is expressed in the brain eats up        valuable research time especially when there are so many potentially interesting genes In        most cells  genes can be expressed        Eichele improved the slow errorprone process into an automated fast high throughput        method that caught the attention of the Allen team because it was capable of meeting the        needs of such an ambitious project In situ hybridization uses labeled probes for specific        messenger RNA sequences allowing scientists to test individual brain tissue samples for        gene expression        Automated in situ hybridization data will be generated for the entire mouse        transcriptomethe full complement of activated genes in a particular tissue at a particular        timeon a genomewide scale The mouse is a young adult at  days old free from the        confounding factors of development After it is sacrificed the mouse brain is immediately        frozen then sliced very thinlyto get forty sections from each millimeter of thicknessso        that the probes for hybridization can expose gene expression in individual cells                    Mining the Mind for Riches        The in situ data will be matched in a threedimensional framework to the reference atlas        developed by Allens team The resulting images will be turned into a virtual microscope        allowing users to focus down on genes expressed in regions of interest        While the Allen Brain Atlas is somewhat like other genomics projects in scale it is        unique No ones gone into a D structure like a tissue and examined it in a systematic        way says Allan Jones senior director of Allen Brain Atlas Operations In that way he        adds its a much richer dataset than the Human Genome Project As were ramping upfully        by spring of next yearwell be generating about  microscope slides a day with four        mouse brain sections on each slide says Jones Each day those sections are scanned and        stitched together electronically into megabyte batches Scaling up a lab process is        currently the biggest challenge says Jones In effect were turning an art form into        something that gives highquality data day in and day out says Jones If you are off        slightly when cutting a D brain slice it becomes very difficult to map back into a D        context        While it is a logical starting point a spatial understanding of gene expression is just        one way to mine the brain Other avenues currently being pursued explore individual        variability development and comparisons between species See Box  The sheer        comprehensive nature of the Allen Brain Atlas will be its crowing achievement and its        complement to the other ongoing atlas efforts However the magnitude of the project also        poses its greatest hurdleabout which onlookers have expressed some concern        Its clear that they want to do a firstrate job of working with all this information        but Im not sure they entirely appreciate how hard its going to be to manage the        staggering amount of information theyre getting says Van Essen As manager of his own        comparative anatomy database he understands the magnitude of the task He points out that        properly digitizing the data in electronic form and registering one particular slice to a        standardized reference with meaningful coordinates is not trivial        In an atlas there will be considerable variability from one individual to the        nexteven in inbred mouse strains says Van Essen Even if its only  variability it        is still going to pose challenges for managing experimental data Van Essen acknowledges        that this isnt just an impediment for Allens team but for neuroscience as a whole        These tools in general dont emerge from a vacuum They emerge best when rich        challenging datasets are staring people in the face he says        An even larger problem is communicating the data effectively Figuring out how to        navigate the tremendous morass of data will be a bioinformatic stumbling block Lein        acknowledges that figuring out how to best annotate the data is one of the bigger        challenges for the futureparticularly in cases where gene expression doesnt match the        agreedupon boundaries of anatomical regions        For now users will be able to mine the data by gene name only The initial release        consists of an image viewer to view the in situ hybridization data for one or several genes        at a time along with a reference atlas to determine the structures in which genes are        expressed Future releases will allow the user to conduct more sophisticated searches such        as by anatomical structures        Not only is there this D structure but there are lots of studies where people are        trying to understand what drives the turning on and off of genes says Jones At the end        if the atlas has a big impact it will be in providing the precise coordinates for those        people to tease apart what specific DNA elements drive expression within regions or        structures        And while the Allen Brain Atlas will provide a fine level of detail there are        limitations Much like the Human Genome Project the information will be the starting point        and not the end point of understanding brain function It wont change strategy for doing        experiments says Nobel laureate and Columbia University neuroscientist Eric Kandel The        atlas will be a catalyst rather than a direction setter                    The Final Frontier        Overall neuroscience is entering a new era Insel notes that recent work has proven the        brain to be extraordinarily dynamic birthing neurons throughout a lifespan Brain        functions seem more modular than global And there is no real separation between the mind        and brain Mental disorders are brain disorders he says        Over the next  years neurogenomics will fuel a golden age of discovery in        neuroscience In fact scientists may even reach an overarching goalunderstanding how the        wild card of environment impacts brain function We want predictive genetics able to        accommodate environmental differences says Rob Williams neurobiologist at the University        of Tennessee in Memphis        For Kandel one thing is certain Most of the mysteries of the brain lie ahead of        us
