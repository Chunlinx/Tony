                okay ill let you go ahead   okay i uh i have five children all together   oh uhhuh   uh my oldest two are already out and about in the world and i uh have a set of twins that are fourteen and uh my youngest is twelve   oh thats great i always thought itd be great to have twins   uh yeah if you like doing everything twice   well yeah   uh at any rate um my first two children uh i didnt spend a whole lot of time with them   uhhuh   um and you know was a a problem with having five children needing to work a uh fulltime job that was more than a fulltime job i worked about fifty one hours a week because i worked every worked eleven hours every Sunday   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and uh so i didnt get to spend as much time with them as i as i should have as i really wanted to   your first ones you mean it was this way   yeah the yeah the family well it was with all of them but it was uh more an impact i think on the oldest two   uhhuh uhhuh   because um oh about the time i got out of working that long hours was when the uh when the twins were about three years old and uh they never you know i dont think they noticed i wasnt around that much you know with all the children around the house its kind of hard to notice that dad isnt around very much um   oh right     so what ive tried to do uh now that ive uh finally went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years old and uh so   uhhuh   then i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fifty one hours a week so ive tried to spend more time with uh the children since then um what im currently doing is uh taking a lot of time um   uhhuh uhhuh   helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings um we just started a thing where every other week we go to uh movies theres a movie theater that offers dollar movies on Wednesday nights   uhhuh   and so every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because thats how often they change the movies and   uhhuh   its working out pretty well um were spending more time together i feel like im a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than i ever was to the two that were living there before um   uhhuh   and in fact i found that im a lot closer with uh i have one son whos gone and i dont even know where hes at um hes taken off for parts unknown but uh yeah and and uh my   huh thats difficult yeah   daughter is um has moved out of the house her and i get along a lot better now that shes moved  out of the house   uhhuh  it happens that way     and uh so its its its its been difficult to try to find the time and i think its important that we do because um i notice that uh when i had spent two years down in Dallas down there they all have a uh a me kind of attitude   uhhuh   and i noticed parents not spending time with their children and and going out and doing things and you know i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine and   uhhuh um uhhuh   you know it just you know i saw the family falling apart down there   Texas is much worst for the drugs i mean it was bad enough every place else but drugs is in Texas are extremely bad   yeah and so i think its kind of important that i that i you know nurture the relationship i have with my children now and im doing my best to keep that up   uhhuh uhhuh well thats all you can do   yeah whats your been your experience   well i i was going to ask too does your wife work   um she didnt up until the last oh six months   uhhuh she just recently started working then   uh she just recently started working uh she worked a job until we moved to our new house and uh she quit that job because it was too inconvenient and uh she starts a new job tomorrow which should take her out of the house about four days a week   uhhuh uhhuh huh oh uhhuh uhhuh so that sounds great well uh we also have five children   huh   and but ours are all out of the nest  so uh as when they were growing up i probably we had a lot of similar things like like you had       you know having the time when you have younger ones to take care of you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones but uh we were were very active of course at church and uh Boy Scouting and Girl Scouts Four H   yeah   uh and those activities helped a lot in giving us things to do with the children   uhhuh   and uh we try to take a vacation with them every year camping of some sort something that wasnt expensive and uh our youngest is uh expecting her first baby so theyre theyre all out and on their own theyre and we have one to get married yet  and theyll all be married uh and theyre theyre all doing pretty good they uh two lives in Pittsburgh you probably dont know where that is   certainly do   okay two of our children live there uh one i like i said lives near Maryland in in around Maryland DC he works right on the border of DC   uhhuh   and one lives in Connecticut and our baby lives just a mile over the hill  so well get to see her a little more than uh what we do the other ones     yeah that sounds great ive ive noticed uh another thing um when i was younger my father was always working and   uhhuh well they have to   yeah and uh you know he uh he worked a fulltime job and a parttime job and i never saw him so i didnt have much of a role model to go by   yeah uhhuh uhhuh to go to follow uhhuh   you know to learn how to be a a father and a parent   uhhuh   and that kind of thing because i i cant ever remember playing ball with my dad or catch with my dad or doing anything with my dad   yeah uhhuh and that does make a big difference   yeah and it if you dont have i dont i its my feeling that if you dont have a role model to follow then its kind of tough you know everybodys not Father Knows Best   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh thats thats well none of us are lets face it you know were not none of us like they portray portray it on those shows i mean lifes much more difficult than that   yeah but yeah yeah yeah i mean the the the capability to uh create children doesnt necessarily mean you have the uh the mental capacity to raise them  and   and uh right right now our daughter our well shes our second oldest she has shes the only that other one that has children she has two boys and she works full time and i have mixed feelings about that shes able to do that and i dont know if shed be happy to stay at home but yet on the other hand i ive got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children im kind of old fashioned i guess that way but they seem to they seem to give uh quality time   yes   to those children when they are together and and so it seems it seems for them that it works out all right so i dont know i i dont think i ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family i   yes its its not easy ive uh you know ive helped out extremely   yeah   uh well i cant say that but ive helped out  as best i could at home and uh you as you know with five children it takes a lot of work   uhhuh uhhuh yes it does it it yeah   even if even if someones home all the time theres still a lot of things that have to be done   yeah what line of work are you in now since you went to school and   uh well now i work for Texas Instruments so so im in computers   oh okay okay a lot of the people ive thats called ive talked to work for uh for the same   yeah and so ive uh prior to that i uh i worked in a food store   uh uhhuh   and uh you know work   which your income would be a lot better now   uh right   yeah   yeah it uh it was uh it was a a smart move to make um i was more intelligent than the position i was holding   uhhuh uhhuh right   and uh it was   and its kind of a waste of a person   yes i i felt that it certainly was i mean i was smarter than most of the people that i was working for and uh you know every time something new came up i was explaining it to them and uh i had   you know uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh and you you recognized this and was able to you know do something about it   yeah i uh yeah i uh started back to school in fact i was going to school while i was working fifty one hours a week and thats why i you know if youre working if youre taking twelve credits at night and youre working fifty one hours a week theres not much time left to spend with   uhhuh well it puts a strain on everybody your wife and your family   yeah   and the only thing you can remember is to  try and stay together as much as you can because its very easy to uh become go your own direction when youre so when youre working so hard and going to school too     yeah yeah well it it all paid off um so uh you know i got my degree and got the better paying job and   well thats wonderful uhhuh   and uh you know we i think as a family were a lot better off   uhhuh it sounds to me like uh youre doing well my husbands retired so uh hes been retired for three years now yeah thats quite a change   uhhuh   yeah well my goal is to try to retire by the time im fifty five   oh well he made it at fifty  it was a magic number for him and and uh he went at fifty and he still works part time at other thing you know   great   same job as he was doing only hes retired and doing it independently but uh   uhhuh   nevertheless retired   well im
