                                 Letters to the Summer Tenants            Aug              DearPs            Im so glad you enjoyed yourstay on the island We were delighted to arrive after our long trip yesterdayand find everything in such fine shape It is always such a pleasureafter thefuss with the boat the baggage and the groceriesto walk the porches and towatch the sun set behind the lighthouse to the west the moon rise from thetinted sea to the east the water darken and cap with white in the south Ofcourse you probably didnt spend much time on the deck looking south becauseof the smell from the garbage cans            Well theyre all clean nowthough it did take some scrubbing Next year I must make sure to leave you alarger supply of the gallon can liners I know Ive left you notes about theothers being too small which means the lobster shells and fish juices spillover and mix with the chewing gum and pasta in the bottom of the can You canbuy the liners right in the harbor at the supermarket though I suppose it iseasier to grab the gallon size And with all the guests you have whileyoure here Im sure time must be at a premium            I did find a minute to relaxin a rocker on the porch this morning to watch the seabirds and admire whatsleft of the garden Its amazing what a little watering will do for theflowers in a dry summer like this one Unfortunately I didnt realize untilit was too late that one of the spokes holding the left rocker had come looseand that someone had tossed it away You know its really easy to reglue thatsort of thing before the whole frame collapses and the rattan tearsbut Isuppose it does make handy kindling I noticed there were only a couple ofbeads of the carving left when I cleaned the fireplace But I didnt reallyhurt myselfone always picks up a few bumps and scrapes around the house            Manythanks for the bottles of wine I can see from all the empty cartons that youmust have enjoyed it too Hope youre having a great summers end            As ever etc            Aug              DearPs            It struck me this morningthat you can see water from every window of the cottage I noticed this as Iwas moving the furniture on the second floor back into the bedrooms Its easyto sort outas youve probably noticed when restoring the paint on all theold pieces I colormatched them to the bedspreads and rugs Oh and dontworry I did finally find all the rugs No doubt theyll dry out in time and beas good as new You know its not a bad idea to close the windows when itrains            Oh say Idont want to be intrusive but if your guests do get into another knife fightor whatever its really easy to get the blood splatters out of the whitefrilled curtains if you wash them in cold water right away You can just throwthem in the washing machine if the kids sandy clothes havent stripped thegears yet            All the best etc            Sept              DearPs            I just thought Id dropanother line to remind you for next year that the cottage is made of wood Theshingles the tongueingroove paneling the polishedpine floors are all oldwood That means they burn very easily So Do not lean the pleated shade onthe bedside lamp against the bulb while it is lighted As you have no doubtnoticed after two such experiments in consecutive years when you do that theshade melts and finally burns Left long enough the burning shade will set thehouse on fire I assume you leave the house when you conduct these littletrials but there is always the chance that someone else may have lingered            By the way if you think ofit next year dont let the kids remove the front legs of the pedestal sink inthe east bathroom and fill them with QTipschildren are so imaginative thesedays And if they must do it try not to discard the peculiar bolt fittings sothat I can put them backthey dont make that kind of sink anymore so partsare hard to find Ditto the handles on the bureau drawers I know they are oldand can come unscrewed But the nut will always fall inside the drawer so allyou have to do is thread it back on the screw and then tighten it Well Isuppose thats a bother on a vacation but wouldnt it be just as easy to putthe whole thing inside the drawer as in the wastebasket Speaking ofscrewingno no Im not concerned about the mattressesbut did anyone evershow you how to replace a light bulb There are lots of brand new ones in thesideboard in the dining room and I would have thought youd find itinconvenient to read or wash dishes in the dark            And speaking of washingdishes in the dark the Italian cook you brought with you this year must be agreat chef Of course great cooks dont usually make great cleaners But notto worry Ill get the grease off the pots and pans before we close the housefor the winter What a good thing though that I happened to look under thecast iron stove while searching for the corkscrew Otherwise Id never havefound the six bags of garlic and onions Theyll help fill up the composterwhich is really very empty after such a busy seasonI guess you didnt havetime to mind all those recycling rules posted at the town hall            Wellhave a great winter            Sincerely etc            PS The mail just cameHow thoughtful of you to have paid the rent a whole year in advance And thetiming couldnt be better as Ive just got the bills for the taxes andinsurance and the chapel and library and conservation society appeals and thedown payment on the roof reshingling I always tell myself how lucky I am tohave such wonderful guests as tenants
