preparing toravish a white maiden and Ku Klux Klanners galloping chivalrously to her aidIn True Crime  director Clint Eastwood demonstrates at once how far themedium has come in terms of race and how far it has backslid artisticallytoabout  As a white journalist played by Eastwood hastens to save aninnocent black man Isaiah Washington from execution for the murder of apregnant white conveniencestore cashier Eastwood cuts from the reporters carcareening around hairpin curves to poisonbearing tubes being inserted into theblack mans veins screeching car needle in vein screeching car poisondescending the tube screeching car clock going tickticktick glazedexpression on the dying mans face screeech  Not even Robert Altmanwho parodied this sort of climax in The Player  was cynical enough tolet his sellout filmmaker play the intravenous card            Melodramas like TrueCrime are all pretty much hustles but the good ones are stylish enough tomake you love the old song and dance This one tends toward unlovably brazenpokes and shoves yet there are moments mostly in the script when a highersensibility can be glimpsed through all the galumphing crumminess The filmsmost emblematic character is a beggar who trails people outside the offices ofthe Oakland Tribune yelling Gimme pussy on toast or Gimme money ontoast True                Crime gives you sleaze on toasta heap of tabloidbathos a dusting of highmindedness a dash of gallows humor Its a bizarreconcoction but its rivetingand I use that term advisedly in the sense of ahackemup serial killer riveting somebodys head to the side of a door            The film presents Eastwood as Steve Everett a philanderingexalcoholic with I swear that the movie exhumes this phrase a nose fortruth After a young female reporter whom Everett has plied with drink crashesher car on something called Dead Mans Curve the former New York hotshot isforced to fill in at a human interest interview with Frank BeachumWashington a mere eight hours before his scheduled San Quentin demise Thatsthe cue for what in movies is called a conversion narrative in which aheretofore lost soul pursues a seemingly lost causeand inevitably findsredemption            The script credited to Larry Gross Paul Brickmanand Stephen Schiff from a potboiler by Andrew Klavan is often laughablyschematic but much of whats outside its ramrod narrative is masterfullyorchestrated the physical exam on Beachum that begins the film hes inperfect health to be killed the meetings between the warden and his guards onexecution procedure the testing of the different colored phonesone connectedto the governors officeoutside the lethal injection chamber The raunchypatter between Eastwood and James Woods as his editor in chief might have madefor classic scenes if the former had known how to rein in the latter Woods hasballooned into such a selfcongratulatory grotesque that he now upstages hisown blowhard characters Two funny affecting sequences exploit every fatherspained awareness of his daughters unmet needs In one the besieged Everett isobliged to take his little girl to the zoo so he stuffs her into a cart andraces past the animals Speed Zoo while hollering out their namesat oncethrilling the child and endangering her life In the other Beachums daughtervisiting for the last time loses a green crayon she needs to draw grass andher mounting hysteria conveys her grief at the loss of her daddy moreeloquently than any direct expression ever could The scenes punch linetheprison guards comb the parking lot for the crayonmight be the best mostirrationally moving moment in the movie Unless that moment is Everetts retortto Beachums wife Lisa Gay Hamilton who cries out angrily as if confrontinga wayward savior Where were you all this time Shrugs the journalist by wayof expiation It wasnt my story            That the actor hascondemned so many killers to death with his caliber Magnum gives theliberal thrust of True Crime a certain piquancy Only Eastwood can go toSan Quentin But is he plausibly cast as a journalist As the taciturnprotagonist of vigilante pictures Eastwood could be a hoot and his struggleto articulate something clearly beyond his range resulted in the one truemultidimensional performance of his career the aging Secret Service agent ofIn The Line of Fire  But this is not a man who strikes meeitherin interviews or on the big screenas being at home with words His comicacting style is based on a gunfighters paranoia on letting others speak anddraw first the verbal forwardness of Everett sits uneasily on his yearoldframe In any case it has become painful to listen to Eastwood talk Thatvoice which never had much timbre has grown so raspy that you can practicallysee the flakes of his vocal cords swirling around his head like dandruff            Thats not an appetizing image but Im preparing you forRavenous  the cannibal saga I predict will elicit the most derisivereviews of any film this year Id like to recommend it but its too silly Onthe plus side its ravishingly well directed by Antonia Bird  Priest  who reportedly came on board two weeks after shooting had commenced andas such had little say about the thrust of the script She could not alter thecoven of frontier cannibals to say lapsed Catholic priests although I betthat the idea crossed her mind Even so the first half of Ravenous istantalizingly scary A captain Boyd Guy Pearce of LA Confidential  is decorated for heroism in the SpanishAmerican War and then exiled toan isolated fort high in the Sierra Nevada mountains of Californiaa seeminglygodforsaken place where at least in winter the only passersby are starvingwagontrainers Why exile a hero It seems that he initially played dead in theheat of battle then awoke to find himself lodged under a messy corpse theblood from which was running into his mouth Invigorated  la Popeye the SailorMan he proceeded to capture the enemy regiment singlehandedly Not a manyoud want to have hovering around your mess hall            Bird and her cinematographer Anthony B Richmondcreate a world of blinding white peaks and deep black crevices in which demonsmight lodgea world of humans driven batty from fear and isolation wherereaching out to other people sometimes takes the form of ingesting them Themetaphor would be better if left suggestive if the strange new appetites weresomehow the product of anxieties associated with American westward expansionismand Manifest Destiny But the second half of Ravenous is almostliterally a dumb vampire picture in which the chief vampire woos a reluctanthalfvampire who has pangs of conscience about cooking and eating his fellowmanJoin us You know you want to etc            By all means see Ravenous if your taste runsto bloody cannibal pictures I found it less of a grossout than sayYouve Got Mail  which would have benefited from a touch offlesheating Although Pearce brings little to the party but his cheekbonesJeffrey Jones makes a wonderfully mordant fort commander and RobertCarlylewho pops up out of the wilderness with burning eyes and a tale ofhaving been forced to cook and eat his horses dogs and travelingcompanionsmight turn out to be a major actor Carlyle looks like just thesort of fellow whod think it his duty to explore things that the rest of usdeep down want to know about but wouldnt dream of investigating ourselvesHes someone you could actually imagine taking aside and asking Er Roberttell me  does it really taste like pork
