        personally       prefer sports cars and responsive cars i like to uh to drive kind of fast i guess but im finding that as i get older im thinking that it would also be nice to have kind of a a nicer bigger maybe more luxurious luxurious car to have in addition to the one i already have   umhum what kind of car do you have right now   its a uh Dodge Daytona its a Shelby Z they only made them for for one year its really just a variation on the other Daytonas that they have out but im real happy with it   umhum umhum   its uh an eighty seven and its the first turbo charge car i ever owned and i was a little little reluctant about that because i heard things about uh other people that owned turbo charge cars that the turbo would break quite often be very expensive to fix but i havent had any problems with it   yeah i know my fatherinlaw has have a has a turbo charged uh engine on his truck and hes had some some problems with that   oh really   but um he put the turbo on himself and uh   uh   there was some problems right from the start with that   uhhuh how old is uh how old is the truck   well i think its probably about an eighty seven also   uhhuh   excuse me but i guess my tastes in vehicles are just a little bit different um um ive been more into just kind of a family car small uh not real big car uh   umhum   but lately weve been uh trying to get something thats a little bit more reliable so weve been going with uh Toyota vehicles lately   uhhuh   and im more into pick up trucks lately i i got myself uh myself a pick up truck last spring   oh   and im more interested in the the off road that kind of thing hauling things around   oh sure yeah we just recently bought a second car and we ended up getting a Jeep Wrangler   uh umhum   and uh its funny though because its this is actually my wifes car the Jeep and uh but its fun having four wheel drive capability and a rugged suspension like that to go out and do things   umhum   but were still finding that when we end up driving other people places that       it would be nice to have something where something roomier where people didnt have to duck their heads or scrunch their knees up and something that would ride a little more smoothly especially when when you travel   right   which we do a a fair bit of traveling   yeah i know we do a lot of that yeah on the road traveling and we we have a Toyota Camry for that kind of traveling   oh yeah   thats a little bit more comfortable its its not real fancy but its a lot more comfortable than a lot of the other vehicles weve had prior to that   yeah sure its uh i dont know when youre when youre used to one thing i guess something different always seems like it would be fun to have or nice to have   umhum   but   are you pretty satisfied with your Jeep as far as repair and reliability on it   yeah we havent had it for very long we got it in September right around uh Labor Day i guess it was and so it doesnt have a whole lot of miles on it yet   umhum   but uh up here in Rochester New York its nice to have a four wheel drive capability especially on days like today where we have about six inches of snow coming down out there   yeah yeah we just got that a few days ago here in Wisconsin so   yeah i was a little uh surprised to find i im not the sort of person thats going to go out and shop for exclusively for an American built car but i am the sort of person that feels good knowing that the car they like the best is American   umhum   made and American built but i was reading in the paper the other day that uh surprisingly enough a lot of cars that you think are American arent always and in fact they listed the Jeep Wrangler as being almost exclusively made in either Mexico or Canada   yeah   which isnt that far away but i it surprised me i always thought Jeep was about as American as you could get as far as manufacturing goes at least   well it kind of goes the other way with the vehicles that weve had because the Toyota we have now was built in i think Tennessee   really   and the uh before that we had a a Volkswagen Jetta which was made in Philadelphia or somewhere in Pennsylvania i think   yeah   so but you wouldnt think that just off the top of your head youd think theyre German or or Japanese made   no yeah yeah i guess you never know in fact they had a whole system uh decoding the vehicle identification number so you could figure out even right down to where the factory was which state the factory was in where it built   yeah i read that in the paper the other day   yeah   found that interesting   but    it was interesting   we used to have a Jeep a long time ago when we were first married and i i swore id never get one again because we had so many problems with it it was just a a a never ending uh stay at the the repair shop it just   oh really oh no oh really what sorts of problems did you have with it     well the carburetion never really worked quite right and there
