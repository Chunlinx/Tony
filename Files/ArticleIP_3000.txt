                                 The Ms Makeover            To call Ms a MediaEvent sounds less invidious than obvious Isnt that what all journalism is bydefinition and what even serious activism aspires to nowadays Mostsingleissue magazines can only dream about the eyecatching niche that GloriaSteinem and her fellow editors carved out for Americas first glossy feministpublication  years ago With the glamorous Steinem at its helmandintermittently on its cover Ms was just the promotional vehicle thefeminist movement needed to go mainstream            ButInside Ms  as you might expect of an authorized account of themagazine prefers to think of it as a Historic Event Mary Thom is herself astaff veteran who arrived as a researcher at the very start and went on toserve as executive editor under Editor in Chief Robin Morgan in the s Thomtouts her reliance on oral histories of many founders and longtime staffmembers It is clear that she aspires to a downinthetrenches record of apioneering endeavor that in her opinion transcended the ordinary boundariesof journalism As such Thom requires unconventional characters dauntingcircumstances and heroic goals all of which she does her best to supply            Hence Gloria Steinem one among a large cast ofpathbreakers struggling to fulfill an unorthodox dream Hence the many pagesdevoted to the uphill battles on the business end Unsurprisingly bolddetermination prevailed and a new kind of magazine was born Ms seemsmore like a social movement than a national magazine Thom writes The officeswere both a publishing enterprise and a center for activism Msrepresented a state of mind Ms was a feminist mecca A flood ofvisitors were eagerly greetedand vettedas potential recruits to the causeFunds flowed out from the coffers of the Ms Foundation for Womengiving fledgling feminist projects the boost they needed            Such anepic saga of political activism may have been what Thom meant to write butsoon enough she settles down into the blander form of the press release Hersis not the book to read for a serious assessment of the ideas in the manyarticles she makes sure to mention by author Her former colleagues she iswell aware will head straight for the index She rehearses the maincriticisms leveled against the magazine that it was politically conventionalemphasizing maledominated electoral politics and skirting controversy that itwas sentimental about sisterhood forever holding up individual women asinspirational role models But her reply to the critics consists of providingan exception or two to each of the complaints and then moving swiftly on Shedutifully describes the big dramas that got Ms  editors all riledupthe crusade for and defeat of the ERA the smear campaign in  by theradical Redstockings who attacked Steinem for work shed done a decade earlieron behalf of a liberal cause that had CIA backing the nationwide womensconference in Houston in  What may have been the larger philosophicalquestions behind these contretemps Here is Thoms idea of an answer Then astoday feminism was not an ideology set in stone but rather an adaptable setof attitudes and beliefs            And yet bromidic and blurry though thispublicrelations job is it is in its way not inaccurate For Steinem never wasan editor of the sharp analytic variety she was a repackager Her aim was notto subvert the womens magazine but to give it a makeover to translatefeminism into something familiar to the middle class Go back and reread theMs of the s and you rediscover how psychological howtoism forwomen at home became consciousnessraising for women newly out in the worldConfessional narrative became firstperson testimonial about the choices andchanges in womens lives In the copingwithchildren department the messagechanged from advice to mothers on say avoiding martyr complexes to adviceon lobbying for child care and avoiding gender stereotypes with sons anddaughters Softfocus messages about sexualitythe importance of pleasing yourmanbecame pointed discussion of abortion rights and the myth of the vaginalorgasm            By thes the positions had grown predictable  Ms was proabortion prodaycare proERA prowelfare rights proclitoral orgasm But it is no smalltribute to Ms that most of the issues it raised over the years arestill around Ms was among the first womens magazines to run piecesabout sexual harassment spousal abuse breast implants the economic impact ofdivorceall based on real reporting The formula was not original and didntpretend to besoft personal stories plus hard facts with someprescriptions for action It was service journalism and its depth and qualitywere uneven as it generally is with service journalism Ms also relieda great deal on book excerpts hardly a sign of bold editorialentrepreneurship As for Ms  political coverage crusades heavy onsymbolism preoccupied the staff through the s the ERA the Houstonconference If the magazine followed electoral politics a little doggedly itparticipated in gestural politics a little overenthusiastically In Crackingthe Womens Movement Protection Game in  a staff writer was honest enoughto acknowledge the journalisticand politicalpitfalls of such boosterismShe had puffed proERA forces although they were in complete disarray            Ms radical critics were right It was not in the businessof making sustained ideological arguments or issuing eccentric polemics Fewdistinctive writers emerged from the magazine though over the years manycontributed to it From the choice of name onward Ms  real specialtywas promotionabove all of a usable salable symbolism It probably didnthurt this larger endeavor that fellow founding editor Letty Cottin Pogrebinthe author of How to Make It in a Mans World  had a career as ahighpowered publicist behind her But it was Steinems inspirational role atMs that was the model for Ms  role with its readers She wasnot a theorist She was an icon a catalyst plugged in to American women viathe lecture circuit and to establishment men such as boyfriends Mike Nicholsand Mortimer Zuckerman via the social circuit            Itsfitting then that Thom perks up whenever shes describing a party a gala atelevision show a promotional tour This was the true Ms state ofmind and there were many such events to boast about The premier issue in thespring of  got a plug from The David Frost Show  on which Steinemand others appeared Then there was a big party at the New York Public Libraryto celebrate The next year the magazines own birthday  was the occasionof larger gatherings several of them aboard a chartered Circle Line boatEverything we did one member of the staff recalled got a tremendous amountof attention It would all sound narcissistically frivolous were it not soearnest And so ineffective financially the magazine was all but broke fromthe start and stayed that way            In the s The New Ms  which hadbeen granted notforprofit educational status launched a campus issue toattract younger readers but a hectically busy Steinem was devoting lesseditorial energy to the magazine and it showed You can sense a magazinesdesperation when it tries to generate hoopla on both its  th and th anniversaries In the s after being sold and resoldMs lost its spark but it still carries on Its covers are as flashy asever though an arid cleanliness reigns within it resembles nothing so much asan alumnae magazine  Ms has been adfree since  Inside thecurrent issue you will find what else an excerpt from Inside Ms  Onthis  th anniversary there is no gala Instead theres a bookthat reads like a genteel obituary
