new flurry of diplomatic activity over Kosovo Die Weltquoted German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer as saying the next few days willbe decisive The paper also reported strong speculation that German DefenseMinister Rudolf Scharping will be the next secretarygeneral of NATOsucceeding Spaniard Javier Solana who is expected to be appointed this week asthe first foreign policy supremo of the European Union His official title willbe high representative for European foreign and security policy butaccording to the FinancialTimes of London he is already colloquially known as Mr Pesc afterthe French acronym for the job            In aneditorial Wednesday the FT described Solana as an excellent choice fora position that requires both a surefooted diplomat and a supersalesman Itsaid Mr Solana will be the European on the end of the telephone to takecalls from Washingtona figure whose absence was always bemoaned by HenryKissinger A frontpage reportin the International HeraldTribune of Paris said US officials are confident that Solana wouldhelp guarantee that EU military cooperation fits with NATO and does notchallenge the Western alliances primacy in European security            Havingapparently forgotten that only last week they ruled out Yugoslav PresidentSlobodan Milosevic as a negotiating partner because of his indictment for warcrimes most British newspapers were taking this weeks Belgrade talks veryseriously Crunch talks on Kosovo was the main headline in the liberalGuardian which said the discussions will decide whether NATO halts the bombing orlaunches a ground war Vital hours for Kosovo peace said the Times  The DailyTelegraph notedthat the European Unions negotiator Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari isthe first Western leader to visit Belgrade since the start of the bombingcampaign March  and that hopes were higher than at any time But theIndependent s Kosovo leadwas the killing of Yugoslavias deputy air force commander Gen LjubisaVelickovic in a NATO air raid It called this a success to be weighedagainst NATOs continuing blunders            Another military blunder made the front page of the South China Morning Post ofHong Kong This was the death of  pupils during Indian shelling of a schoolin Kashmir As Indias efforts to evict Pakistanbacked Muslim guerrillas fromthe disputed territory entered the seventh day the daily Dawn of Pakistan led onPakistani troops repelling three crossborder raids that India denied had takenplace In New Delhi the Asian Age led on a muchcriticized statement by IndianDefense Minister George Fernandes that India would consider granting theguerrillas safe passage back to Pakistan But Fernandes insisted that allthose who have been pushed into our territory by Pakistan including theirtroops have to go back dead or alive The Indian press has generally advisedagainst any escalation of the war and the Times ofIndia ran an editorial Wednesday discounting a muchreported remark bythe Pakistani foreign minister that we will not hesitate to use any weapon inour arsenal to defend our territorial integrity Pakistan was crying nuclearwolf the paper said The nuclear gap between the two countries has widened inIndias favor Pakistans generals may not mind sacrificing a few hundred oftheir soldiers and Afghan mercenaries to Indian air strikes but they are notgoing to expose their own cities to needless risk            Backto Kosovo The conservative National Post of Canada ran a tough editorial Wednesday saying that acceptance of Milosevicsposition on the implementation of the G peace plan would be little betterthan a surrender in stages  Rather than attempting to dictate the nigglingterms of peacekeeping Mr Milosevic should be obliged to negotiate on thebroader subject of Kosovos future as an independent statewhich has not yetbeen discussed at all it said The Times of London was equally toughMilosevics purported acceptance of the G general principles ismeaningless in itself notable only as a hint of desperation it said in aneditorial The only reason for the Finnish president going to Belgrade was tospell out exactly what Yugoslavia has to do to meet NATOs own clear demands infull But if Milosevic still needs more clearly to be told the truth is bestconveyed by bombs and by the speedy reinforcement of NATO troops on theground            InEurope the other main
