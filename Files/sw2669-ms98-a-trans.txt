            okay the topic was uh should the United States adopt the metric system and if so should uh oh   how should they do it why didnt it work last time   and why didnt it work last time  well yeah well im   well im all for it   i i am too i wish uh it had started a long time ago is the the problem because were so wound up in the in the system that weve got that you know trying to convert over   yeah   and i guess  whatd they try they tried whatd the call it soft conversion and hard conversion one of them is where you just take whatevers already standard and you give it some sort of a weird   yeah they tried to   metric number like uh  six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter something like that   yeah yeah direct conversion   yeah and uh i i dont know uh   i think they just ought to you know start uh just go all all the way you know new products introduced or whatever you know start your packaging go to liters instead of quarts and you know people if they have to are going to learn to think that way   yeah well dont most of them doesnt just about everything now have uh both   but if you start   uh metric and English   they do but things are generally packaged in the English sized packages you know you buy a quart of milk and sure it has has the metric equivalent written on there but it still a quart so if they started putting it in liters liter of oil and   oh yeah yeah umhum   you know liters of gasoline people are going to learn to think in metric as long as you can still buy a product in the English units thats how youre going to think of it   yeah i kind of remember back when gas prices started up uh you know pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range somebody had uh i believe it was Exxon   figures   we we were living in uh Lubbock at the time they started marketing it in in liters and it was only like  you know twenty nine and thirty cents a liter so they could put this sign out front that said you know thirty nine cents a liter and nobody had any idea what a liter was so   right   uh   yeah thats thats the problem   when you finally figured out that liters what about a quart theres about four liters in a gallon you know so you can figure out what youre actually paying for it   right its kind of hard for me to believe that this this day and age i dont know when i was growing up we were taught the metric system in school i mean not not at first but by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade anyway   umhum yeah oh ive never   its i would expect people with any kind of buying power over the age of or you know under the age of thirty or so to have some idea what it is anyway a liters about a quart   yeah i yeah the uh i think maybe theres where the the problem came in you know we uh tried to instead of learning its kind of like learning a language you know when you learn one from the other yeah you always end up in this conversion thing all the time so its you its almost like uh course this country isnt a dictatorship but you know its like somebody said okay as of such and such a date   yeah   you know anybody caught talking in the English metric you know in the will be shot or something like that you know but uh  uh     well thing is its a global global market place these days and you know were one of like what two backwards clo countries in the world as far as   yeah i read that what Uganda and uh   uh something i dont remember what the other one is but   uh theres one or two others that just     its its just time i think for for us to go over because all you end up doing is if youre in business or youre in any kind of international   umhum   i dont you know i dont know i uh i work for TI were all around the world you have to perform this conversion anyway   yeah well i i yeah i i do too and uh one of the things that weve run run into a a problem of course youre familiar with the TI drawing well with any drawing system you end up with uh you end up with things in inches   and right mils and microns right   in parts of inches you know fourth half fourth you know this sort of thing and then you end up with a decimal   right   where you start getting into mils and that sort of thing and then some of them are are done in uh you know purely metric   right yeah i remember how big stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns and ours were in mils   and it umhum umhum   and it got to you know somewhere down the line they went standardized they went microns but uh you just you know you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs   yeah oh i can imagine   and so   the uh the one that uh uh have you ever lived in a country where they use metric   no   or i was with TI in in El Salvador for a while   no   and uh i had to get used to you know purely metric system down there and because they they didnt understand anything else you know if you start talking about miles theyd look at you like what you know   yeah   so uh i had a little bit of experience with it and also i noticed in Canada they uh you drop a a quarter fifty cents whatever in a Coke machine up there and you get this funny looking Coke you know its in a can thats uh thats taller but not as big around you know i guess thats some   yeah about a half a liter or something   its not its not a liter its like a half a liter or something like that its a strange looking can   yeah   but my daughterinlaws from Panama and she has  they have uh had Americans down there for so long you know that theyre theyre kind of into both systems but uh she gets real confused on distances and temperature is the big thing is the the Centigrade for which she says Celsius   yeah i would have more problem with more problem with the temperature except that you know working in engineering we do everything in Centigrade or Celsius   well i had kind of gotten used to uh centigrade temperature you know if its between zero and ten its cold and if its between ten and twenty its not too bad if its between twenty and thirty its pretty warm and if its more than thirty its just hotter than all get out so   yeah getting warm right   but uh the big problem is not having the uh uh the resolution between temperature you know between a hundred and if youre talking about a hundred degrees or what thirty zero you know thirty four degrees whatever that is you know you you dont get all the little   yeah well its about   the differences you know the differences between seventy and seventy two or seventy five degrees isnt much but the difference between thirty and thirty five degrees is is quite a bit yeah   yeah its about twice as much yeah what it works out to   yeah five  well i   one point one point eight times as many   yeah something like that yeah   points yeah so i dont know i think as long as people have a choice theyre going to stick with the American way   i umhum   and until we have to have to learn to think that way we we wont   yeah i know we keep calling it the English system but im im not sure what they do in England now theyre theyre on metric arent they   yeah for the most part i think so   yeah except theyve got a now okay there we ran into some problems once i remember uh theyve got a a nut and bolts system called Wentworth and uh this thing was was even different than you know SAE standards and stuff so   right   uh uh this this came okay my my dad bought uh one of these little Nash Metropolitans here a few years back you know quite a few years back and the thing had uh uh an Austin Heeley type uh engine you know it was Austin motors engine and running gear   right   and the body was built by Nash or who you know American it wasnt that was even before American Motors but Nash essentially in the US somewhere and that thing had the darndest combination of metric and Wentworth and uh SAE he ended up with about three sets of tools  in order to work on that fool thing because uh   he just get one more   i think the Wentworth and the SAE bolt sizes were the same but the threads were different and uh it was it was it was a it was a total mess   oh that would be a mess   and i know on my Chevy van thats a couple of years old uh part of its built in Canada matter of fact the thing is i always say its built off shore you know because it was assembled in Canada the only thing that was in it was built in the US was the uh differential and it was built in Buffalo New York but its got the darndest combination of uh of metric and most of the body parts seem to be metric and most of the engine parts seem to be SAE so its   well i guess it just gets bad down to you got to you got to have one and not mix them up because youre never going to get to one one system if you still still got a got a mix   its just crazy yeah umhum   and of course here that that would involve changing road signs all across the country you know miles per hour to kilometers per hour and the whole whole nine yards   umhum yeah   its kind of hard to do gradually   i thought maybe they would convert to uh metric back when they went to the fifty five mile an hour speed limit because what is it fifty six or fifty sevens a hundred   yeah   uh uh  or a hundred kilometers and uh you know a hundred a hundred yeah youd have a hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five but youd have people going youre right a hundred miles an hour yeah   oh hell youd have people doing a hundred miles an hour yeah   and so i dont know id kind of and the other thing too is you know between here and El Pasos what five hundred miles but its its almost eight hundred kilometers you know thatd sure seems like a long way   yeah but theyd need theyd seem to be ticking off faster too     yeah i guess thats it   every road sign you come to is like well i didnt know i went that far i dont know   well they converted all the road signs to fifty five miles an hour you know they could of converted it to metric just about as easy   yeah i think they you got the problem with all your cars are still yeah you still got cars on the road that dont have both   yeah   at that time anyway the that was still when things were the metric system was still not   yeah not all that common   yeah you know now cars they have both   yeah   sooner or later theyll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way   i was yeah i know the only other place that i was ever at where they really had it mixed was was in Panama wheres a lot of the road signs and everything are in uh in miles per hour and some are in uh in kilometers and you you got to know where you are because anything that was the old canal zone is going to be miles per hour but any   yeah
