                                 Seven Years in Tibet                           Note Life and Artis an occasional column that compares fiction in various media with thereallife facts on which it is ostensibly based                        It has been widely reportedthat Seven Years in Tibet  the tale of Austrian mountaineer HeinrichHarrers trek through Tibet and his relationship with the Dalai Lama wasnearly released with an embarrassing omission It failed to mention that Harrerhad been a sergeant in Hitlers SS The news revealed by the German magazineStern this June took the movies cast and crew by surprise At a pressconference this fall Brad Pitt declared You say Nazi and all theseconnotations like concentration camps come up That was not the case Harrerwas an athlete who spent the entire war in Tibet Director JeanJacques Annaudsubsequently made a few changes For instance when at the beginning of thefilm Harrer and an expedition party leave Austria for the asyet unscaledHimalayan mountain Nanga Parbat a journalist calls Harrer a distinguishedmember of the National Socialist Party The year is  Someone else handshim a Nazi flag to place atop the peak Toward the end of the film as PittsHarrer contemplates the takeover of Tibet by the intolerant totalitarianChinese he says in a voiceover I shudder to recall how once long ago Iembraced the same beliefs            Harrercertainly lamented the Chinese takeover Whether that meant that he renouncedpreviously held beliefs or what exactly those beliefs were in the first placeis harder to ascertain Harrer who is  now kept quiet about his Nazi pastuntil the Stern article was published This summer one day aftermeeting Simon Wiesenthal in Vienna he issued a statement It read in partMy personal political philosophy grew out of my life in Tibet  and itplaces great emphasis on human life and human dignity  It is a philosophythat leads me to condemn as strongly as possible the horrible crimes of theNazi period Having already made Harrers character an unappealing egotistinterested only in mountain climbing until the Dalai Lama changed his life thefilmmakers were able to incorporate Stern s unpleasant revelation intothe story line quite easily The press material for the movie talks of Harrersemotional transformation and then says that the Stern piece helps usunderstand the extent of this transformation            Whether Harrer was transformed by his voyage and hisconnection to the Dalai Lama is unclear there is some evidence to suggest thaton crucial issues he wasnt But otherwise Seven Years in Tibet doesconform to the record of Harrers tripalthough it should be noted that muchof what we know of that trip comes from Harrers own memoir from which themovie takes its title            In life as onscreen Harrerand his fellow expeditioners were placed in a British prisonerofwar camp inIndia at the start of World War II Harrer and several other prisoners escapedin  the movie has the escape take place earlier He set off alone butended up traveling with Peter Aufschnaiter David Thewlis the head of theNanga Parbat expedition They made their way across the border and into Tibetcontending with treacherous terrain frostbite hunger robbers and aninterdiction against foreigners Finally they reached Lhasa the forbiddencity in part by duping officials along the way with an outofdate travelpermit And Harrer became a tutor to the  th Dalai Lama            In themovie this relationship looks suspiciously like a fairy tale Harrer not onlyteaches the Dalai Lama about radios and time zones but also befriends the godking and is apparently his sole source of informal contact and entertainmentCan Harrer really have helped build a movie theater for the Dalai Lama Wellif we consider the Dalai Lamas threeparagraph foreword to Harrers memoirsome sort of guarantee of its accuracy the answer is yes The Dalai Lama alsowrites in his autobiography Freedom in Exile  that Harrer had awonderful sense of humour and that as I began to get to know him better he became very forthright  I greatly valued this quality            The movie does embellish somewhat the intensityof the Austrians relationships with the Tibetans Aufschnaiter did not marry aTibetan during their stay Harrer was not the Dalai Lamas only partner in playfor instance it was someone else who helped him tinker with old cars And itwasnt the explorer who proposed an escape plan to the Dalai Lama in  whenthe Chinese invaded though he did urge him to leave Lhasa            As forthe invasion the film understandably simplifies eventsit leaves out forinstance the unheeded pleas for help made by Tibet to India that preceded theinvasion and the unheeded pleas to the United Nations that followed itbut onthe whole the movie is fairly accurate Tibet did fall to the Chinese in days and an incident shown in the film as crucial to the success of theinvasion was indeed definitivewhen in a startling act of cowardice NgaboNgawang Jigme played in the movie by BD Wong a Tibetan minister in chargeof defending the town of Chamdo not only abandoned it but also ordered thedestruction of ammunition supplies before he left Moreover the filmsforeshadowing of Chinese atrocities as reflected by a dream in which the DalaiLama sees his native village being pillaged and monks shot reflects thehistorical facts all too well As the written epilogue to the film statesalmost all Tibets monasteriesmore than have been ransacked under theoccupation            Seven Years in Tibet ends with the Dalai Lamasenthronement in  at age  and his assumption of the role of political aswell as spiritual leader of the country The films epilogue mentions that hefled Tibet in  though it mentions neither that this took place in themiddle of an attempted rebellion against the occupiers nor that his Buddhistbeliefs had previously led him to cooperate with the Chinese The Dalai Lamaslife as exiled leader is beyond the movies time frame for more on this seeSlates Assessment of the Ambassador from ShangriLa            However the film is reallyless historical drama than personal epicthe story of how a European waschanged by Tibet and its philosophy We are supposed to believe that PittsHarrer has learned to be a better person offered as proof is his changedattitude toward his son Rolf whose name in real life is Peter In life andin the movie Harrer left for Nanga Parbat when his wife was still pregnantIn the movie Harrer knows shes pregnant Time reports that Harrerdenies having known she was She divorced him while he was gone At variouspoints in the film Harrer thinks longingly of Rolf and writes him letters Hisovertures are rebuffed his son has come to think of his stepfather as his truefather  Vanity Fair reports that Peter actually was abandoned by hismother too he was raised by his grandmother during Harrers absence Harrersmemoir which covers the years  never mentions him Pitts Harrerfinally returns to Austria dropping a music boxa gift from the DalaiLamain his sons bedroom The last scene shows father and son climbing amountain in the Alps The Nazi flag of the opening scene has become a Tibetanone which they place on the summit            However this climb neverhappened Peter who wasnt invited to either of Harrers subsequent weddingstold Vanity Fair  We didnt have much of a relationshipthough healso claimed he has no hard feelings toward his father whom he now seesoccasionally The friendship between Harrer and the Dalai Lama continues tothis day
