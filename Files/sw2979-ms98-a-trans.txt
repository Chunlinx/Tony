        some of the the more recent uh changes that ive noticed in society is i guess over the last ten to twenty years or maybe the technological advances you know ten to twenty years ago there wasnt a VCR in every home and there wasnt uh   oh i know the remote control was a great big box that was connected to the back of the TV   some some of the   uh thats true yeah and the old remote controls that were all by sound and you could drop a coin or clang some dishes and turn off the TV or change channels and all the things that have changed over the years   yeah     but along with that i unfortunately i guess theres been a down side to a lot of that stuff i mean another three or four years youre going to have a land fill full of VCRs that and the parts and things that dont work and   umhum   a lot of those things just dont go away and uh i guess the  environmentalists have done their jobs that ten to twenty years ago i didnt think of it that much i knew about all the the uh organizations that tried to do that for a living you know let you know what what environmental impact was but just kind of recently uh the worlds waking up to that so thats a change thats come along   yeah you got to well lets see you i guess you grew up in the you were a teenager in the seventies right okay did you go to like Woodstock and all that   yeah yeah no no never got around as it were but i uh i paid attention to it all being there so that that has changed people are uh i think the the outspoken people people who make a difference and make a change that age has come down it seems like uh you can make a difference at a younger age these days you dont have to be a an older part of the establishment to make waves   no like that one little girl that wrote who did she write oh i think she was in some kind of a airplane crash seem like it was an eleven year old girl wrote Gorbachev Gorbachev or Noriega or someone   oh yeah yeah   i thought that was a lot   its true they can uh they can make quite a difference at no matter what the age nowadays plus there seems to be uh uh theres a few negative changes that have come along i was just thinking last night how different uh my kids childhood is from uh when i grew up i i was allowed pretty much a free rein around my house to ride my bike uh you know all several blocks away even at the age of of ten or eleven years old i could ride   uhhuh   a couple of miles away id ride to school you know and it was it was right at two miles away from the house   uhhuh but its just not safe anymore   whereas here uh yeah i wont let them go you know more than a block out of my sight there im just a little too paranoid these days with whats going on and uh   humum umhum   yeah we get you know reports from the police will give us warnings about this neighborhood and some activity thats occurring there and then you know occasionally it works its way around to our neighborhood and we have to keep a real close rein on them wont even let them go out of our sight for a while and then   uhhuh how   after they catch that guy you know you can let him go out for a while but its uh its kind of sad   well how old are your kids   ive got a nine year old and a seven year old and uh they both like to ride their bikes off into never never land and you know be   okay right well we used to ride around well i guess it would be a city block   umhum   my mom didnt mind i wouldnt dream of letting my little boy take off   yeah i used to uh i grew up in kind of a good combination of between the country and the city   umhum   uh in East Texas and i had while we were in town wed ride several miles away like to school and the like but when we were in the country we would ride ten twelve miles away wed spend a whole day just two or three of us get together and take a lunch and go ride somewhere and eat lunch and come back and you know as long as we told the parents what roads we were going to be on and if there any   umhum   trouble was they could come find us but uh cant do that now  just no safe place to let your kid go that long and of course it probably wasnt that good of an idea back then either it just uh   humum well no but back even when i was growing up it wasnt drugs wasnt as now drugs was pretty bad but they werent near as bad as they are now   umhum   and  this child abuse wasnt as bad as it is now either   right   and theres uh so many missing kids   you know they theyre saying that the uh uh the education is going to be enough or at least a major part of the drug deterrment and though i remember when i was in school they had a a drug awareness week type deal that we studied in the science classes and we got little posters and we did all sorts of stuff but that was nothing compared to the you know campaigns that are going on now but i guess its just the the class of people or the area that were in but i im not in contact with any kids that think its its its its a positive thing to do i mean it is it is really looked down upon even to the point of smoking i mean that kids are so ingrained   uhhuh   that they look down on them we have to tell them you know dont say anything in public to a stranger about his smoking you know not not quite thats not quite accepted yet now if hes in a nonsmoking area you might want to say something but     well   they uh theyre so outspoken on the topic that uh   its an interesting change in attitudes   yeah that is because   theres coming coming along with the education   even in my time smoking was just cool   yeah   all the cool people did it   yep   went outside but my stepdaughters getting like that and thats pretty hard because her granny smokes and we smoke so it   yeah it wont take but a like uh maybe generation or so before it uh it it no longer the cool thing to do i dont know   oh yeah have a smoke free   hopefully hopefully we can get away from it yeah   really   its quite an expense too now they keep deciding thats the thing to tax   yeah they do its what about two dollars a pack now   yeah it keeps going up and up well i guess theres uh its i dont know of any other major changes other than the political environment course that things are no longer the cold war scares and the things that are going on that realm and Russias no longer the major enemy and   well who is the major enemy now   i i dont know if there is one one easy one to uh to pick thats part of the problem   i dont when i was growing up i was scared of Red China   yeah yeah   now everybody told me that they had the biggest Army in the world which i guess they still do because   they probably still do as far as humans go   yeah because Chinas real densely populated unless they   of course there you wouldnt be able to go over and attack them but i dont know that theyd be able to go anywhere and attack us  they cant get all those people across the sea they dont have the ships to get them anywhere so they may have a huge army but its going to stay put   yeah hm   uh its kind of an interesting uh interesting problem not having any one enemy to focus on as a society tends to uh let that go out of the mind youre no longer concerned with the the weapon systems and the the defense area so now that Russias gone as a major focused on enemy uh that whole defense issue is just not quite as important to peoples lives so thats an an interesting social change i guess   yeah   course itll surprise them some day when when all the hostilities start back up and some people arent prepared for it  so   oh i dont think anybody was prepared for this last war
