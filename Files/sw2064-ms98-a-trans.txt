              well i am new to Texas so i dont even know what the law is in the state do you   umhum well yes of course we do have capital punishment and weve you know done away with our quote fair share number   oh thats right i think now that i recall reading about it in the paper   yes   um you know different things is it restricted to certain crimes or just   yes its certain crimes uh capital crimes murder of course uh rape this sort of thing   umhum hum well   and it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks you know that get into the system   yes i know the one thing that i think is really sad about it as i recall from the articles that ive read is that if if people who have been there   are going to be killed  um theres people that come to the prisons and and theyre very violent and they want i mean theyre anxious for someone to be killed i just i cant see that   umhum yes that that happens on occasion it sure does maybe it just depends on you know how closely the crime you know has affected you personally you know i dont know or a person personally     uhhuh no   i think i would be  you know i guess really if i had to say yes or no i guess i would say you know that i am in certain cases in favor of the death penalty i dont know that its a big deterrent really i dont know that it is i dont know how wed ever find out you know really whether it is or not   well there is so many chances for appeal that it keep   oh yeah oh absolutely yeah it goes on for years and years and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars taxpayer money   yeah its really sad i dont know i just think um   yeah   somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than than um expecting   yes   the feeling that it right with someone is calling for someone else to be killed you know   yes umhum   is really kind of bad and   yeah it is its its a tough tough question it really is   hum   i suspect i would be uh you know a lot more favor of it if you know one of my children were you know brutally killed or something like that like i say i think it depends on how personally affected you know you might be by it   thats true and there really are criminals that are hardcore and repeat and never never have any chance for   oh absolutely thats thats right   oh i dont know is it do you feel at all like its a religious issue   not with me personally it is with a lot of other people     umhum   its not not to me personally no   hum   no   i dont know sometimes i feel i mean i do go to church and things i dont know how i would feel about it but like you say if it hit you personally closer at home you would feel feel differently   umhum yes thats a its a tough tough question it really is   do you think most states have that or   yes i think most states do have capital punishment yes   umhum hum   but i think the US is one of the few countries that still do   that still does it thats right   yes theyre only i was reading something about it the other day i think there was only like six or eight countries in the world that have capital punishment still   umhum   a lot of them had to have elected elected not to do so now i dont know what they do in place of it you know maybe its life imprisonment or you know something i dont i dont know how they handle it but i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment   have that well and it doesnt seem like very many people uh are really i mean theres a lot of people that are on death row but theres not very many people that actually um do get killed   oh yeah yes a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else   umhum so it seems like a of people live there and through appeals because i know they do frequently i mean they cover cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper   yes uhhuh yes   if it finally gets to that point   right the first appeal is automatic so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat   yeah   theres theres a lot of you know last minute uh things that happen cause a person not to have to go through the whole thing   umhum so is it uh  are we doing lethal injection now   yes uhhuh thats thats fairly recent i dont know how recent but fairly recent in the state of Texas before that it was uh death by electrocution   umhum which which seems so awful   yes it certainly does   so its a little bit more humane i guess it is   yes it would almost have to be i suppose if you if you had to chose i guess i would i am sure i would take the lethal injection     yes the other one just seems so terrible   yes absolutely   hum   its a its a tough question it really is i guess if i had to say you know yes or no i would say you know yes i i would have to lean toward capital punishment you know for certain crimes   well do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime or its not because we dont want to pay for inmates to stay in prison   no i dont think its a monetary thing i think we hope that it will be you know   umhum   some sort of determent deterrent or you know an eye for an eye type thing or something like that   hum   some of the crimes are just so brutal and so you know useless this may seem to be the best way out i dont know   yes   easiest way out maybe no i dont think its a monetary thing   hum well um and i notice that the crime rate was up in the Dallas area  its   yes especially the murder rate its just gone crazy   and its kind of been scary to think about it and   yes absolutely   and youre hoping there is something that will cut down on that   yes i wish i had the answer for that everybody does   you hate to have the dubious honor of being you know so high in the   yes its nothing to be proud of certainly not   in statistics but i you know we have been really fortunate our family hasnt had   yes   any crime   so have we been very very fortunate   and so we dont its harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way   thats right absolutely   and how they would expect how they would   umhum   hope i mean you you hear of people who have um committed crimes and then they get out of jail and they go and they do the same thing again and you wonder why they cant just stop it   absolutely uhhuh thats right   so maybe you would   yeah   but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone   so would i i fortunately i have never been in that circumstance i hope i never am like like everybody else   no  i know when um we just we moved here um i from the i got a summons jury summons just   umhum   like constantly it seemed like but fortunately i had small children and i didnt have to go and its not that i mean i think everyone should have to serve on the jury its just that   uhhuh right uhhuh   i didnt i hate having to be in charge of someone elses life   sure its its a big responsibility it really is   and i would hate to have to hear any kind of case involving a violent crime or anything   yes so would i   that would be really awful   yes absolutely   well anyway i sure have enjoyed uh  talking to you about this although it has been difficult but uh   it is its a tough subject it really is   id hate to decide it but i guess um guess its important that we decide as a people what what were going to do   right thats right   anyway well you have a good day   well thank you its nice talking to you uhhuh bye bye   thank you byebye
