                                 The Other LWord            Are libertarians on a rollIf you begin with the recent election to Congress of Ron Paul a formerLibertarian presidential candidate note the emergence of cyberlibertarians asa political constituency factor in the collapse of communism and quote BillClintons admission that the era of big government is over you have whatsounds like a compelling case There are other signs as well the rise of theCato Institute as one of the leading Washington think tanks and the generalaccrual of credibility to what  years ago was a fringey movement of AynRand devotees and risqu Republicans            Yetthere is an equally strong argument to be made that the United States is onlymoving toward libertarianstyle minimalist government in the same way that youget closer to Paris when you drive east to the supermarket Libertarianpresidential candidate Harry Browne got less than  votes in  Thiswas an increase over  but only a slight improvement upon the Libertarianvote in  and a far weaker performance than in  Meanwhile leaders ofthe Christian right whose aims are antithetical to those of libertarians makethe plausible claim that it is they who are winning converts and influence bythe day And if Clinton now knows to eschew big government members of theRepublican Congress elected in  have also learned their lesson aboutattempting to make government truly smaller            The appearance of these two books counts as an entry in theplus side of the ledger Each attempts to make libertarianism more respectableand popular They are pitched however at different audiences Charles Murrayis a conservative trying to persuade other conservatives that the absence ofrestraint will in fact make people more moral He rather reluctantly defendsthe legalization of drugs prostitution and pornography and concedes thatgovernment has to play some morethanminimal role David Boaz an official atthe Cato Institute sees libertarianism as neither conservative nor liberaland aims to convert everyone But while he is more ecumenical Boaz is far moreextreme If you insist on keeping national parks or oldage pensions he hassome advice on the least bad way to run these thingsbut given his druthershe wouldnt run them at all            Murrays more laconic account is based upon aclassical liberal argument Force is bad cooperation is good government isforce ergo the only legitimate functions of government are to enforcevoluntary agreements and to prevent force and fraud Murray accepts thoughthat there also exist limited public goods The two he names areenvironmental protection and education These exceptions to the rule of theminimal state are probably necessary to make libertarianism palatable tomainstream conservatives The problem is that they require an admissionwhichMurray never makes directlythat decisions made by a democratic governmentwithin the boundaries of a constitution are not merely force but alsocooperation albeit with a certain degree of legitimate coercion            In anattempt to distinguish those public purposes that are tolerable from those thatarent Murray posits that to be valid public goods either have to benonexclusiveinterventions from which everyone benefitsor else must ariseto counter externalities costs passed on to others that in practical termscannot be compensated as in the case of the chemical incinerator that pollutesthe air What this scheme leaves unclear is why education and the environmentare valid public goods while other efforts he opposesinsuring elderly peopleagainst poverty say or providing national health insuranceare notEducation and the environment are not purely nonexclusive goods Some peoplewho either dont have children or who dont like to visit national parksorbothwill be taxed to pay for them And if the standard of nonexclusivity isnot absolute then programs Murray rejects such as welfare and Medicare canreasonably qualify Anyone may fall upon hard times and most people anticipatebeing around long enough to benefit from nationalized health care for theelderly            Murrays next strategy is to try a series of more pragmaticarguments against government action To show how little sense regulations makehe proposes a thought experiment Why not give consumers a choice he asksabout whether to use regulated or unregulated products unregulated productshe stipulates would have to be labeled as such This merely demonstrates thatMurray has failed to understand his own argument about externalities as a basisfor public goods The point of regulation is not merely to protect consumersbut to protect innocent third parties Of course consumers would be better offif the government gave them the right to buy appliances built by pollutingfactories and lowcost child labor In fact consumers already can so long asthe pollution and child labor are foreign and not domestic These regulationsexist for the benefit of those who live downstream from the factory and thechildren who would otherwise be working inside it            Or totake an example of regulation employed by Murray consider the mileperhourspeed limit Murray says there is no reason to keep people from harmingthemselves But speed limits dont just prevent people who willingly take therisk of driving faster and more dangerously from hurting themselves Theyimprove the odds for the children in the back seat and for the safe driver inthe opposite lane whom the reckless driver might plow into With this exampleMurray undercuts himself in another way He says regulation only gets moreonerous over time But the national speed limit is an example of precisely theopposite point In most states you can now drive  or  on freeways Likemany conservatives Murray highdudgeons himself into the Jeane Kirkpatrickposition of ascribing historical inevitability to a trend that is actually inthe midst of reversal            Murray involves himself in more seriouscontradictions by drawing in arguments from his earlier books each of whichpresents a different case against public action to fight poverty In LosingGround  the work that made him famous he contended that governmentantipoverty programs had done much to create the underclass In The BellCurve  he said that some peoplenamely blackswere geneticallyinferior a condition that government could do nothing about In What ItMeans to Be a Libertarian  he says government intervention is morallywrong            He means these arguments tobe mutually reinforcing Government social programs dont work they cant workon account of human nature and if by chance they do work theyre morallyunjustified anyhow But this triple argument in the triple alternative actuallyobliterates itself In The Bell Curve  Murray contends that governmentcant really help people In the version of that argument given in What ItMeans  he asserts that most government interventions are ineffectualbecause modern society has the inertia of a ponderous freight train But ifgovernment cant reroute the freight train in a better direction its hard tosee how it can derail it The metaphor undermines the Losing GroundMurray the guy who writes that until the government began masking thesocial costs created by large numbers of fatherless children civilizedcommunities everywhere stigmatized illegitimacy The futilitythesisgovernment cant helpand the perversity thesisgovernment makesproblems worse instead of betterare at odds If government cant do anythinghow can it do so strongly the opposite of what it intends            Dimlyaware of this problem Murray brings in a more sweeping illegitimacythesisgovernment is unjustifiedto trump all the others But this exposeshis underlying bias which casts doubt on the critiques of government in bothLosing Ground and The Bell Curve  The three Murrays play a kindof fugue throughout this book In fact there seems to be a fourth Murraystruggling to get out This is the Charles Murray who says late in the bookthat he halfsupports the idea of a negative income taxa guaranteed incomefor everyone This would seem to violate all the aforementioned principles Itwould create a powerful incentive of the kind attacked in LosingGround  for people not to work it would be an attempt to help people whoThe Bell Curve says cant be helped anyway and it would certainlyviolate What It Means to Be a Libertarian s admonition against forcingpeople to pay for dubious public goods What Murray likes about the idea isthat it would finally discharge societys obligation to members of theunderclass They might not be better off but they would have to quitbellyaching Combined with a new heartfelt attack on civilrights laws Murraysays bad prejudicial discrimination is inseparable from good economicallysensible discrimination this passage leaves one with the sense that indeclaring himself a libertarian Murray has not yet removed the final veil            David Boaz has written a more stimulating more consistentand more dogmatic book After a long history of libertarian ideas he proposesa version of Murrays basic argument which he calls the nonagressionaxiomno one can use force against anyone else Thats it Unlike MurrayBoaz draws no exception for public goods He does not pander to politicalreality by accepting large expenditures for national defense environmentalregulation or publicly funded education He does not believe in national parksprivate stewards will exercise proper stewardship Nor does he believe inmilitary conscription in wartime the libertarian believes that people willvoluntarily defend a country worth defending            Thoughthis version of libertarianism seems to flirt with anarchism Boaz isntworried about disarray In the absence of malign government intervention therewill emerge what he calls spontaneous order Boazs model for this is theInternet He neglects of course the fact that the Internet began life as afederal defense project But the real question Boaz begs is why the laws hethinks are necessary for society to function including fair chunks of the USConstitution count as spontaneous and good while everything else is definedas coercion Capitalism may arise spontaneously but the Bill of Rights is asmuch a manmade construct as the foodstamp program            In the end it is futile to argue with thisview Boaz has worked out every possible detail of his libertarian heaven in anutterly comprehensive and slightly mad way He takes pains to say he is notoffering a plan for a perfect society merely a framework for utopia thephrase is Robert Nozicks But his heart is clearly with the ancient Chinesephilosopher Laotzu who wrote Without law or compulsion men would dwell inharmony            Murray too is afflictedwith millenarianism That America is not the land of universal plenty itshould have become is for many libertarians including me the source of ourdeepest anger about what big government has done to this country he writes atone point He offers instead a society that is prosperous and virtuous butone that is exciting and fun as well I was reminded of the famous passagewhere Marx writes that in the Communist future every worker will spend part ofhis day fishing part writing poetry and only part working at his lathe Marxbelieved that the state would wither away Libertarians believe men must witherit But really their utopias are not so different They share a wishful visionof human perfectibility dressed up as an idea of justice
