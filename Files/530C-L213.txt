              October        Name Address City ST Zip      Dear Name      During the current period of declining state funding for our law      school there is one outstanding development In increasing numbers      alumni and friends are providing the private resources necessary for      scholarships faculty support and other items which enrich the schools      curriculum related programs      Significant examples are the  trust agreement executed by      Judge Sam Rosen in  in honor of his friend and our former Dean      Bill Foust More recently alumni have responded generously to the      special Bruce Townsend Endowed Professorship campaign as more than       has now been given or pledged      Have these events put our law school on easy street By no means They      will however together with Annual Fund contributions and other gifts      assure that students at the school continue to receive an excellent legal      education So as the end of  approaches we ask that you remember      what your law school education has meant to you and to support the Law      School Annual Fund      Consider the current enrollment picture at the school and the costs      students bear today      Demand for a legal education remains high The School of Law in      Indianapolis received nearly  applications to enroll its       firstyear class of  students      The schools  full and parttime students provide in fees and      tuition  of the schools annual operating budget For       Indiana residents pay  per credit hour and nonresidents pay       The average annual course load for firstyear students in the      day program  credit hours costs  for residents and  for      nonresidents To meet tuition payments and other expenses total loans      of the student body each year now exceed  Consequently we      have approached the limit on student tuition increases      You are all too familiar with Indianas budget pinch and the pressures      on state government to cut expenditures Consequently significant      increases in state financial support for higher education is extremely      unlikely during the remainder of this decade      Gifts from alumni and friends therefore are more critical than ever      They provide scholarship dollars which aid students and enable the school      to compete with other public and private law schools for outstanding      young people Gifts also support student organizations such as moot      court supply library materials pay for student research assistants and      make available other necessary resources      Your contributions to the Annual Fund at the Maennerchor Society level      have provided significant assistance to the school Please continue that      tradition by completing and returning the enclosed pledge card Payment      of  or more may be made now or at anytime before December             Thank you for your past help and your continued support      Sincere best wishes      John M Holt Donald K Densborn Chairman Chairman Maennerchor Society      Deans Council
