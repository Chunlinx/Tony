                okay im here how do you feel about the public schools   well our public schools are are really poor i feel um   uhhuh   im not sure where Georgia ranks in the nation but uh were toward the bottom   yeah   and uh theres a lot of things that i see that are so obviously wrong   umhum   that you would think itd be easy to correct but the system doesnt allow for the corrections   right umhum   yeah how about you   well thats interesting i have a sister who used to live in Kennesaw Georgia   oh yes   and uh she has a young boy actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there and she complained quite a bit about this school system there   yes   and   and Cobb County is better than the county im in she was in Cobb County   right right im i cant really say much about the schools up here i really dont come from here   uhhuh   im only up here temporarily on an internship but um i live in Orlando Florida usually   okay   and the schools down there from what i know are not bad theyre pretty good   well thats great   but i know that in some i know in a lot of rural areas theyre not that good   umhum   for example i have a brother in North Carolina and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad um just terrible   well i feel that were way behind uh i have a son that is in the fourth grade and uh they have just now taken up division   hm wow   uh yeah and and you know i  my husband and i go to the store and we buy these math books and and fractions and multiplication division things and   that is slow   i feel like uh there are several areas that were just really really slow in and uh   umhum   i dont blame the teachers as much as i blame the system it is   what do you thinks wrong to cause that   well well for one thing theres not enough money in the school system and the money they do have theyre not they do not use it wisely uh she my sons teacher has twenty seven students   yeah umhum   and thats certainly is a lot of students for one person   yeah   to deal with on an every day basis   perhaps   uh but more than that i dont think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children   yeah   and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keep the ca class in an uproar and youre not at liberty   yeah   to do something about it other than give them on campus isolation or send them to the principals office and it   yeah thats thats one thing i worry about   it you know it can you it can really be bad uh also i think we have a lot of uh Hispanics   there you go uhhuh   and we have a lot of uh uh the county i am im in uh the minorities are mostly Hispanic   yeah probably quite a few black people up there and and   no  were from a county and uh were from the county they marched in were in Forsyth county yes and we and theres very very few blacks uh so uh so thats um   no oh is that right oh okay   i i hate to say  its not a problem uh because i hate to feel like they are a problem although they are   yeah but you know it it its you dont want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever but then again yeah there is no denying that it that   but it is a problem uh especially in the inner schools inner city   sure you know teachers you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who dont understand especially if theres not a very well developed special education program at the school   well and  you cant put all the children in special education uh and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done   thats right you cant do that right   you know   see i grew up in Nebraska   umhum   and the school that i went to there was fantastic it i i really consider myself very very lucky um we had a school that had classes probably about the same size youre talking twenty seven thirty kids to class to a class   yeah but your teacher had control   but yeah we zipped right along you know i i was i was doing mathematics fractions and division and multiplication by the third grade easily um   umhum yeah i i believe i was too   umhum but youre right you know with all this  dont hurt the kids and dont abuse their rights youve also taken something away from the discipline i think   uhhuh um well it it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it my son would be in private school we just cannot afford it   yeah right i was gonna ask you if there that was an option   um if
