                                 Alas Babylon            In Alas Babylon  PatFranks classic nuclearapocalypse novel of the s a man awaits word thatnuclear war is imminent Hell know that time is up when his brother workingfor the government and privy to topsecret information sends him a telegramwith the words Alas Babylon The collapse of Microsoft would not be quite ascalamitous as a nuclear war But like many others whove gloried in owningMicrosoft stock I would dearly love a signal if the moment to run for coverarrived            I need asignal more than most Microsoft shareholders do perhaps I joined Microsoftstraight out of college in  and left this August taking a small buthealthy chunk of its stock with me Now I have far more of my familys savingsinvested in a single firm for which I no longer even work than any sanefinancial adviser would recommend Thats OK with me because I still thinkMicrosoft is a great company with a great future But nothing lasts forever Icant expect a telegram from Bill Gates saying Alas Babylon So here are thesignals that will warn me the unthinkable may be happening            Of course any analyst will tell you that Microsoftsstrategic position at the center of the computer industry is paramount Chancesare if youre using a computer youre running at least some Microsoftsoftware In particular theres a that youre running some variety of theWindows operating system The ongoing Java war read about Java in Webhead and The Motley Foolis a battle for this strategic center            Java doesnt scare meyetTheres so much software written for Windows and PCs running Windows are soubiquitous that its hard to see it being supplanted But Ill know somethingis wrong when someone I know buys a Javaonly home computer  Not one ofmy geeky computernerd friends eithertheyll buy anythingI mean someone inmy family or any of my basically computerilliterate friends Unlikecorporations which will occasionally throw money at bizarre nonstandardcomputing solutions like NeXT OS or Java normal people only get one shotat it So they are conservative They ask around They buy what their friendsbuy or more likely what their kids friends buy When Java invades the homeIll know the tide has turned            By thenof course it will be too late I will have missed my chance I believe theonly thing that can defeat Microsoft in the home or for that matter at workis if Microsoft fails to make computers easier to use  I spend far toomuch of my life setting up computers for friends and family and answering dumbquestions But its not really the questions that are dumbits the computersSoftware and hardware configuration is too errorprone incompatibility remainstoo common and software is too difficult to use People arent getting afraction of the productivityor the funthey could and their computers soonbecome merely expensive toys Frustration is rampant If Microsoft doesnt fixthis in a year or two someone else will            A yardstick I watch on a daily basis is thestock price But Im not nervous about it droppingI worry when Microsoftstock stagnates particularly when it stagnates at a high price  Now itseems backward to judge a companys success directly by its stock price AWarren Buffettesque buyandhold strategy tells you to look at thefundamentals If theyre strong hold on to the stock But Microsoftslifeblood is its employee stockoption program and so the stock price is in asense one of the fundamentals Options are how the company attracts andretains smart young college graduates with no money and most important nolives A person joining Microsoft today right out of college will get a numberof options giving him or her the right to buy shares of Microsoft at the lowestclosing price the month after he or she joins And most employees get moreevery year In essence options give the employee any future increase in stockprice If the price doesnt increase the options are worthless            Options vest take effectgradually over several years At any time therefore valued employees have asizable amount of money thats theirsif they stay around long enough to getit Psychologically it doesnt work to have the stock stay at the same pricethen shoot up after four years By that time the employee is long gone lostto some little startup about to have an initial public offering Its worse ifthe stock stays at a high price because the employee knows or at leastworries that there isnt much upside I dont mind a little volatilitybecause this makes it more likely that a new employees options will hit amomentarily low price during that crucial first month when new employeesparadoxically have an incentive to want the price to go down And I dontmind periodic declines even steep ones because its a chance to scoop up somemore good employees at to them an attractively low price Over the long termthough what I want to see is a steady upward progression            On a more personal basis Iwatch my friends slowly trickling out of Microsoft leaving because theyvemade enough money or because theyve burnt out or because they just want totry something new That in and of itself is not necessarily a warningsignold blood leaves new blood comes in and sometimes the old blood comesback after a while In any case most of these friends remain in the softwarebusiness They love it they live it and they cant stop talking about itThey talk about the important things the key technologies the good peoplethe big deals And they do it all the time while feeding babies hiking upmountains and even in nominally social situations Ill know that the jig isup the end of the world has come and its time to sell my very last share ofMSFT when conversations at parties no longer center on Microsoft
