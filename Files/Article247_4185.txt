                                 For Cooks With Commitment Issues            This may be hard to believe but Culturebox has discovered a bestof listwith solid practical value Its a brand extension of the Best Americanliterary franchiseyou know The                Best American Essays The                Best American Short Stories  etc This iteration of the ideais called The Best American Recipes  The Years Top  From BooksMagazines Newspapers  the Internet  edited by book editor FranMcCullough and food writer Suzanne Hamlin HoughtonMifflin                            The Best American Recipes  Culturebox wishes to warn you in advanceis not for readers of Cooks                Illustrated magazine or anyoneelse pledged to uphold gastronomical values On the other hand its not fordummies either as the other leading introductory series likes to put itThis cookbooks browlevel is all over the place One minute youre cooking thefirstprizewinning recipe in the Pillsbury BAKEOFF chicken thighs with asweetandsour Old El Paso salsa currants and honey sauce served oncouscous and the next youre composing the sternly Mediterranean endivefennel and orange salad from the latest cookbook by Paula Wolfert the most rigorous scholar in American cookbookwriting The recipes are Indian and Brazilian and Frenchand Italian and Texan and Minnesotan Theyre culled fromregional cookbooks Robert Redfords kitchen and Sophia Lorens memoirs andthe kinds of sample recipes you find inside the box when you open your newKitchen Aid The introduction lists emerging food trends of the year albeit abit cursorily and without really specifying how the trends are certified assuch There are marginal notes explaining how to secure obscure ingredients orperform difficult procedures and menu recommendations that allow you toassemble an impressive threecourse meal using this book alone In short itsthe perfect purchase or gift for those among us with bare kitchen bookshelvesand larger culinary ambitions that dwell in latency stymied by a gravethoughcommonpsychological flaw being unable to commit to a single technique orethnic cuisine at a time            Which brings us to the question raised by The Best American Recipes  Why in a world besotted with mindless applications of the bestofconceit did it take so long to come up with this one The answer surely hassomething to do with the sociology of cooking right nowyoure supposed tocrave purity or at least authenticity If youre going to cook Italian youdbest get the works of Marcella Hazan or else a food anthropologist who hasinterviewed all the grandmothers in Italy and discovered the bestliverandgrappa pasta sauce to be found north of the Arno Ditto with Spanishand Penelope Casas Indian and Julie Sahni and on it goes around the globe Ifyour tastes are downmarket you can be a purist in that department toojustbuy the works of whitetrash aficionados Jane and Michael Stern all of whosedishes must be presented with the requisite ironic appurtenances such as traysand swizzle sticks Referencestyle cookbooks such as Fannie Farmer rangefairly broadly over the American basics but if you want to get higherend thanthat youre hardpressed to find anything but books devoted to individualcuisines Foodies dont believe in mixing and matchingits the culinaryequivalent of putting an Eames chair in a room full of frilly French antiquesLook at the harsh waves of criticism that greeted Maria Guarnaschelli theeditor who asked food experts and celebrity chefs of all stripes andpreferences to contribute chapters to the  update of The Joy ofCooking             But cooking is one of the few areas in which anthologizing actually makessense A bestof collection of recipes is a much more satisfying creature thanmost other genres of bestofs When it comes to poetry for instance suchcompilations always lack context Who can grasp the greatness of a poet on thebasis of a single poem Anthologies of essays on the other hand just make youfeel oppressed No one wants to read that much of the same thingthat muchfolksy digressive argumentin a single sitting But The Best AmericanRecipes  reflects life as it is lived This is how Americans eatat anItalian restaurant one night a Chinese one the next America the melting pothas become American the food court and The Best American Recipes makesa virtue of that fact            McCullough and Hamlin say they plan to repeat The Best AmericanRecipes in  which is good because theres room for improvement hereSome things are strangely delicious such as the salsaandcouscous chicken andthe LemonAlmond Pound Cake which is essentially baked marzipan dough Otherdishes such as the cloyingly sweet lamb with olives and oranges from celebritychef Mario Batalis Simple Italian Food  just dont measure up Thetimes given for cooking are not to be relied on Culturebox tested everythingin or on a gas range viewed favorably by Consumer Reports  and foundthat some things were done in the time recommended but the socalled PerfectBrowniesa dry crumbly tasteless contribution from a book presumptuouslycalled The Perfect Recipe would have been overbaked and Batalis lambdish understewed if Culturebox had followed the recipes strictly The faultmay lie with the authors of the original cookbook or recipe but since Hamlinand McCullough allege that they tried everything out they share the blame            There are other faults Eclecticness guarantees waste and inefficiencyShould you shell out  for a bottle of Italian lemon liqueur you will useonce then store in your liquor cabinet Or should you make your own whichwould take about four days The writing can be breathless and schmaltzyit wasnot necessary to say of the Turkish poached eggs with garlic yogurt from acookbook written by a couple that this is a Sunday morning meal from twopeople whose love for garlic is as intense as it is for each other Theemphasis on trends leads to a kneejerk overreliance on ingredients thathappen to be fashionable right now such as cumin and coconut milk But theseare quibbles which could well be obviated by next years anthology Andbesides theyre in keeping with the basic idea This is a cookbook thatspleasingly shallow and imperfect just like those of us who are drawn toit
