          well i personally dont have any problem with uh drug testing employees or potential employees do you   um   i mean basically   basically no um um   okay i dont i really cant disagree with it   yeah i i uh uh the policy that TI has i think is uh uh very fair   uhhuh   um i they first had a policy where they uh would test new employees and then since ive been with them the last four years uh theres been in the last year year and a half um theyre doing random testing of all employees   uhhuh i think thats really the only fair way to do it   yes   i really think it ought to be some you know Junkins all the way down   and it is it and from from what i understand it is Jerry Junkins all the way down   right as a matter of fact i want to think they took the top managers first isnt that a fact ive been retired from TI about a year but the program you know was still fairly new i guess it had been going on maybe almost a year   uhhuh uhhuh   before i retired so i was not uh ever called upon to do a drug test i certainly wouldnt object to it and i think random is probably you know the only really fair way to do it   yeah um i like it because um you know i i i grew up in the sixties i mean i graduated high school in sixty eight and and uh you know i i saw you know i know my friends who were you know druggies and friends who werent and and uh you know its i think its a real problem   oh i absolutely   and i think it and i think its causing us a lot of trouble and and a lot of problems   yeah uhhuh   and so im hoping that uh a lot of other companies will will follow the same path   i dont think theyll have much choice do you   um probably not   especially if they have anything do with you know government contracts or anything as matter of fact i want to believe that the uh defense department more or less mandated that people you know who work on defense contracts you know some do some sort of you know drug testing i think thats really what maybe prompted TI to do it i was in the uh   uhhuh   Defense Electronic Division when i retired i know it was a you know it was a real hot hot item there i think i want to think maybe they you know really got some nudging from you know D O D to do this sort of thing   yeah i used to be in DSEG myself um A P D as a matter of fact   yeah so you knew you know the atmosphere then   yep very aware of it but i id id i really like the idea uh in fact i would like to see uh a lot more uh people uh adopt it uh like you know school systems and that kind of thing i mean id like id like to know that my childs being taught by a teacher whos not on drugs or   thats right   or uh who might be at a point where theyre trying to sell my kid drugs   thats right absolutely yeah i dont i just cant disagree with you with you know the basic premise   yeah   its to much as far as i know its you know seems to be a fairly accurate program as far as uh you know the testing goes   and i like the idea that they have a uh system where they allow you to uh be retested if for some reason there may have been a problem or something did show up   thats right thats right and offer you you know help if you need help   yeah yeah   yeah i do too   yeah rather than just uh   put you out on the street   put you out on the street and let you fend for yourself   yeah thats right   thats not going to help anybody get over the problem i believe it is a a a medical problem   no absolute thats right   um of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world too   oh absolutely not to mention alcohol   yeah so i mean theres a lot of things out there and things that uh im just glad that they uh decided not to uh tax drugs otherwise theyd be legal and theyd be getting tax money off it the same way they are the alcohol and tobacco   thats right  thats right  oh gosh well its its a real problem im sure   yeah i have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy and and stuff and i uh uh i moved to a TI facility that um had never had uh random drug sampling before   uhhuh   because they were outside of the military sector it was uh an industrial company and you know that TI purchased and so the people here a lot of them are real opposed to it   right uhhuh oh yeah uhhuh   uh they were really opposed to it and you know there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs and thats why they were opposed to it   uhhuh uhhuh thats right   and uh it resulted in in a few people leaving   uhhuh   you know because they just flat out werent going to put up with the policy   uhhuh   you know they had a lifestyle and they werent going to change it   yep right yeah i know a lot of people who   and its   when it first began or at least began was in the talking stage you know everybody knew it was coming it just a matter of time everybody was screaming you know invasion of privacy and all this stuff but a lot of people i think after they thought about it for awhile and you know weighed the pros and cons decided you know its really not a bad idea unless youre doing drugs of course   yeah yeah i mean uh you should have no objection to it its like uh going down to get your license and checking your eyes i mean you know why do i need my eyes checked well we want to make sure you can see   thats right thats right yep yep   why are we doing this well so you dont kill people on the road     thats right or yourself or   uh its a basic  i mean its the basic premise with you know drug testing   yeah thats right   especially some of the jobs um luckily ive always been in the engineering sector and its very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as uh you know hurting someone i mean its hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it   uhhuh uhhuh yeah thats true   but uh in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor and down in some of those labs and stuff   uhhuh yeah assembly people   yeah i darn if id want somebody down there that im working with side by side you know that could kill me   thats right   by doing something incorrectly because they were not exactly all there because they were on drugs   absolutely   so theres a theres a lot of sectors where i think that would would help out and i think in the long run we all benefit   uhhuh oh absolutely yeah   i mean if you have uh you know if youre not working with someone on drugs well then youre going to have less accidents and you have less accidents and you spend less money on medical and you spend less money on medical then the companys more profitable   uhhuh yeah sure   well then the companys more profitable then maybe they can pay you more if they can pay you more you can buy more and then and it and it goes around you know to everywhere   sure trickles trickles up and down   yep all over   sure does   and uh   yeah affects a lot of people   it certainly does and   yeah   i i just hope that uh more and more companies uh get on the ball and and start it up   uhhuh i think they probably will you know if they im sure its a very expensive program to administer im not sure every small company could do it   well a lot of companies are are coming down in price and i think that the insurance companies are starting to give uh benefits you know reduction reduction in in medical costs if you know they   uhhuh yeah yeah its got to help them too   yeah so i think everybody will will benefit from the program   uhhuh yeah i do too thats right   and i think if if a lot more insurance companies get on the bandwagon and say well if you impose uh   uhhuh uhhuh   mandatory drug testing well reduce your insurance costs by you know twenty per cent and of course you know the companys not going to reduce the employees cost of insurance twenty per cent theyre going to reduce their own   uhhuh no no but it itll save in some areas yeah right   yeah and thatll cover it and maybe some insurance companies might start offering it as a uh as part of the package   thats right that certainly could happen thats a very very very very competitive business   yeah so it i i think i think all around it its going to help out a lot course   yeah i do too i just really cant disagree with you   yeah   okay well its nice to talk to you   it was great talking with you   and you take care   you do the same   okay byebye   byebye
