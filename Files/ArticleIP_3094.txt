hairstyles and conventionalmakeupwere banished to the torture chamber of the patriarchy One by one theyhave all come back licensed frivolities rather than slavish concessions to themale beholder Since they are subject to womens freedom of choice many womennever make use of them and that too has its own excitement            Of allthe old appurtenances the bra was the only one that never really disappearedsince some women cant do without it In fact developments in bra constructionand embellishment speeded up when not wearing them became a natural rightinstead of a questionable perversion and wearing them became a sensualexperience instead of a social duty Now there are tough sports bras for activewomen cleverly minimizing bras for the very abundant and scores ofconfections with no
