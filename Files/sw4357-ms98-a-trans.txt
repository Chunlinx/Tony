        hi um the most experience i know about that is just when we had my grandma and       she lived with us when i was a little girl for about three or four years and then we had to put her in a rest home and   uhhuh uhhuh because you couldnt take care of her anymore huh   yeah she had to have nurses care   yeah thats rough isnt it   and yeah it was a really hard decision because i she had nine kids and they had all decided that between the nine of them they could keep her at their home   uhhuh wow   but uh her health just failed so much that they couldnt do that she needed an IV and things   yeah thats really hard my grandma is uh just turned ninety   oh wow   and shes still on her own   oh my goodness   and shes down in Phoenix and i dont know what well do when she cant take care of herself her her son my dad is dead   uhhuh   and she has a daughter  my aunt uh who lives in another state but uh she has   and then theres just the grandkids   uh well im like the uh yeah im my sister and i are the grandkids are her only grandkids   oh wow   so i dont i dont know whats going to happen with her but shes amazingly strong uh   yeah thats whats neat is when they dont have to go into a rest home or anything   yeah but i dont know i guess uh  most of us uh probably end up there sooner or sooner or later   yeah my grandpa lived to be ninety four and   oh my gosh   his grandma or his wife was uh ten years younger than him and she kept him at home his uh about the last two years of his life she had him in a hospital bed   uhhuh   and you know the port a potty and stuff she he couldnt get up or anything but she threatened that shed never put that man in a rest home and she never did   boy thats amazing thats a lot of stress   oh yeah uh she has osteoporosis  i dont know how to say it       anyway where their back bends and stuff and the bones deteriorate and it really did a toll on her lifting him and stuff but she   uhhuh hm   she would have died before she let anyone put him in there in a rest home   amazing   but when my grand when my one grandma that did go in the rest home we found a really nice one the you know wed go visit every night   uhhuh every night wow thats dedicated   and she only well she was only there for about a month and she was really bad we you know we knew it was coming   oh i see   and i you know we felt really bad for putting her there and stuff she was unconscious and so       i dont know a lot of people say she didnt even know she was there but still it was nice to be with her and stuff   yeah its a tough emotional uh issue   well nowadays the expense is going so crazy i mean some people they need it but they cant afford it and those are the families i feel so bad for   yep yeah thats tough   you could lose your whole retirement or whatever just   uhhuh   taking and you know nowadays a lot of kids are taking care of their parents you know because they cant afford a rest home or whatever and that does a double toll on the kids   uhhuh     i dont know if i could ever put my parents in a rest home but i dont know how we would afford it either   i remember one time i was uh i was in a Mexican restaurant here in Seattle   uhhuh   and uh i i was sitting alone in this booth reading and eating and i overheard some  folks in the next booth who i think some of them worked at the restaurant they were a little younger than me and they were talking about the differences between i dont know whether they were from Mexico or or but they were you know definitely Latin American   uhhuh uhhuh   they were talking about the differences between uh how uh our country cares for old people and what it was like back home and they were just appalled that anybody could  put somebody in a you know in a rest home   oh really   yeah they werent course they werent talking about uh where you know youre absolutely unable to care for them but it was it you know they would come from large extended families   right   where you know the the old people were uh were at home   living all together werent they   yeah and uh most people dont want to live that way today  in this country   yeah i dont even know if i can handle living with my parents let alone three generations   yeah  God yeah i dont know i and ive been single so long i dont even know if i could handle living with a wife   that is a challenge     im probably  incorrigible you know   that and you know a lot of people say its good for the elderly because they can be with you know people with their same interest and their same age and stuff but i dont know i i would never want to be in a rest home     yeah uhhuh   i really dont think id want to   well my grandmas in a retirement community now and uh seems to like it there a lot and stays really active and   does she have a home or an apartment
