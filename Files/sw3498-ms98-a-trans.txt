                 all right this is my opinion i im still a student right now and im actually studying in elementary education i think that there are quite a few problems with the school systems today   uhhuh   um more than anything i just believe that as students were taught to learn what the teacher wants instead of actually um gaining a further vantage point and so its basically were taught to be mediocre in what we learn   yeah  um im also an education major  im still in school and uh but i wanna go into teaching special ed   uhhuh   and um i think there is a lot of problems in that area a i think there is problems all over the education system whether it be   uhhuh   um elementary you know or even colleges you know have their flaws but  especially in the learning disabilities because um a lot of times you know teachers think oh this kids dumb and you know they just not too many people have knowledge you know about  this area   humum   of uh type of kids you know because its starting to become new and and theyre starting to find out more research about um this type of learning   umhum   and so   yeah i think youre right i think thats really a a a really neat field i uh work right now in a special center for abused children and for some of the learning disabled   uhhuh   and its incredible how they they can learn quickly if you just find whats right for them   thats right   and i think like you said at least in my opinion i think they put a lot of restrictions on teachers of how they can teach them you know   thats right it theyre they hire teachers who arent even qualified to teach those kind of kids and they burn out so fast they dont wanna teach them   umhum   and theres not enough teachers who want to do that  and theyre starting to find out you know oh this kid  may have a learning disability they test them and find out that they do and then its just a growing field because more and more kids are being tested into that   i i think its really interesting too i think along with the special children i have a friend who is gifted and in school he did terrible his all his years because there was no one who ever challenged or whoever found what exactly was what he needed in terms of learning   uhhuh right   and i think again it kind of goes back to the same thing of you know being mediocre in everything that we do   right yeah like  everybody not just people with problems um learn differently i mean you know one teacher can go out and learn how to teach but  they only know one way and a kid might have   umhum   problems you know learning that and comprehending well what does that mean i think its i think more teachers should um   right   find different ways and be creative on their teaching   well i think youre absolutely correct   so   you know i think personally like you said it it has  more to do with the teachers coming out of their shell and not being afraid to make mistakes and saying you know hey im im gonna try this If it works great if it doesnt i apologize   right umhum   and i i found  in my own schooling that when the teachers made that special effort to to make the class exciting to make it different to to challenge my intellect or to to bring about a different method of teaching i was a lot more interested in learning   yeah exactly   what do you think about the grading systems and and how those work   the grading system grading system um   uhhuh   well i think um well in a sense its probably too easy but if it wasnt   umhum   um these kids you know i mean nowadays a lot of kids they just you know dont try they dont get the grades that they could   umhum umhum   and um i dont   do you think theres too much focus on grades grades instead of learning   i dont yeah i think well the field i wanna go into grades to me doesnt mean much it doesnt tell you how intelligent you are how bright you are you know um   umhum right   because i know somebody whos very bright and very intelligent but just doesnt get the grades and thats just because they have a learning disability um so yeah i think you have a good point there where they dont focus enough on them   huhuh umhum   how they learn and what theyre learning you know not on the grade   hm right yeah and i think at least as me as a college student i have a really hard time because you know they when you go out for a job or whatever theyre gonna focus on your grades and i think again that a lot of the school problems are more society problems where theyre not looking at the individuals as much much as they are just the whole overall picture   right   and you know like you said i i like the point that you brought up that that you said really it it needs to be individualized and i think as that happens more that the schooling will become better   umhum yeah right and thats hard with a a large class you know with thirty kids you cant give them all your full attention but and you know i i wish there was a way im not sure of it   umhum
