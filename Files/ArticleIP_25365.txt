                                 DOS Capitalism            Writers have long soughtmetaphors to capture the conflict of new and old worlds Henry Adams posited anantithesis between the Dynamo and the Virginthe mysterious electricalgenerators he saw at the Great Exhibition of  and the religious devotionthat built Chartres Cathedral Adams saw the new technological forces of acentury ago as aweinspiring destructive and almost beyond comprehension Hisopposition has been revised many times since Recently for instance thepolitical scientist Benjamin Barber described the contest as Jihad vsMcWorld As one may gather from his terms Barber is hardly enamored of eitherglobalism or tribalism the modernizing principle or the medievalizing oneBoth in his view undermine the viability of participatory democracy            The newest entrant inthis contest of symbols is Thomas L Friedman the foreign affairs columnist ofthe New York Times  who offers a somewhat sunnier pair in his new bookThe Lexus and the Olive Tree  The Lexus a luxury car made mostly byrobots in a stateoftheart Japanese factory stands for progressall theanonymous transnational homogenizing standardizing market forces andtechnologies that make up todays globalizing economic system as he puts itThe olive tree which grows in the Middle East where Friedman was stationedfor several years as a correspondent for the Times  stands fornationalism religion tribe communitygnarled rooted things that cling tothe soil Friedman believes that the clash between these two principles definesthe postCold War era in international relations The Lexus and olive treeare wrestling with each other in the new system of globalization as he putsit energetically compounding his metaphor            Friedman is a Lexus man himselfhe lets it be known thathe drives one of these sublime sedans around the Washington suburb where helives when hes not trading Internet stocks on the Internet communicatingwith CEOs by cell phone or eating a Big Mac in some farflung capital Heavers that he respects olive trees and aspires to preserve as many as possiblebut that theres no stopping or even slowing technological advancementmarket integration or American cultural hegemony            His point of view is that of the TreasuryDepartment the Economist  and the Davos World Economic Forum Capitalnow moves swiftly and freely around the globea phenomenon Friedman calls inone of his catchier coinages an electronic herd Because this herd canstampede at will if not at whim developing nations now known as emergingmarkets no longer have much discretion about which economic policies topursue If your country lacks a capitalistfriendly financial structure with aconvertible currency transparency of information and protections forprivate property First World investment money will simply go elsewhere As theleader of a country you can choose to conform to international economic normsor you can choose to be poor Friedman makes this point various ways sayingit quoting others saying it and quoting himself saying it to others He callsthis dilemma the golden straightjacket            But rather than considerwhether we should be altogether pleased that the entire world seems to beconverging upon the same economic model Friedman simply declares it anonissue The integrated world market is coming no one can do anything aboutit so the question of how we like it is irrelevant You might call Friedmansforeign policy market realism Capitalism not liberal democracy emergedtriumphant from the Cold War And though a free economy tends to open up asociety over time growth and democracy arent necessarily connected in theshort term To Friedmans way of thinking the question of whether a governmenthas elected leaders or respects human rights has far less effect on itsimmediate prosperity than the question of whether it listens to theInternational Monetary Fund Russia and India which have something resemblingfree elections are stagnating because they refuse to liberalize theireconomies China which has a thriving capitalist economy but doesnt have freeelections survived the Asian economic crisis largely unscathed            The problem with Friedmans book is not that hes wrongabout economics or international relations I think hes largely right thoughas Ill argue in a minute he overstates the ease with which the Lexus and theolive tree can happily coexist The problem is that he has distilled theconventional wisdom of the enlightened financier circa  without adding muchthinking of his own Financial metaphors running away with him Friedmandescribes his journalistic method as information arbitrage He sees himselfacquiring knowledge at wholesale from the top diplomats hedge fund managersand central bankers to whom his Times column grants him access andselling at retail to general readers Reporting on things seen and heard whileglobetrotting with a bit of opinion thrown in works well in Friedmansbiweekly Times column but a book needs to do more than endorse thewisdom of othersespecially if the wisdom is as familiar and widely acceptedas that of Robert Hormats of Goldman Sachs and Lawrence Summers of the TreasuryDepartment The fact that Friedman agrees with these guys is no excuse forneglecting challenges from such skeptics as George Soros Jeffrey Sachs PaulKrugman or the aforementioned Barber none of whose views he considers            A subsidiary fault isrhetorical hyperventilation The less Frieidman has to say of his own the morehe relies on slogans and strained neologisms Countries he tells us haveeconomic operating systems of different degrees of sophistication which hedubs DOScaptial   etc Globalution is the way the electronic herdcreates pressure for democracy Glocalism is a cultures ability to profitfrom whats good about other cultures without soaking up whats bad Backwardcountries and companies suffer from Microchip Immune Deficiency or MIDS Attimes Friedman manages to sound like Jesse Jackson at a rally The UnitedStates can destroy you by dropping bombs and the Supermarkets can destroy youby downgrading your bonds he writes            This penchant for Toffleresque gimmickry finally gets thebetter of him in the chapter titled The Golden Arches Theory of ConflictPrevention Friedmans insight as he calls it is that no two countriesthat both had McDonalds had fought a war against each other since each got itsMcDonalds A variation on the theory that democracies dont go to war witheach other the golden arches hypothesis was proved false even before hisbooks publication date by the war between NATO and Serbia where the BelgradeMcDonalds franchises were promptly vandalized An ethnic and territorialconflict that doesnt have much to do with globalization at all the war inKosovo defies Friedmans notion that international relations is now anextension of international economics            As an evangelist for globalization Friedman isintent on demonstrating that its compatible with a respect for identity andtradition that olive trees can grow next to Lexi His Clintonian instinctstell him that any difficult choice must be a false choice His happygoyuppiesensibility tells him that we can have our cake and eat it too that technologycan uphold tradition instead of undermining it Thus Friedman spills over withhopeful juxtapositions garnered on his travels He describes Muslims on aflight from Bahrain using the planes global positioning system to pray towardMecca Kuwaiti feminists in veils and on the Internet Kayapo Indians in a hutin the Brazilian rain forest watching soccer and monitoring the value of theirgoldextraction rights on a satellite TV This last example Friedman describesas Lexus and olive tree in healthy balance            Friedman is almost certainly correct in his beliefthat globalization is likely to make life better for people in remote placesBut it wont do it while preserving their local cultures It will do it bypartially or completely obliterating them Thats what market capitalism doesIt uproots and homogenizes as it enricheslike a Ronco appliance as Friedmanmight say I dont know anything about the Kayapos but Id wager that if theykeep watching that satellite TV they wont be in loin cloths and huts the nexttime the foreign affairs columnist of the New York Times helicopters infor a visit
