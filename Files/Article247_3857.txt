                                 Read Any Good Dictionaries Lately                        Jesse            I agree that the users of our books read themdifferently than we do When the Encarta Dictionary ofEnglish was published last month the press celebrated the event by listingthe dictionarys errors which surely mortified Anne Soukhanov its editor Idont know if Ill ever get used to people misreading what I write or studentsmisinterpreting what I say But it does happen all the time Ive come to seethis as a legitimate function of reading and writing If Gass characterizesbooks as living in the mind not on the page hes saying to some extent thatbooks are the creation of the reader as well as the writer I know that when Iread I turn the text into a world that is influenced by who I am what I haveread or thought up to that point whats going on in my life or around me Andit doesnt matter whether Im reading the OED orBrideshead Revisited two of my favoritereads            You mentioned the example of people living in housesthinking they can critique houses as if they were architects Well noteveryone can design or build a house thats true But you know from yourexperience living in houses that you might have laid out the kitchendifferently or put the closet somewhere else or made one room smaller andanother larger Users of dictionaries get to use them any way they want towhether we like it or not When I ask people how they use their dictionariesthey tell me for spelling now I suppose more and more people just use spellcheckers for that or sometimes to look up an unfamiliar word But to someextent theyre saying this because they think thats how theyre supposed touse dictionaries In fact many people use dictionaries to press flowers hidemoney or prop up uneven table legs Or as booster seats for visiting smallchildren Dictionary editors like you and Anne Soukhanov and Sidney Landau knowthe fine distinctions that exist among dictionaries But end users often treatdictionaries as interchangeable One popular meaning of the word Websters issimply dictionary This is an indication of how people lump dictionariestogether But I dont think any dictionaryeven the Encarta defines Websters generically as dictionary I assumethat has something to do with trademark worries Websters is part of thename of several dictionaries now but it may also reflect an unwillingness onthe part of dictionary makers to admit that the public doesnt discriminate thedictionary brands the way marketers would like them to            Users of language like people living in houses oftenwish things had been designed differently and they often take a hand inremodeling efforts these may have amateurish effects or they may be quiteprofessional I like to ask audiences every chance I get If you were theboss of English what would you change The three most common answers I getare still  Id reform the spelling  Id get rid of the meaninglessexpression You know  Theres too much swearing            The answers are a nice springboard for talking about how you go about reforming language and what limitations youd face justsaying it wont make it so  how expressions like you know actuallyfunction linguistically people arent saying you know just to annoy youeven if thats the effect and  the nature of language etiquette tabooeuphemism and context As Clarence Darrow said in Inherit the Wind  I dont swear just for the hell of it            But one more thing to return to William Gass Ithought when I began reading your piece that you were going to mention thefuture of the book that is the question we hear a lot Will print books bereplaced by virtual books Ive been thinking about the effects of technologyon our reading and writing practices and wonder if that might be somethingyoud want to talk aboutand speculate about I myself see virtual textexpanding I dont see us yet curling up with a virtual book taking a virtualbook to the beach browsing through musty used virtual book stores looking forthat elusive something special But I do see changes happening everywhere sofar as reading and writing are concerned especially in my own literacypractice Im perfectly comfortable composing at a keyboard Though I love agood fountain pen I find that every time I have to write by hand on a pad ofpaper Im annoyed at the inconvenience plus my handwriting is shot throughlack of practice not that it was very good to begin with But Im not yet atthe point where Im entirely comfortable reading and editing my writingonscreen Im getting there though and I notice I spend less and less timeprinting things out editing them at the desk then keying in correctionsThats what I mean by technology affecting our literacy practices            So hows by youDennis
