                                 A  Dow            One year ago with the DowJones industrial average at  financial writer James Glassman andeconomist Kevin Hassett wrote in the Wall Street Journal that the priceof stocks was still way too low By their logic they said the Dow should beat and would be when investors caught on            This week as the Dowhit  Glassman and Hassett repeat their argument in the Journal They admit that the financial establishment has reacted with guffaws They donot mention that Jeremy Siegel the Wharton finance professor whose research iscentral to their case wrote to the Journal that their analysiscontains a serious flaw and vastly overstates the value of stocks                  Slate                also published a  between Glassman and theEconomist s Clive Crook in which Crook explained that Glassman waswrong plain wrong  in the same way that its wrong to say two plus twoequals five But Glassman and Hassett henceforth Glassman remain unbowedIn fact theyve upped the ante This fall theyre bringing out a book titledDow              It would make a wonderful tale if these two bothassociated with the American Enterprise Institute a conservative Washingtonthink tank had discovered what the entire finance establishment had missedand written the next Wealth of Nations  The true tale sadly issomewhat less inspiring Glassmans analysis suffers from a plain conceptualmistake described below which he simply refuses to admit no matter how manytimes it is pointed out to him Here is his argument and why it is wrong            Glassman begins by askingwhether youd rather have  in a savings account that pays  percentinterest or a  share of a company that earned  per share last year Theanswer is simple right The savings account pays you  per year while thestock pays only and even that only if the companys entire earnings arepaid out in dividends            But why would a stock that pays out only  be trading at when investors can get  in a savings account Because firms tend togrow over time and so do their earnings Firms can grow for any number ofreasons but only one is mathematically certain and that is the one Glassmansargument depends on A firm that earns  can use it to expand and thusincrease its earnings expand even more and so on For instance a typicalfirm with  of earnings per share might earn  next year  thefollowing year and so on In  years earnings per share will pass  andcontinue to increase You can show mathematically that  a year forever and this year plus  next year and so on are equal amounts So its notillogical that investors would be willing to pay the same  for eitherincome stream            Glassman points out that investors are notpaying the same amount for these two income streams To get  a year from asavings account costs you about  today but you can buy  of corporateearnings on the stock market for an average of only  One reason is thatstocks are considered riskier Even if the average return on the stocks is thesame as the certain return on the savings account people will pay extra forthe certainty itself Glassman thinks this is the only reason for thedifferencealthough its not            But Glassmanarguesciting historical studies by Siegelthat stocks held for many yearsare not actually riskier And when people realize this theyll be willing topay  instead of  for  of corporate earnings and stock prices willquadruple Thats where he gets his  Dow four times the current levelMaybe its not too late to call the book Dow              So wheres the flaw Assume that Glassman is right aboutthe longterm risk of stocks and assume hes right that average corporateearnings will grow at  percent a year The problem is that he isdoublecounting The  a year you get from a savings account is yours to spendon anything you please The corporate earnings are yours to spend only if theyare paid out in dividends But if they are paid out in dividends they arentavailable to expand the firm and so the delightful progression from  to to  and so on wont occur            Another way to see the flaw is to apply Glassmanslogic to the savings account Sure a  investment today will only get you this year But those earnings will allow the savings account to grow andnext years earnings will be  and then  and so on So according toGlassmans theory you should be willing to pay  for a  savingsaccount            The key point is that earnings cannot besimultaneously paid out in dividends and invested in future profitsGlassman would be right however if you could buy  of dividends for But it turns out that to buy  of dividends costs you  among DowJones industrial average stocks Which suggests that if you really believethat stocks are actually no riskier than a savings accountor rather if youbelieve that everyone else will come to believe thisthe Dow may still have or so points to go Dow  anyone
