FEDERAL CROPINSURANCE CORPORATION ENTITLED CATASTROPHIC RISK PROTECTIONENDORSEMENT RIN AB AND GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVEREGULATIONS FEDERAL CROP INSURANCE REFORM ACT OF  REGULATIONSFOR IMPLEMENTATION RIN ABi Costbenefit analysisThe Federal Crop Insurance Corporation FCIC prepared acostbenefit analysis in connection with the final rules The costsand benefits discussed in the analysis consider both rulesThe analysis estimated  million in savings associated withrequiring a producer to obtain at least catastrophic coverage forany crop of economic significance as a condition of receivingbenefits for that crop under certain Department of Agricultureprograms linkage requirement or signing a waiver for eligibilityfor emergency crop loss assistance A  million cost resultingfrom the loss of revenue is estimated from the tobacco marketingcard and the undivided interest language which allows a landownerto obtain catastrophic coverage to satisfy the linkage requirementfor all other landowners who hold an undivided interest in giveninsurable acreage Therefore a  million annual savings isestimated to result from the rulesIn addition the rule is expected to result in less volatilityof producers incomes and less risk of no income due to adverseweather events and rural communities and producers will benefitfrom the certainty of payments in times of catastrophic yieldlosses The Government benefits from a single disaster protectionprogram as opposed to the previous ad hoc disaster programs andreduced Federal outlaysii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and Pursuant to section b of the Act FCIC certified in thepreambles to both the interim rules  Fed Reg  and January   and the final rules  Fed Reg  and August   that the rules would not have asignificant impact on a substantial number of small entitiesTherefore there was no requirement to prepare an initial or finalregulatory flexibility analysis under sections  or  of theAct For the same reason sections  and  areinapplicableGAOOGCHowever the preambles to the final rules do discuss additionalflexibility and cost savings for small entities in several areasFirst producers are no longer required to obtain at leastcatastrophic coverage for economically significant crops but maysign a waiver foregoing emergency crop loss assistance Second allproducers with a share in a tobacco crop are allowed to be underone marketing card to insure the crop under one insurance policyFinally with certain restrictions persons who hold an undividedinterest in a crop may be eligible to purchase one insurance policycovering all shares to satisfy linkage requirements thereby nothaving to pay the  processing fee in these situationsAccording to an official at FCIC publication of thecertifications in the Federal Register was treated as providingnotice under section b to the Small Business AdministrationsSBA Chief Counsel for Advocacy The SBA has confirmed that someagencies follow this practice without objection from SBAiii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC  In the preambles to the final rules FCIC explains that therules do not contain a Federal mandate under Title  of the Act forState local or tribal governments or the private sector andtherefore sections  and  of the Act are inapplicableIn addition the final rules do not affect small governments orcontain a significant intergovernmental mandate Accordinglysections  and  of the Act which require agencies to consultwith small governments and solicit input from State local andtribal governments are also inapplicableiv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts andExecutive ordersAdministrative Procedure Act  USC   et seqThe rules were promulgated through the notice and commentrulemaking procedures of the Act  USC   Because theFederal Crop Insurance Reform Act of  required that thestatutory changes be implemented by the  crop year and many ofthe changes were mandated by the statute FCIC invoked theexception to the notice and comment requirements contained in USC  bB that it would be impractical and contrary to thepublic interest to publish the rules prior to making the ruleseffective Therefore the rules were published as interim rulesrather than as proposed rulesHowever a  day period was afforded for comments to besubmitted on the interim rules which period was reopened on August  and extended to August   Forty comments werereceived and considered prior to the issuance of the final rulesEach of the comments and the response and changesPage  GAOOGCmade by the FCIC based on such comments are discussed in thepreambles to the final rulesPaperwork Reduction Act  USC  The information collections contained in
