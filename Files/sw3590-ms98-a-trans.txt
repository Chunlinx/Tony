        how the Mavericks doing     oh soso   soso   yeah theyre not doing too good this year theyre they they think they kind of started off with a rocket there at the beginning not in the season but i mean just when uh just in general   uhhuh right   just kind of come down to an even slump but theyre not doing too good this year   story with Tarpley is he uh is he history altogether   oh yeah oh yeah   thats kind of in a oh tough situation theyre handling   yeah im kind of surprised that they uh that they that they hung onto him as long as they did   really they they gave him every chance possible with him     oh they gave him more than more than uh more than i would have   is that right   oh yeah i wouldnt i wouldnt have put up with it after the second time id have said get out of here   uhhuh uh hes talented player but uh i feel  i dont know they seem to get involved in those substance abuse problems and its a tough road for them   oh i know it you follow follow the Mavericks   well you know because i follow the Jazz fairly closely and then you know were in the same conference   yeah   and you know keep tabs on them a little bit   hows the Jazz doing this year   theyre doing well i uh   are they   theyre in the in the head of the division and just won the last two road games they beat uh Philadelphia tonight it was a close one beat them by two points or three points but yeah theyre doing theyre doing great uh they had this little incident i dont know if you heard about it with uh Carl   well thats good   Carl Malone and Isaiah Thomas   huhuh   there was a i guess they played last Friday here in Salt Lake       and about the first two minutes of the game Isaiah drove in and Malone went up to block the shot and really fouled him hard so hard that it put him to the floor and he had like twenty stitches above his eye   whoa   and uh they in reviewing the tapes decided it was a flagrant foul oh i guess they decided it was flagrant foul at the time of the ball game and ejected Carl and then he got a he got a ten thousand dollar fine and one game suspension which is about another thirty five thousand   no kidding   so it was a forty five thousand dollar deal for him and i i believe it was unintentional he fouled him hard but it wasnt like he had you know malicious intent to go cream the guy       so theres been a big buzz about that how how Detroits the bad boys of the league to begin with and when something like that happens to one of their players theyre all all claiming that uh   my goodness   you know it was totally uncalled for this unnecessary violence when theyve been guilty of that kind of thing for years   right   Laimbeer and Rodman are about the two worst hatchet men in the league  so   yeah thats for sure   anyway   yeah i didnt even hear i didnt even hear but i havent picked up a paper probably or a sports page in   i venture to say in about a month   oh is that right   yeah i havent had a chance to so   youve youve been busy huh   yeah just been extremely busy but no i didnt i didnt even hear about that i didnt even see it on the news so i must have missed that one altogether   well yeah it it was probably  more local interest obviously but   no  something something like that they usually theyll usually you know play that just about anywhere   yeah and everybodys interested in seeing the little well its just the nature of the human i guess to like to see a little violence  i think   oh especially excessive violence where somebody gets hurt especially oh its just so but were raised were raised on that   yeah yeah   everybodys raised on that   thats true   on the negatives of life i guess   yeah well ive had about enough of Magic Johnson for the year though   oh yeah   i guess where hes uh appears hes touring with the team and Jabbars thinking of coming out of retirement to help fund the AIDS research and i dont know you hear both those stories   yeah i heard those   i guess thats a nice gesture on Jabbars part   yeah might as well   yeah   its going to take a lot of people to do that though  its going to take a lot of research   what do you what do you think about that do you do you think that he got what he deserved or   you mean as far as Magic   yeah   well i mean you know he  he got to pay to pay to play as they say   yeah   yeah but hes hes paying pretty hard   yeah i did see it  circumstances but     well that yeah thats true   i guess i guess maybe well you know some good come of it because of this you know its a notoriety and focus that itll have on the disease   yeah thats true he definitely he definitely opened it up and showed a different side of it   yeah i dont know how the Lakers are going to do without him this year they theyre doing all right now from what i see but   i dont think theyll hold together   yeah hes uh the was the heart and soul of that group so   no i believe youre right i believe youre right   anyway what other teams you follow any   no thats about it i i i just really i mean when it gets down to the end end of the season if the Mavericks are doing good ill stay up with them but yeah i im dedicated to a point   uhhuh yeah   you know just like im more dedicated in football i guess than anything   well the Cowboys are a lot more popular arent they   well yeah well i was raised on the Cowboys so   uhhuh   i mean the Mavericks are   well   i i was raised with the old Dallas Chaparrals   oh is that right   yeah that was years ago though   uhhuh   that was that was uh i guess the original pro team that that they had here   yeah well
