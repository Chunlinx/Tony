                                 Beating Around the Bush            Everything you need to know about Gov George W Bush RTexas you learned inkindergarten Launching his presidential campaign in Iowa this weekend Bushoutlined a threefold agenda to impose bad consequences for bad behavior andlove our neighbor as we want to be loved ourselves to help churches andcharities to nurture to mentor to comfort people in need and to insistthat every child must be educated            A lessdaring platform can scarcely be imagined Yet the media lauded Bushs speechfor its boldness citing the contrasts he drew with President Clinton whileappealing to a different kind of audience from the one that had elected hisfather and distinguishing himself from the rest of the crowded Republicanfield How does Bush pass off his clichs as confrontations By fabricatingillusory distinctions and debates                            Compassionate conservatism This is Bushs unofficialslogan Saturday in Iowa Rep Jim Leach RIowa introduced Bush as aconservative with a conscience with compassion Bush used the wordcompassion  times in his speech concluding I know this approach has beencriticized But why Is compassion beneath us Is mercy below us Should ourparty be led by someone who boasts of a hard heart  Im proud to be acompassionate conservative I welcome the label And on this ground I will makemy stand The crowd applauded and the press swooned As the Los AngelesTimes described the scene Taking up a challenge from some opponents Bushdefended his philosophy of compassionate conservatism             Howdoes Bush spin compassion the worlds most universal value as a courageousstand As with most magic tricks the sleight of hand occurs at the outsetwhen Bush says his philosophy has been criticized In truth none of Bushsrivals has criticized compassion or boasted of a hard heart On the contrarysome call compassionate conservatism an offensive phrase because it suggeststhat unmodified conservatives lack compassion just as many liberals complainedthat Vice President Al Gores practical idealism implied that unmodifiedidealists were impractical Others dismiss this phrase as weasel wordsdesigned to substitute for positions on specific issues What Bushs opponentshave criticized in short is not his approach but its redundancy andinsubstantiality By conning the media into reporting that he was defendinghis philosophy Bush snuffed out the real question whether he has aphilosophy to defend                            Prosperity with a purpose This is Bushs official campaigntheme Its supposed to convey what he offers that Gore doesnt Clinton andGore may have brought us prosperity the slogan suggests but Bush will giveour prosperity a purpose And what is that purpose According to Bush Americamust be prosperous so that anybody who wants to work can find a high qualityhigh paying job America must be prosperous so that people can realize theirentrepreneurial dreams America must be open so that every citizen knows thepromise of America America must be educated so that all our citizens canrealize the American dream In other words the purpose of prosperity is prosperity                            The responsibility era Bush doesnt talk about moralissues that might get him into trouble such as abortion or homosexualityInstead he pledges to usher in the responsibility era in which we willconfront illegitimacy instill discipline and love in juvenile justice andaccept that were responsible for our neighbors and helping in ourcommunities Lest anyone point out the abstractness and obviousness of thesecommitments Bush says they stand in stark contrast to the last few decadeswhen our culture has clearly said If it feels good do it and if youve gota problem blame somebody else  Does Bush really think the last few decadessupervised in large part by his father and President Reagan were the era ofirresponsibility Or is he painting a dark background to lend the illusion ofluster to his pale moral agenda            Likewise Bush often uses sharp language to obscure fuzzy thought Some peoplethink it is inappropriate to draw a moral line in the sand Not me heproclaims And what is his line Children must learn to say yes toresponsibility yes to hard work yes to honesty and yes to family LikewiseBush asserts We must teach our children there are  wrong choices Suchas Drugs alcohol and teen pregnancy he says And whats wrong with teenpregnancy Its a surefire way to fall behind he explains using thelanguage not of a pulpit but of a Planned Parenthood clinic                            New idealism In Iowa Bush elicited applause and mediaexcitement by taking what the Los Angeles Times called several shotsat Clinton I will not use my office as a mirror to reflect public opiniondeclared Bush Government should not try to be all things to all people Ido not run polls to tell me what to think We will show that politics aftera time of tarnished ideals can be higher and better We will give our countrya fresh start after a season of cynicism Americans are waiting for newhopes new energy and new idealism            Thedifference between an idealist and a cynic in this view is that the idealistis willing to take a stand contrary to public opinion On taxes Bush proposesto give Americans more money in the name of compassion On special interestpork He told Iowans he supports ethanol subsidies On Kosovo He welcomesthe peace agreement but says America should be suspicious of it On the GOPscampaign against James Hormel the gay man Clinton has appointed to beambassador to Luxembourg Bush says that any qualified appointee should beallowed to serve but that he wont speak out against the campaign becauseHormel isnt conservative On fiscal restraint Bush says After we meetpriorities when we have money left over we must pass it back to thetaxpayers Note the caveat about priorities Sound familiar            Likehis father Bush substitutes virtue for substance When asked byNewsweek what his family stands for George W answered Honestyintegrity serving for the right reasons And what are those reasonsAmerica and what America stands for he replied To bring integrity anddecency to the process and to serve for the right reason which is countryabove self But Im going to have a specific agenda that addresses what I thinkare the big concerns as we go into the  st century The youngerBushs constant assurances that hes going to unveil his point plans andspecific incentives any day nowa vague pledge to be specificare thefunctional equivalent of his fathers constant allusions to vision The lessyou have of something the more you boast of it abstractly                            A uniter not adivider Bushs greatest feat has been to spin his evasion ofcontroversies as a virtue A leader must be a uniter not a divider hedeclares This country is hungry for a newstyle campaign that is positivehopeful inclusive and unites America With those words the Republicanfrontrunner takes a bold stand against taking bold stands Shame on lessercandidates who demand that he choose sides on the difficult issues of the dayHes in his own league And by selling the media distinctions without adifference he intends to keep it that way
