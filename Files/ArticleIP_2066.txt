                                 Therapeutic Laws            Bill Clinton wants to be anactivist chief executive but a paradox of his own making stands in the way Inhis last State of the Union address he repudiated big government We knowtheres not a program for every problem he said The era of big governmentis over With the help of Dick Morris Clinton has turned this paradoxthislets face itlogical contradiction into an electoral strength Cleverrhetoric has helped But so did his embrace of what might be calledtherapeutic legislation            Therapeutic legislation isintended to make people feel good not actually to accomplish anythingSometimes it addresses a virtually nonexistent problem or at least a problemthat ranks lower on any sensible scale of national concerns than the fuss andselfcongratulation would indicate Sometimes it addresses real majorproblems but in an almost totally symbolic manner Often therapeuticlegislation exploits the electorates short attention span its capacity tobecome suddenly obsessed with an issue and thenespecially if provided withlegislative catharsisto forget it just as quickly In any case therapeuticlegislation costs the taxpayer little or nothing and generally offends almostno one In an important subclass of therapeutic legislation however stagilyoffending an unpopular interest groupeg the tobacco lobbyis part of thetherapy            This week Clinton signedanother of the many therapeutic laws for which he has taken credit This onemakes stalking across interstate lines or on US government property a federaloffense punishable by five years to life in prison The law was sponsored bySen Kay Bailey Hutchison Republican of Texas proving that Democrats arentalone in the dirty habit of pleasuring themselves this way The antistalkinglaw is typical of much therapeutic legislation in that it addresses a hungerfor the federal government to do something about a matterusually crimeor educationthat is properly the concern of the states I wouldnt be socallous as to suggest that stalking isnt an urgent problem fully worthy ofimmediate action by a Congress that cant pass a budget on time But isstalking across state lines or on federal property really such apressing concern Undoubtedly it is terrifying when it happens as itapparently happened to Sen Hutchison The reason Congress and the presidenthave outlawed it with such a flourish however is as a way of expressingsymbolic concern over stalking in general Sen Hutchisons office concedesthat it has collected no information on the number of interstate stalkingcases            Indeedif there were thousands of interstate stalkers if they did posea serious lawenforcement problem Hutchisons legislation would have smokedout some sort of constituency to oppose the bill If a stalkers lobby itselfdidnt pipe up at least civil libertarians who deplore the doublejeopardyimplications of a federal stalking law would have criticized it InsteadHutchisons solution to the nonproblem passed  in the Senate A law thatpasses with no opposition is a good bet to be therapeutic legislation And itis doubly hypocritical for Republicans who claim to believe in less governmentand in state government to be clotting the federal statute books with lawsthat mess in areas of state concern                           M any therapeutic laws are superfluous Some are passed unanimouslyBut the defining characteristic of a therapeutic bill is its thrift It doesntincrease the budget it requires no new taxes and it offends nospecialinterest group The antistalking bill cost Clinton and several hundredmembers of Congress absolutely nothing but allowed them to inflate theiranticrime rsums            A good third of Clintonsacceptance speech at the Democratic Convention was used to publicizetherapeutic laws passed on his watch or new ones he wanted Congress toconsider            He called for a ban oncopkiller bullets reiterated his support for a victimsrightsconstitutional amendment argued for an extension of the Family and MedicalLeave law and a measure to keep moms and their babies in hospitals longer than hours promoted a measure that would place taggents in explosives and askedfor a Brady Bill amendment to keep guns out of the hands of perpetrators ofdomestic violence            He touted the televisionVchip praised the KennedyKassebaum law an ultratherapeutic law thatguarantees portability of insurance but places no ceiling on the rates insurerscan charge applauded the ban on assault rifles and bragged about the newFDA regulations that curb the advertising and sale of cigarettes tochildren            To muchapplause he deplored the fact that  million children live within just fourmiles of a toxic waste dump four miles  and urged that we make itillegal even to attempt to pollute whatever that means            Clinton isnt the only therapeutic politicianjust the best Linguistic nationalists are pushing their Englishfirstmeasures The ultrapatriotic want an amendment to ban flagburning hell whynot just mandate flagwaving The spitandpolish crowd campaigns forschool uniforms The drug warriors seek more drugfree zones To ward off childmolesters the city of San Mateo Calif has proposed background checks andfingerprinting of Little League coaches den mothers and others who volunteertheir time to children never mind as the Wall Street Journal reportsthat less than  percent of all child molestations take place in aninstitutional setting that most accused child molesters have no previousconvictions and that child abuse is down in the s And with the continuedBalanced Budget Amendment follies Congress indulges itself in the grandest oftherapeutic fantasies If it really wants to balance the budget it should justdo so rather than passing feelgood laws that say the budget should bebalanced            No doubtsomewhere in the above list Ive included a law that you dear reader supportand believe is more than merely therapeutic Your particular law or twoaddress problems fully worthy of a national fuss and Rose Garden signingceremony But surely even you will agree that most of these laws are merelytherapeutic We can all agree on that without agreeing on which are theexceptions            Therapeutic laws become props for rhetoric that might becalled demagoguery except that it disgraces the memories of Joe McCarthy andHuey Long and the ambitions of Pat Buchanan to call Clinton a demagogue Thegenuine demagogue assails minorities and labels his foes Communists The modernsemigogue speaks liltingly about children and education and health and publicsafety He artfully constructs his debate to make his foes sound as if they areagainst children for gun violence against safe streets and for pollutionThe semigogue in chief has buried Dole with so many positives during thiselection season its enough to make you long for the days of negativecampaigning            And for genuine activismEven though my personal tastes in legislation tend toward the kind that beginCongress shall pass no law I admired the old Bill Clinton who attempted toreorganize the  trillion healthcare business and who forthrightly called fora workfare program that would cost more not less than simple handouts ThatClinton didnt pussyfoot around He stood for what he believed in Hestimulated a thunderous and enlightening debate He demonstrated to theelectorate that real change is not cheap and easy            He also got his asskicked
