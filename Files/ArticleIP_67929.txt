                                 Charles Schulz            Thevery best comic strips for my taste are the magic ones They all come fromthe same place left field Also known as the blue Or the intuition Theother place they come from is of course the real world Its a combination ofthe two The cartoonist experiences real life in some penetrating way Then heor she takes a leap into the unconscious the dreamlike the mysteriouswithin hoping to emerge with something fresh something original In the bestand rarest cases what emerges is something brilliant and enduring likePeanuts             Whenit first came on the scene it was unlike any other cartoon It had and has apowerful originality both visually and verbally Schulz would set you up with acouple of tiny tots speaking in childlike innocence for three panels then comeout of the wild blue yonder with one of them sounding suddenly like amiddleaged college professor in the grip of a nervous breakdown Thedimensions of comicstrip possibility expanded            Simplicity is its initial appeal And openness Innocence It catches our eyeand draws in our psyches Economy of line with so much between the lines Afraught simplicity a growing complexity an emotional involvement in Schulzsdeeply felt world            Itworks because its genuine and because Schulz has just the right touch ofmagic Not a bunch of schlocky gags No overwrought corn A genuine search isgoing on The comic strip has a soul Schulz believes in his world and caresabout it and so do we            JeanShepherd the recently deceased radio genius who created magic with the spokenword used to berate Snoopy back in the late s Shepherd thought the wholeidea of a dog with an imaginary life as a World War I pilot and a novelistetc destroyed the credibility of the strip Shepherd was a hero of mine Hiscriticism caused me to question my own belief in Peanuts  I took itunder consideration I concluded that Shepherd was wrong            Howmuch leeway a comic strip can sustain how far afield it can stretch and strayis always a delicate balance guided by the intuition of the cartoonist Schulzhas great instincts I say all of it works            Iespecially love the nutty out of the blue lines like Lucy telling LinusWhen oak trees get real old theyre cut down and used to make knottypinerecreation rooms            Thats not contrivanceNot a hack gag Thats pure left field
