                    Background        The human         FHIT gene located at the chromosome         fragile site FRAB is inactivated early in the        development of many tumors     Murine         Fhit is also located at a fragile        site     and mice heterozygous for disruption of         Fhit  given low intragastric doses        of the mutagen Nnitrosomethylbenzylamine develop stomach        and sebaceous tumors    that can be prevented by viral        Fhit expression     Fhit a dimer of  amino acid        subunits is a member of the histidine triad HIT        superfamily of nucleotide hydrolases and transferases             Members of the Hint branch of the HIT superfamily are        found in all forms of life     The         S cerevisiae Hint homolog Hnt and        rabbit Hint possess adenosine monophosphoramidase activity        that functions in yeast to positively regulate function of        Kin Ccl and Tfb which constitute the kinase component        of general transcription factor TFIIH     A new Hint        related protein Aprataxin is mutated in individuals with        ataxia with oculomotor apraxia     and has a yeast        homolog termed Hnt     Members of the Fhit branch of        the HIT superfamily have been found in fungi             animals      and plants    and hydrolyze        diadenosine tetraphosphate diadenosine triphosphate and        other dinucleoside polyphosphates The middle        histidine of the histidine triad His in human Fhit        which is critical for hydrolysis of ApppA by Fhit             is not necessary for tumor suppression             Nonetheless wildtype and HisAsn forms of Fhit are        saturated by ApppA in the low micromolar range and form        stable complexes with nonhydrolyzable ApppA in which two        ApppA analogs are bound per Fhit dimer and all phosphates        cluster on one surface of the protein     These        observations suggested that Fhitsubstrate complexes may be        the active signaling form of Fhit and that the function of        the catalytically essential histidine may be to terminate        the lifetime of signaling complexes            Given that neither transcriptional nor        posttranscriptional regulation has been reported for Fhit        protein the level of biological activity of Fhit may be        controlled by levels of Fhit substrates inhibitors and        proteins that interact with Fhitnucleotide complexes Fhit        proteins from humans    and worms    bind ApppA and        AppppA with         K         m values of  to  M Human Fhit           and the         S cerevisiae Fhit homolog            which was called Aph but is here termed Hnt under        nomenclature aproved by the         Saccharomyces Genome Database cleave        ApppA more readily while Aph the         S pombe homolog cleaves AppppA more        readily     Consistent with the ApppA hydrolase        activity of purified Fhit protein most cancer cell lines        that are Fhit negative at the protein level have higher        levels of ApppA than cell lines that are Fhit positive            Nonetheless the actual concentrations of dinucleoside        polyphosphates were submicromolar in every cell culture        sample    and thus under the reported culture        conditions the measured dinucleoside polyphosphates would        not be expected to occupy the Fhit active site        substantially     Dinucleoside polyphosphate levels        were measured in adeninerequiring         S cerevisiae strains before or after        disruption of the Fhithomologous         HNT gene    and in        adeninerequiring         S pombe strains as a function of        disruption and overexpression of the Fhithomologous         aph gene     Recently it was        observed that diadenosine polyphosphates undergo a divalent        cationdependent conformational change that might mediate        their biosynthesis catabolism or signaling properties                   Here we discover a requirement of adenine biosynthesis        for highlevel dinucleoside polyphosphate accumulation in        the absence of the Fhit homolog in         S cerevisiae  By constructing        active site mutants of Hnt that were expressed in yeast        we demonstrate that ApppN and to a lesser degree AppppN        levels are controlled by the Hnt active site An added        benefit of these constructions is the availability of yeast        strains that possess high levels of dinucleoside        polyphosphates and at the same time express a mutant        Fhithomologous protein because these are conditions which        have been postulated to constitute the signaling form of        Fhit     Finally using controlled genotypes we        revisited conditions that lead to increased accumulation of        dinucleoside polyphosphates                     Recognizing that         hnt deletion is a pathological        condition we were particular interested in identifying        conditions that lead to accumulation of such compounds in        cells that contain a functional         HNT gene rather than simply        identifying conditions that produce diadenosine        polyphosphate accumulation in the absence of Hnt While        cells without a functional         HNT gene accumulate dinucleoside        polyphosphates in excess of  M in a variety of        nonstressed and stressed conditions C heat shock was        the only condition that produced dinucleoside polyphosphate        accumulation in excess of  M in cells containing a        functional         HNT gene These conditions did not        render the cells conditionally null for Hnt because cells        expressing         HNT continued to limit dinucleoside        polyphosphate accumulation during hours of heat shock        though at levels of  mM        Recently discovery that the Hinthomologous         HNT gene is required for high        temperature growth on galactose and observations that        alleles of         cak          kin          ccl and         tfb are hypersensitive to loss of        Hnt enzyme activity provided evidence that Hnt enzyme        activity positively regulates Kin function particularly        on galactose media     Though phenotypic consequences        of         hnt mutations have yet to be        discovered our observations suggest that synthetic lethal        interactions with         hnt mutations are likely to be found        in adenine prototrophic strains undergoing heat shock                    Results and discussion                  Disruption of HNTand tetrad analysis of          dinucleoside polyphosphate levels          An earlier report demonstrated that disruption of           HNT was tolerated by haploid yeast          strains without an effect on growth and that ApppN and          AppppN accumulate  and fold respectively on account          of the           hnt deletion     Because          those data were obtained by random spore analysis we          considered it important to test whether elevated          dinucleoside polyphosphate levels cosegregate with           hnt disruption in all tetrads          examined and whether any other commonly used genetic          markers affect dinucleoside polyphosphate levels Diploid          strain BY Table  created to be heterozygous for           MAT            ADE            HIS            LEU            LYS            MET            TRP            URA and           HNT  was allowed to sporulate and          was then dissected As shown in Figure  tetrads          produced four viable colonies two of which were large          and white and two of which were smaller and pink on YPD          medium which scored as ade on SDC ade medium Markers          segregated  in nearly all cases and possession of a           bp PCR fragment using primers  and  always          correlated with geneticinresistance while possession of          a  bp product correlated with geneticinsensitivity          as expected for segregants containing a nondisrupted           HNT gene          Haploid segregants from three complete tetrads were          cultured for   and  hours in SDC medium lysed          and levels of ApppN and AppppN were determined As shown          in Table  strains containing an intact           HNT gene were never observed to          have calculated intracellular ApppN levels above  M and          typically were found to have ApppN levels below  M          Strains disrupted for           hnt had ApppN levels of          approximately  to  M after one day of culture rising          to approximately  to  M and  to  M after two          and three days of culture respectively The           ade mutation was partially          epistatic to the effect of           hnt disruption on ApppN          accumulation           hnt strains containing           ade mutations were several fold          lower in ApppN accumulation than           hntADE isolates Thus deletion          of           hnt afforded a fold increase in          ApppN in           ade mutants consistent with an          earlier report of a fold effect     but a          fold increase in           ADE strains          Earlier           hnt deletion was reported to          increase AppppN levels only fold but the study was          performed in           ade mutants     Consistent          with that report the three           hnt ade strains showed only a          fold higher AppppN level than the three           HNT ade strains when nucleotide          levels were averaged across the three time points In          contrast           hntADE strains achieved a          fold higher level of AppppN than           HNT ADE strains Larger increases          in AppppN concentrations have been seen with disruption          of Apa and Apa the diadenosine tetraphosphate          phosphorylases in           S cerevisiae               indicating that they have a more significant role in          controlling AppppN levels than does Hnt In the case of          disruption of the Fhit and Hnthomologous           aph gene in           S pombe  which encodes an enzyme          relatively specific for a AppppA     a fold          increase in AppppA concentration was observed              Our data indicate that Hnt hydrolyzes ApppN and AppppN           in vivo in budding yeast and that          an intact adenine biosynthetic pathway is required for          highlevel synthesis and accumulation of adenylylated          dinucleoside polyphosphates                          Hnt active sitedependence of dinucleoside          polyphosphate accumulation          Catalytic activity of the Fhit ApppA hydrolase depends          on His      To test whether the active site of          Hnt is necessary to control dinucleoside polyphosphate          accumulation           in vivo  wildtype and mutant          alleles of           HNT that differ at His          corresponding to human Fhit His were expressed from          the           HNT promoter on plasmids Table           in           hntADE strain BYc As shown          in Table  reintroduction of wildtype           HNT produced a  to fold          reduction in intracellular concentrations of ApppN and a          two to sevenfold reduction in levels of AppppN This          reduction was activesite dependent adding back          multicopy           HNT with the nucleophilic          histidine replaced by alanine or aspartate reduced          dinucleoside polyphosphate levels less than twofold                          Dinucleoside polyphosphate levels may not be          limited by the levels of lysyl tRNA synthetase          AppppA is induced by heat shock in bacteria    and          the induction of AppppA was thought to be a function of          the heatshock inducible LysU lysyl tRNA synthetase          However deletion of           lysU had no effect on heatshock          inducible AppppA accumulation     The           KRS gene    encoding cytosolic          lysyl tRNA synthetase was cloned into multicopy plasmid          pRS    to generate plasmid pM Strains BYd                     ADE HNT  and BYc            ADE hnt  were transformed with          pM and the pRS control plasmid and cultures were          harvested at   and  hours Determination of ApppN          and AppppN concentrations revealed that ApppN levels are          substantially higher in           hnt mutants than in isogenic          wildtypes at all time points and that plasmids          conferring multiple copies of           KRS did not increase ApppN or          AppppN levels at any culture time point Table  To          address whether plasmid pM indeed increased lysyl tRNA          synthetase activity lysates from pRS and          pMtransformed BYc were assayed for incorporation of          H lysine into yeast tRNA As shown in Figure           tRNAdependent lysine incorporation was increased          fold by expression of           KRS from a multicopy plasmid                          Heat shock is the most effective stress for          elevation of dinucleoside polyphosphates          In the wild and in the laboratory yeast are exposed          to stresses such as hypoosmotic or hyperosmotic          conditions toxic cations heat shock and cellcycle          disruptive reagents To test whether such conditions          induce dinucleoside polyphosphates in hnt or Hnt          cells we incubated           ADE hnt and           ADE HNT cells in water  M          sorbitol  mM CdCl              C heat shock  mM caffeine          or in rich media for two hours and determined          dinucleoside polyphosphate levels Additionally to test          whether moderate overexpression of the lysyl tRNA          synthetase gene affected accumulation we compared          control transformants to multicopy           KRS transformants of the two          strains As shown in Table  the           hnt samples had substantially          higher ApppN levels than           HNT samples under all conditions          Among the           hnt samples only heat shocked          samples showed evidence of ApppN levels higher than the          levels in nonstressed           hnt cells Similarly among the           HNT samples the heat shocked          samples showed increased ApppN levels compared with          controltreated cells while CdCl            and other treated samples showed no          significant changes           KRS on a multicopy plasmid showed          no significant alteration of ApppN levels in any sample          As with other experiments AppppN levels were lower than          ApppN levels in all cases Heat shock was the best          inducer of AppppN Hypotonic hypertonic and caffeine          treated media produced no increase in AppppN not          shown          To further investigate the kinetics of heat shock and          cadmiuminduction of ApppN and AppppN levels we          transformed           hntADE strain BYc with          multicopy plasmids containing no           HNT gene the wildtype           HNT gene or the           HNTHisAla or           HNTHisAsp alleles of           HNT  Cultures were exposed to          either  mM CdCl            or C heat shock and intracellular          concentrations of ApppN and AppppN were determined at          minute timepoints          As shown in Figure  ApppN and AppppN levels are          higher in           hnt strains than in cells with a          functional           HNT gene and were not          significantly elevated by  mM CdCl             However when cells were heat          shocked as shown in Figure  ApppN and AppppN levels          increased substantially in cultures with every           HNT genotype absence presence or          active site mutation Increases in dinucleoside          polyphosphates in Hnt cultures cannot be attributed to          thermal inactivation of Hnt because the presence of           HNT plasmids continues to reduce          incremental increases in dinucleoside polyphosphates even          in the fourth hour of the heat shock Furthermore the          activesite mutant alleles of           HNT            HNTHisAla and           HNTHisAsp  provided on          plasmids pB and pB demonstrated intermediate          abilities to control dinucleoside polyphosphate levels          suggesting that elevated temperature reduces the          catalytic defects of these mutant enzymes The high          levels of ApppN  M and AppppN  M and the          fact that Hntcontaining samples continue to reduce the           rate of increase in dinucleoside          polyphosphates without reducing their concentrations          demonstrate that heat shock induces dinucleoside          polyphosphate synthesis and that Hnt is saturated under          such conditions In           Xenopus oocytes however some work          has suggested that heat shockdependent accumulation of          AppppN is largely due to inactivation of degradative          enzymes                                Conclusions        It had been reported that Hnt controls ApppN levels         in vivo  with a minor effect on        AppppN     Here we show that the         ade mutation present in earlier        experiments prevents accumulation of ApppN and AppppN and        reduced the magnitude of the Hnt effect In         ADE strains examined herein        deletion of         HNT increased levels of ApppN and        AppppN by factors of approximately  and  respectively        Mutagenesis     Xray crystallography      and        stereochemical analysis    indicate that His is the        nucleophile that attacks the phosphate of Fhit        substrates Our analysis shows that the corresponding        residue His of Hnt is required for hydrolysis of        ApppN and AppppN substrates         in vivo         Other than effects on the concentrations of        intracellular nucleotides neither deletion of         HNT nor mutation of His of         HNT had phenotypic consequences In        the case of the Hinthomologous         HNT gene of         S cerevisiae  the phenotype of the        single mutant was mild and the biological pathway positive        regulation of Kin the yeast homolog of Cdk was        revealed by synthetic lethal interactions between         hnt and hypomorphic alleles of         cak          kin          ccl and         tfb     Because backup systems        to limit problems with         hnt mutant cells apparently exist        synthetic lethal interactions may be critical to identify        the Hnt biological pathway Thus if the major function of                HNT is simply control of        dinucleoside polyphosphates lest their accumulation inhibit        other enzymes ie McLennans foe hypothesis            then synthetic lethal phenotypes ought to be sought with         hnt mutant strains that are        wildtype for the adenine biosynthetic pathway potentially        under heat shock conditions On the other hand if the        major function of Hnt depends on formation of an        enzymesubstrate complex     then synthetic lethal        interactions ought to be sought in heat shocked         ADE HNTHisAla strains In fact        because         ADE HNTHisAla strains have high        levels of dinucleoside polyphosphates and an Hnt        polypeptide such a strain may be sensitized to secondary        mutations whether dinucleoside polyphosphates are friend        or foe                        Materials and methods                  General molecular biology          Yeast media and

ends          corresponding to sequences upstream and downstream of           HNT  The resulting fragment was          transformed into haploid           S cerevisiae strain BY and          transformants were selected on YPD with  gml          geneticin To ensure that geneticinresistance was linked          to           hnt disruption genomic DNA from          several geneticinresistant

segregants pregrown in liquid SDC          medium were inoculated into  ml of SDC at starting          density of  cells per ml At   and  hours of          growth  ml of cells were harvested cells counted          microscopically lysed and levels of AppppN and ApppN          were determined as described     Intracellular          concentrations of ApppN and AppppN were calculated using             l as the volume of a haploid cell              Cultures of BYc were transformed with plasmids          pRS pB pB and pB and transformants were          selected on SDChis media Intracellular concentrations          of ApppN and AppppN were determined for transformants          from cultures in SDChis media as above To determine          whether a multicopy lysyl tRNA synthetase plasmid          affected accumulation of dinucleoside polyphosphates we          transformed           HNT ADE strain BYd and           hntADE strain BYc with          control plasmid pRS and with plasmid pM          Transformants were grown for   and  hours in          SDChis media and intracellular dinucleoside          polyphosphate concentrations were determined as above To          survey dinucleoside polyphosphate induction as a function          of potential stress conditions strain BYc was          transformed with either pRS or pM effectively           hnt and           hnt YEp           KRS  respectively and strain          BYd was transformed with the same plasmids          effectively           HNT and           HNT YEp           KRS  respectively After           hours of culture cells were pelleted and resuspended in          either YPD media water SDChis media or the same media          supplemented with  mM CdCl              mM caffeine or  M sorbitol          The SDChis sample was incubated for  hours at C          while other samples were incubated for  hours at room          temperature prior to extraction for determination of          dinucleoside polyphosphate concentrations To determine          the time course of ApppN and AppppN levels as a function          of stresses we used strains BYd and BYc          transformed with pRS pB pB or pB          Transformants were cultured for  hours treated with           mM CdCl            or C heat shock and then          harvested for nucleotide quantitation at  minute          intervals Experiments presented in Tables   and          were performed two three five and three times          respectively Experiments presented in Figures and were          performed four times each Because diadenosine          polyphosphate levels vary with time in culture          generating a higher or lower range of values in          independently conducted experiments we did not average          values obtained in separate experiments For the data          presented in Table  triplicate cultures were prepared          and the ApppN levels for identically treated samples are          provided as averages
