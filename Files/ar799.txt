                    Introduction        Actinin is an actinbinding cytoskeletal protein        present in a variety of cells    and in focal adhesion        sites where cells adhere to the substrate     There is        biochemical    and histologic    evidence that focal        adhesion complexes containing actinin and other footpad        material are left behind as a result of normal movement of        cells     perhaps at increased rates when neutrophils        and monocytes move into inflammatory tissue We have shown        that actinin is abundant in the bone marrow stroma        matrix presumably at focal adhesion sites     We have        also reported that a  kDa aminoterminal actinin        fragment which we have named mactinin is generated by the        degradation of extracellular actinin by monocytesecreted        urokinase     Furthermore we have demonstrated that        mactinin is present in inflammation caused by         Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia by        examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice with        infection     It was not present in mice not challenged        with         P carinii  suggesting that        inflammaton is necessary for mactinin formation We have        also reported that mactinin promotes monocytemacrophage        maturation     For example actinin fragments        significantly increase lysozyme secretion and        tartateresistant acid phosphatase staining in peripheral        blood monocytes In contrast intact actinin has no        maturationpromoting activity We proposed that mactinin is        present in the microenvironment at sites of various types        of inflammation perhaps owing to migrating cell        populations and there it might contribute to the        recruitment and maturation of monocytes        Monocytemacrophage infiltration has a key role in the        pathogenesis of chronic arthritis     The release of        proinflammatory cytokines chemokines growth factors and        enzymes by the synovial lining macrophages is important for        the onset propagation and flare of arthritic inflammation            The finding that the number of synovial tissue        macrophages is correlated with joint destruction in        rheumatoid arthritis is evidence of their importance             Monocytes and macrophages are believed to have a        similar role in other chronic inflammatory joint diseases        such as gout    and psoriatic arthropathy            Therefore in this study we assessed the effects of mactinin        on monocyte chemotaxis         in vitro  We have also tested        synovial fluid from patients with various types of        arthritis including rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic        arthritis reactive arthritis gout and ankylosing        spondylitis for the presence of the monocytemacrophage        maturationpromoting fragment mactinin We have also        investigated whether mactinin is present in the        antigeninduced arthritis model in rabbits             Macrophages are believed to be important in this model of        rheumatoid arthritis      and both the arthritic and        control joint fluid can be tested for mactinin                    Materials and methods                  Source of mactinin          As described previously     a pGEX vector          encoding the actinbinding domain residues  of          chicken smooth muscle actinin fused with the carboxy          terminus of glutathione Stransferase GST with an          engineered thrombin cleavage site was kindly provided by          Dr DR Critchley of the University of Leicester UK          Fusion protein was expressed in           Escherichia coli  and the cleavage          products of the fusion protein were purified by affinity          chromatography of cell extracts on immobilized          glutathione The fusion protein was then cleaved with          thrombin Calbiochem San Diego CA to yield the          actinbinding domain of actinin and the GST carrier          The cleavage products were then separated by          reversephase highperformance liquid chromatography on a          C column     SDSPAGE demonstrated that the          actinin fragment was more than  of the total protein          of pooled fractions with the remaining  being carrier          GST The calculated molecular mass of this actinin          fragment was  Da In this report both the active          product of urokinase degradation of actinin formed           in vivo    and the active          recombinant actinbinding domain which are of similar          molecular masses will be referred to as mactinin          Mactinin and GST routinely assay negative for protein          endotoxin with a Pyrotell chromogenic assay kit which          can detect more than  endotoxin unitsml Associates          of Cape Cod Woods Hole MA                          Isolation of peripheral blood monocytes          Mononuclear cells were isolated from buffy coat          preparations of healthy blood donors by density gradient          centrifugation with Histopaque  Sigma          Contaminating red cells were then lysed in distilled          water and the sample was applied to an LS separation          column with a magnetic monocyte isolation kit in          accordance with the manufacturers instructions Miltenyi          Biotec Auburn CA This negative selection method          resulted in a cell population containing more than           monocytes as determined by CD expression                          Chemotaxis assay          Cell migration was assessed by a well          microchemotaxis chamber NeuroProbe Gaithersburg MD          An aliquot of peptide was placed in the lower          compartment and a suspension of monocytes           was placed in the upper compartment of          the well The two compartments were separated by a          polyvinylpyrrolidonefree polycarbonate filter with a          pore size of  m The chamber was incubated at C for           minutes At the end of the incubation period the          filter was removed fixed and stained with a Hema           stain set Fisher Pittsburgh PA The cells that          migrated through the membrane pore in three highpower          fields  were counted by light microscopy Three          chamber membranes were counted for each          concentration                          Assessment of mactinin concentrations necessary for          HL cell maturation          HL myeloid leukemia cells were seeded at a density          of  ml and grown for  days in RPMI medium with           gml gentamicin and  fetal calf serum at C and           CO             in the presence of various          concentrations of recombinant mactinin We have          previously reported that mactinin promotes monocyte          maturation as measured by morphology nonspecific          esterase activity and Fc rosette formation in this          leukemia cell line     Here we report the          concentrations necessary to induce maturation as measured          by nonspecific esterase staining used as a maturation          marker                          Antisera generation          To generate antisera with sensitivity for detecting          mactinin purified recombinant chicken actinin peptide          was modified by coupling with dinitrophenol    and          injected into two New Zealand white rabbits along with          complete Freunds adjuvant as described previously              Boosts were done with peptide and incomplete Freunds          adjuvant These animal studies were approved by the          Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC of          the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center Antisera          were screened for their ability to detect the immunizing          peptide and were immunoaffinitypurified with columns of          the recombinant fragment covalently bound to a AffiGel           matrix BioRad Hercules CA We expected          crossreactivity of the purified antisera with fragments          from rats mice or humans because of the highly          conserved amino acid sequence                          Synovial fluid samples          Fluid from patients with arthritis undergoing          therapeutic arthrocentesis was collected and tested for          the presence of the fragment by Western blot analysis          The use of these fluid samples in this study was approved          by the subcommittee on human studies of the Minneapolis          VAMC In brief fresh samples were centrifuged at            g for  minutes and frozen at          C until the time of analysis Because mactinin is a          very small fraction of the total protein content more          than  g l of the fluid immunoaffinity          purification of mactinin was performed before Western          blotting Samples were thawed dialyzed against          phosphatebuffered saline and centrifuged again the          total sample volume was then applied to a column of          immunoaffinitypurified antibody covalently bound to a          AffiGel  matrix and eluted with  M sodium citrate          in  M NaCl pH  Fractions  ml were collected          and neutralized with  M TrisHCl Proteincontaining          fractions were pooled dialyzed against          phosphatebuffered saline concentrated and subjected to          electrophoresis on a  SDSPAGE gel under reducing          conditions Each lane contained  l representing          about  of the total sample                          Immunoblot analysis          The proteins separated by SDSPAGE were transferred          electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride          membranes BioRad The membrane was blocked with           nonfat milk in  M TrisHCl M NaCl pH  and          sequentially treated with affinitypurified rabbit          antisera raised against recombinant mactinin followed by          second antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase          ICN Costa Mesa CA Immunoreactive proteins were          detected by alkaline phosphatase reaction with          bromochloroindoyl phosphatenitroblue          tetrazolium Control analyses were performed with rabbit          IgG Santa Cruz Biochemistry Santa Cruz CA                          Dissociation of immune complexes in rheumatoid          arthritis fluid          To examine whether mactinin was present in immune          complexes in rheumatoid arthritis fluid some samples          were acidified by dialysis against  M sodium acetate          pH  to dissociate complexes     The acidified          samples were first fractionated on an  ml G          Sephadex Pharmacia Piscataway NJ sizeexclusion          column Fractions identified by Western blotting as          containing mactinin were pooled neutralized and further          purified by fractionation on a C column The C column          was equilibrated with  trifluoroacetic acid and          eluted with an acetonitrile gradient  run at          mlmin Aliquots of proteincontaining fractions were          used for Western blots                          Measurement of mactinin in the antigeninduced          arthritis model          To produce antigeninduced arthritis New Zealand          white rabbits were immunized by subdermal injection of          ovalbumin emulsified in complete Freunds adjuvant in          accordance with modifications    of the method of          Dumonde and Glynn    under IACUC approval Three          weeks later animals with positive skin tests to          ovalbumin received intraarticular injections of  mg of          sterile ovalbumin into one knee and an equal volume of          sterile saline in the contralateral control knee weekly          for  weeks Arthritic and control knee joints were then          lavaged with saline and aspirated at the time of killing          when animals had developed chronic synovitis  weeks          after the intraarticular injections were complete          Samples were frozen at C until the time of analysis          Samples were then concentrated and used for Western          blots                            Results                  Mactinin is a chemoattractant for peripheral blood          monocytes          For analysis of the effect of mactinin on monocyte          chemotaxis peripheral blood monocytes were placed in the          upper chambers of a well microchamber plate with          various concentrations of mactinin The lower compartment          of the wells also contained various concentrations of          mactinin and was separated from the upper chamber by a          polycarbonate filter As shown in Table   nM          mactinin had significant chemotactic activity for          monocytes Intact actinin at  nM had no activity          Because our mactinin preparations were contaminated with          up to  GST thus containing  nM GST in  nM          mactinin we tested  nM GST alone and also found no          activity The number of concentrations tested per assay          was limited by the  wells  combinations for          triplicate wells but in separate assays we have seen          significant chemotactic activity at mactinin          concentrations as low as  nM The concentration of          mactinin necessary for activity is similar to that of          FMLP  nM in our assay system and mactinin and          FMLP attract similar numbers of monocytes                          Measurement of mactinins maturationpromoting          activity          Recombinant mactinin has maturationpromoting activity                    in vitro in HL leukemia cells at          the concentrations shown in Figure  That is it induces          nonspecific esterase staining at  pM and activity          reaches a plateau at  pM  ngml GST controls were          run at a similar range of concentrations and showed no          significant activity                          Detection of mactinin in arthritis fluid          Affinitypurified rabbit antiserum raised against a          recombinant chicken actinin fragment detected picogram          amounts of the immunizing aminoterminal protein fragment          Fig  As also shown in Figure  this antiserum          reacted with a protein of the expected molecular mass in          representative samples of immunoaffinitypurified          synovial fluid from patients with psoriatic arthritis          reactive arthritis gout and ankylosing spondylitis In          all six of seven samples from patients with these          arthritides contained mactinin In contrast mactinin was          detected in none of five rheumatoid arthritis samples            P   Fishers exact test          When the detected levels of mactinin are corrected for          the recovery rate by the isolation procedure they are           ngml and are in the range of          maturationpromoting activity           in vitro   pM or  ngml and          the level needed for chemotactic activity  nM or           ngml The lack of mactinin in rheumatoid arthritis          fluid was surprising and we decided to pursue this          further          Owing to the autoimmune nature of rheumatoid          arthritis we examined whether mactinin was present in          immune complexes That is antibodybound mactinin might          not bind to the antibodymatrix column used in the          isolation protocol to decrease the total protein load          resulting in mactinin being undetectable but potentially          active To dissociate immune complexes an aliquot of a          rheumatoid arthritis fluid sample was acidified and the          proteins were fractionated on a C column As shown in          Figure  mactinin is detectable by Western blot analysis          after dissociation from immune complexes          To confirm the presence of mactinin in rheumatoid          arthritis fluids some frozen aliquots were thawed and          immediately subjected to electrophoresis on a           SDSPAGE gel under reducing conditions As shown in          Figure  affinitypurified mactinin antisera reacted          with several  kDa proteins including  kDa          mactinin in each of the samples tested We have          previously demonstrated that only the  kDa actinin          degradation product has maturationpromoting activity              These proteins were not seen in nonreduced samples          which did have immunoreactive material at the top of the          gel data not shown Hence the detected proteins might          represent mactinin bound to various immune complex          fragments                          Mactinin is present in inflammatory fluid from          antigeninduced arthritis          Arthritic and control knee joints of rabbits with          chronic antigeninduced arthritis were lavaged with          saline and aspirated at the time of killing Samples were          concentrated and used for Western blots run under          reducing conditions As seen in Figure  mactinin is          present in arthritis joint fluid but absent from control          fluid suggesting that mactinin formation is dependent on          the inflammatory response As also seen in Figure           another actinin fragment of slightly higher molecular          mass is present in both samples                            Discussion        During inflammatory processes various mediators such        as cytokines and chemokines regulate the recruitment of        monocytes Once in the tissue monocytes undergo the poorly        understood process of transformation to macrophages with        altered morphology and function     In arthritis        synovial macrophages might cause joint destruction by        differentiating to boneresorbing osteoclasts    or by        releasing cartilagedegrading enzymes and cytokines such        as interleukin and tumor necrosis factor     It has        therefore been suggested that therapies for chronic        arthritis should be aimed at depleting joint mononuclear        cells or controlling the activation of synovial macrophages            Indeed elimination of macrophages by        clodronateladen liposomes in rat models of adjuvant           and antigeninduced arthritis    induces amelioration        of the arthritis        Of the many mediators of inflammation mactinin is the        first example of a fragment of a cytoskeletal component        that might be released during leukocyte influx into        inflammatory tissue Further mactinin might have a role in        promoting the response of mononuclear phagocytes to        inflammation The monocyte functional studies         in vitro demonstrate that  nM        levels of the fragment have significant chemotactic        activity We have previously reported that mactinin        promotes monocyte maturation as measured by lysozyme        secretion and tartrateresistant acid phosphatase staining            Here we show that  pM levels of mactinin promote        monocytic maturation of the HL leukemia cell line        Mactinin is present at sites of various types of        arthritic inflammation at levels that are active         in vitro  including synovial fluid        samples from patients with psoriatic arthritis reactive        arthritis gout and ankylosing spondylitis Although it        was not initially detected in five immunoaffinitypurified        rheumatoid arthritis samples it was detected after the        acid dissociation of immune complexes Girard and Senecal           have reported that sera from patients with autoimmune        diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis contain antibodies        against microfilamentassociated proteins including        actinin In addition autoantibodies against actin        vinculin integrins or fibronectin could also form        complexes with mactinin      Our results suggest        that mactinin is bound to immune complexes in rheumatoid        arthritis joint fluid which prevents its binding to the        antibodymatrix during the isolation procedure The finding        that mactinin is detected by Western blotting of samples        run under reducing conditions without immunoaffinity        purification seems to confirm this It is noteworthy that        unless the antibody is neutralizing even antibodybound        mactinin might still be active        The antigeninduced arthritis model of rheumatoid        arthritis in rabbits demonstrates persistent active        inflammation for several months after the intraarticular        injection of antigen including hypertrophy and hyperplasia        of the synovial lining cells pannus formation with        articular cartilage erosion and chronic infiltration of        synovium by lymphocytes and plasma cells     In        addition Dijkstra and colleagues    found macrophages        in the superficial layer of the synovium where they might        secrete enzymes and oxygen radicals into the joint space        which can lead to cartilage erosion     The protein        levels in lavage fluid from arthritic joints in this model        are low enough to allow direct testing by Western blot        analysis without immunoaffinity purification as was needed        with the human aspirates Mactinin was found in the lavage        fluid from arthritic knee joints of rabbits with this        immune arthritis and might contribute to macrophage        function in this arthritis model        Because this study was done using waste fluid from        therapeutic synovial fluid aspirates we did not have        samples from noninflamed joints The low mactinin recovery        rate during the purification process and the low        concentration of mactinin needed for activity make it        necessary to assay at least  ml of fluid and this amount        is not available from any tissue and fluid bank However        mactinin was not present in the control joint fluid in the        rabbit antigeninduced arthritis model suggesting that        mactinin is specific for the inflammation process        Similarly we have reported that bronchoalveolar lavage        fluid from uninfected mice contains no mactinin in        contrast to fluid from mice infected with         P carinii            The plasminogen activators tissue type and urokinase        type have been reported to be both deleterious in        inflammation owing to the proteolysis of tissue proteins        and beneficial because of fibrinolytic activity            The presence of both increased urokinase and plasmin        inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis synovial tissue suggests        a complex role for urokinase in this disease             that seems pertinent to our finding of urokinasegenerated        mactinin in the arthritis fluid samples The overall effect        of urokinase in the antigeninduced arthritis model seems        to be beneficial because chronic joint inflammation and        bone erosion are significantly worse in urokinasedeficient        mice     However the ability of urokinasegenerated        mactinin to enhance proteolysis might be deleterious        Hence future testing of specific mactinin inhibitors in        animal models of arthritis seems warranted                    Conclusion        We conclude that mactinin is present in arthritic        synovial fluid in levels that can promote mononuclear        phagocyte chemotaxis and maturation There increased        numbers of mature monocytes might increase cartilage and        bone destruction These results lead us to speculate that        inhibitors of mactinin might be of benefit in the treatment        of some forms of chronic arthritis and form the basis for        our plans to test the efficacy of mactinin antisera to        ameliorate antigeninduced arthritis                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        GST  glutathione Stransferase IACUC  Institutional        Animal Care and Use Committee
