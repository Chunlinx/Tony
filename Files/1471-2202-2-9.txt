                    Background        It previously was believed that axonal growth within        white matter was not possible This belief was based on the        welldocumented failure of injured axons to regenerate        within the central nervous system CNS   and reinforced        by studies showing that neurons attach poorly to white        matter         in vitro                 These studies in part supported the hypothesis that CNS        myelin contains axongrowth inhibiting molecules        Additional investigations identified myelinassociated        molecules including Nogo formerly NI        myelinassociated glycoprotein MAG and chondroitin        sulfate proteoglycans that inhibit neurite growth                          Early studies in which transplanted embryonic neurons        extended parallel axons within white matter appeared to be        inconsistent with this hypothesis                   However successful growth was attributed        to the possibility that embryonic neurons may not express        receptors for myelinassociated inhibitors             Recent studies however demonstrated that white        matter can support extensive parallel axonal growth from        transplanted         adult neurons    Recent        tissue section culture experiments also demonstrated that        white matter can support parallel neurite growth          Given the growing evidence that white matter can support        axonal growth we sought to identify the properties that        mediate its parallel orientation Physical edges and        contours haptotactic cues can guide axonal growth        independently of biochemical composition   Physical        edges arranged in parallel within white matter such as        astroglial processes and axons could theoretically guide        parallel neurite growth Alternatively biochemical cues        may guide parallel growth Cryostat sections of rat brain        were manipulated to deactivate biochemical guidance cues        while preserving haptotactic cues and were then used as        substrata for cultured neurons These manipulations        included prior fixation or mounting on polyornithinecoated        culture dishes and in both cases nonparallel neurite        growth occurred on white matter suggesting that biochemical        cues are required for parallel growth        Additional experiments assessed the contribution of        myelin to the parallel orientation of neurites The        orientation of neurites on myelindeficient corpus callosum        was assessed Also neurons were cultured with cAMP analogs        or preincubated with nerve growth factor NGF treatments        known to attenuate the overall inhibitory effects of myelin           Neurites extending on myelindeficient corpus        callosum or from neurons that were preincubated with NGF or        treated with cAMP analogs were significantly less parallel        These results suggest that myelin contributes to the        parallel orientation of neurite growth on white matter and        that this effect may be mediated by its overall        neuriteinhibitory properties                    Results                  Neurite growth on the corpus callosum          As previously reported   neurites extending on          the corpus callosum near the midline and medial to the          cingulum were mostly limited to orientations that were in          parallel with the longitudinal axis of the fiber tract          Neurites also extended on more lateral portions of the          corpus callosum but these neurites extended in all          directions including perpendicular orientations          Neurites on lateral portions of the fiber tract could          also be commonly observed extending from white matter          onto gray matter whereas those medial to the cingulum          were generally confined to the fiber tract As it is          difficult to assess the orientation of the underlying          corpus callosum laterally analysis of neurite          orientiation relative to the underlying tract was          restricted to portions of the corpus callosum medial to          the cingulum          Neurons attached in varying densities under all          conditions but neurite orientation was not dramatically          affected by neuronal density Neurite orientation is          qualitatively best demonstrated by high density cultures          Consequently the photomicrographs presented in the          following results are generally of higher density          cultures However since it is difficult to follow a          single neurite from soma to growth cone in the case of          high neuronal densities the quantitative results          presented herein were derived from all assessible neurons          from cases where low rates of attachment occurred                          Haptotaxis appears insufficient to mediate the          parallel orientation of neurites          In order to deactivate biochemical guidance cues while          preserving haptotactic cues that may guide parallel          neurite growth brain sections were fixed prior to use as          substrata for cultured neurons After  hours in          culture many neurons had attached to the corpus callosum          of both fixed and unfixed tissue sections and extended          short neurites freely on these fiber tracts On the          corpus callosum in unfixed sections the neurites were          oriented mostly in parallel with the longitudinal axis of          the tract as has been previously shown   In          contrast on fixed sections neurite growth occurred in          all directions on the corpus callosum In fact neurite          growth often occurred in directions perpendicular to the          tract          After  days in culture neurites continued to extend          freely on both fixed and unfixed sections On the unfixed          corpus callosum scattered neurons continued to extend          neurites parallel to the tract forming dense plexi of          neurites attached firmly to the underlying substrate On          the fixed corpus callosum however many of the neurons          had migrated together forming small clusters that          extended neurites in all directions across the fiber          tract Many of these neurites grew in close association          appearing to use each other as a substrate While the          growth cones of these neurites remained firmly attached          to the underlying substrate the proximal segments often          detached from the substrate and straightened under the          tension applied by the outward migrating growth cone          After one week in culture dense parallel plexi of          firmlyattached neurites were found on the unfixed corpus          callosum Fig A Neurites extending on the fixed          corpus callosum Fig B formed a web of loosely          attached neurites radiating in all directions across the          fiber tract          Quantification of neurite orientation showed a          significant difference between those extending on fixed          and unfixed corpus callosum Since the results were          essentially the same regardless of the length of time          that the neurons were cultured Figure shows the mean          orientations for neurites assessed after culture          durations of  hours to  days To assure that these          values reflected neurites in contact with the underlying          tissue section rather than neurites growing on each          other only the orientations of neurites that extended in          isolation from other neurites were assessed In addition          to a significantly greater            p   mean angular          deviation from an orientation that is parallel to the          longitudinal axis of the tract the variance in the          deviation on fixed corpus callosum was significantly          greater than that on unfixed corpus callosum F                      p   This is consistent          with the interpretation that neurites are free to grow in          a wider range of orientations on fixed white matter          As documented previously   explants of          sympathetic ganglia attached to corpus callosum in          unfixed sections mounted on untreated culture dishes          exhibited neurite outgrowth halos that were oriented in          parallel with the underlying tract Fig E However          when sections were mounted on polyornithinecoated          culture dishes a manipulation also designed to mask          chemical cues but not haptotactic interactions between          growing neurites and the underlying substrate neurite          outgrowth was found to radiate in all orientations          without preference for the longitudinal axis of the fiber          tract Fig F                          Myelin may contribute to the parallel orientation          of neurites          The corpus callosum of myelindeficient            md  rats was difficult to          distinguish from gray matter when viewed using          phasecontrast optics data not shown and was clearly          less myelinated when labelled using Rip          immunohistochemistry Fig AB and Luxol Fast Blue          histochemistry data not shown          GFAPimmunohistochemistry showed hypertrophy of astroglia          within the           md fiber tracts compared with          wildtype            Wt  tracts as has been previously          reported   However the orientation of          GFAPimmunoreactivity was mostly in parallel with the          longitudinal axis of both           md and           Wt fiber tracts Fig CD          To determine whether the absence of myelin affects the          rate and orientation of neurite growth neurons were          cultured on sections of           md forebrain and           Wt forebrain matched for age P          and genetic background Wistar Neurite length and          orientation were assessed after  days in culture The          orientation of neurite growth on           Wt corpus callosum Fig E was          clearly more parallel compared with that on           md corpus callosum Fig F In          addition the density of neuronal attachment and neurite          growth appeared to be greater on           md corpus callosum and neurites          extending on gray matter were less inhibited at borders          with the           md corpus callosum Fig F          A quantitative comparison of neurites on           md and           Wt corpus callosum showed that they          did not differ in length Fig A           p   However a comparison of          the mean deviation from an orientation parallel to the          longitudinal axis of the fiber tract showed that neurites          on           md corpus callosum were          significantly less parallel compared with those on           Wt corpus callosum Fig B           p   Moreover the          variance in the orientation on           md corpus callosum was          significantly greater than that on           Wt corpus callosum F                      p   consistent with the          interpretation that neurites are free to grow in a wider          range of orientations on the           md fiber tract Interestingly          neurite growth on P           Wt corpus callosum appeared less          constrained to a parallel orientation than that normally          seen on white matter in sections of adult           Wt brain compare Figure B           Wt with Figure Band          ABcontrols                          Myelinassociated inhibitors may contribute to          parallel neurite growth          Preincubation of neurons with high concentrations of          neurotrophins for  to  hours blocks the neuritegrowth          inhibitory effects of myelin   Therefore neurons          were preincubated with nerve growth factor NGF           ngml for  hours prior to plating on sections of adult          forebrain Neurite length and orientation were assessed          after  days of culture          No difference in neurite length was detectable between          neurons that had been preincubated with NGF and control          neurons that had been preincubated for the same length of          time in culture medium without NGF Fig A           p   However the mean          deviation of neurites from an orientation parallel to the          longitudinal axis of the corpus callosum from neurons          that had been preincubated with NGF was significantly          greater than that of control neurons Fig B           p   Moreover the          variance in neurite orientation from neurons that had          been preincubated with NGF was significantly greater than          that of control neurons F              p   The NGF was          biologically active as it substantially increased neurite          growth from sympathetic explants cultured on          polyornithinecoated dishes data not shown          Treatment with cAMP analogs has also been shown to          block the inhibitory effects of myelin on neurite growth             Therefore neurons were cultured on sections          of adult forebrain in the presence of dibutyrylcAMP          dbcAMP  mM and the effects on neurite growth were          assessed after  to  days in culture Interestingly the          length of neurites was significantly decreased by dbcAMP          data not shown Assessment of neurite orientation          showed a significant increase in deviation from a          parallel orientation on the corpus callosum compared with          mediumtreated control cultures Fig A           p   An increased variance          in neurite orientation in dbcAMP treated cultures also          occurred F              p                              Discussion                  The contributions of biochemical and haptotactic          cues to parallel neurite growth          Several biochemical factors influence axonal growth by          either attraction or repulsion and may guide axonal          growth by hemming in the growth cone to a channel          containing permissive molecules surrounded by repulsive          molecules    For example this mechanism may          explain somitemediated segmentation of developing motor          axons             Mechanical haptotactic cues can also guide neurites          Early theories proposed that neurites extend in the          direction of least resistance reviewed by Ramn y Cajal            Harrison proposed that haptotaxis guides neurites          along fibrin threads in tissue culture   He also          noted that developing peripheral nerves grow through the          notches between the muscle plates the nerves follow          definite paths which are preformedby the          configuration of other organs Groovesbetween the more          solid embryonic organs seem to be paths of predilection            Grooves etched into plastic or glass also guide          neurites             Tissue sections supported neuronal attachment and          neurite growth on gray and white matter despite prior          fixation However neurites did not extend in parallel on          fixed corpus callosum By crosslinking proteins          fixation should interfere with biochemical          contactguidance cues without altering the edges and          contours that could act as haptotactic cues In fact the          histology of the sections was preserved after fixation          compare Figures Cand D when viewed with          phasecontrast optics which depends on refraction and          diffraction indicating that the edges and contours were          not altered Nevertheless the resolution afforded by          light microscopy is insufficient to rule out the          possibility that fixation altered surface contours          thereby contributing to the loss of parallel          orientation          The polyornithine experiments provide additional          evidence that haptotaxis is insufficient to guide          parallel growth Whether polyornithine acted through the          tissue section andor reentered solution secondarily          depositing onto the sections is not clear Either way          it is unlikely that polyornithine altered the topology of          the sections to mask haptotactic cues in the same manner          that would have occurred through fixation Therefore          taken together the effects of fixation and polyornithine          suggest that haptotactic cues are insufficient to guide          parallel neurite growth          It is likely that several biochemical guidance cues          exist in white matter including not only repulsive          molecules eg Nogo or MAG but also growthpermissive          molecules eg laminin It is possible that only a          subset of them are blocked by either fixation or          polyornithine and it is not possible to determine which          of these factors have been blocked in our experiments          especially since many of these factors may not be known          Therefore if parallel neurite growth had been observed          on fixed corpus callosum or on corpus callosum in          sections mounted on polyornithine it would not have been          possible to interpret the data with regard to the          relative contributions of biochemical guidance cues and          haptotaxis However since the parallel growth constraint          was eliminated under these conditions it is clear that          the relevant biochemical cues were blocked To the extent          that these biochemical cues but not haptotactic cues          were blocked by fixation or mounting on polyornithine          these data suggest that haptotaxis is insufficient to          account for the parallel orientation The fact that the          neurite outgrowth was more fasciculated points to the          possibility that growthpromoting andor adhesive factors          were also affected by the treatments Therefore the loss          of parallel growth could be attributed to the loss of          either positive or negative cues or both that normally          serve to align neurite outgrowth                          The contribution of myelin to parallel neurite          growth          White matter is replete with paralleloriented cells          that could provide biochemical orienting cues for growing          axons eg nonreactive astrocytes             Alternatively given their tendency to fasciculate axons          could provide a permissive parallel substrate          However for white matter to have an orienting          influence there must also be a relatively nonpermissive          substrate that restricts growing axons to a parallel          course Myelinassociated inhibitors are obvious          candidates for this role To test the contribution of          myelin neurons were cultured on sections of          myelindeficient            md  brain Neurites on           md corpus callosum were          significantly less parallel than those on wildtype            Wt  corpus callosum Since          deviation from parallelism is restricted to the range of          values from  to  where  indicates strict          parallelism and  indicates perpendicularity          randomlyoriented neurites would have a mean deviation          approaching  In fact the mean deviation from          parallelism on           md corpus callosum was  These          data suggest that myelin contributes to the parallel          orientation of axons on white matter Interestingly          neurites on P           Wt corpus callosum were less          parallel than those on adult           Wt corpus callosum possibly          because of incomplete myelination at P          Neurite lengths on           md and           Wt corpus callosum did not differ          The absence of myelinassociated neuritegrowth          inhibitors might have been expected to increase neurite          growth on           md corpus callosum However          myelinmediated inhibition has mostly been studied under          conditions in which the organization of myelin was          disrupted                     There is little evidence that myelinassociated          inhibitors reduce neurite growth when maintained in their          normal geometric organization In fact neurites          extending in parallel on corpus callosum           in vitro are comparable in length          to those on gray matter            It is possible that demyelination affects other          properties that affect neurite orientation For example          hypertrophy of astrocytes and axonal swellings have been          reported in the white matter of these animals   In          fact the axons and astrocytes appear to remain oriented          mostly in parallel Thus the possibility that          alterations in astrocytic morphology or other changes in          the tissue contribute to the reduced parallel outgrowth          cannot be ruled out However when these data are taken          in combination with the reduced parallel neurite growth          from neurons preincubated with NGF or treated with cAMP          analogs conditions known to interfere with the overall          inhibitory effects of myelin on neurite growth see          discussion below there appears to be a preponderance of          data suggesting that the loss of myelin is directly          responsible for the reduced parallel orientation of          neurite growth                          The contribution of myelinassociated inhibitors to          parallel neurite growth          To test whether myelinassociated neuriteinhibitors          are involved conditions known to block myelinassociated          inhibitory activity were used Since the parallel growth          constraint may be due to the combined action of multiple          inhibitors treatments that are known to attenuate the          overall inhibitory properties of myelin were selected          Priming neurons with NGF or treatment with dbcAMP          reduced the parallel constraint on growth Together          these data suggest that myelinassociated neuritegrowth          inhibitory activity may contribute to the parallel          constraint on growth in white matter but do not          necessarily implicate specific inhibitors since priming          with neurotrophins and treatment with cAMP analogs          inactivate the inhibitory activity of myelin as a whole             Whether the test neurons used in this study are          responding to specific factors that have been previously          identified such as MAG and NoGo is unknown It is          possible that other myelinassociated inhibitors exist          and contribute to parallel neurite orientation                            Do myelinassociated inhibitors influence the          orientation of neurite growth in vivo          MAG is reportedly expressed only at the interface          between axons and their myelin sheaths   If so MAG          is not accessible to axons extending within myelinated          tracts without disruption of the myelin sheaths Nogo in          contrast is expressed on the outer surface of myelin          sheaths   and is therefore accessible to axons          extending within uninjured fiber tracts In fact          infusion of the Nogoinactivating IN Fab fragment into          the vermis of the rat cerebellum induced sprouting of          uninjured Purkinje cell axons suggesting that Nogo          normally constrains the growth and orientation of axons            A role of Nogo in restricting the orientation of          neurite growth is further supported by studies showing          that INsensitive inhibitors expressed in the          alreadymyelinated sensory tracts of the rat spinal cord          appeared to restrict the position of developing          corticospinal axons            A limitation of tissue section culture is that it          accounts for only two of the three dimensions normally          present           in vivo  However the intent of          this study was to examine the role of the parallel array          of tissue elements in regulating axonal growth and the          twodimensional sections can be viewed as a sampling of          this threedimensional parallel geometry It also cannot          be ruled out that by sectioning the fiber tract as is          done in tissue section culture that intracellular          molecules may be exposed artifactually The striking          similarity to the parallel axonal growth within white          matter observed from transplanted neurons           in vivo                    however makes it unlikely that the pattern          of neurite growth in tissue section culture is entirely          due to artifactual unmasking of normally sequestered          molecules or to a limitation in the available degrees of          freedom The correspondence between the orientation of          neurite growth in this assay and that observed           in vivo indicates that tissue          section culture models the relevant tissue properties and          geometry                            Conclusions        These data suggest that the orienting influence of white        matter geometry on neurite outgrowth involves myelin and        possibly its associated neuritegrowth inhibitory        activity The term inhibitor refers to the effects of        myelin on neurites in studies that did not consider its        normal geometric organization within white matter In fact        close to the site of injury where its geometry is        disrupted myelin may indeed be an obstacle to regeneration        see Pettigrew et al companion paper        httpwwwbiomedcentralcom It is now        clear however that the presence alone of undisrupted        myelin is insufficient to prevent regeneration           While the direct effect of myelin on growing axons         in vitro is inhibitory but does        little to block axonal growth within intact tracts         in vivo  myelin may nevertheless        play an important role in regulating axonal growth within        intact tracts Myelin may encourage directed longdistance        growth by restricting it to a parallel orientation For        example in the spinal cord where successful regeneration        ultimately depends on axon extension in an appropriate        direction over long distances factors that promote        parallel axonal growth and discourage nonparallel growth        should enhance longdistance regeneration In fact several        studies have been succesful in promoting axonal        regeneration across sites of spinal cord or optic nerve        injury by blocking the myelinassociated inhibitor Nogo            However these axons often fail to reattain a        parallel orientation within the distal stump These axons        followed an irregular course and branching was seen        quite frequently The inhibitory activity of myelin may        actually serve to promote axonal growth in an intact fiber        tract such as the distal stump of the injured spinal cord        by restricting this growth to an orientation that is        parallel to the fiber tract while discouraging local        meandering and collateral sprouting                    Materials and Methods                  Preparation of substrata          Adult SpragueDawley rats maintained in the          University of

Laboratories North Chicago          IL and decapitated The brains were rapidly removed and          frozen at C In other cases myelindeficient            md  and wildtype            Wt  control brains Wistar          supplied by Dr Judith Grinspan Dept of Research          Neurology Childrens Hospital Philadelphia PA were          used age   days Brains were cut using a cryostat          and four

sections were postfixed with           formalin for  to  minutes at C and rinsed three          times with Hams F medium Sigma Control sections          were treated for the same length of time at the same          temperature with Hams F medium rather than          formalin                          Tissue culture          Lumbar sympathetic chain ganglia were dissected from          embryonic day  Leghorn chicken embryos Spafas Inc          Boston MA in Hams F medium In some cases the          sympathetic chain ganglia were further dissected into          explants area   to  m  using a          BardParker scalpel fitted with a No  blade These          explants were seeded either onto  polyDLornithine          coated  mm diameter plastic culture dishes or onto the          prepared tissue sections In other cases the sympathetic          chain ganglia were incubated with  trypsin Sigma          for  minutes at C Trypsinization was subsequently          blocked by exposure to  heatinactivated fetal bovine          serum FBS Harlan Bioproducts for Science Inc          Indianapolis IN for  minutes and the tissue was washed           times with serumfree Hams F medium The tissue was          then dissociated by gentle trituration using flamed          Pasteur pipets Fisher Catalog No A and the          cell suspension was seeded onto the prepared tissue          sections All cultures were grown in serumfree          Neurobasal medium  ml per dish supplemented with B          Gibco BRL Grand Island NY  vv  mM          Lglutamine Sigma and  unitsml          penicillinstreptomycin Gibco Catalog No           Cultures were grown for  hours to  days in a          humidified environment at C and  CO                                      Treatments          Some suspensions of neurons were preincubated at C          with  ngml nerve growth factor NGF Harlan product          code BT for  hours prior to plating Control          suspensions were preincubated in Neurobasal medium for           hours at C Bioactivity of the NGF was confirmed by          culturing explants of sympathetic chain ganglia on          polyornithinecoated dishes with or without  ngml NGF          and assessing the extent of neurite outgrowth after           days Some cultures were established with  mM          dibutyrylcAMP dbcAMP Calbiochem San Diego CA

growth and substrate          anatomy          After  hours to  days in culture all media were          removed and replaced with Hams F medium Each dish was          treated with  ngml of carboxyfluorescein diacetate          acetoxymethyl ester vital dye Molecular Probes Eugene          OR for  to  minutes at C Subsequently all media          were removed and replaced with fresh Hams F medium          The cultures were then visualized using a Nikon Diaphot          fluorescent microscope with a fluorescein filter and a x          or x objective Substrate histology was visualized          using phasecontrast optics or by immunohistochemically          labelling glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP In the          latter case the cultures were incubated with a          Cyconjugated monoclonal antibody raised against porcine          GFAP  Sigma Product No C simultaneously          with labelling of the neurons with vital dye          GFAPimmunoreactivity was visualized using the same          microscope with a rhodamine filter Photomicrographs were          captured with a Nikon  mm camera In other cases          digital images were captured to a Power Macintosh          microcomputer with a Data Translation framegrabber card          and electronically enhanced to increase contrast                          Quantification of neurite length and          orientation          The orientation and spatial extent of the corpus          callosum in sections used as substrata were first          assessed using phasecontrast or GFAP immunoreactivity          The orientation of the tract was measured by drawing a          line parallel to its edges and measuring the angle of          this line using NIH Image  software The spatial          extent of the tract was marked by tracing around the          perimeter of the visible tract using the polygon tool          Three subregions of the corpus callosum were analyzed          separately the horizontal segment at the midline and          the two segments oriented at roughly  angles from          points just lateral to the horizontal midline segment to          the dorsal callosal apex immediately ventral to the          widest portion of the cingulum More lateral portions of          the corpus callosum were avoided because of the          difficulty in assessing the orientation of their          composing fibers Both the orientation of the tract and          its spatial extent were recorded by an NIH Image macro          program custommade for this analysis          This image was then closed and replaced by an image of          the same field showing the neurons and their neurites but          not the anatomy of the section Neurite length and          orientation were then assessed A neuron was included for          analysis only if its neurite did not form fascicles with          other neurites and if it was possible to visually follow          the entire length of the neurite Neurites located on the          curved flexures between the previously described           segments of the corpus callosum were avoided since it is          difficult to assign a fixed orientation to the underlying          corpus callosum Neurite length was assessed by tracing          the neurite using the straightline tool in NIH Image          The net length ie the straightline distance between          the cell body and growth cone was measured in pixels and          then converted to micrometers using a known physical          standard From vector arithmetic we know that this          distance is the weighted by segment length average of          the orientations of each of the segments along the total          length of the neurite The macro program automatically          determined whether the neuronal cell body was located          within the polygondelimited spatial extent of the fiber          tract and excluded the neuron from the analysis if it was          not Neurite orientation was defined as the angle of the          line traced over the neurite The final measure of          orientation for each neurite the deviation from an          orientation parallel to the longitudinal axis of the          tract is the acute angle between the neurite and the          longitudinal axis of the tract without regard to the          polarity of either This value ranged from  to           where  indicates a neurite growing in parallel with the          longitudinal axis of the underlying tract and           indicates a neurite oriented perpendicular to the tract          Analysis of neurite length and orientation were made by          an observer without knowledge of which experimental group          was being assessed All statistical comparisons of          neurite length were made using twotailed unpaired          Students ttests Statistical comparisons of neurite          orientation were made using onetailed unpaired          Students ttests                          Myelin histochemistry          Sections adjacent to those used as substrata for          culture were stained using the Rip immunohistochemical          technique for labelling oligodendrocytes and their          myelinating processes   Sixteen micron thick          sections were mounted on gelatincoated slides and were          postfixed in  paraformaldehyde for  minutes at room          temperature The sections were then rinsed with  M          phosphatebuffered saline PBS  times  minutes each          and blocked with  FBS   Bovine Serum Albumin          Sigma   Triton X Sigma in  M PBS The          sections were rinsed again and incubated overnight at C          with the Rip primary antibody Developmental Studies          Hybridoma Bank Iowa City IA diluted  in  M PBS          The following day the sections were rinsed again and          incubated for  minutes at room temperature with          FITCconjugated sheep antimouse IgG          BoehringerMannheim diluted  The sections were          again rinsed and coverslipped using  glycerol as a          mounting solution and then visualized using a Nikon          Microphot microscope with a fluorescein filter and a x          x or x objective Photomicrographs were captured with          a Nikon  mm camera          Other adjacent sections were stained using the Luxol          Fast Blue technique   Sixteen micron thick sections          were mounted on gelatincoated slides and were postfixed          in  paraformaldehyde for  minutes at room          temperature The sections were then dehydrated by          immersion in  ethanol  immersions  minutes each          and then transferred to  ethanol for  minutes The          sections were then stained with Luxol Fast Blue in           ethanol for  minutes at room temperature rinsed twice          with  ethanol and cleared overnight in a third           ethanol rinse Subsequently the sections were rinsed           times in xylene and coverslipped using Permount Fisher          as a mounting solution
