                                 Suffer the Democrats            So were going to have acontest after all Not for presidentno pundit honestly thinks a surprise islikely there The horse race thats been declared is for control of CongressNearly all the prognosticators failed to predict the Republican triumph in Now they are saying Bill Clintons coattails might just be long enoughfor the Democrats to ride back into power The Democratic National Committee israising millions per week on the promise to liberate the nation from the reignof Gingrich Republicans more creatively are trying to frighten smallchildren with the supposedly terrifying specter of Speaker Gephardt            Well itcould happen But theres good reason to hope it doesnt whether you are aDemocrat a progressive or even president of the United States The reasons tobe alarmed about the return of the Democrats arent those put forward by BobDole and Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour who have been warning of areturn to the liberal Dark Ages circa George McGovern A RestorationDemocratic Congress almost certainly would not try to pass comprehensivehealthcare reform cut the defense budget in half or raise taxes As Barbourmight say even a dog learns not to stick its nose in the campfire a secondtime            The real reason to worry about Democrats retaking Congressis that after two years out of power they have begun to reconsider theirapproach to governmentbut theyve only just begun The danger is that insteadof returning to power as spirited reform liberals the Democrats would governas a devious dispirited version of their old selves And paradoxically theywill have a more productive two years if they dont win than if they doAssuming that President Clinton is reelected a divided government would beable to accomplish more of what Democrats want than if they controlled bothelected branches            Thepolitical model for a Restoration Democratic Congress wouldnt be Ted Kennedythe corpulent Massachusetts senator It would be Henry Waxman the tinycongressman from Los Angeles The Kennedy model was New Deal liberalism Raisemoney through taxation to pay for ambitious federal programs The Waxman modeldeployed when he chaired the health subcommittee of Energy and Commerce isadministrative liberalism Try to accomplish the same social goals covertlythrough regulation and mandates In the s while Kennedy was still arguingfor nationalized health care paid for by a payroll tax Waxman was trying tocreate universal coverage through the back door by expanding Medicaideligibility and requiring states to provide ever more extensive benefits Themandates Waxman buried in various appropriation bills produced a malfunctioningsystem that was resented by governors of both parties as its costs escalatedand the number of uninsured Americans continued to rise Kennedys was alegitimate alternative democratically rejected Waxmans approach which hasfinally become Kennedys as well was to quietly foist more government on anuncomprehending electorate            Blocked by the present political mood fromacting in a direct sensible way to create government programs where they areneeded Democrats would be tempted to operate Waxmanstyle in an inefficientsubterranean way Take welfare reform The bill Clinton signed this summer isdeficient principally because it would cut poor people off even if theycouldnt find jobs It could however be made into a reasonable scheme byadding a publicsector jobs program that would offer employment in the lastresort for those who are willing to work but are frankly unemployable in theprivate sector Butafraid of spending for the underclassa DemocraticCongress might find it easier to tinker with regulations to prevent states fromcutting welfare recipients off at the end of their supposed time limits Thiswould undermine reform rather than fixing it With a nominally RepublicanCongress though President Clinton might be able to drum up bipartisan supportto pass a humane modification in the form of a jobs program            Whyshould that be We saw how it worked during Clintons first term In his firsttwo years when Clinton had a Democratic congressional majority Republicanswere truculent and obstructionist It soon dawned on them that anyaccomplishments benefited the party in power As GOP strategist William Kristolargued in his famous healthcare memo Republicans were politically better offblocking everything than compromising But in the last two years with aRepublican Congress the incentives have been reversed Newt Gingrich triedruling by nonnegotiable demand and ended up with Republican congressionalcandidates denying any knowledge of his existence He and his party learned thehard way that they were better off cooperating with Democrats on things thecountry wants and trying to share the credithence the recent flurry oflegislation passed with bipartisan support welfare reform healthcareportability and the minimumwage increase In fact a Democratic Congresswould probably mean less opportunity for Clinton to pass legislation of anykind            If Republicans retain a majority both parties will bedenied their grander schemes But President Clinton might win a few moreincrements of healthcare reform improvements in the welfare bill the kind oftax cut he wants and maybe even some sort of entitlement reform The balancedbudget will continue to get closer If Democrats recover a majorityRepublicans will have every incentive to block everything once again And witha superslim majority instead of a seat one Democrats will be even weakerThere wont be any onevote budget victories Conservatives would jeer from thesidelines demanding big tax cuts and no longer spelling outas they admirablydid last yearhow such cuts would be paid for Cheap Republican partisanshipwould bring out the worst in the Democrats encouraging more symbolictherapeutic legislation see my colleague Jack ShafersFlame Posies column and demagoguery intended to keep old people in aRepublicanhating frenzy            It is saidthat suffering is good for the soul and so it has been for the Democrats WhenI went to see Dick Gephardt a few weeks ago he was saying all the right thingsabout how his party had been lazy and undisciplined throwing programs atproblems without worrying about results He was touting his Families Firstagenda a kind of Democratic Contract With America which he developed with theSenate Minority Leader Tom Daschle It includes sensible smallscale proposalssuch as requiring healthinsurance companies to offer kidsonly policies Theseare modest steps but not falsely modest ones like some of President Clintonsrecent Dick Morrisinspired microideas eg school uniforms Those arentincremental governmenttheyre infinitesimal government            But Gephardts admirable evolution may beinterrupted if he runs for president in  The prospect of a party primarywill drag him back to the left And Gephardt has yet to bring around most ofthe old Democratic barons the Obeys the Boniors the Dingells These guysstill arent into small stuff Theyve made clear that the balanced budget willbe the first thing out the window if they get their old chairs back The nextthing to go would be the rules restraining the power of committee chairsperhaps the only truly good deed of the Gingrich Congress For the old bulls aNovember victory would prove that  was a meaningless blip that there wasnothing wrong with the Democrats after all            They may have suffered butthey havent suffered enough
