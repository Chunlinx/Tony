people a few times a yearI have real problems remembering names Have you heard this one before Ivetried several ways to compensate The one that works best for me is to reviewthe list of names I should know and visualize their faces But I stillfail                                       So myquestion to you is What is the best way to handle the introduction of somebodywhose name you should know but dont when they join a small conversationalgroup youre with                                       Sign meBill From LaJolla                        DearBill            Far worse than picking upthe wrong fork is stumbling around with an introduction But take heart youhave a lot of company falling into this particular social pothole            Prudie does notrecommend an association technique For example years ago a certain womansname would not stay in Prudies memory The woman wore crazy hatsoftensporting fruitso Carmen Miranda seemed a useful aid  until Prudieaddressed the woman as Mrs Miranda            You are luckier than most inthat your elevated position gives you something of a pass Many individualswill assume that you meet so many people that name recollection would be toughat best Actor Robert Wagner RJ to people who could remember hisname got around this by calling everyone Pallie This stunt only workshowever in direct address and is no help with introductions            Prudie is willing to blowher cover and offer you her trick When stuck just say Tell me yourwhole name implying alas fraudulently that she remembers one name but notboth            Happilymost people pick up on someones difficulty and introduce themselves Whennothing happens to relieve the situation you can say forthrightly Im sosorry your name has gone right out of my head            Prudie forgetfully                                             DearPrudie                                                      I havelong wanted to ask your advice concerning a problem that is certainly not newto me I have been in a committed relationship with a man for four years Wehave everything going for us and I feel its time to marry It seems to be thenext logical step Weve been talking about this for over a year so this isnot a new subject Last week we had a huge fight about our relationship andgetting married It ended with him storming out and me crying My question isIf a man keeps saying hes not ready to marry is this his way of saying Illnever marry you In other words should I just move on                                       ImpatientlyWaiting                        DearImp            Oh dear the beloved ishaving trouble with his feet Theyre cold Its the old commitment problemwhich seems to afflict more men than women The goingson you describe soundlike a cross between psychodrama and dating never good for the nerves Youhave these options as Prudie sees it You can stick it to him and force adecision you can coast along and see if he starts to feel more ready or youcan make a deadlinespoken or unspokenat which time you will either call acaterer or tell him its been lovely            What some women have donethough Prudie doesnt recommend it is to make the beloved jealous with othermen This is sometimes effective in extracting a proposal but it is also alittle like lassoing a calf and who wants a groom one is dragging to thealtar The dilemma on whose horns you ride is that sometimes not ready meansjust that and at other times it really does mean not you The hell of it isthat often the real meaning is unknown to the gentleman himself As one of theFrench philosophes put it Men and women deserve something better thaneach other            If thingswork out do let Prudie know so that she can wish you mazel ton  tonsof luck            Prudie hopefully                                             DearPrudie                                                      So one of Prudieshotbuttons is the governments failure to provide clean needles to addictsMay I suggest you take your finger off the button calm down and review thehistory of Vancouvers  year experiment doing just such a thing                                       Theresults are not encouraging The number of addicts has risen and thepercentage infected with AIDS has gone from around  percent to  percent ifmemory serves Compassionate sounding ideas do not always pan out its good tolook at the evidence and be willing to change your mind if necessary                                       Concerned butSkeptical                        DearCon            Your giving Prudie theneedle pardon the expression is understandable As with all studies thereare opposite findings to be offered Alas it is the nature of the statisticalbeast            Your figures for theVancouver study are correct but there is no way to know if the numberof users would have gone up without a needle exchange Some experts have alsoquarreled with the design of the Vancouver program The complaints have to dowith the low limits on exchanges per addict and poor timing That is thecrack epidemic had just taken hold and according to the Toronto Sun injected cocaine and crack use often require  to  needles a session Withimpaired judgment a guaranteed result with injected drugs one would not knowhow many or whose needles one was using            Prudiethinks it best we agree to disagree and err on the side of humaneconsiderations            Prudie agreeably
