                    Background        Genomewide expression data such as that obtained with        microarrays presents a significant challenge for analysis        A frequent goal of expression analysis is to identify genes        whose expression is altered by an experimental condition        In general automated methods are needed to accomplish this        task owing to the large amount of data involved A good        example of an expression dataset requiring detailed        complex analysis comes from the work of Sandberg         et al   In their study the        expression of  genes and expressed sequence tags        ESTs was assayed using oligonucleotide arrays   for        each of six brain regions in two different inbred strains        of mice with each condition measured twice This data is a        potentially rich source of targets for investigting        behavioral and neurophysiological differences between the        mouse strains CB and SvEv as well as structural        and functional differences among brain regions        Both regional and strain variations in gene expression        are relevant to questions in neuroscience Inbred mouse        strains are used in many studies relating to human        neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders such as stroke        and alcoholism however it has long been recognized that        different strains vary significantly in the results        obtained in such studies   Expression analysis is one        approach to exploring the underlying molecular causes of        these differences Similarly expression analysis can        provide insight into one potential source of functional        differences between brain regions Traditional expression        analysis for example northern blots and         in situ hybridization can be used to        uncover such expression patterns one gene at a time but        the highthroughput nature of array technology allows        researchers to take a much wider view        Given the data of Sandberg         et al and the questions one can        address with it the issue becomes how to proceed with the        analysis Many researchers use an         ad hoc approach for example the        fold change for each gene is considered where fold        change is defined as the ratio of gene expression in a test        condition to that in a control condition Changes in        expression above a certain foldchange threshold are deemed        to be significant The problem with such methods is that        they typically do not take into account the variability of        the measurements being considered When using the        Microarray Analysis Suite Affymetrix one also has the        option of using the absentpresent calls determined by        the software to make discriminations as to whether a gene        is expressed in one set of samples and not others The        trouble with this method is that the absentpresent        threshold is essentially arbitrary and there is no easy        way to estimate the numbers of false positives and false        negatives obtained Typically in such studies genes are        identified as changed or not changed often without a        quantitative estimate of the statistical confidence in that        conclusion        Because of the shortcomings of         ad hoc methods some researchers have        tackled the problem of how to apply more robust statistical        methods to the problem of identifying changed genes in a        dataset     Most such methods deal with the case of        a twoway comparison for example between a wildtype        organism and one that is mutant in a gene of interest But        many experimenters are studying complex systems and        generate large datasets with more than one experimental        variable Such is the case for Sandberg         et al   where both strain and        brain region were varied in the same experiment Here we        investigate methods appropriate for analyzing this type of        dataset and determine how the methods affect the        interpretation of the data of Sandberg         et al         There are several desirable properties of a method for        analysis of microarray data First it should provide an        estimate of the confidence that the geneexpression pattern        observed would occur by chance that is a         p value Failing the ability to        generate accurate         p values the method should at least        automatically rank the genes in order of interest Second        the method should be flexible enough to allow for complex        experimental designs Methods that permit us to compare        only two conditions are insufficient Finally an ideal        method is computationally simple and fast Mathematical        simplicity and familiarity are also advantages when the        methods must be used and interpreted by biologists with        little statistical background        A standard technique for analyzing such multivariate        datasets which fulfills the above criteria is analysis of        variance ANOVA   For the data of Sandberg         et al the appropriate method is a        twoway ANOVA because two variables  strain and region         were involved ANOVA is a well understood and powerful        method but has two drawbacks that can make its application        difficult in practice First when more than two categories        are present for a variable as in the case of the work of        Sandberg         et al where six brain regions were        studied additional work must be done to determine which        categories underlie the effects observed Another drawback        of ANOVA is that in its standard form the number of        replicates of each condition should be equal Adjustments        can be made when small differences in the number of        replicates occur but large deviations are difficult to        correct for        We note that some workers have previously applied        oneway ANOVA to expression data   and that the use of         t tests which is oneway ANOVA for        the limiting case of two replicated conditions is becoming        a more common method for analyzing expression data          Kerr         et al   applied ANOVA to        twocolor cDNA arrays in an experiment involving a single        biological variable tissue type Their model encompassed        all the genes on the array as well as experimental factors        such as dye and array effects Their complex model differs        from the genespecific application for experiments with        more than one biological variable that we discuss here        An alternative way of approaching the analysis problem        is to view it as one of feature selection In machine        learning feature selection seeks to identify the data        points here expression profiles that are most        informative when trying to learn a classification problem        In the context of the data of Sandberg         et al we are seeking genes that        differentiate between the genotypes andor brain regions in        our samples While learning to predict this classification        is not relevant here the underlying task is effectively        one of feature selection The features in this situation        are the individual samples arrays A recent application        of feature selection to microarray data was described by        Golub         et al   They sought to identify        genes that best differentiated between two types of tumor        Because feature selection methods can be quite simple can        be used to differentiate between any number of categories        and permit ranking genes in accordance with how well they        differentiate between regions or strains feature selection        fulfills all three criteria for a suitable analysis method        A similar method was used by Chu         et al   to perform clustering        they created a set of idealized expression patterns based        on the data from handselected genes and identified        additional genes that were similar to the desired        patterns        Sandberg         et al used criteria based on        absentpresent calls and foldchange thresholds for their        analysis and applied multiple         t tests to each gene to detect        additional regional variations in expression    With        these methods they identified  genes showing strain        variation and about  genes showing some type of        regional variation An examination of the data and        experimental design suggests that methods such as ANOVA and        feature selection could be profitably applied Here we        describe the identification of additional genes showing        possible strain and regiondependent patterns of        expression from the data of Sandberg         et al We find that ANOVA and feature        selection are complementary and can be combined to form a        powerful method for detecting interesting genes in a        complex dataset                    Results                  Strainspecific expression          At a           p value cutoff of   we found          about  probe sets that show strainspecific variation          in expression across all areas compared to  genes          showing overall differences between strains identified by          Sandberg           et al   The genes near the top          of our ranking include many of those chosen by Sandberg            and all  genes identified by Sandberg           et al have           p values less than  by either          ANOVA template match or both Two examples of          strainspecific genes not identified in the previous work          are shown in more detail Figure a The first is          Sparcosteonectin testican which was detected at lower          levels in the CB strain The second is phosphatase          ACPACP with the opposite expression pattern We rank          ACPACP and Sparcosteonectin as having the th and          rd strongest strain differences respectively both          ACPACP and Sparcosteonectin are also shown in Figure           For comparison Figure bshows globin which was          identified in   and was ranked th by template match          Overall we rank  previously unrecognized genes as          having stronger strain differences than globin          Sandberg           et al   also identified an          additional  genes that varied between strains for          particular regions We have not specifically searched for          such genes the ANOVA interaction effects would          correspond most closely to such a category but very few          genes were found to have significant interaction effects          Table  Preliminary results see Materials and          methods Availability of data and software using          templates that select specifically for genes expressed in          one region in one strain suggest that this strategy will          be useful for identifying more complex expression          patterns as well as the simple ones we describe in detail          here                          Regionspecific expression          As with the strainspecific genes we identify a          number of putative regionspecific genes in addition to          those identified by Sandberg           et al   The two methods lead          to an estimate that at a           p value of   up to          approximately  genes show variability of expression          with respect to brain region Table  or around  of          the total compared to the  regionspecific genes          identified by Sandberg   and Sandberg           et al   As for the          strainspecific genes some genes identified in   do          not receive particularly high scores in our assays          Figure  and see Additional data files For example          both hippocampal genes identified in   have           p values greater than  and do          not appear in Figure  In general however most of the          genes selected in   appear fairly high on our lists          although additional genes are often given even higher          scores by our assays          In agreement with Sandberg           et al   we find that the          cerebellum is by far the most distinct of the brain          regions studied The bulk of the genes identified as          showing regionspecific effects appear to be due to          cerebellum enrichment or depletion  out of  at          templatematch           p    The midbrain was the          second most distinct single region Table  In          contrast the cortex had the least distinct expression          pattern being very similar to other forebrain regions          as pointed out by Sandberg           et al When considered together          the forebrain represented by cortex amygdala          hippocampus and entorhinal cortex has many genes that          distinguish it from the midbrain and cerebellum Table           Taken separately the cortex amygdala hippocampus          and entorhinal cortex had relatively few genes with          distinct patterns Table  Figure  The single          amygdalaspecific gene ARP identified by Sandberg           et al appears at the top of our          list of amygdalaspecific genes and although we identify          a few other highscoring genes in that category none          approaches the specificity of ARP Figure  Details          of a few examples of highscoring genes we identified for          hippocampus and midbrain are shown in Figure cand d          respectively          In many cases the expression patterns we report seem          to be novel but in others supporting evidence is found          in the literature We did not attempt a comprehensive          literature survey for each gene but support was readily          found for the hippocampus enrichment of copine             neuropeptide Y receptor Y   Atonal    and          kallikrein  neuropsin   The same can be said for          the midbrain enrichment of Rin   Peg   and          nexin   Some cerebellarenriched genes for which we          found supporting evidence include calsequestrin             and aldolase  zebrin                              Discussion                  Evaluation of methodology          The difference in the genes we selected compared to          Sandberg           et al   seems to depend on two          factors ignoring the absentpresent calls and using          statistical methods that provide a score for each gene          rather than simply choosing to assign genes to the group          of changed genes Sandberg           et al appear to have used criteria          that were conservative given the measures used that is          three out of four absentpresent calls must be present          to consider a gene expressed But the fact that the          standard ANOVA often does not support the evaluation          based on absentpresent calls supports the idea that          absentpresent calls even if used conservatively are          neither specific nor sensitive enough          There are two particular drawbacks to using          absentpresent calls for this type of analysis Most          important each absentpresent call is based on only a          single array If one has only a single array such a          guideline for the ability to detect a given gene may be          useful When multiple measurements are made however as          in the dataset considered here there is no set method          for evaluating the data Is a gene present in the          experiment when it is present on three of four arrays          or are two out of four arrays sufficient Instead of such                    ad hoc criteria we used          statistical comparisons of the samples This means that          lowmagnitude signals which might have been called          absent can turn out to be reliable and meaningful when          several observations are made A second problem with the          absentpresent calls is that they are based on          essentially arbitrary thresholds with no simple estimate          of the risk of false positives or false negatives The          use of methods that provide           p values allows a much          finergrained analysis For these reasons we feel that          absentpresent calls should generally not be used to          analyze experiments where replicates were performed          Despite the advantages of ignoring absentpresent          calls the absolute difference expression value          provided by the Affymetrix software is not ideal In          particular large negative values occur at a much higher          rate than expected data not shown These negative          values are probably due to problems with mismatch probes          as described in the Materials and methods section A more          thorough analysis would remove or otherwise correct for          probe pairs containing such problematic probes from the          raw data which we did not have access to here At least          two groups have described alternative methods that start          with the perfect matchmismatch pair data             which may be better at identifying and eliminating such          troublesome data points          The regionspecific genes listed in Figure reflect a          combination of the two methods we used This combination          takes advantage of desirable features of both methods          ANOVA can detect any effect of region on expression          whereas template matching looks specifically for one          pattern at a time By sorting ANOVA hits into regions          based on templatematch           p values we identify some genes          that were missed by template matching In general this          is caused by the ability of ANOVA to detect significant          expression patterns that do not fit any particular          template very well but when examined manually reveal          interesting patterns related to the template We note          that other methods of           post hoc testing ANOVA data exist            A benefit of the templatematch method is that it is          very simple to apply and we believe we found some          patterns that would be fairly difficult to find using          other methods Thus we consider the templatematch method          a useful complement to standard           post hoc tests          In the search for regionspecific genes ANOVA tended          to be more conservative than template matching This is          probably because ANOVA retains information about the          experimental design for the example of synuclein given          in the results it knows that there is a large          disagreement between two matched replicates in the          midbrain samples whereas the template match based on the          correlation coefficient considers all variations to be          essentially equivalent The fact that there are only four          samples for each tissue while there are twelve for each          strain means that tests for tissuespecific genes are          even more susceptible to the effect of noise in the data          This helps explain why the discrepancies between template          match and ANOVA was larger for the regionspecific genes          than for strainspecific genes          The methods we describe have some limitations ANOVA          loses power when the number of replicates is not the same          for all the conditions and the experiment must also          follow a complete block design where all possible          combinations of factors are tested Even in cases where          these conditions are not adhered to multiple           t tests which are generally          proscribed in multivariate statistics in favor of ANOVA          would be preferable to resorting to           ad hoc methods for assessing          statistical significance of the results The          templatematch method has the potential drawback that if          used alone one would miss potentially interesting          patterns that do not resemble the templates being          tested This may be acceptable if there is a clear idea          of what is being sought in the experiment but is          possibly detrimental in studies relying on exploration          and serendipity to find patterns The          ANOVAtemplatematch combination ameliorates this problem          as one can choose to be guided primarily by the ANOVA           p value which is not pattern          specific while using the template to reduce the          complexity of the analysis by partitioning the data into          groups based on interesting patterns                          Biological significance          Our results resemble those of Sandberg           et al   in that many of the          genes given high scores have previously defined roles in          the function of the nervous system At the same time          many of the high scoring genes have housekeeping roles          or more general cellular functions that are not specific          to the nervous system Currently this conclusion is based          on a manual examination of the annotations and the          literature associated with topscoring genes In the          future as annotations improve we hope to be able to          perform such assessments quantitatively and objectively          Clearly the ranked list of genes we provide can only act          as an input to further studies of nervous system          function and does not provide any ready answers to          questions about behavioral or functional differences          As already indicated another general conclusion from          our study is that the variation between regions and          strains appears to be greater than originally indicated          by the analysis of Sandberg           et al In a commentary on the          original study Geschwind   sought explanations for          the apparent paucity of regionspecific and          strainspecific gene expression Although the sensitivity          of the microarray assay itself may be at issue our          results clearly show that the use of different          computational analysis methods has a dramatic effect on          the interpretation of the data Geschwind   also          expressed surprise that the cerebellum which is          histologically more homogeneous than the other brain          regions assayed was discovered to have the largest          number of uniquely expressed genes This interpretation          of the data assumes that the other regions such as cortex          and hippocampus being more complex and heterogeneous          should have more differences between each other as well          as from the cerebellum However because hippocampus          neocortex and entorhinal cortex are all cortical          structures with many cell types in common it is not          surprising that they have similar gene expression          profiles In contrast the cerebellum has a distinct          developmental origin as well as a unique cellular          composition compared to all the other regions assayed          Thus it is not at all surprising that the cerebellum is          the most distinct region In agreement with this line of          logic the midbrain which is histologically and          developmentally distinct from the cortex and cerebellum          was the next most distinct region We also note that          contrary to the suggestion of Geschwind the fact that          the cerebellum had the largest number of uniquely          expressed genes is not equivalent to stating that the          cerebellum has the highest molecular complexity   To          assess this type of complexity the total number of mRNA          species expressed in the tissue would have to be          measured but such information is not readily available          If we take the number of present calls provided by the          Affymetrix software as a first approximation of a          complexity measure we find no evidence that the          cerebellum expresses more genes than other regions          assayed by Sandberg           et al data not shown          A recent study by Zirlinger           et al   also analyzed          regionspecific gene expression in the amygdala          cerebellum and hippocampus as well as the olfactory bulb          and periaqueductal gray for a single mouse strain Our          results and those of Sandberg           et al can be compared to theirs          though there were several important differences in their          study that need to be taken into account First unlike          the study of Sandberg           et al no replicates were          performed for each region although           in situ hybridization was used to          confirm some of the array results In addition the          strain Zirlinger           et al used was not one used by          Sandberg           et al and there were also          differences in the methods for isolating the tissues used          by the two groups Finally Zirlinger           et al assayed a larger number of          genes and ESTs approximately  than were in the          dataset we studied approximately  Some          comparisons can be made however          In agreement with our results and the results of          Sandberg           et al Zirlinger           et al found that the cerebellum          was most distinct from the amygdala and hippocampus Some          of the genes they identified are also given high scores          by our tests adding further support to the validity of          our results Of the cerebellar genes identified by          Zirlinger           et al  of the  which are on          the MuK arrays have ANOVA           p values less than   while          for the template match the number is  For the          amygdala genes the numbers are  ANOVA and           template match None of the hippocampal genes they          identified appears to be on the MuK arrays One          possible source of discrepancies here is that Zirlinger           et al did not assay neocortex          midbrain or entorhinal cortex Expression in these          regions would decrease their significance in our assays          but would not affect their results The differences in          our results suggest that caution is advisable in making          broad interpretations based on largescale gene          expression data from a limited sample of tissues and          genetic backgrounds and that confirmation by another          method is desirable          In summary our results expand the number of candidate          genes for investigation of the genetic basis of          behavioral differences between the CBL and SvEv          mouse strains as well as the number of genes that might          be responsible for structural and functional differences          between brain regions in the mouse More sophisticated          methods than ours could be envisioned but ANOVA and          template matching have much to recommend them They yield          results with high sensitivity and selectivity and are          fast simple and based on commonly understood statistical          principles They should also be readily applicable to          other complex expression datasets                            Materials and methods                  Data          Expression data was downloaded from the FTP site          established by Sandberg           et al   The data had already          been normalized and analyzed using the Affymetrix          software Affymetrix arrays use sets of around  pairs          of oligonucleotide probes to represent a single gene or          EST Each pair consists of a perfectmatch primer and a          mismatch primer that has a single base change from the          perfect match and is meant to control for nonspecific          hybridization effects For each gene probe set the          Affymetrix software calculates an average difference          between the intensities of the perfectmatch and mismatch          primers and additionally makes an overall determination          as to the absence or presence of a gene absentpresent          call in the sample For our methods we used only the          average difference measures We assembled the average          difference data for the  arrays into a single matrix of           columns and  rows Updated annotations for the          sequences on the arrays were obtained from the UniGene            and the FANTOM    databases                          Feature selection          A simple method of selecting genes that display          particular characteristics across           m experiments is to compare each          profile to a template representing the pattern being          sought We define a template as a binary vector of length                    m with a value of o corresponding          to one expression value and a value of  corresponding          to a contrasting expression value For example a search          for genes showing strainspecific variation in expression          could be performed by comparing each profile to the          following template given that the data columns are          grouped by strain  in SvEv followed by  in          CBL                                           The Pearson correlation coefficient of the profile          with the template was used as a simple measure of the          agreement of the profile with the pattern For two          profiles           X and           Y the correlation coefficient           r is calculated using the          formula                    where and are the means of each profile and sums are          taken for           i ranging over all           m values in each profile If in the          template a value of o is interpreted as low expression          and  as high expression the example pattern would          identify samples with lower expression in the SvEv          than CBL The correlation is only sensitive to the          shape of the profile not the amplitude so all profiles          having a shape like the template will be given higher          scores regardless of the actual expression values To          allow both matches and antimatches in some cases we          used the absolute value of the correlation coefficient          effectively allowing the meanings of ones and zeroes in          the template to be reversed for any particular          comparison We note that templates that contain          continuous values instead of binary ones could be applied          in the same way allowing one to search for specific          patterns of greater complexity but binary vectors were          sufficient for the purposes of this study High          correlation values correspond to a good match The           p values were calculated using a           t test on the correlation          coefficient   We prepared templates corresponding to          each of the regions assayed by Sandberg           et al as well as using the          straindistinguishing template shown in the example          above                          Analysis of variance ANOVA and combining ANOVA          with feature selection          A standard linear twoway analysis of variance             was performed independently on the data for each          gene The effects examined for each gene were strain          region and interactions between strain and region This          is expressed by the following linear equation                    where           E           ijk  is the measured expression          level of the gene in replicate           k from one of six regions           i in one of two strains           j   is the overall mean          expression level of the gene and           R and           S are effects due to region and          strain respectively The           RS term represents interactions          between strain and region which might be detected if a          gene is expressed only in specific regions in only one          strain for example The error term  accounts for          random variation from replicate to replicate that is          any effect not accounted for by the other terms in the          model Thus this model assumes that the measured          expression level of a gene can be described as a linear          combination of effects due to measurement error strain          region and interactions between strain and region The          null hypothesis is that a given factor does not have an          effect on expression meaning that the corresponding term          in the equation is zero The extent to which the fitted          parameters           R            S and           RS for a gene are nonzero          provides the basis of the ANOVA We generated           p values for each of the three          effects for each gene using a standard Ftest            As discussed ANOVA does not allow one to directly          distinguish between effects due to particular levels of          one parameter Specifically ANOVA might indicate that          there was a significant effect of region on expression          but does not directly reveal which regions show different          expression from any others Thus one needs to apply a           post hoc test to the ANOVA results          to determine which regions if any show differences from          others Typically this type of multiple comparison is          done using statistical tests such as the Tukey or Scheff          methods   In our study each region must be compared          to each other region so  comparisons must be made in          total for each gene In practice however interpretation          of these results is more complicated an additional stage          of analysis must be performed to generate for example          genes expressed at higher levels in the cerebellum than          in all other regions as opposed to any one other region          as is given by Tukey or Scheff methods For our study          we used a simple strategy suggested by the idea of          template matching we choose genes fitting a pattern in          which we are interested from a subset of genes with low          ANOVA           p values for region effects          Specifically we first selected all genes which had          regioneffect ANOVA           p values   and then          applied template matching to this set to select genes          which fit a particular pattern as described above at a           p value of  or less These          arbitrary and fairly lax thresholds were used because          they proved to give reasonable numbers of genes in each          partition The resulting groups of genes can then be          ranked according to either their ANOVA           p value or by the correlation with          the template                          Interpretation of pvalues          An important issue in interpreting the           p values generated by tests on          single genes is the effect of multiple tests          Specifically a test performed with a chosen           p value cutoff of  repeated           times will on average generate  false          positives if each test is independent Corrections for          this multiple testing problem are well known in          statistics but are somewhat controversial   Methods          used by Tusher           et al   and Callow           et al   attempt to provide          appropriate corrections for microarray experiments but          there is as yet no consensus on which methods to apply          For the purposes of presenting our data here we report          results at three different thresholds which would by          the Bonferroni criteria yield on average about            or  experimentwide false positives under the          assumptions of our tests that is           p values of   and            respectively Because these cutoffs assume that each          gene is independent which is clearly not the case these          false positive estimates are probably conservative with          respect to the multiple testing issue Because we assume          here that the standard F and           t distributions are adequate for          describing the statistics we use however using a          conservative cutoff provides some additional protection          from type I errors due to potential inaccuracy of the          uncorrected           p values                          Filtering selected genes          All the analysis described above was performed without          adjusting or filtering the raw average difference values          But a difficulty one commonly encounters with Affymetrix          data is that many probe sets yield large negative          expression average difference measures Large negative          expression values occur when one or more mismatch primers          in a probe set have much higher intensities than their          corresponding perfect match primers This may occur          because the mismatch primer is binding to some other          nucleotide in the sample which does not represent the          gene for which a measurement is indented Because the          Affymetrix software determines the presence or absence of          expression of a gene in part on the basis of how many          probe pairs give high intensities not just the average          across the probe pairs some genes may be flagged as          present despite having negative average differences          Obviously this is not desirable one would like to          correct for problematic mismatch probes before          calculating the average difference A stopgap measure          which we used here as we did not have access to the          original raw data files is to remove from consideration          entire probe sets which have this problem Specifically          genes with more than  values out of  that were less          than  were rejected in practice this method is quite          conservative removing only the most problematic genes          We note that a few genes about  of approximately           selected by Sandberg           et al would be removed from          consideration by our filter                          Comparison with the results of Sandberg et al                    A list of the genes identified in the previous work on          this dataset were obtained from Tables and  of Sandberg                    et al   and Table  of Sandberg            A few groups of genes referred to in these studies          are not specifically identified in the publications the          selection of eight hippocampusenriched two          amygdaladecreased five entorhinal cortexenriched and          three entorhinal cortexdecreased genes is mentioned but          the genes are not specifically identified in   From          our other comparisons it is fairly likely that some of          these genes were given high scores in our analysis so          our comparison to the results of Sandberg           et al for those areas should be          regarded as incomplete                          Visualization of the
