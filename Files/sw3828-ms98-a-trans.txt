                so what are your feelings on the topic today as far as crime in America today   well im think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the or a lot less of the time than theyre   yeah thats   given by the court system but  i dont know with the economy the way it is i think crime cant do much but go up   no i have to i have to agree with you i had an occasion a couple years ago to hear the Richardson Chief of Police of Richardson Texas speak and you know its a shame a a criminal today not a murderer but a guy that breaks in houses and steals things and you know he does this and he does this for a couple of years hides all the stash and works off of it and then when he gets caught hell be sentenced something like five to seven years but he gets five days credit for every day he serves i mean its like a bonus to go to jail so subsequently a five year sentence means hes going be out in uh a year   right     on probation i mean what he does the chief said is he just merely goes back to a stash stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate and uh when he uses spends uses up all that and spends all that money then he uh starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing   well there was an article in our paper Sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in North Carolina the average serves six weeks   now see thats a you talk about thats a crime right there   well we see we dont have any room in our prisons so   well we dont either in Texas   they shuttle they shuttle them in and shuttle them out and they get them get them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks and then theyre theyre paroled uh to make room for the newest criminals and it just it its just really absurd   well it it certainly is and uh that would be a huge concern you know i dont think the general public really realizes this as far what goes on with our criminal system our judiciary judiciary system and everything else its just uh its terrible the way it is right now   i think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now so many different things coming in so many different directions that theyve just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize theres absolutely or they think that theres absolutely nothing they can do about it   yeah as far as steps to reduce crime if its uh crimes like were just been discussing obviously we we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in to uh take them off the streets but i dont think thats gonna happen because just like you said and   uh yeah   our states a good example your states a good example and its just not gonna happen as far as the murderers and people that commit rape and things like that im not sure whats right but i know that its its not right to put him in there and let let him live for years and years and leers years before you do execute him or whatever because its has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to clothe him and you know to   yep   im sure he gets to watch a lot of TV and im sure they have uh exercise facilities and movies and  and everything else you know they can have a good time in   well i dont know what the answer is but i know that asking the question over and over and over again isnt working so   no it really isnt its a big its a big problem and hopefully something will come out of it so i dont know   i hope so i dont   im uh im pretty much of a hard person uh i believe in capital punishment i mean you know a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone i mean you know if its just downright outright   oh i definitely believe in capital punishment   oh you bet i mean thats the only way to   its when they its when theyre in on death row for nineteen years that i dont im kind of curious curious about what   oh yeah and you spend thousands hundreds of thousands of dollars to uh take care of them and all you know its just unbelievable      yeah you can appeal now in North Carolina for almost almost a period of twenty years   can you really   yeah you can just keep going around and around and around the merry go round until you i think the i think its uh the average is eight to ten years to get it to the North Carolina Supreme Court   gosh   and then uh after that it goes to the  Supreme Court of the United States and that usually takes another four to six years so its   oh i know see meanwhile youre living in a country club situation perhaps you know   theyre hoping i guess theyre what theyre hoping theyre trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did but it just uh   yes   we have a serious problem in we have so many problems in this state right now and and the the thing is the the fundamental   the drug problems thats another one   fundamental problem is the legal is
