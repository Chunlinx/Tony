                    Background        Mammalian protein phosphatase  PP and its homolog        protein phosphatase T Pptp from the yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae contain a        catalytic domain structurally related to the catalytic        subunits of PP PPA and PPB and an Nterminal domain        consisting of multiple tetratricopeptide repeats TPRs not        found in other members of this family of phosphatases              Homologs have also been identified in         Xenopus laevis             Neurospora crassa             Drosophila melanogaster             Trypanosoma brucei             Plasmodium falciparum      and        cauliflower     and homologs for         Caenorhabditis elegans        Schizosaccharomyces pombe and         Arabidopsis thaliana are predicted        accession number CAB CAA and AAD        respectively        Protein phosphatase  has been implicated in the control        of cell proliferation in hormonal signal transduction and        in hsp chaperone function                   However little is known about the regulation of PP or its        specific role in these pathways and only one physiological        substrate for PP has been identified to date the        apoptosis signaling kinase ASK      PP can be        activated by lipid         in vitro  and removal of the TPR        domain or the C terminus generates an active lipid        insensitive form of the enzyme        PP        phosphatase activity is also altered by hCRY and a        fragment of hsp         in vitro      These findings        suggest that PP may be autoinhibited and that the binding        of protein partners or lipids to the TPR domain could        potentially control PP activity in cells however no        reports have yet documented how PP is regulated         in vivo  The activity of PP        homologs from cauliflower         T brucei and         P falciparum is stimulated by        polyunsaturated fatty acids         in vitro       and removal of        the TPR domain from         P falciparum PP increases activity        to the same extent as lipid treatment      This        suggests that the TPR domain plays a similar inhibitory        role for all PP homologs        Genetic analyses in         S cerevisiae have yielded few clues        about the function of Pptp Budding yeast lacking         PPT do not exhibit obvious growth        defects or detectable phenotypes     Disruption of         PPT together with one of the other        known phosphatases in budding yeast also reveals no obvious        phenotype     Thus if Pptp has an essential function        in         S cerevisiae  more than one other        phosphatase can also carry out this role In this report we        have characterized the activity of recombinant Pptp        analyzed its expression at the level of protein and mRNA        and localized Pptp in yeast Pptp can be activated by        lipid is most highly expressed in early log phase growth        and is present throughout the cell                    Results                  Comparison of Pptp and PP activity and response          to lipid treatment          Recombinant Pptp expressed as a GSTfusion protein          then affinity purified and released from GST by thrombin          cleavage yielded a single band of the expected molecular          weight  kDa Fig A When assayed sidebyside the          basal specific activities for recombinant Pptp and PP          were similar toward the artificial substrates PMBP and          Pcasein respectively Fig B Like PP the          dephosphorylation of PMBP by Pptp was stimulated by          arachidonic acid and other unsaturated fatty acids but          lipids lacking either a double bond or a carboxylate          group were not effective Table           In the case of pNPP hydrolysis others have reported          both saturated and unsaturated fatty acyl coenzyme A          esters stimulate PP activity with concentrations          required for halfmaximal stimulation approximately          fold lower than those of their corresponding free          fatty acids     We therefore tested whether a          saturated fatty acyl coenzyme A ester could also          stimulate Pptp Pptp activity toward PMBP was          stimulated by arachidoyl coenzyme A in a concentration          range similar to that observed for AA with halfmaximal          stimulation occurring at approximately  M for          arachidoyl coenzyme A and  M for AA However in          contrast to AA stimulation Pptp activity dropped off          sharply at  M arachidoyl coenzyme A and higher          Similar results were observed for PP data not shown          This suggests that double bonds are not required to          observe the effect of fatty acyl coenzyme A esters          Unlike PP the activity of Pptp toward Pcasein          was not stimulated by AA arachidoyl coenzyme A or          linoleoyl coenzyme A over a range in concentration from           M Fig Band data not shown Other unsaturated          fatty acids also failed to stimulate Pptp activity with          this substrate Table  These data indicate that Pptp          is stimulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids as well as          by a saturated fatty acyl coenzyme A derivative toward          some but not all substrates dephosphorylated by PP                          Limited proteolysis of Pptp          Removal of the TPR domain of PP by limited          proteolysis increases enzyme activity and the TPR domain          binds lipid         Using conditions similar to          those employed with PP digestion of Pptp with trypsin          in the absence of lipid produced a  kDa catalytic          fragment that was stable for at least  min and a  kDa          fragment that was degraded within  min Fig A          Nterminal sequence analysis showed that these fragments          are derived from the catalytic and the TPR domains          respectively Fig AB The crystal structure of the          PP TPR domain revealed three TPRs followed by an          extended  helix     however Pptp was originally          proposed to contain one additional TPR     The          pattern of proteolysis and sites of cleavage for Pptp          are very similar to those seen with PP under these same          conditions     This indicates that Pptp also          contains an accessible region linking the TPR and          catalytic domains and is most consistent with the          presence of three TPRs in Pptp Limited tryptic          proteolysis in the presence of  M AA generated a          distinct pattern of fragmentation Fig A A  kDa          fragment was observed at early times but a series of          four fragments ranging from  kDa appeared between           and  min as the amount of the  kDa fragment          decreased These fragments which are derived from the          TPR domain were not observed in the absence of AA          suggesting that lipid binding alters the conformation of          this domain and its susceptibility to proteolysis A          similar change in susceptibility to proteolysis upon          lipid binding was observed with PP     As with PP          only lipids that stimulated PMBP dephosphorylation          slowed degradation of the  kDa TPR fragment Table                    Removal of the TPR domain from Pptp by trypsin          treatment had no effect on its activity toward          Pcasein but increased activity toward PMBP          approximately two fold Fig C AA did not stimulate          PMBP dephosphorylation by Pptp after removal of the          TPR domain data not shown Thus lipids that activate          Pptp alter the sensitivity of the TPR domain to          proteolysis and removal of the TPR domain causes a loss          of the response of Pptp to lipid However removal of          the TPR domain only modestly increases Pptp activity in          contrast to the  fold elevation reported after TPR          removal from PP      Although we cannot rule out          the possibility that proteolyzed Pptp is unresponsive to          lipid because it is unstable the observations that the          catalytic fragment remains undegraded and control          activity is not decreased argue against this possibility          Alternatively an inhibitory element in the linker region          may remain after TPR domain removal                          The effect of Cterminal truncation on Pptp          activity          Removal of  residues from the C terminus of PP          results in a highly active enzyme that is only modestly          stimulated by lipid     To examine the role of the C          terminus in controlling Pptp phosphatase activity a          similar truncation mutant Pptp  was expressed          and characterized Fig Aand  Compared to fulllength          enzyme Pptp  exhibited a twofold increase in          control specific activity with both Pcasein and          PMBP Lipid did not stimulate Pptp  toward          Pcasein but still increased activity with PMBP          fold In contrast Cterminal truncation of PP          activates the enzyme as extensively as lipid treatment          and little further activation is seen with lipid              In the case of PP subtilisin digestion removed both the          TPR domain and the C terminus     The observation          that Cterminal truncation increased Pptp activity          toward both Pcasein and PMBP but subtilisin          digestion increased activity only toward PMBP see          Fig C suggests that the C terminus of Pptp remained          intact during subtilisin digestion However mass          analysis of the subtilisinderived catalytic fragment          would be required to confirm this                          Expression and localization of HAPptp in yeast          cells          To examine when Pptp is expressed and where it is          localized a yeast strain WHT was generated in which          the           PPT gene was replaced with cDNA          encoding hemagglutinintagged Pptp HAPptp          Immunoblotting showed that HAPptp levels were highest          in early log phase and then decreased dramatically          during the stationary phase Fig AB Northern          analysis showed that the           PPT mRNA levels also increased in          early log phase and decreased as the cell division          decreased upon entering the stationary phase Fig C          correlating with protein expression The pattern of           PPT gene expression was identical          in wildtype cells and cells expressing HAPptp          indicating that the epitope tag did not alter          transcription or message stability data not shown          Cells in early log phase growth when           PPT gene expression was maximal          were used to localize HAPptp Indirect          immunofluorescence was required to detect HAPptp          Fluorescence microscopy indicated that HAPptp was          present throughout the cell including the nucleus Fig          A Localization and staining intensity did not appear          to change as a function of bud size or morphology          suggesting that Pptp expression and localization is not          cell cycle dependent          To confirm that the indirect immunofluorescence          procedure did not generate artifacts the localization of          the spindle pole body protein Spcp was also examined by          this method A yeast centromeric plasmid encoding the          fusion protein SpcpEGFP was transformed into W          cells Direct fluorescence from EGFP and indirect          immunofluorescence using the amplification protocol with          antiEGFP antibody were compared Both signals revealed          specific localization of SpcpEGFP to the spindle pole          body Fig B          When HAPptp or EGFPPptp was overexpressed from the                    GAL promoter in a centromeric or          episomal plasmid respectively indirect          immunofluorescence of HAPptp or direct fluorescence          from EGFPPptp showed that both proteins were also          localized throughout the cell                            Discussion        PP and its homologs in other species represent a        subfamily of PPP enzymes distinguished by the presence of        an Nterminal domain containing multiple TPR repeats Pptp        from the yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae was the        first homolog of mammalian PP to be described Thus far        genetic approaches have not revealed functions for budding        yeast Pptp In this report we have characterized Pptp        activity         in vitro and examined its        expression        In the case of mammalian PP results from lipid        stimulation and binding limited proteolysis and truncation        studies taken together suggest the TPR domain and the C        terminus inhibit PP activity in a coordinated manner and        that lipid binding to the TPR domain activates the enzyme         in vitro       In the        present study we used assay conditions for Pptp identical        to those in which PP was shown to be activated by removal        of the TPR or Cterminal regions     Under these        conditions Pptp is also stimulated by lipids toward        PMBP and activating lipids slow TPR domain proteolysis        These results indicate that Pptp has a similar domain        structure to PP and is activated in a similar manner by        lipid binding to the TPR domain Removal of the TPR domain        prevents stimulation by lipid but only modestly increases        Pptp activity Carboxylterminal truncation modestly        increases Pptp activity toward both PMBP and        Pcasein and does not prevent further lipid stimulation        of PMBP dephosphorylation These results distinguish        Pptp from mammalian PP and suggest that the C terminus is        less important in controlling Pptp activity Although more        work will be required to determine its role in lipid        stimulation removal of the TPR domain had only a small        effect on Pptp activation Pptp contains two short        stretches of amino acids a residue sequence between the        linker helix and the catalytic domain residues         and a tenresidue sequence just preceding the extreme C        terminus residues  that are not found in other        PP homologs reported thus far                      and accession numbers CAB CAA and AAD The        presence of these additional sequences in Pptp may        underlie the differences in the responses of Pptp and PP        to N or Cterminal truncation Additional studies will be        required to determine if our observations reflect        structural and regulatory properties unique to Pptp        Pptp and PP exhibit similar specific activities toward        Pcasein in the absence of lipid However Pptp activity        toward this substrate was not stimulated by lipids These        results highlight the fact that PPP enzymes often exhibit        substrate specific effects         in vitro and that the use of a single        substrate to study this family of enzymes can be        misleading Like PP the control activity of Pptp is low        toward the commonly used artificial substrates such as        Pcasein and PMBP compared to other PPP enzymes            Thus it is not clear whether the selective lipid        stimulation of Pptp toward PMBP reflects a        substratedirected effect or whether Pcasein is simply        a poor substrate for Pptp Egloff and colleagues        identified seven acidic surface residues on the catalytic        face of PPc  that are replaced by neutral or basic        residues in PPA     They suggest the presence of        these acidic residues in PPc  may explain why casein is a        good substrate for PPA but not for PP Based on a        sequence alignment with PPc  these seven acidic residues        are not conserved in Pptp Using the program Modeller            a homology model of the catalytic domain of Pptp was        built based on three PP structures  PDB        httpwwwpdborg    codes FJM     IT           and JK     This model shows that the catalytic face        of Pptp is generally less acidic than that of PPc  and        does not indicate the presence of other acidic residues        that could act in the same fashion as those on PPc  Thus        the reason for low Pptp activity toward this acidic        substrate may be more complex than can be explained by        electrostatic repulsion        Others have proposed that fatty acyl coenzyme A esters        are potential physiologic regulators of PP since these        compounds stimulate pNPP hydrolysis by PP         in vitro at physiologically relevant        concentrations and are approximately fold more potent        than their free fatty acid counterparts     Although        we confirmed this observation using PP and pNPP data not        shown in our hands similar levels of AA and arachidoyl        coenzyme A were required for halfmaximal stimulation of        PMBP dephosphorylation in the case of both Pptp and        PP Although more work is required to examine this issue        thoroughly our results suggest that the large differences        in potency between free fatty acids and fatty acyl coenzyme        A esters seen using pNPP may not extend to all protein        substrates In addition it will be important to determine        if lipids in any form play a role in the regulation of PP        or Pptp         in vivo         Pptp was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of         S cerevisiae  No difference in        compartmentalization or staining intensity in cells was        observed as a function of cell or bud size This suggests        that the level or localization of Pptp is not controlled        as a function of cell cycle progression Both nuclear and        cytoplasmic localization have been reported for other PP        homologs In some cases including         P falciparum and HeLa cells nuclear        staining appeared more intense than cytoplasmic staining             Based on studies with heterologously expressed        human PPGFP fusion proteins it has been proposed that        nuclear localization requires a stretch of sequence in the        C terminus     However other sequences or signals are        also likely to contribute to nuclear localization of PP        and its homologs since rat and mouse PP which are        identical to human PP in this region do not appear to be        nuclear in all cell types      In addition         P falciparum PP is primarily        nuclear     although it is not well conserved in the        relevant Cterminal region but contains a potential        bipartite nuclear localization signal not found in other        PP sequences reported thus far The functional        significance of differential localization is not known at        this time        Pptp levels are highest during periods of rapid growth        and drop off when growth slows Fig B raising the        possibility that this enzyme may have a role in controlling        cell growth    and its expression may be regulated by a        metabolic or nutritional signal     The observation        that Pptp levels rose and fell in parallel with mRNA        levels suggests that Pptp expression is primarily        controlled at the level of gene transcription Studies of        PP and its homologs in cultured cells and various        organisms also suggest it may play a role in development            or during rapid cell growth                         Conclusions        Pptp shares several biochemical properties with PP and        other homologs including a similar domain structure and        stimulation by lipid         in vitro  Unlike PP Pptp is not        fully activated by removal of the TPR domain or by removal        of  Cterminal residues suggesting that these regions may        not play an autoinhibitory role in Pptp Pptp is        expressed in early log phase growth and decreases        dramatically as cells approach the stationary phase        suggesting that Pptp could play a role in cell growth or        may be controlled by metabolic or nutritional signals Like        PP the observation that Pptp is localized in both the        nucleus and cytoplasm implies that it may function in        several subcellular compartments        Although our findings suggest some differences may exist        in regulatory properties of Pptp and PP many biochemical        and cellular properties are shared In addition a recent        report has shown that Pptp is copurified with Hspp and        Hscp the         S cerevisiae homologs of hsp            indicating that Pptp and PP have at least one common        protein partner and suggesting that like PP Pptp        functions in chaperone complexes Thus         S cerevisiae Pptp is likely to be a        valuable model for probing the cellular role of PP
