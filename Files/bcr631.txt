                    Introduction        Common agents currently used in treating metastatic        breast cancer are the antimitotics paclitaxel and docetaxel             These drugs bind to tubulin a major protein in        mitotic spindles and halt cell division at metaphase        Their effectiveness in cancer chemotherapy is thought to be        due to their ability to reduce the dynamics of microtubules        in mitotic spindles thus preventing spindle assembly and        interrupting the normal movement of sister chromatids        toward the spindle poles           Tubulin a         kDa  heterodimer is structurally heterogeneous with        seven genes encoding tubulin and tubulin isotypes The        major differences between isotype classes reside in the        last  amino acids of the carboxytermini             and these differences have been exploited in the        development of isotypespecific antibodies              Mammalian microtubules are formed from a mixture of        tubulin and tubulin isotype classes       and        the antimitotics used in chemotherapy interact primarily        with tubulin In vertebrates the concentrations of the        specific isotypes vary in different tissues             although the functional role for the variability in tubulin        polypeptides is uncertain             The expression of genes encoding tubulin and tubulin        seems to be developmentally regulated     For example        tubulin isotype expression patterns change during the        development and maturation of neurons      Studies        with paclitaxel or other antimitotic agents such as        colchicine or estramustine indicate that drug interactions        with tubulin isotypes differ        and might        contribute to cell resistance to antimitotics                 However one group of antimitotic agents the        vinca alkaloids was shown to bind with similar affinity to        all tubulin isotypes     suggesting that alterations        in drug binding affinity is unlikely to be the cause of        drug resistance Furthermore whereas some of these data        suggest a role for tubulin isotypes in drug resistance        cell growth and differentiation other work indicates that        isotypeindependent factors affecting microtubule polymer        formation are more important than changes in isotype levels               For example a decrease in total polymer        concentrations causes resistance to microtubulestabilizing        agents such as paclitaxel             The work presented here quantitatively compares the        tubulin isotype levels in normal and tumor breast tissues        We developed an indirect competitive enzymelinked        immunosorbent assay ELISA using antibodies specific for        tubulin classes II III and I  IV that is sensitive to         gml tubulin The results of the ELISA assay agree with        quantitative Western blotting and indicate that tubulin        class II predominates in both normal and tumor breast        tissues Isotype levels are similar in both tissues but        surprisingly they exhibit a broad fractional distribution        To explore this further we measured Herneu protein        levels which are known to be correlated with poor        prognosis We demonstrate that although Herneu levels in        tumor tissues were fold those in normal tissues there        was no correlation between the Herneu biomarker and        tubulin isotype levels Taken together these data suggest        that unlike previous reports on small cell lung cancer            tubulin isotype levels are not diagnostic markers        in breast cancer These results challenge the hypothesis of        a universal role for tubulin isotypes in tumor growth and        the development of drug resistance Nevertheless we cannot        exclude the possibility that changes in the distribution of        tubulin isotypes in normal and tumor breast tissue in        conjunction with other molecular factors might still be        relevant to disease progression and cellular response to        antimitotic drugs                    Materials and methods

American Type Culture Collection and grown          under the recommended conditions MCF cells are known          to have fewer than five copies of the Herneu gene          whereas HCC cells overexpress the protein because of          gene amplification      Herneu protein levels          were determined with a Herneu ELISA kit Oncogene in          accordance with the manufacturers

Membranes were removed by pelleting at C in a          microcentrifuge for  min Membrane lipids remained at          the top of the sample and a tiny pellet was often also          observed The pellet was not sufficiently large to allow          the determination of protein levels with our assay The          total protein concentration in the supernatant separated          from the lipid fraction

above without Triton          X The procedure for arginineSepharose purification          of tubulin was presented in detail by Lacey and Snowdon              An enriched tubulin fraction was

Western blotting          To ensure that arginineSepharose chromatography did          not preferentially fractionate specific tubulin isotypes          microtubule protein fractions from an early stage in          purification tubulin plus MAPs were examined by ELISAs          and Western blotting There were no differences before          and after arginineSepharose fractionation in the

Sequential immunoaffinity          columns were used to purify tubulin classes II and III          with their associated tubulins as described previously              Known amounts of PCtubulin tubulin classes          II and III and pig brain samples            n   from the cerebellum and          right cerebrum were examined by SDSpolyacrylamidegel          electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF filters              Alkaline phosphatase colorimetric reactions NBT and          BCIP were used to identify tubulin isotypes Triplicate          blots for each sample were analyzed by densitometry          Molecular Dynamics with ImageQuant Software The          linearity of response was established by systematically          varying the amounts of known tubulin loaded into wells          and plotting these values against densitometry results by          using Origin  Microcal These comparisons allowed us          to calibrate the amounts of tubulin classes I  IV II          and III in PCtubulin and in pig brain samples Table           The same procedures were used to quantify tubulin in          five tumor and normal breast tissues for comparison with          the ELISA results                          Tubulin isotype ELISAs          Indirect competitive ELISAs were used to quantify the          tubulin isotypes in tissue samples The method is adapted          from standard protocols for indirect ELISAs     The          indirect ELISA involves the titration of antibodies          reacted with tubulin in solution A known amount of          tubulin is mixed with the unknown sample the antibodies          compete with a known amount of tubulin bound to the          plate A secondary antibody generates the signal used to          quantify the unknown protein The amount of known protein          can be adjusted to optimize the sensitivity of the          assay          Optimal tubulin binding  gml  l per well to          polystyrene microtiter plates

        average values in pig brain tissues for each isotype            class II   classes I  IV and   class III          determined as described above Table  were used to          construct standard

unknown tissue          samples were prepared by combining them with known levels          of PCtubulin    then mixing them    with          antibody in  nonfat dried milk in PBS          Antibodies usually about  mgml against tubulin          classes I  IV H II B and III TUJ were used          at optimal dilutions ranging from    to             determined empirically for each new stock of

isotype in the breast tissue sample Typical          ELISA data are shown in Fig  In developing the          quantitative tubulin ELISA either microtubule protein          from pig brain containing unknown amounts of tubulin or a          known amount of PCtubulin was used as the experimental          sample This permitted a determination of the accuracy of          our quantification The experiments with microtubule          protein resulted in isotype percentages similar to those          determined by quantitative Western blotting Isotype          determinations with the experimental samples made with          known PCtubulin were within error the same as the          expected quantities data not shown          The reliability of the tubulin ELISA is indicated by          comparison with quantitative Western blotting of breast          tissue samples Figs and  Five paired anonymous          normal and anonymous tumor samples were obtained in  g          quantities

between normal and tumor          tissue distributions of tubulin isotypes However          tubulin classes II and I  IV fractions vary widely           and  respectively Tubulin class          III values are relatively constant  with the          exception of one pair  and  for tumor T and          normal N Fig  These wide distributions for          tubulin classes II and I  IV agree with the ELISAs for          the larger study of  additional samples from CHTN          presented here  and  respectively          Note also that unlike for breast tissues quantitative          Western blot analyses of pig brain samples demonstrate          relatively constant tubulin isotype fractions described          above Table  The values for each isotype in pig brain          are in reasonable agreement with the values previously          reported   and  for tubulin classes II          III and IV     further establishing the validity          of this approach This result supports the accuracy and          the sensitivity of the quantitative Western blots and          ELISAs and demonstrates that the wide distribution          observed for tubulin classes II and I  IV in breast          tissues is not due to error in measurement                          Immunohistochemistry          Tissues were fixed in  buffered formalin containing           zinc sulfate to preserve antigenic sites then          embedded in paraffin and sectioned on a Zeiss rotary          microtome Trypsin digestion was performed at C for           min and followed by a wash with soybean trypsin          inhibitor The slides were deparaffinized with a total          of three incubations in xylene rehydrated through a          graded alcohol series beginning with    and           in PBS and treated with  hydrogen peroxide in          methanol to quench the endogenous peroxidase activity          The sections were blocked in  powdered skimmed milk in          PBS pH  and incubated overnight in a humid chamber          at C with primary monoclonal antibodies The slides          were washed with four changes of PBS and incubated with          a working dilution of biotinlabeled antimouse secondary          antibody and avidinbiotinperoxidase complex ABC The          color was developed with  mM diaminobenzidine           mM hydrogen peroxide in  mM TrisHCl buffer pH           The sections were counterstained with Gills hematoxylin          dehydrated and mounted Negative controls were performed          by omission of the primary antibody and positive          controls for tubulin isotypes were performed with pig          brain tissues                          Realtime polymerase chain reaction PCR          Realtime PCR was used to determine tubulin isotype          mRNA levels in selected breast tissues Table  T N          T N T N T N T N T N N and          T All the other breast tissue samples were required          in their entirety for the ELISA and immunohistochemistry          experiments The purpose of these realtime PCR          experiments was to establish whether tubulin protein          levels were correlated with mRNA levels We developed          protocols for quantitative twostep reverse transcriptase          PCR to establish the relative amounts of mRNA transcripts          encoding each of the tubulin isotypes classes I II          III IVa IVb V and VI Total RNA was extracted from             cells with the MicrotoMidi Total RNA          Purification System Invitrogen The purity of the RNA          was assessed by           A                       A            ratios Electrophoresis with RNA           LabChips and an Agilent  Bioanalyzer was used          to determine the integrity of ribosomal RNA The RNA          concentration was calculated from           A             absorbance unit   gml or          obtained directly from the bioanalyzer Before the          reverse transcription reaction genomic DNA contamination          was eliminated by digestion with deoxyribonuclease I          amplification grade Sigma          To minimize differences in efficiency of the reverse          transcription reaction the various isotype complementary          DNAs cDNAs were produced in a single tube Aliquots          were then used in quantitative PCR to determine the          relative amount of each isotype cDNA independently PCR          reactions were performed with isotypespecific primer          pairs for tubulin isotype classes I II III IVa and          IVb as described     with minor modifications to          correct mismatches and to match the melting temperatures          more closely Similar genespecific primers were designed          for classes V and VI Table  In preliminary          experiments the class II primers gave rise to two PCR          products of approximately equal intensity differing in          size by  base pairs These two products were cloned          into pCR a TAcloning vector and subsequently          sequenced The results showed that the larger product was          due to a tandem duplication at the reverse primer Thus          new primers for the tubulin class II gene were          designed Tubulin cDNA was produced with genespecific          primers for each of the isotype mRNAs and Reflectase          reverse transcriptase Active Motif Aliquots were used          in quantitative realtime PCR to determine independently          the relative amount of each isotype cDNA          To obtain control cDNA template of a known quantity

purified cDNA was determined by          analyzing serial dilutions on DNA  LabChips Agilent          Standard curves for each tubulin isotype cDNA were          generated with realtime PCR at the same time as data          were collected for each of the tissue samples With the          use of triplicate samples and no template controls          realtime PCR iCycler iQ BioRad with SYBR Green          Molecular Probes as the detection method was performed          to quantify the mRNA levels for selected breast tissues          The amount of tubulin isotype mRNA in a known amount of          total RNA was determined from standard curves                            Results                  Tubulin isotypes in breast tissues by          immunohistochemistry          A total of  anonymous paired normal and tumor tissue          samples were obtained from CHTN Table  Selected          breast tissue samples            n   were examined by          immunohistochemistry for the presence of tubulin          isotypes Thin sections from all five samples two normal          and three tumor reacted moderately to strongly with          monoclonal antibodies against tubulin classes II and I           IV Both cellular and stromal staining were observed          Figure shows sections from a tumor sample that had          relatively high levels of tubulin class III levels by          ELISA Fig C T Some staining with antibody against          tubulin class III was also observed mostly as diffuse          background stromal tissue staining Fig C although          occasionally more specific reactivity occurred A          previous examination of five normal and tumor breast          tissues showed similar staining patterns     In that          study antibodies against tubulin classes II and I  IV          also reacted moderately to strongly with cells whereas          tubulin class III was found in stromal cells and rarely          in punctate irregular staining patterns suggesting          cross sections of nerve fibers Tubulin class III in          normal tissues is a highly specific marker for neurons              and we therefore attribute most of the tubulin          class III antibody reactivity in the breast tissues to          the weak stromal reactivity and presence of nerve          fibers                          Quantification of tubulin isotypes in breast          tissues by ELISA          To quantify tubulin isotypes in breast tissue samples           g we developed a sensitive and reliable          indirect ELISA sensitive to levels of  gml tubulin          isotype Fig  The sensitivity of the ELISA assay was          verified by quantitative Western blotting Figs and           These results suggested that tubulin classes II and I           IV are the predominant tubulin isotypes in these tissues          This was verified by immunohistochemistry Fig  which          demonstrated strong specific staining by the antibodies          against tubulin classes II and I  IV In the work          presented here each tissue sample was examined in          duplicate on microtiter plates and triplicate plates          were measured to obtain means and standard deviations for          each isotype Fig  There was no difference in tubulin          isotype levels in normal and tumor tissues The          predominant isotype fraction was tubulin class II             of the total Both tubulin classes III and I           IV were expressed in smaller amounts in all tissues             and    respectively Figures Aand          Bshow tubulin classes I  IV and II plotted as a          percentage of total tubulin excluding tubulin class          III as discussed above showing that in each tissue          sample tubulin class II predominated Figure Cshows          the distribution of tubulin class III Several samples          had relatively high levels of tubulin class III Two of          these N and T were examined by immunohistochemistry          to determine whether the high level of tubulin class          III might be due to upregulation of this isotype in tumor          or normal cells however as discussed above only          stromal staining was observed          The fraction of tubulin class II in tissues varied          from  to  Fig  Figure Ashows the similar          distributions of tubulin class II in both normal and          tumor

varying amounts of          isotypes in these tissue samples suggest that isotype          levels might be correlated with other biomarkers of poor          prognosis                          Correlation of tubulin isotype protein and mRNA          levels          To establish whether tubulin isotype protein levels          could be inferred from mRNA levels we used quantitative          realtime PCR to measure tubulin mRNA levels in          selected breast tissues Table  T N T N T          N T N T N T N N and T Fig           These data show a broad distribution of mRNA content for          all seven tubulin isotype classes The lowest levels          were found for tubulin classes IVa and VI The ranges          of tubulin levels for the other five isotype classes were          similar Although differences between matched tumor and          normal tissues were found there were no correlations          suggesting the upregulation or downregulation of specific          tubulin isotypes in tumor tissues compared with normal          data not shown When the fraction of mRNA for tubulin          classes I  IV II and III were plotted against the          corresponding fraction of protein it became evident that          there is no correlation between tubulin mRNA and protein          levels in these tissues Fig                           Comparison of Herneu and tubulin class II          expression          In an attempt to understand the significance of the          distributions of tubulin classes II and I  IV in          normal and tumor breast tissues we used ELISAs to          quantify the Herneu protein levels in these tissues          Expression of Herneu is amplified in  of all breast          tumors and data suggest that it might be a negative          prognostic indicator     Figure Ashows the levels          of Herneu protein normalized for total protein in tumor          and normal tissues Higher Herneu levels were found in          all tumor tissues compared with normal tissues This          result verifies the pathology reports Table  that          describe the tumor samples as tumors Note that one          normal tissue N was shown to have relatively high          levels of Herneu protein However an independent          pathology report on this tissue sample indicated a          significant number of tumor cells throughout the entire          breast tissue even though the normal sample was          excised at a site distant from the tumor          The increase of Herneu protein in tumor tissues          compared with normal tissues is shown in Fig Bto be          from fold to more than fold The inset in Fig          Acompares Herneu protein levels in a breast cancer          cell line that overexpresses Herneu with one that does          not The increase in the Herneu overexpressing cells is          more than fold We infer from these data that the          breast tumor tissues approaching this level of Herneu          expression would have significantly increased Herneu          levels Plots of Herneu protein Fig A or fold          increase in Herneu protein Fig B against tubulin          class II fraction demonstrate no significant correlation          There is therefore no relationship between tubulin          isotype levels and Herneu protein expression                            Discussion                  Tubulin class II predominates in breast          tissues          This is the first quantitative comparison of tubulin          isotype protein levels in human tissues Previous work          has indicated that vertebrate tissues vary in their          tubulin isotype composition Tubulin class II          predominates in brain tissues and has been found in          smaller amounts in other tissues      Classes III          and IVa are primarily found in neurons whereas classes I          and IVb are found in many tissues      Tubulin          class V is present in small amounts in many cell types             and class VI is found in blood cells and          hematopoietic tissues      Much of this          quantitative work was done by comparing mRNA levels          However mRNA and protein levels are not correlated for          many human and yeast proteins especially those that are          regulated by posttranscriptional processes                although there is controversy regarding correct          statistical analysis and interpretation of some of these          data     Intracellular tubulin levels are under both          transcriptional and posttranscriptional control          Finetuning of tubulin levels during the cell cycle          occurs by autoregulation This process alters mRNA          stability and requires both an essential sequence on          polysomal tubulin mRNA and an aminoterminal          MetArgGluIle sequence on the nascent tubulin          polypeptide       Furthermore tubulin mRNA          levels remain high even when protein synthesis is          repressed     In fact tubulin synthesis in CHO          cells seems to have a role in regulating tubulin          protein levels          This phenomenon of tubulin posttranscriptional          autoregulation was demonstrated in a wide variety of          vertebrate and invertebrate cell types It suggests that          individual tubulin isotype protein levels are all          similarly regulated although this has not been          demonstrated Because the total amount of intracellular          tubulin depends on both mRNA stability and protein          halflife these data together indicate that high levels          of tubulin mRNA might be associated with low levels of          free tubulin subunits This is supported by the recent          mass spectrometry and isoelectric focusing work that          demonstrated a lack of correlation between tubulin          isotype protein levels and mRNA levels in          paclitaxelresistant cell lines     However tubulin          mRNA levels are currently interpreted by most          investigators as directly representing the total          intracellular tubulin protein pool One alternative to          mRNA quantification is immunostaining Although          immunostaining of cells is useful for localizing proteins          in tissues and cells accurate quantification by this          method is difficult     Nevertheless quantitative          measurement of protein levels is crucial for          understanding intracellular events In our studies          quantitative realtime PCR data from selected breast          tissue samples revealed that tubulin mRNA and protein          levels are not correlated These results indicate that          quantitative studies of tubulin isotypes that are done          exclusively with PCR techniques should be interpreted          with caution because functional protein levels cannot be          inferred          Consistent with our results is the finding of both          tubulin classes I and II by immunostaining in many          human tissues and cell types     To understand the          relationship between the drug target levels and the          development of drug resistance it is essential to know          the actual protein amounts in tissues and cells We          demonstrate here by a quantitative ELISA assay that the          tubulin class II protein is on average the most          abundant isotype in human breast tissues We found a          distribution of tubulin class II levels ranging from           to  This wide distribution was not expected          because our study of tubulin isotypes in pig brains          showed very little braintobrain variation To evaluate          the significance of the distribution of tubulin classes          II and I  IV in breast tissues we measured the tissue          levels of Herneu protein known to be amplified in           of all breast tumors and associated with poor prognosis              All tumor tissues expressed higher levels of          Herneu relative to normal tissues However there was          no correlation between this biomarker and levels of          tubulin classes II or I  IV isotype levels Thus the          significance of the range of isotype levels in breast          tissues remains unknown Although it is possible that          tubulin class II levels might be correlated with a          prognostic biomarker not yet examined     these          results suggest that a normal patienttopatient          variation might exist          The ELISA method described here involves total          extraction of tubulin and does not differentiate between          polymerizable and nonpolymerizable tubulin fractions          There are reports of tubulin isotypes that are          differentially incorporated into microtubule structures              However it is not possible to fractionate          microtubules from total cytoplasmic tubulin with          quickfrozen human tissue samples Current experiments          are exploring this aspect of tubulin isotype utilization          in cell culture studies One complexity in our work is          the sampling of breast tissue It is possible that          samples are composed of different amounts of          heterogeneous cell types However because our data show          similar isotype amounts in normal and tumor breast          tissues differential tissue sampling seems not to be an          issue in these experiments Our method is based in part          on an ELISA assay developed by Thrower and colleagues             for tubulin extracts This work fulfills their          suggestion to quantify changes in tubulin isotype levels          with the appropriate antibodies and establishes a          sensitive and accurate assay to complement mRNA assays          and studies of the response of cultured cells to          antimitotic drugs          The patient diagnoses for these tumor samples were          most commonly infiltrating ductal carcinoma  of           samples We found no correlations between tubulin          isotype levels and any of the variables given in the          pathology reports estrogen receptor progesterone          receptor age race or histology grade It should be          noted that the normal breast tissues examined in this          study were excised from a site distal to the tumor site          but in the same breast Histological examination of the          normal tissues indicates the presence of fibrocystic          changes in many of the samples and therefore although          these changes are not uncommon in normal aging they          cannot be classified as truly normal breast tissue          However independent pathology reports determined that          the normal tissues were nontumor tissues with the          exception of N N and N in which tumor cells were          noted N and N were estimated to contain more than           tumor cells N however had tumor cells throughout the          breast tissue and therefore although the normal sample          was taken distal to the tumor it contained significant          numbers of tumor cells N was also shown in our ELISA          studies to have relatively high levels of Herneu          protein Thus the Herneu ELISAs provided a second          means of grossly differentiating between tumor and          normal tissues for these patients          It is important to note that many tumor tissues do not          express Herneu it is therefore not a generally useful          marker for differentiating between tumor and normal          tissues In addition our work demonstrates that although          tubulin class III is a marker for aggressive          neuroendocrine tumors      it is not a significant          biomarker in breast tumors We speculate that this is          because breast tissue rarely dysregulates to          neuroendocrine cell types                          Tumor and normal breast tissues have similar          tubulin isotype levels          Over the past decade paclitaxel and docetaxel have          become important chemotherapeutic agents for both ovarian          and breast cancers      Considerable interest has          focused on the target receptor  tubulin  and mechanisms          underlying efficacy toxicity and drug resistance                   Whether tubulin isotype levels might          determine cellular responses to antimitotic agents          remains controversial For example paclitaxelresistant          lung cancer cells and ovarian tumors were shown to have          increased levels of tubulin isotypes particularly          tubulin classes III and IVa     Furthermore when          paclitaxelresistant lung cancer cells were treated with          antisense oligonucleotides for tubulin class III the          drug resistance was partly reversed coincident with          decreased protein levels of tubulin class III              However it should be noted that tubulin classes I II          III and IVa all increased significantly in          paclitaxelresistant lung cancer cells indicating that          the drug effect did not uniquely involve a single tubulin          isotype In other work tubulin classes III and IVa          were shown to increase in paclitaxelresistant prostate          cancer cells     However these two isotypes          continued to be expressed in the lowest amounts          In ovarian cancer cells mutations in residues near          the putative paclitaxelbinding site of tubulin class I          were found in paclitaxelresistant ovarian cancer cells              Other work suggests that changes in tubulin          isotypes alone cannot confer resistance to antimitotics          It was demonstrated that one group of antimitotic agents          vinca alkaloids bind with similar affinity to all          tubulin isotypes     thus suggesting for therapy          with vinorelbine vinblastine or vincristine that          tubulin isotype levels are incidental for efficacy          Furthermore transfection of CHO cells with tubulin          classes I II or IVb did not produce resistance to          paclitaxel     The alternative hypothesis derived          from the work of Cabral and colleagues is that rather          than the tubulin isotype levels the amount of          polymerized tubulin is the critical factor that regulates          response to antimitotic drugs For example total amounts          of polymerizable tubulin are decreased in          paclitaxelresistant cells whereas colcemidresistant          tubulin or vinca alkaloidresistant cells have increased          levels of assembled tubulin       Furthermore          when cells were transfected with tubulin class III          weak resistance to paclitaxel was found and this          resistance was associated with decreased microtubule          stability     This is consistent with the different          modes of action of these drugs paclitaxel stabilizes          microtubules and colcemid inhibits tubulin assembly In          support of this hypothesis tubulin mutations consistent          with altered assembly properties have been identified in          paclitaxelresistant and vinca alkaloidresistant cells                                           Conclusion        We demonstrate that normal and tumor breast tissues        before chemotherapy or radiation treatment have broad        distributions of tubulin isotypes Furthermore  class        II tubulin predominates in most breast tissues The        tubulin isotype levels in normal and tumor tissue are not        significantly different and are therefore unlikely to        contribute to differential responses of tumors to        antimitotic agents The initial drug sensitivity might        depend upon the levels of polymerized tubulin in normal        versus tumor tissues associated with the differential        expression of MAPs and dynamics regulators such as stathmin            a hypothesis currently being explored in our        laboratory The work presented here describes untreated        tumors and should be useful for comparison with        paclitaxeltreated tumors as a basis for evaluating tubulin        isotype levels in response to therapy or in the development        of drug resistance                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        BCIP  bromochloroindolyl phosphate cDNA
