                 i have trouble uh coming up with things that actually ive considered invasion of privacy and perhaps its because ive become so accustomed to the fact that thats the way technology works   life is yeah well you know theres something that um i really find kind of maybe its not an invasion of privacy but its kind of annoying     whats that   um you know phone calls uh automated   oh gosh yes yes   you know i mean i i find that really offencing or offensive   i suppose that its an invasion in that they know where you are and and   yeah and they dont stop i mean they you know you call and it   it could be any time of the day and and what happens is is theyll call especially especially those computer ones   uhhuh uhhuh   theyll call and and they dont you cant get them off the line youll hang up and you pick it up a minute later and theyll still be on there   oh seriously ive never had that experience   yes i just had you know that just happened a couple day of i guess its kind of fresh in my mind because this happened a couple of days ago id picked up the phone and its you know they started talking giving me all this spiel and then you know you try to hang up because theres theres nobody to talk to theres only just um   that seems unusual     and you hang up and then you pick up to make a phone theyre still on there   you know that almost seems dangerous because what if you picked up the phone to call nine one one or something and you   i know i know that is   i wonder if that was a problem in their system that doesnt seem like it should work that way   yeah but uh as far as privacy uh invasion of privacy i there really you know i guess im kind of like you i dont really find it   haunting you   there isnt a whole lot that i feel like its a invasion of privacy of privacy um   i used to be concerned that everyone no matter what the creditor always wanted to know your social security number but then i figured well theyre   oh i know   they all have to link it back to some number that that only you have and so   yeah   everyone in the world that ive you know dealt with on a commercial basis probably has that number and thats just the way it is   yeah well the i guess you know theres um   they have access to all your records   i i guess i dont think about that very often because it it has become the norm you know um   umhum umhum if you wanna use credit you have to pay the price and thats   yeah and you they find everything i mean they find out everything about you they want to know your you know  where you live what you do what you know and some of the questions yeah and some of the   umhum thats probably why you have gotten those calls because they know that youre one of those people who um are in a i dont know income bracket or something but who has disposable income  thats why theyre after you   uhhuh yes you know sometimes that does happen you know sometimes they they would you know somebody would call on the phone and and uh you know you think its just uh regular type questions but really they are kind of prying into your to your life you know you   umhum   they wanna know uh where you live how long you been living there   do you own do you rent   do you own do you rent you know what time of the days theyre usually home what uh you know and sometimes you know you just kind of go through the routine of giving it out and then you think about it afterwards   uhhuh   why do they need all that you know   yeah i generally dont you know when you buy a new product how the um warranty card always asks your level of income   yes   and it usually says optional so i i rarely fill it i i dont think i ever fill it out frankly  but uh they they wanna know they  would like to come back and   uhhuh right oh yeah oh yeah   see whether or not youre gonna buy another product   yep   interesting   but um   thats how marketing works today i think   i guess it is im im in that area so its uh   are you   well im yeah im in sales so i   uhhuh   you always kind of uh you know it i know that when we when i sell a product to a new customer thats always the first thing that i ask you know is about their credit and you know would they have to fill out a little credit application with with us and and sometimes i feel very uncomfortable in in doing that   umhum umhum really huh   um  you know but i know that in order for our company to survive we cant you know uh   oh yeah you dont wanna take risks   dont wanna take the risks so   umhum   um i i suppose some of those uh   do you personally look at those credit uh references or is there someone else who does that   you know thats thats the funniest thing is be rare i mean maybe one out of ten do we check on it yeah you know but its kind of a routine type thing where you just do it and and you file it away and uh   someone else in your company does that umhum   you know at random well well go ahead and check on it but um its not   umhum oh really so there isnt someone who every time does it just not you   no huhuh   hm   so you know i just gather the information and and somebody else uh you know at their leisure time uh will check on those credit references but   but most of them are checked on routinely just by someone else   yeah most of them are yeah most of them are but theyre not all you know theyre not all done at the same time   uhhuh uhhuh that makes sense   and um you know i i wonder about credit uh
