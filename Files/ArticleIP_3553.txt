thinking ahead imagined it to be aoneshot and now know it is not beneficial for him in the long run Noneed to go into the national scandal of schools going academically easy ontheir athletes and graduating dumb people            Prudieforesees a potential fight and then you will have to evaluate the young mansvalues and intellect in relation to your own As one of Prudies friends saysmazel ton  tons of luck            Prudie studiously                                             DearPrudie                                                      I need advice A woman ofmy acquaintance recently announced that she has a boyfriend and wantseveryone to introduce the fellow by that title It seems to me that when youvereached the stage of life where your children are eligible for AARP all yourgrandchildren are married and some of your greatgrandchildren have their ownWeb sites you should find a term other than boyfriend for the guy with whomyoure hooking up hanging out going steady or whatever                                       Atsocial occasions such as my sons upcoming bar mitzvah I would be reluctant tosay Id like you to meet my grandmother and her boyfriend It just soundswrong Can you suggest an alternative term                                       Neologistically Needyin New Jersey                        DearNeo            Personally Prudie is notwild about boyfriend and girlfriend for people over  and sheloathes the term lover except when used by European women            Prudie may be a tad retrobut the terms beau lady friend or beloved seem about right forgrownups Then of course you could always use the chaps name This is mygrandmothers friend Mr Schwartz            Would youfeel very unhappy with Prudie if she mentioned that a married personsgrandmother referring to her boyfriend is rather sweet consideringeveryones ages            Prudieeuphemistically                                             DearPrudence                                                      I amoverly stressed by finals and the question haunts me When will the insanitystop Teachers are asking more of students every year and its coming to thepoint where the average kid has to go to college for four years just to flipburgers I am asking you Why is everything so hard nowmore so than  yearsago                                       Pete Fiala                        DearPete            Prudie isnt sure how tosquare your complaints with all the news stories about grade inflation andcollegelevel courses such as The Structure of the Soap Opera and TheHistory of Beads            It ispossible you are not in a college suited to your needs If its any comfortPrudie cannot imagine how she got through her own university years andsympathizes about the increasing need for degrees just to get a foot in anydoor            Prudieempathetically                                             DearPrudie                                                      You counseled Holding a Secretin Toronto that she had a civic duty to report her old boyfriend for taxfraud I cant say about Canadians but we in the United States have no suchduty                                       A small informal pollindicated that we would voluntarily yield  percent of our income togovernment Anything beyond that is not voluntary A Readers Digestpoll indicates that the most anyone at least anyone in a family of fourshould have to pay is  percent                                       I believe the currentlevel of taxation is illegitimate because it is done without the consent of thegoverned Prudie even if you personally dont agree that we are at the pointwhere noncooperation is a virtue wont you admit that at some level oftaxation noncooperation with the Internal Revenue Service would become acivic duty                                       During the Vietnam Warsome conscientious objectors believed they were acting for the good of thecountry and did so at great personal risk Perhaps tax resisters should beviewed with the same mix of emotions that we viewed conscientiousobjectors                                       Prudiecan I get you to withdraw your blanket statement that we have a civic duty toreport tax evaders                                       Charles Clack                        DearCharles            Prudies reply to her Torontocorrespondent did not say that tax evaders must always be reported but shewonders why you wish the Readers Digest respondents made up CongressWhile no one really likes forking over taxes that money pays for amultitude of government services and functions Which ones should beeliminated Whatever their true merits widely unpopular items such as foreignaid make up only a tiny percentage of the federal budget            Taxes areof course a complicated issue What is proper and what is enough The conceptof a fiscal citizens arrest tattling on tax fraud is subject to manyconsiderations What you call noncooperation with the IRS is called taxevasion by the feds and is punishable by jail time Just as those whoprotested the Vietnam War paid various prices it would seem logical that taxprotesters make a similar determination Gandhi would be the perfect person toconsult about civil disobedience as it pertains to taxes but alas it isimpossible to contact him
