               okay   well do you exercise regularly   there is well i am a school teacher and uh there uh uh girl that went through our school district i teach in Highland Park who uh   uhhuh uhhuh   who uh does aerobics at uh the YMCA and i say Y them YWCA  turn that off please i am recording   umhum   my husband just turned on something noisy anyway uh she comes to the school and there are a group of teachers and we exercise regularly and for an hour and we do it twice a week   hm umhum oh thats good   and uh we do uh aerobics for cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes and then we do stretching and toning and cool down   uhhuh umhum   for another thirty minutes so it is an hour and then my husband and i take uh two mile walks uh as often as possible and uh not on the nights that i do aerobics but if if he wants to he jogs but i uh   umhum   i we take the fast walks and we walk a couple of miles and come back to the house   uhhuh   and so we we take it seriously we enjoy doing it i enjoy my group at school its a lot more fun to exercise with somebody than it is to do it by yourself   well thats good yeah yeah uhhuh   well i use to exercise regularly and i havent lately  i have goofed off i guess um i use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work but um   oh oh oh umhum   i guess my job change my husbands job change and its just not easy to get up early in the morning any more so um   oh i understand that ive never been able to do it before   no  well the problem is that i am so tired at the end of the day i just wanna go home and not do anything so yeah   umhum well i am too i just make myself i get up at five thirty and i am at school at seven thirty and  school isnt over until uh four   well umhum   and our class but its in the building that is the big difference because   oh     there are other people around said uh youd better hurry go get dressed you know there is motivation around there and then uh we can we can change right there in the building i dont have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere   uhhuh  yeah   and i just go and we all exercise and until then you know i have belonged to exercise clubs and oh ive gone to uh  oh like um       oh these gyms you know that that like in Plano or Richardson or and uh where they offer the   umhum   uh rec centers really where they offer aerobics and ive done that before but it always had to be late at night   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   after ive got home and after dinner and you are just kind of going ugh       and i have tried it immediately after school like try to get some place and exercise from five to six but then by the time you get home and you fix dinner you are eating so late   thats right thats right thats difficult really is   it is its really hard with our life style when you work um   umhum yeah i know well i know some people go during lunch but you know by the time i i get over the gym and       and go to my class and shower and get back to work its probably two hours or more and thats just too long so   umhum i have twenty five minutes for lunch   yeah  yeah that doesnt really do it does it  yeah   thats out for me no i dont think so but uh and theyre nice because if we are running late it usually uh if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late they kind of wait on us you know because they know we are in the building and coming   umhum yeah well that good   whereas and uh another place you are paying a lot more money and uh it it theyre gonna to start whether you are there or not i mean you know   thats right thats right   so this has worked out real nicely in fact she charges us two dollars a session   well thats not much   humum so its its we like pay her for six weeks at a time because that is like a unit in uh uh school uh you know report card period and so it is like twenty four dollars every six weeks   uhhuh uhhuh oh thats not bad   humum   it beats memberships at some of these clubs thats for sure  they are real expensive   youre not kidding i know we belonged um  for a period of time to the Signature Club for about a year   uhhuh   i mean we were paying a hundred dollars plus a month for our family membership and at first we used it and then it got where we werent beginning to get out moneys worth   oh gosh yeah   and they offered lots of things but we werent taking advantage of them because we didnt have the time to so we decided to forget that that was just a waste of our our money   yeah uhhuh yeah yeah well we have one through work and its its probably about a hundred and fifty dollars a year which isnt bad   oh no humum   but i uh i dont know i still just dont dont end up going because there isnt at a convenient time or i dont know something   umhum   but i need to do something if only walk the dog or something i need to start doing that   umhum it does make you feel better and the hard thing is getting going   yeah thats right thats right   and if you have somebody who will do it with you like for a long time my husband didnt want to walk because he wants to run uh jog   uhhuh   but he decided that uh maybe you know uh if i was you know would be willing to walk
