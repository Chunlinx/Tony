                                 Groping Toward a New Liberalism            With our reaction to theMonica Lewinsky episode we Americans have turned the concept of hypocrisy onits head The French philosopher Franois La Rochefoucauld famously praisedhypocrisy as the socially useful homage that vice pays to virtue That ofcourse is very French In the United States however it seems that virtuepays homage to vice Have we thought through the implications            Americansin large numbers tell pollsters that we disapprove of adultery regularlyattend church and would like to see the return of prayer to schools We claimnostalgia for  th century moral standards and propel the Book ofVirtues to the top of the bestseller list Yet almost  percent of usaccording to a New York Times CBS poll last week not only dont thinkits our business whether President Clinton had sex with Monica Lewinsky butalso would understand if he had lied about it even under oath            Until now it has been assumed that the leader of anegalitarian society should at least in aspiration be betternot just smarterand braver but more noblethan other citizens Now we seem to be engaged in arapid rewind of the morality tape zipping right through the age of Victoria tothe time when the rules of droit du seigneur held sway Then thepeasants and bourgeoisie were expected to live lives of probity while the kingand his court whored and plundered as they pleased            Can thisreally be us tugging our forelocks and mumbling Thats OK boss you goahead and have a good time well just wait out here in the hall and say a fewprayers No thats not us Far more likely is that we still regard thepresident as a role modelits just that like him we prefer his new role Wewish we had the protective coterie of governmentpaid procurers and concealersthat would let us get away with it            That being so serious rethinking is in orderbefore we invest further in public activities incongruent with the newdispensation Some corrections are easy and obvious Send prosecutor Starr offto Pepperdine and let him take all his pokings into S  L swindles and FBIfile invasions and electionfund finagling with him Nobody cares about thatother stuff either For a successful politician thats just doin what comesnatcherly            And letsquit picking on poor Army Sgt Maj Gene McKinney If its OK for the commanderin chief to hit on women in the office why should we prosecute a man so muchfarther down the military chain of command Sure his satisfiedcustomer ratioseems to have been lower than Clintons but is that any reason to put a man atrisk of a lifetime in jail Let copulation thrive as King Lear would say Andas the century ends let us grope our way toward a new liberalism            Other changes in federal policy are needed urgently tosupport the implicit goals of the New Awakening For example we must obviouslyrestore Welfare as We Knew It Here after all was a program Aid to Familieswith Dependent Children that judged by current lights must be rated one ofthe most successful social experiments of all time When AFDC rolls beganclimbing in the late s fewer than  percent of American children wereborn out of wedlock By the time the welfare rolls peaked in  that figurehad risen to a gratifying  percent            To besure illegitimacy is not a perfect proxy for indiscriminatepromiscuityalthough other indicators venerealdisease incidence divorcerates etc track well with it Nor can AFDC take all the credit OtherprogramsMedicaid Food Stamps housing aid special feeding and educationalprograms for unwed teens and so oncertainly provided additional inducementsfor unguarded sexuality Some people eg our president manage topromiscuate pretty indiscriminately without the incentive of food stampsjustas some minority citizens manage to get ahead without affirmative action Butan extra incentive from the government surely helps            And yet even now in a misguided appeal to apublic that misunderstands its own core beliefs President Clinton is presidingover the dismantling of this forwardlooking program Welfare mothers are beingpushed into the work force whence they will stagger home each night lackingthe energy for romantic exploration Young men are being told to takeresponsibility for their sexual behavior and should they slip pay up on childsupport This threatens to undermine all President Clintons good work insending the message that one should get it whenever and however one can            Oh and lets cut out allthis huffing and puffing about Saddam Hussein Hes got oil to sell and wevegot gas guzzlers to keep rolling Anyway by now he has surely squirreled awayall that anthrax and poison gas where well never find it with bombs orinspectors Keeping all those planes ships and troops on alert is expensiveIt uses up money that would be much better spent onwell tax cuts for all ofus And while were at it isnt it time to jettison all this analretentivepreoccupation with a balanced budget Is paying for what we get really theessential us  Listen instead to the subtext of the presidents recentacclaimed State of the Union message More spending More tax cuts Thissurely is where the Clinton sex policy and the Clinton social policy combineHe wants us to feel his pleasure And we do
