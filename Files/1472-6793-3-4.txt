                    Background        Chronically elevated cortisol levels caused by Cushings        syndrome leads to central obesity    while the reduction        of cortisol caused by Addisons disease leads to decreased        body weight     Obesity in several rodent models is        also associated with elevated corticosterone levels and        adrenalectomy reverses some of the phenotypes associated        with these forms of obesity         Furthermore        elevated corticosterone production can cause a metabolic        syndrome     These data suggest that reduction of        glucocorticoid production might therefore constitute a        plausible clinical strategy to treat obesity On the other        hand obesity in humans does not generally entail elevated        plasma cortisol        and it is not clear how        effective reduction of glucocorticoid production would be        to reverse obesity if glucocorticoid production were        otherwise normal Nevertheless pharmacological antagonism        of glucocorticoid type II receptor by mifepristone        RU was reported to reverse high fat dietinduced        obesity     Since dietinduced obesity does not entail        elevated glucocorticoid levels       this result        suggests that reduction of glucocorticoid levels would        reverse obesity even when glucocorticoid levels are not        elevated        Although the mechanisms through which adrenalectomy acts        to reverse obesity is not entirely clear it is plausible        that the mechanisms entail enhanced hypothalamic POMC        production     Hypothalamic POMC mRNA is reduced in        several forms of obesity       Conversely        reversal of obese phenotypes by adrenalectomy is associated        with a restoration of hypothalamic POMC mRNA tone in        leptindeficient         obob mice     Furthermore the        melanocortin agonist MTII which mimics the key        antiobesity product of POMC alphaMSH reduces body        weight in dietinduced obesity     On the other hand        the effect of dietinduced obesity on hypothalamic POMC        mRNA is somewhat complex and may depend on the genetic        background      and duration of the diet            or composition    of the diet Furthermore the effect        of adrenalectomy on hypothalamic POMC mRNA may also depend        genetic background       Nevertheless we        hypothesized that if adrenalectomy enhanced hypothalamic        POMC mRNA in dietinduced obesity in mice as in        leptindeficient mice adrenalectomy would also reverse        obese phenotypes in mice that became obese due to a        highfat diet In the present study we observed that        adrenalectomy did indeed lead to a remarkable enhancement        of hypothalamic POMC mRNA tone in mice made obese on a        highfat diet surprisingly however adrenalectomy did not        reverse dietinduced obesity                    Results                  Effects diet and adrenalectomy on body weight          adipose weight and caloric intake          Prior to adrenalectomy mice on the highfat diet          gained body weight about fivefold more rapidly than          chowfed mice in the first seven days on the highfat          diet chow fed mice gained    g compared to          highfat diet mice which gained    g over the          first seven days on the diet p  At the end of          the five week period mice on the highfat diet both          shamoperated and adrenalectomized exhibited a          significant elevation of both body weight Fig A and          adipose weight Fig B compared to the chow fed mice          both shamoperated and adrenalectomized Although          adrenalectomy initially caused a greater loss of body          weight in the dietinduced obese mice high fatdiet          shamoperated mice lost    g seven days after          surgery compared to diet adrenalectomized mice who lost             g p   by two weeks after the surgery          body weight in both groups had fully recovered body          weight to presurgery levels In the shamoperated mice          mass of food intake was significantly decreased in mice          on the high fat diet compared to the chowfed mice Fig          C Although the dietinduced obese mice consumed more          calculated calories than chowfed mice during the first          week on the diet during which the most rapid weight gain          was observed by the fifth week they were hypophagic          both in terms of mass of food consumed gday and in          calculated calories consumed caloriesday the chow          shamoperated mice consumed    calculated          calday compared to    calday for the diet          shamoperated mice p            Surprisingly adrenalectomy had no effect on body          weight Fig A adipose weight Fig B or food intake          Fig C for mice on either the chow diet or the high          fat diet five weeks after initiation of the diet and          three weeks after adrenalectomy                          Effects of diet and adrenalectomy on serum          hormones glucose tolerance and metabolic rate          Serum leptin was elevated in mice on the highfat          diet concordant with the development of obesity but          adrenalectomy had no effect on leptin levels Table I          Neither insulin nor glucose was significantly influenced          by either diet or adrenalectomy Table I The high fat          diet had no effect on serum corticosterone but as          expected adrenalectomy reduced serum corticosterone by          over  in mice on both diets Table I While this          effect was significant consistent with previous studies              adrenalectomy did not eliminate detectable          corticosterone completely          Glucose tolerance was strikingly impaired after only          one week on the high fat diet Fig  p            Adrenalectomy slightly but significantly improved glucose          tolerance on the high fat diet Fig  p            Total heat production not normalized to body weight was          significantly elevated by the high fat diet Fig A p            and adrenalectomy led to a slight but          statistical further increase in heat production in the          dietinduced obese mice Fib B p   VO            oxygen consumption normalized to          body weight was reduced in mice on the high fat diet          Fig A p   and as with total heat          production adrenalectomy slightly but statistically          increased VO            in the dietinduced obese mice group          Fig B p   Therefore adrenalectomy led to a          slight but statistical increase in metabolic rate as well          as glucose tolerance in the dietinduced mice                          Effects of diet and adrenalectomy on pituitary POMC          mRNA          Although diet did not influence pituitary POMC mRNA          adrenalectomy increased pituitary POMC expression in mice          on both diets Table I Together with the reduction in          serum corticosterone this induction of pituitary POMC          indicates that the adrenalectomy produced a          physiologically significant reduction in corticosterone          tone                          Effects of diet and adrenalectomy on hypothalamic          POMC mRNA          The highfat diet led to a slight but significant          increase in hypothalamic POMC mRNA in shamoperated mice          Figure A Adrenalectomy produced a nonsignificant          trend toward an increase in hypothalamic POMC mRNA in          shamoperated mice but a fold induction of POMC mRNA          in mice on the highfat diet Fig A The highfat diet          did not significantly influence hypothalamic AGRP in this          study but surprisingly adrenalectomy slightly stimulated          hypothalamic AGPR mRNA levels Fig B                            Discussion        The high fat diet used in this study led to the        development of obesity over the course of five weeks as        expected Fig A As observed in leptindeficient         obob mice adrenalectomy in        dietinduced obese mice led to a striking increase in        hypothalamic POMC mRNA Fig A This elevation in        hypothalamic POMC with only a very modest increase in the        antagonist AGRP mRNA Fig B would be expected to lead to        significant amelioration of obese phenotypes consistent        with effects of adrenalectomy on other forms of obesity                Indeed adrenalectomy initially led to a greater        loss of body weight after surgery in the dietinduced obese        mice results in text above Surprisingly however        adrenalectomized mice regained all the weight lost after        surgery Fig A and adrenalectomy also failed to reduce        food intake adipose weight or plasma leptin in the obese        mice        As has been observed in other models of obesity due to a        highfat diet the dietinduced obese mice also became        hypophagic compared to the chow fed mice and compared to        the hyperphagia exhibited by mice in the first two weeks on        a high fat diet    Fig C The hypophagia of        dietinduced obesity may be related to the modestly        elevated hypothalamic POMC whose product alphaMSH is a        known anorexic agent      In turn the induction of        hypothalamic POMC by the highfat diet might have been due        in part to the elevation of leptin in dietinduced obese        mice Table I The further elevation in POMC expression        observed after adrenalectomy of the obese mice could        plausibly be due to elevated leptin combined with decreased        glucocorticoids since glucocorticoids may antagonize the        effects leptin            Tolerance to a glucose load was also impaired in mice        after one week on the highfat diet suggesting the        development of insulin resistance Fig  However        neither basal blood glucose nor serum insulin levels were        elevated by the high fat diet at this time point Table I        We have observed in other studies that basal        hyperinsulinemia is not detected until mice have been on        the highfat diet for at least two months unpublished        observations Adrenalectomy led to only minor improvement        in impaired glucose tolerance Fig  and it did not        affect blood glucose or serum insulin levels Table I        The key observation concerning food intake was that        adrenalectomy did not significantly influence food intake        on either diet Mice on the highfat diet ate less than the        mice on the chow diet both in terms of mass consumed and        surprisingly in terms of total calculated caloric intake        Fig C Since caloric intake was calculated without        normalization to body weight for purposes of analyzing        metabolic economy the most valid comparison of total        caloric intake is to total caloric expenditure total heat        production without normalization to body weight as shown        in Figure  Although the effect was small the increase on        the highfat diet in total heat production without        normalization to body weight was significant statistical        reliability derived in part from the many repeated        measures once every five minutes for  hours that        measuring metabolic rate entails Similarly the very        small further increase in metabolic rate after        adrenalectomy was significant When metabolic rate was        normalized to body weight expressed as V Figure A        the effect of diet was to reduce this parameter and        adrenalectomy increased very slightly but significantly        caused this measure of metabolic rate normalized for body        mass Figure B The effect of diet on normalized        metabolic rate may be construed as suggesting that the        failure of metabolic rate to scale proportionally to the        increase in body weight on the high fat diet may have        contributed to the maintenance of the obese state        especially since the calculated caloric intake on the high        fat diet was less than on the chow fat diet        The key conclusion to be drawn from the metabolic rate        and food intake data is that effect of adrenalectomy on        metabolic rate was marginal and there was no effect of        adrenalectomy on food intake consistent with the lack of        effect of adrenalectomy on other obese phenotypes        Nevertheless with respect to the mechanism of dietinduced        obesity the present data seem to indicate that the        dietinduced obese mice maintained their obesity despite        apparently decreased caloric intake and increased caloric        expenditure Several explanations might account for this        anomalous result First caloric intake is calculated from        the caloric density as empirically measured and reported by        the manufacturers of the diets it remains possible that        due to differences in these measurements the true        metabolically available calories may differ from these        empirically measured calories If so it remains possible        that the highfat diet may actually include relatively more        metabolically available calories than the chow diet and        thus that the mice on the highfat diet in reality consumed        more metabolically available calories than reflected by        simple calculation of empirically determined caloric        density It is also possible that calories were absorbed        more efficiently on the highfat diet In any case none of        these considerations compromise the basic observation that        adrenalectomy failed to reverse dietinduced obesity        Since adrenalectomy only reduced plasma corticosterone        by about  in the obese mice rather than completely        eliminating the steroid from circulation it remains        possible that even further reduction of corticosterone        would produce an effect on dietinduced obese phenotypes        On the other hand using the same adrenalectomy protocol        that produced a similar reduction but not elimination of        plasma corticosterone levels we observed a remarkable        reversal of obese phenotypes in leptindeficient         obob mice     Furthermore the        reduction of corticosterone by adrenalectomy in the present        study was sufficient to produce elevation of pituitary POMC        mRNA as well as hypothalamic POMC mRNA demonstrating        that the reduced levels were clearly producing        physiological effects Consistent with these results high        fat diet attenuates the effect of adrenalectomy to reverse        obese phenotypes in         obob mice                        Conclusions        Dietinduced obesity led to significant increases in        body weight and adiposity and to the development of glucose        intolerance Adrenalectomy reverses obese phenotypes        including melanocortin tone in mice models of obesity in        which plasma glucocorticoid levels are elevated Consistent        with results in obob mice adrenalectomy did stimulate        hypothalamic POMC mRNA associated with marginal        improvements in glucose tolerance and metabolic rate in        mice made obese by the highfat diet However these        responses to adrenalectomy failed to reduce food intake        body weight adiposity or leptin in mice made obese by the        highfat diet in which the obsese state was not associated        with elevated glucocorticoid levels Thus neither        adrenalectomy nor remarkable enhancement of hypothalamic        POMC mRNA produced significant attenuation of the        dietinduced obese phenotype In contrast to other models        of obesity however dietinduced obesity was not        associated with either elevated glucocorticoid levels or        reduced hypothalamic POMC mRNA These data raise the        possibility that potential antiobesity drugs based on        reducing glucocorticoid tone or elevating melanocortin tone        may have limited efficacy in treating forms of obesity in        which those systems are not perturbed                    Methods                  Animals          The appropriate Institutional Animal Review Board had          approved all studies          Male CBlJ mice were obtained at  months of age          from The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME and were          individually housed with free access to feed and water          under  h lightdark cycle lights on at  h          This age was chosen because body weight is stable at this          age facilitating interpretation of the expected opposing          effects of diet and adrenalectomy The CBlJ strain          was chosen for susceptibility to obesity on a high fat          diet        Mice were placed on either a high          fat diet diet D Research Diets New Brunswick          NJ or regular rodent chow diet diet  Purina          Mills Richmond IN for a total of five weeks during          which time both body weight and food intake was monitored          daily Cages were changed daily and a sieve was used to          measure spilt food The high fat diet  kcalg          consisted of  kcal protein  kcal carbohydrate and           kcal fat while the standard rodent chow diet           kcalg consisted of  kcal protein  kcal          carbohydrate and  kcal fat More specifically the          composition of the high fat diet was per kg casein           mesh  g Lcystine  g maltodextrin   g          sucrose  g cellulose BW  g soybean oil           g lard  g mineral mix  g dicalcium          phosphate  g calcium carbonate  g potassium          citrate  g vitamin mix  g choline bitartrate           g and FDC Blue Dye   g          After one week on their respective diets tolerance to          a glucose load was tested by injection of a glucose          solution  mgg body weight ip monitored for three          hours after injection Previous to the glucose tolerance          test food was removed from the cages for five hours from           to  hours After two weeks on the highfat          diet mice from both chow and highfat diets were either          bilaterally adrenalectomized or shamoperated as          previously described     All mice were then given one          injection of dexamethasone  mgkg body weight ip to          facilitate recovery from the surgery The drinking water          was replaced with normal saline  NaCl to compensate          for the loss of mineralocorticoids Two weeks after the          surgery when all mice had recovered body weight lost due          to the stress from the surgery another glucose tolerance          test was performed and after another week all the mice          were placed into metabolic cages in groups of eight in a          balanced design Metabolic rate was monitored          continuously by indirect calorimetry for  hours as          previously described      Food and water were          freely available in the metabolic cages Briefly air          from each cage was sampled every five minutes and oxygen          and carbon dioxide concentrations from each sample were          measured independently From the change in oxygen VO            was calculated as oxygen consumption          per hour normalized to body weight mlkghour Heat          production was then calculated using the following          formula Heat calhour    VCO            VO              VO             Body weight   Therefore          the parameter VO            is normalized to body weight          whereas heat production is not normalized to body weight          and so reflects total energy expenditure          The mice were sacrificed toward the end of the light          period at the end of the day in the metabolic cages          between  and  h by decapitation after a brief          exposure to carbon dioxide and trunk blood was collected          we have verified in pilot studies that this method of          sacrifice does not increase plasma corticosterone above          levels observed without carbon dioxide exposure Brains          for Northern blot analysis were quickly removed and the          hypothalamus was dissected out frozen on dry ice and          stored at C until use as described previously          Makimura   Mizuno   In addition          the anterior lobe of the pituitary was also removed and          frozen on dry ice and stored at C until use          Epididymal white adipose tissue was also removed weighed          and frozen on dry ice and stored at C until use The          four groups that resulted from this experimental design          was as follows chow shamoperated n chow          adrenalectomized n diet shamoperated n and          diet adrenalectomized n Successful adrenalectomy          was verified by visual inspection at the time of          sacrifice as well as by the induction of pituitary          proopiomelanocortin POMC mRNA levels and the reduction          in serum corticosterone levels

RNA from hypothalamus          estimated by spectrophotometer and verified by gel          electrophoresis was subjected to Northern blot analysis          to measure POMC and AGRP mRNA Three micrograms of total          RNA from anterior pituitary was used to measure pituitary          POMC mRNA Total RNA was denatured in a mixture of          glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide for  hr at C
