                            As the HIV epidemic continues to grow mutations in the virus that confer drug        resistance are becoming increasingly important in the clinical management of patients        worldwide Of all the different virus subtypes A B C D F G H J and K and a        rapidly increasing number of established and emerging recombinant viruses it is subtype B        that predominates in Western Europe the United States and the rest of the industrialized        world Antiretroviral drugs were developed by studying subtype B and most data on the        genetic mechanisms of HIV drug resistance are also from subtype B However worldwide        subtype B is in the minority  of the infected population In Africa for example        where there is broad viral diversity there is a greater spread of subtypes with subtype C        being the most common representing over half of all infections Although it seems that        current drugsdeveloped against subtype B virusare active against nonsubtypeB virus one        critical issue is whether viruses from some subtypes or particular regions are more likely        than others to develop resistance against certain drugs Another crucial issue is to        identify the mutations that confer drug resistance in nonB subtypes Answering these        questions might determine whether initial treatment strategies should be different for        people with nonsubtypeB viruses and also could help decide how patients with        nonsubtypeB virus who fail antiretroviral therapy should be managed        In a paper in this months         PLoS Medicine  Rami Kantor and colleagues from a worldwide collaboration        have looked at the mutations found in  people with nonsubtypeB HIV infections        compared with those in  people with subtype B infections They wanted to answer two        questions first whether the mutations that cause drug resistance in subtype B viruses        also develop in nonsubtypeB viruses exposed to antiretroviral drugs and second whether        novel mutations ie not previously seen in subtype B virus develop in nonsubtypeB        viruses when they fail to respond to antiretroviral drugs What they found was that all of        the  drugresistance mutations that have been known to occur in subtype B also occurred        in at least one nonsubtypeB isolate and most of these mutations were also statistically        associated with antiretroviral treatment in at least one nonB subtype Conversely of the         mutations associated with antiretroviral therapy in at least one nonB subtype  were        also associated with antiretroviral therapy in subtype B isolates        So it appears that few novel mutations are arising in nonsubtypeB viruses exposed to        the current antiretroviral drugs and that the present focus on subtype B mutations for        global surveillance and genotypic assessments of drug resistance is a reasonable approach        However the authors emphasize that differences in the types and patterns of        drugresistance mutations are likely to differ between the subtypes and that larger        numbers of samples and further analyses are needed to exclude the possibility of new andor        rare subtypespecific mutations
