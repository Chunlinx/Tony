            okay   was i supposed to do something   no i had to press one   good uh lets see so uh were we right in the Middle East   sure   should we have been there   uhhuh   did we do what was correct there   i think we should have stayed longer   should we have fought them harder used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that werent used   uh i think what we did was good but i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do   oh you agree with Schwartzkopf who says uh Drive on into Baghdad   yeah i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because its kind of like a civil war going on now And its almost like theyre killing each other off and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all   would that be so bad was there anything there to begin with     well i think i dont think it would be good if we were to completely lose it um   it wasnt ours   well no i just mean that that the world in general   well weve got to talk so its just just as well we argue   yeah Um i dont know i think we should have helped the the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more than rather than just quitting where we did   i agree wouldnt it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country   yes  But i think thats almost impossible next to impossible   yeah so other political things thats going on i heard mister Bush say uh excuse me President Bush say that he uh wanted to improve the highways   oh see i havent really been keeping up with them so i really dont know what he said what did he say about it     oh he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and   uhhuh   turn it into interstates like the rest of the country   we dont have the money for that   but wouldnt it be wonderful   It would be really nice because im kind of tired of driving in pot holes     and back east you all drive at fifty five dont you whats that oh okay um i say back east you all drive at fifty five dont you see out here in the west   im sorry i dropped the phone yeah   a lot of our secondary roads are fifty five   uhhuh   we drive sixty five oh yes well   oh really oh really   i uh last weekend went home to visit my parents my dads in the hospital and uh   uhhuh   between here and west Texas there was probably three and four hours at sixty five miles an hour   oh i didnt realize that   nonstop have you have you ever been out here   no huhuh   how far west have you been   only in Ohio   oh youve never   ive never been past Ohio   youve never seen the great American desert   no huhuh ive never seen anything out i never seen the great ive seen   the Rocky Mountains   ive never seen ive seen pictures of it but   Mountains Yellowstone   ive never been there ive seen pictures i just im a college student and um       im paying for my own education and im i come from a large family and we we were never able to take vacations because theres theres twelve kids in the family so   uh   well my college education uh thirty six worked for Texas Instruments for seventeen or eighteen now   oh my   uh know virtually nothing else uh yeah i got my four year got my BS in General Science     uhhuh   yeah i know its a funny degree uh anyway uh i know nothing other than the west in fact uh   really   yeah   down in east Texas where the companys located theres streams and water and things i dont understand trees and have   uhhuh uhhuh   the gulf and its really interesting so tell me about where you live   uhhuh well um im im originally from Butler and thats about an hour away from where i am now im at Clairon And um its its pretty like windy and hilly   uh how high is the highest elevation   oh i couldnt even tell you   like uh probably   its not like a mountain it wouldnt be like a mountain its uh   three thousand foot   oh i dont even know i have no clue   close to sea level   i would say its closer to sea level   okay uh right here in Colorado Springs where i live   uhhuh   its over six thousand foot   oh well see um   um yes when i lived in Texas every year i had to drive you know i drove every year to the gulf and you know so i could have a feast of fresh seafood   uhhuh   six eight twelve hours away   um   you know just just for fresh i im really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of America   uhhuh   how many hours have you been from home   uh the farthest away from home   yes   probably id say five or six   oh yeah   uhhuh   uh now when i was growing up in the Panhandle of Texas l ook at your map later and see the the town of Amarillo   uhhuh   fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle to just go buy a pair of jeans wed drive an hour   oh my oh my gosh   when i was growing up now things are different and people buy jeans in town but   uhhuh   uh we thought nothing at all of wake up waking up in the morning hopping into your car grabbing fishing poles and driving four hours   oh yes Now see for me thats a long ways     yeah it is i imagine   uhhuh       even well like i im in like a little town right now its smaller than Butler and um Butler Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh So that will give you some idea of where im at and im about   okay okay ill look at my map later   im about two hours north east of Pittsburgh   wow how neat   and uh i mean just this this little town here is basically a college town       the college without the college here this town would be nothing It would be absolutely dead because its completely made up of fast food restaurants and and in the summer when we come uh my fiancees family lives up there we come up here in the summer and its i mean theres just no one around   so are you working your way through college   um well i go home in the summer and i work in the summer and between what i make in the summer and student loans thats how i go to college   well how neat whats your major   finance   finance   uhhuh   well thats interesting   uhhuh   so uh what do you plan to do with it   um well like i said my fiancee   savings and loans uh   no  No no no um my fiancee works down in D C and id actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a something id rather work for a company and um like be their financial advisor or something   oh that would be great that would be neat lets see uh so were all excited in Colorado Springs Apple Computer is coming to town     uhhuh oh really   yes the uh new employer in in the city   uhhuh   so were expecting our local economy to     take a boom a little bit   uh maybe not a boom but uh at least recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still   well well what would be the unemployment rate out there   uh unemployment runs approximately six percent   see thats what it is here too   but now under employment i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent   uhhuh   and the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree   yeah Its even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs   yes it is   i know people they are out of school for two or three years and they have a job that has nothing to do
