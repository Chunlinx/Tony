                    Introduction        In treating patients with severe sepsis physicians are        mainly concerned with biologic physiologic and clinical        outcomes Of those patients who survive to hospital        discharge little is known regarding their physical        functioning ability to conduct activities of daily life        such as walking around psychologic functioning mental        wellbeing and social functioning communication and        relationships with others after sepsis Because quality        of life QoL describes or characterizes what the patient        has experienced as a result of sepsis care it is a useful        and important supplement to traditional physiologic or        biologic measures of health status that is assessments of        effectiveness need to include wider measures of benefits to        patients and particularly those that measure the impact        from the patients point of view A relevant therapeutic        benefit may also be in restoring the patients ability to        function on a daily basis to socialize and to be alert        In fact a longterm focus on QoL in clinical trial        evaluations was among the recommendations of a recent        sepsis international advisory group          This report presents the results of an evaluation of QoL        among sepsis survivors done as part of the phase III        multicenter KyberSept trial To the best of our knowledge        limited information on the effects of sepsis treatment on        QoL has been reported    The report focuses on the        effects of antithrombin AT III therapy related to        physical mental and social functioning of patients who        were randomly assigned to either highdose intravenous        treatment with Kybernin P Aventis Behring Marburg        Germany a plasmaderived AT III concentrate  IU        over  days or placebo during up to  days of follow up        In the trial overall survival tended to favor AT III over        placebo after  days of follow up although the        differences were nominal However the AT III group that        did not receive concomitant heparin exhibited a nominally        statistically significant survival advantage over placebo        at  days of followup The purpose of this investigation        was to establish whether these trends also held for the        subjective effects of AT III in severe sepsis It concludes        that AT III treatment is effective in improving longterm        patient QoL and that future outcome research studies of        severe sepsis should follow up patients throughout their        hospital stay and after discharge                    Method                  Quality of life instruments          There are a number of important conceptual and          methodologic issues in assessing QoL in people who are          critically ill not least of which is the question of how          it should be defined Recent attempts to define QoL have          resulted in the development of a functional definition          that is measurable evaluable over time and readily          applied to patients over a wide range of illness          severity Most attempts incorporate the domains of          physical psychologiccognitive and social functioning          Each of these domains can be measured in two dimensions          objective assessments of functioning or health status          and more subjective perceptions of general health The          patients subjective experience translates that objective          assessment into the actual QoL experienced Thus where          the term QoL is used in the present study it refers to          a composite of objective functional impairment and          subjective perceptions and expectations The instruments          chosen for the study were designed to reflect this          QoL gives information on what medical care has          achieved for the patient but severe sepsis is a          difficult area in which to obtain such information          Normally QoL data should be obtained directly from the          patient Unfortunately patients hospitalized with severe          sepsis may be unable to complete a QoL measure or it may          be too burdensome Rather than lose information on          patients the physician investigator was used as a proxy          respondent          Two instruments were used to cover the objective and          subjective dimensions The objective component in the          study was measured using the Karnofsky performance scale          The Karnofsky scale emphasizes physical performance and          dependency it is a descriptive ordinal scale that          ranges from  good health to  dead Trial          investigators assigned percentages based on physical          performance Table  The Karnofsky scale is designed to          assess independent functioning and appears to have          substantial validity as an indicator of overall physical          status The validity and reliability of the scale have          been shown in several populations              The subjective component of the trial was measured          with multiple items using a visual analog scale   A          visual analog scale is a line with defined endpoints on          which investigators indicate a patients health state          Thus the investigator placed a mark along a  mm line          that best described his or her assessment of the patient          with the domain in question There were six domains          Table  The scales ranged from  worst health status          to  best health status The visual analog scale has          been used in several studies of QoL              Reliability estimates for visual analog scaling items          range from  to    and these estimates          compare favorably with those for other scales                      The six domains of the first visual analog scale and          the Karnofsky score are hereafter referred to as          attributes                          The clinical trial          The KyberSept trial was a large international phase          III clinical trial that enrolled  patients who were          evaluable for efficacy and safety in a randomized          doubleblind placebocontrolled design in order to          determine the role of highdose AT III in patients with          severe sepsis Patients randomly assigned to the AT III          group received a total of  IU plasmaderived ATIII          Kybernin P  administered as a loading dose of  IU          given over  min followed by a continuous infusion of           IUday for  days The study protocol permitted          investigators to prescribe unfractionated or          lowmolecularweight heparin for venous thrombosis          prophylaxis   IUday subcutaneous and heparin          flushes for vascular catheter potency   IUkg body          weight per hour intravenous          In the trial the allcause mortality rate at  days          was almost identical between the placebo group and the          group that received AT III  versus  not          significant At the day time point the AT III group          had a nominally lower mortality than did the placebo          group  versus  Among the  patients in the          trial who did not receive heparin concomitantly there          was a statistically significant difference between the AT          III and placebo groups In this subgroup mortality at           days in the AT III subgroup was  versus  in          the placebo subgroup            P           nominal   A complete          description of that study and results are reported          elsewhere                            Outcomes          The Karnofsky scale and visual analog scales were both          administered by physician investigators when patients          enrolled in the trial referred to as baseline during          the trial at  days  days and  days after          enrollment and at discharge from the hospital if it          occurred other than at one of those three intervals For          example if a patient survived and was discharged at          day there would be four assessments ie baseline and          days   and  The primary outcome was change in          attribute scores until  days after patients were          assigned to either treatment or placebo For this          analysis two patient populations were used The smaller          population was the group remaining in the hospital           days from baseline  the inhospital survivors The          larger population comprised all survivors at  days or          at the time point closest to  days This group is          labeled the allsurvivors group It includes the          inhospital group In cases in which there was no patient          response at  days because they had been discharged the          data from the last assessment but before  days were          used This method is equivalent to using the last          observation carried forward          The last observation carried forward method uses the          last observed value for that case and it therefore          assumes that the outcome remains constant at the last          observed value after discharge Otherwise stated it is          assumed that QoL in sepsis patients is stable on average          for the short time period between discharge and  days          It is not possible to conclude firmly that the change in          QoL between discharge and  days was small and unbiased          However the fact that the hospital discharge curve          between AT III and placebo was almost identical provides          evidence that the comparison between treatment groups          should be unbiased Moreover the physician investigator          the patient and the family were blinded to the treatment          assignment placebo versus AT III throughout the          duration of the clinical trial          The secondary outcome was change in the attribute          scores at   and  days after assignment to          treatment or placebo That outcome measure was used in          order to compare relative changes between AT III and          placebo groups at the day day and day          assessments                          Analysis                      Patient characteristics            Mean standard deviation and range values for age            and percentages for relevant patient characteristics            at enrollment and administration of heparin are            reported The overall trial population is presented as            well as the allsurvivors and the inhospital survivors            groups The other variables used were Simplified Acute            Physiology Score SAPS II   a measure of severity            of illness admitting diagnosis and concomitant use            of heparin In the SAPS II system a scoretorisk            transformation developed by Le Gall             et al    for sepsis patients            was used The risk intervals were identical to the SAPS            II strata defined in the trial                                Changes in quality of life between baseline and             days            For both the inhospital survivors and the            allsurvivors groups mean changes and standard            deviations between baseline and  days are shown            Differences in QoL between AT III and placebo were            estimated for each attribute Twosample Wilcoxon            statistical tests were used to determine whether the            changes were different between treatment groups                                Differences among patient subgroups            Similarly Wilcoxon tests were used to identify            whether changes in the QoL scores differed for            subgroups between baseline and  days This analysis            was done on the allsurvivors population                                Changes in quality of life between baseline and              and  days            For the allsurvivors and inhospital survivors            subgroups comparative differences in changes between            baseline and   and  days were estimated For            each attribute the difference in mean change between            treatment groups is presented together with twosided             confidence intervals so that the differences            between placebo and AT III over time are clearly            shown                                Statistical considerations            Nominal             P values should be regarded as            descriptive because no formal null hypothesis was            prespecified and no type I error probability can be            indicated No adjustment of             P values for multiple testing or            multiple confidence intervals was made             P values less than or equal to             were considered statistically significant             P values above  but less than            or equal to  were considered indicative of a trend            Confidence intervals for the difference between mean            changes were constructed assuming a normal distribution            of changes from baseline                                      Results                  Patient characteristics          Table shows baseline patient demographic data and

whereas the inhospital group totaled  The          patients included in this study population were from a          broad mixture of countries          The mean  SD age of the overall population was             years in the placebo group and    years in the AT          III group Mean age was lower    years in the          allsurvivors population A clear majority of patients          were men  men versus  women In the three          populations overall all  day survivors and  day          inhospital survivors the sex distribution for the AT          III groups was similar There was a shift toward the          lower risk strata of SAPS II score from the overall          population to the allsurvivors population whereas the          risks in the inhospital population were slightly higher          than those in the overall population In the          allsurvivors group respiratory disorders were the most          common diagnostic admitting category whereas digestive          causes of sepsis were the most common among the          inhospital group          Among all patients enrolled in the trial  received          heparin concomitantly Among the allsurvivors placebo          and AT III differed by  with respect to concomitant          heparin administration In this population  of placebo          patients were administered heparin concomitantly  of          those administered AT III received heparin Among the          inhospital survivors at  days  in the placebo          group received heparin as compared with  of those          receiving AT III Comparing AT III groups across          populations the use of concomitant heparin was nearly          the same                          Changes in day quality of life          Table shows data for the six attributes of the visual          analog scale and the Karnofsky scale objective physical          performance and dependency measured from baseline to           days Assessment of the changes among the allsurvivors          based on twosided twosample Wilcoxon tests suggests          advantages for the AT III group as compared with the          placebo group in three of the attributes namely patient          communication and speech level of alertness and energy          level In the inhospital population the differences          indicated that communication and speech level of          alertness and the Karnofsky scale were all more improved          for the AT III group than for placebo          In neither population was the change in patient          overall QoL judged to be statistically different In the          inhospital group a trend toward greater patient energy          levels in the AT III group was found            P                            Differences across patient subgroups          As shown in Table  although there were generally          greater increases in attribute scores in the SAPS II risk          for AT III in the allsurvivors none of the differences          were statistically significant There were also no          significant differences between placebo and AT III          according to the diagnostic subgroups on hospital          admission although a few trends favoring AT III          notably the energy level attribute of QoL were found          In the heparin subgroups there was an advantage in some          attributes for AT III Compared with placebo physical          activity was improved significantly more in the AT III          subgroup than in the placebo subgroup not receiving          heparin There was also a trend toward greater          improvement in three other attributes in the no          concomitant heparin subgroup namely patient mobility          communication and speech and patient energy level          Excluding the Karnofsky scores that were unchanged mean          nominal changes in the AT III QoL attributes of the no          concomitant heparin group ranged from  to  whereas          those receiving concomitant heparin experienced nominal          increases in scores ranging from  to                           Changes in quality of life between baseline and            and  days          Figs and show the differences in mean changes in          scores between baseline and later periods for the seven          attributes measured in the AT III group as compared with          placebo Fig shows results for the allsurvivors          population whereas Fig shows findings in the          inhospital population Considering point estimates of          differences between mean changes at each time point for          all attributes and in both populations AT III patients          were more improved than placebo patients Confidence          intervals fully occupying the AT III better side          indicate statistically significant improvements in the AT          III group In the allsurvivors population comparative          improvements tended to increase over time in the AT III          group as compared with the placebo group An exception          was the Karnofsky index for which the difference between          treatment groups remained approximately constant over          time For the inhospital population the advantage in          the AT III group increased over time for the          communicationspeech and the level of alertness          attributes whereas the difference between treatment          groups remained approximately constant for the other          attributes In the allsurvivors the greatest          comparative advantages for the AT III group were found in          communicationspeech alertness and energy level                            Discussion        The present study represents the first attempt to        evaluate patient QoL over a relatively long period in a        large randomized placebocontrolled sepsis trial The        results of the study indicate that over a day period        survivors of severe sepsis receiving AT III experienced        substantial and statistically significant improvements as        compared with placebo in several attributes of QoL These        results held for both allsurvivors and inhospital        survivors populations The comparative advantage in QoL for        AT III was also maintained from  to  and  days        After  days the study also found an advantage with AT        III for some attributes in patients who did not receive        heparin concomitantly        The improvements identified in the study should be        interpreted in terms of statistical and clinical        significance Clinical significance deals with the applied        value of the change in everyday life Unfortunately as        with most other QoL instruments there is not yet a clear        standard for minimal clinically important differences        However improvements by approximately  in the        inhospital group of AT III sepsis patients after  days        in communicationspeech and level of alertness probably        represent meaningful improvements in many patients        Another limitation of the present study is the fact that        investigators were proxy respondents rather than patients        responding themselves Like many studies of QoL in critical        care settings physicians were assumed to be sufficiently        close to patients to provide valid and reliable data        Although this was not substantiated empirically there is        usually moderate agreement between patients and proxies        although lower levels of agreement have been found in        psychosocial functioning                       Conclusion        Combined with previous findings in day mortality for        those without concomitant administration of heparin this        multinational study demonstrates that AT III is associated        with meaningful improvements in health for many sepsis        patients over an extended month followup period In this        subgroup the clinical improvements over a long time period        in patients in the AT III group were complemented by        improvements in QoL in many patients particularly in terms        of social and psychologic functioning Although no        significant reduction in day mortality was found for the        overall population a nominal advantage in mortality for        the AT III group combined with a generally improved QoL        profile in the survivors of this group suggests a possible        longterm benefit from AT III Future studies of critically        ill patients with severe sepsis or other conditions should        include longterm follow up of patients throughout        hospitalization and after hospital discharge In sepsis        longterm follow up appears to provide more meaningful        outcome data for patients families and society than do        standard day allcause mortality statistics                    Key messages         In the present study clinical improvements over an        extended time period with AT III were complemented by        improvements in QoL particularly in social andpsychologic        functioning in a predefined subgroup of patients who did        not receive heparin         Combined with previous research on day mortality        the study suggests that AT III may confer longterm benefit        in sepsis patients         Among the all survivors group of patients        communication and speech level of alertness and energy        level exhibited the greatest gains at  days         In most cases significant differences in patient QoL        scores at  days after hospital admission were also found        at the day and day assessments         Future studies in patients with severe sepsis should        include longterm follow up throughout hospitalization and        after hospital discharge                    Competing interests        Dale Rublee HeinzOtto Keinecke and Sigrid Knaub are        employees of Aventis Behring the latter
