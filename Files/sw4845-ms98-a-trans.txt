                are they doing a lot of recycling out in Georgia   well um at my uh workplace they are we have uh places for aluminum cans and we have uh everybodys been issued a separate trash can for uh recyclable recyclable paper lets lets see them get that word straight uh   uhhuh   as far as the community goes uh its pretty much voluntary nothings been done um i dont where i live i live in an unincorporated area and we dont have any uh we have just private uh garbage services and uh uh as far as im concerned i i guess i should do it but being lazy i dont if if somebody made it easy for me to separate my trash and pick it up i would more than gladly participate  uh   yeah i it it is it is to some degree inconvenient id have to say that   um   uh around here theyve given us mine already got run over um it it  looks sort of like a milk crate a little blue milk milk crate and i have two kids and its not big enough its its kind of its kind of silly and what you do is you put out paper like paper bags and newspaper and cardboard       and that you put separately and you also put out in this little ridiculous container any cans or bottles you have you know like your Campbell soup cans and your milk cartons and that kind of stuff   hm   and then the rest you can just you throw out and the town picks it up ive heard of communities where you have to separate your garbage and then put whats left in a clear plastic ga bag so they can kind of look and see if youre throwing out what you shouldnt i thought that was pretty amusing   have the garbage police looking after you i guess   i imagine i dont know   uh well i used to live in California and um just before i left they were um some communities were making that uh mandatory and uh um fortunately i was in a i was in an apartment complex and for some reason we just threw everything in the dumpster that was all right   well you know its funny we just got back from a trip to California visiting some friends uh near San Francisco and San Jose and wed see these signs on the road that said garbage pickup two exits down or something the apartment for the apartment dwellers they didnt make it easy to recycle at all what they did was um you would bring it to this garbage place that they designated and the Lions Club or you know some community organization would do you the favor of picking it up from there you really had to go out of your way to recycle   yeah you know and most people probably dont wanna carry a couple of bags worth of garbage in their car a few miles uh i mean its all its a good idea we should all do it uh but um if it were from a practical viewpoint from a selfish viewpoint if communities made it easy and convenient for you to do it they would have a lot more participation in my opinion   well around here i its not too bad because on Tuesdays you put out your paper and your cans and and plastic things and they go away so that i mean thats not too tough to put that at the end of your driveway   yeah right   uh my friends in California have this special garbage fill where they collect all their soda cans and they kind of leave it near the dumpster knowing that the neighborhood kids will grab them because they can sell them or something for recycling   uhhuh oh gee you havent   so they just leave it out for the vultures to take   gee kids around here i dont think would pay well wouldnt pay any attention to it theyd the dogs would get to it before they would i would imagine   oh well the soda cans where i live are good for a nickel a piece   wow   so if you bring them to the local supermarket they have these can crushers and you know you throw all the cans in one at a time it takes time a lot of time and uh you push a button and you get a nickel for every can because someone you had to pay a deposit on it when you bought it   oh   and you find these old old men and these bag people collecting all these things and hauling them in in big garbage bags and they just like take up one of these machines to to get you know couple of money uh bucks for beer or something   is that a city or state law that uh requires it to be recycled or   yeah its a state well New York state does it and i know Vermont a lot of the eastern states do it   huh   so you get a lot of old people one old fellow had crates of beer he made friends with a bartender a bartender at some bar and he gets all the beer bottles because the guy cant be bothered with it and he said he bought himself i said thats pretty heavy for you isnt it and he says well i just bought myself an old station wagon to cart you know this is a real business for him hes making big bucks   gee well i i guess if you can buy in bulk it  so to speak   well i guess at a nickel a shot if these people are retired and theyve got nothing better to do i mean they can come away with ten fifteen dollars at a haul i guess   well i bet thats resulted in uh it it would seem to me thats resulted in some cleaner highways i would imagine   well you you do find people picking through the garbage pails at the beach you know my own kids have been guilty of that till they found that the bees were attracted to the Coke cans and that was the end of that   surprise surprise   i think its a fair you know for an eight year old to get three dollars its like wow   gee well thats uh well that you know a state law like that would probably encourage people down here uh to do it uh i mean i i dont know
