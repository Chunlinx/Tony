                                 Celtic Pride            William Butler Yeats likedto organize his life into zones and areas but he was a biased cartographer ofthese regions On Yeats map of himself there are no obscure towns and allroads lead to Rome His was as he saw it a continuous poetic journey aidedhere and there by slaves or musesArthur Symons the symbolist who introducedhim to the poetry of Paul Verlaine and Stphane Mallarm in the s MaudGonne who made Irish nationalism romantic Lady Augusta Gregory an IrishProtestant aristocrat who collaborated with Yeats in his search of old Irishfolklore and legends and Ezra Pound who stiffened Yeats soft Celtic versewith a little modernist geometry            In hislater verse and in many of his letters Yeats interpreted those friendships asinevitable They fed his destiny which was as he saw it to be Irelandsgreatest poet Critics and biographers have too often collaborated in thislegend separating their accounts of Yeats into green developments and goldenphases The result is a fairly schematic narrative The young hothead of theearly Celtic Revivalist years produces lovely impracticalities until  whenIreland explodes he learns about reality becomes a great poet of civil warand a modernist to boot after  or thereabouts he becomes one of thosemonuments of unageing intellect about whom he writes in Sailing toByzantiumthe splendid complainer of the late verse Even Richard Ellman thepoets finest biographer before Roy Foster followed Yeats own division ofhimself into two opposing selvesthe great bard and the man who sat down tobreakfast each morning            In this superb biography Foster unscrambles destiny andcomplicates it into life The most distinguished Irish historian alive Fosterfloods his Yeats with historical detail He is less interested in literaryexegesis than in historical accident indeed his criticism of the poems is alittle spare But he attends to the chaos of Yeats early life a bohemianshuffle during which he was at the mercy of his improvident peripatetic fatherthe painter JB Yeats He gives a deep description of the tensions andambiguities of Yeats shabbygenteel Protestant origins His sketch of thehierarchical and socially touchy Dublin of the s is almostnovelisticsomething like the castefrozen Bombay of some contemporary Indianfiction            How sillywas Yeats Auden uses the adjective in his elegy for the poet and it issupposed to include all of us You were silly like us But Yeats had asingular silliness which is what makes his early poetry so patchy Bouncedbetween London and Dublin he was not at one school long enough to collect arounded education Throughout his life he fed on scrapsin particular Irishliterature and magic In the s he was snared by Madame Helena PetrovnaBlavatsky the eccentric Russian who invented theosophya blend of Easternmysticism occult optimism and universal brotherhood He never really escapedWhen he shaved off his beard in  Blavatsky then living in Londonlamented the loss of the mesmeric force that collects in a beard            Yeats remained a devotee of various forms ofspiritualism and mesmerism Theosophy was the craze of the age and like DHLawrence who had a keen interest in the occult Yeats was on the creative quivive But he seemed to swallow far too much tainted water He believed almostall of it He confessed that he saw no reason not to believe in the actualexistence of Irish fairies and goblins A faith in magic in the spirit worldbecame his aesthetic He denounced naturalism fought George Bernard Shawsmechanistic vision he once had a dream in which Shaw appeared clicking likea sewingmachine and smiling insanely and proposed a poetry of dream andCeltic twilight that would shun the hustle of the world He would live alonein the beeloud glade as he put it in The Lake Isle of Innisfree one of the early poems that established his renown            Thisperfumed hermeticism produced early verse that is easy to love and hard tolike It is poetry to which one swooned as an adolescent Looking again at thepoetry written between  and  one notices the scattered petals offamiliar flowers the secondhand imagery the automatic despondency far toomuch ancient sorrow the druids fairies hermits and witches Goodnesshere is something called Druid vapour Too often the poetry yields nointellectual sap One longs for Browning to clear the mist            But Yeats talent was huge It survived by consuming itsown weaknesses Yeats effectively shut down his Celtic dream world in  withthe starker more acute verse of Responsibilities  He let the realitiesof Irelands civil war invade and occupy his poetic world More than this heused the earlier romanticism of the verse as a wainscot against which he mightscuff his heels Romantic Irelands dead and gone he wrote in September His later poetry tolled this bell again and again Yet this RomanticIreland was largely Yeats own poetic creation in the first place He turnedhis own earlier verse into a nation at the very moment of its abandonment Itwas a brilliant feat of personal expansion            Besidesthe early poetry is tougher than it seems There are realities homely detailsand gorgeous originalities alongside the more sentimental visions If Yeats hasthree hermits meet on a beach one of them is not concerned with being a seerbut is scratching himselfrummaging for a flea One is never far fromPorterdrinkers randy laughter Or from lines that fly beyondaccountability the leopardcoloured trees For God goes by with whitefootfall            Fosters biography shows us this doublemaskedpoet a dreamer who never strayed very far from reality Above all Foster isruthless about Yeats ruthlessness He shows how Yeats went about buildingmodern Irish literature in Dublin and in London at the end of the th century and how Irish goblins and fairies were foot soldiersin that campaign Irish mythology had to be dragged into Irish poetry Yeatswas energetically shameless in this regard He wrote kind reviews of books onIrish history and mythology by his friend Lady Gregory He demolished inprint rivals and competitors He was especially harsh with his former friendErnest Dowden who espoused a benevolent Irish cosmopolitanism in opposition toYeats literary nationalism Between  and  Yeats published more than items in newspapers and journals He also wrote his long and beautifulpoem The Wanderings of Oisin  published in  a list of the bestIrish books edited a book of Irish verse and with Lady Gregory as coworkertoured villages and towns asking peasants for their folk memories            Veryoccasionally one wishes that Foster would look up from his table of detailsand survey the larger literary scene Yeats literary nationbuilding is a casein point Foster might have attended to the poems and shown how willfully theyuse placenames and in the later verse Yeats famous friends names to erectthe mansion of Irish literature Yeats wants to leave his traces On Munstergrass and Connemara skies Pushkin who was building Russian poetry out ofvery little did something very similar in Eugene Onegin  only  yearsbefore Fernando Pessoa almost exactly contemporary with Yeats was doing thesame thing for Portuguese literature producing patriotic and nationalisticverse            But Fosters expertise is historical and he warns us thathe will write as a historian No one is going to better him in this area Hegoes behind the wrestled solemnities of the poetry to reveal the effort thestrategizing and the silliness We learn for example that on his field tripswith Lady Gregory Yeats had difficulty understanding the thick Irish accent ofthe peasants The incomprehension was mutual The subjects of this anthropologylooked at Yeats stylish black London suithe was always a careful poeticdresserand took him to be a proselytizing clergyman            Above all Foster shows us ahistorical actor propelled and limited by his inheritance Yeats was aProtestant in a Catholic country which Foster suggests might have led him toovercompensate with a romantic idealization of Ireland fiercer than that of hisCatholic countrymen At the same timeand this is where Fosters carefuldiscriminations are so usefulYeats hated obviously ideological poetry He wasthat unfamiliar compound a political aesthete Irish poets learn your tradeSing whatever is well made he grumpily advised in  in Under Ben Bulbenone of his very last poems This struggle between the marvelous and themurderous as Seamus Heaney has put it is still acute in modern Irish poetryFosters book is not only a fine account of Yeats early life it is a subtleintroduction to  th century Irish nationalism
