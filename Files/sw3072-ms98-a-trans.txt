            okay   okay where have you all been on vacation recently   recently my most recent trip was last year and that was Detroit   Detroit is that a nice vacation spot   yeah well it wasnt really it was um uh to see an old relative   right okay   and it was uh just to uh have some fellowship with her   right so you probably wouldnt recommend that as tourist big tourist spot   no The only thing that i i visited that you know is quite a tourist spot is Cancun Mexico   ooh that would be nice   and that was real nice uh   did you scuba dive there   uh no we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there   ooh that would be nice   yeah and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit from our daily routine   oh that would be enjoyable right yeah thats a nice break i havent been on vacation in a while either um usually when we go we go to Colorado to Estes Park area which is up kind of near Denver   huh uhhuh yes   and uh stay in the mountains up there do a little hiking and resting get away from the Texas heat that kind of thing   oh thats always refreshing to get away from   so its a lot of fun i worked up there last summer so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the whole summer long   oh well thats nice yeah   worked at a camp there and so i got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains so thats probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere on a vacation   well my uh my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity and thats canoeing   oh   and uh theyve been to the Guadalupe River and they also uh uh have been to uh i guess Colorado and theyve really enjoyed it its a whole new   thats nice we um we canoed up in Arkansas at the Buffalo River   uhhuh   and thats the best place that ive ever canoed it was really   huh   really pretty i was a little kid then and we to have uh we stayed at some park and they had a little uh mountain man who came down the river every night and he would give a little talk about   mountain things you know i think he wasnt a real mountain man but we were pretty convinced he was a full hermit who lived up in   sure uhhuh   the woods that hed come in his little log boat down the river and we would have to wed  and hed make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that hed found and   oh thats neat   thats thats a good family place to go and then the river was really nice because it wasnt too   sure   frightening but it wasnt   uhhuh   you know too easy either so it was like   well you learn a lot of um skills too and i think youre more receptive when youre younger than when youre older to learn new skills and i think they really it really penetrates penetrates in your memory you know what to do because you really have a great interest in it   thats true umhum   because its something you werent forced to do   right   so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning and youre more receptive   yeah well thats good well we um lets see the only other place ive ever vacationed wed you know go on camping trips up to Texoma and things like that   uhhuh   and then i went to England   oh thats exciting   a few years ago i was a student there and spent um a semester studying abroad in London   uhhuh uhhuh   and that was a great time because its so thats such a neat place and its theres not a language barrier so you dont i mean there theres a little bit because theres some of those English words that you just dont exactly know what they mean and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents but its it was really fun i i i really enjoyed that im probably going back there to work for a year   uhhuh well i had a friend that uh visited England not well i think its been probably two years now but thats her next goal and she can do it is go back to England because she really has a great desire to do that because the love that she um has for it now after visiting it   it its really nice i would i would spend all my time in London or most of my time and thats it was really different being in a big city because i dont   uhhuh   get much into  urban you know really urban areas a lot   uhhuh uhhuh   and it was its really its sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone which i thought i would just hate but it ended up being kind of nice because youre not accountable to anyone   uhhuh uhhuh   you could just kind of   do your own thing   kind of walk around and observe i did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching watching people   yeah uhhuh   and i had a great time doing that it was really interesting   thats wonderful theres a lot out there to see ill say   yeah i know i  keep wanting to get up to i havent i havent been anywhere else outside the United States i havent been to Mexico or Canada or   well i lived across the street almost from Canada   oh   so that was that thats a nice place Canada is very nice   yeah that would be nice i had a friend from there then i id love to go somewhere in Asia but id have to have a   uhhuh     tour guide with me to   oh yes absolutely   help with all the language and all that   sure somebody that knows their way around   so yeah thats why thats why England was nice even we traveled in Europe for about a week and that was even nice because there wasnt uh the most the places we went we went to Germany and Switzerland and   well youve been quite a few places there   well i yeah we  have we just kind of     once you think about it huh   we did we whirlwinded through Europe it was   uhhuh   just insane twelve days where wed just stop like a city a day and you slept on the train at night   oh thats great   but there wasnt a it was strange it was kind of sad there wasnt ever a language problem there because everyone in Germany knew English and everyone in Switzerland knew English   uhhuh thats great   so  we were kind of pitiful we found one restaurant we were in and got seated and then no on e knew English in there and we were just   uhhuh   finally had to break out the phrase book and start looking up things but it was uh   what did you wind up with   oh i had fondue that was easy to say   oh okay      tried to get fondue and white wine and that was   uh uhhuh   we were able to have that pretty pretty effortlessly there were some people at the next table who spoke English so we   they kind of guided you   elicited their aid for a while and they were   uhhuh   very helpful so   well good   it was it was a pleasant time id id love to go back there theres just not time theres not enough time to go see everything and then to afford to see everything   i guess thats why we need to plan for retirement so when we do have the free time well have the the means to uh pursue our dreams   right   yeah i guess thats what retirement is all about   thats         that and sleeping late   Yes     i keep hoping for     uhhuh i understand that huh   well it was nice talking with you   well it was nice talking with you too Craig   and have a good afternoon   you do the same thank you byebye   okay goodbye
