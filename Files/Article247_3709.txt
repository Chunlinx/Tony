                                 Let Down by the Media                        Dear George            Breakfast is late this morning I put my yearold on the school bus at am and the coffee seems to have taken too long to kick in Maybe its becauseI actually drink tea            I share your balanced view of crime control and innercity policing Yourmore general point about the complexity of most publicpolicy issues is ofcourse right on the mark Yet it doesnt matter whether the topic is publiceducation health care or free speech politicians routinely look for theposition that plays best in the media Of course the mainstream media dont dovery much to raise the level of public discourse New Yorks three major dailynewspapers were remarkably consistent in their choice of lead stories todayThe New York Post  Museum To Sue City Over Art Flap No Dung Deal theNew York Daily News  Defiant Museum Tells Rudy the Show Goes On andthe New York Times  Brooklyn Museum Sues To Keep Mayor From FreezingFunds Oh yes Warren Beatty also gets frontpage New York Timescoverage for his possible presidential bid I know that the public likes to beentertained but would this museum story actually be playing for an entire weekif it didnt have a salacious element to it and the mayor wasnt using it toscore points with conservative voters The issue of public funding for the artsis actually quite important and yet there is nothing in the discussion thatwould help a thinking person come to some position on this public policyissue            Warren Beatty is another matter I think he and Donald Trump have got morepress on their presidential aspirations than Elizabeth Dole or John McCainToday Bradley actually released his proposal for a health plan for theuninsured This is very important for urban areas especially New York whereso many working men and women are uninsured To its credit the Timesand Post covered the story but it is nowhere to be found in theNews  Yet even the most intent reader would find it difficult toevaluate the plan from the coverage in the Post  but at least it wasthere McCains schoolvoucher program another important issue for urbanAmerica was covered only in the Times             By the time you get my thoughts you will probably be completely exhaustedfrom driving and teaching Cant the policy discussion in the media do betterthan todays New York papers Hope your day went well            Warmest regardsEster
