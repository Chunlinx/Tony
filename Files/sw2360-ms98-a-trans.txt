like that   uhhuh we watch a lot of that also we watch uh CNN a lot   yeah   and then i think one of my favorite shows is LA Law   yeah we dont have cable unfortunately so we just get but weve got plenty of local stations to look at   uhhuh   but uh   uh we have cable here   yeah about the only reason i would want cable probably is is for some of the uh sports programs   i see   that they dont show local   right yeah   like HSEN ESPN but the music movie show uh cables or movie channels they show the same shows over and over and over   well thats right and we never have signed up for those i just havent been interested in what they generally have on and   um and theyre usually   would be just as happy not to have them in the house   yeah but uh do you have small kids   no nope we uh our familys grown in fact weve just been retired for about a year we took early retirement and   okay oh   just really enjoying ourselves   i wished i could do that ive been TI thirty two years   is that right   yeah but im only fifty seven   well   so ive still got a few years to go   uh my husbands fifty five and im a couple of years older well hes fifty seven im a couple years older than that time goes by   yeah yeah   but he was with IBM fa thirty years   yeah   and decided hed had enough of it   well ive had enough of it but unfortunately they dont pay enough       for early retirement   do you still have children do you have children at home   no huhuh no all my kids are grown married   right well our daughter in Texas is working for TI uh on a part time basis so thats how we found out about this calling   uhhuh yeah but uh every once in a while i like to watch some of the old movies i watched a Clint Eastwood movie last night   umhum well we watched the ACC playoffs or i guess   yeah oh yeah uh in in fact its on tonight   rooting for Duke University rooting for Duke University   yeah yeah it ought to be a good uh good game tonight   yeah thats on right its on again tonight   it it doesnt start until seven oclock our time so we still got another hour   umhum uh   are you all behind what time is it there its six oclock here now   its uh its seven oclock here right   seven oclock so you all are behind us   right weve just been watching the national news   yeah but uh   i wish our time were like yours and then we could get i like to watch Johnny Carson and watch the eleven oclock news but it makes it so late   yeah makes it so late well were fixing to go on daylight saving time uh next this next weekend   uhhuh i think we do to   so we have to run our clocks up forward an hour and i sure do hate to loose that hour of sleep in the morning   i hate it too i just would rather stay the way it is     yeah but uh well i guess like like like i said my favorite show whats your favorite shows or you like the news formats   i like i like the i like some of the dramas   yeah   shows and i like mysteries   yeah i like uh the true life adventures too   but uhhuh we like uh we get the uh Financial News Network   yeah   and we like to watch that check up on whats happening with all the stocks and   yeah       i i dont uh watch too much of the of the uh network shows i all i like to watch uh lets see some of the the uh prime time shows that i like to watch like i said or other news formats but then every once in a while ill watch Star Search   uhhuh   uh but uh not too many of the situatio n comedies do i care for   no i dont care for those   and im definitely not a soap fan   too much the only crazy comedy i  really like is Saturday Night Live   yeah or uh i   do you ever watch that   yeah and i like uh Totally Hidden Video       uhhuh we dont watch that much   and uh Super uh what is it uh uh Bloopers and Super Practical Jokes   right uhhuh   but um   uh   i dont know how people stay at home and watch soaps and get involved in them but   no i dont either i just dont have any interest   i guess plenty of people do   yeah they had a program on the other day about people that were addicted to soap operas   yeah in fact i think you can even uh order a magazine that keeps you up to date every day of what happened on every particular soap in case you miss it     uhhuh     but uh that thats not real life to me so   uh no i think itd be an awful waste of time   yeah well i enjoyed talking with you and   well enjoyed it too Jerry and   and how hows you alls weather up there you cold   uh today it was pretty chilly and windy   yeah   the sun was out bright but it was kind of cold   yeah   i guess it was probably in the fifties but theres a
