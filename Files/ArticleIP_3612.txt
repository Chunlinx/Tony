                                 The Slate Arts Index            According to the WallStreet Journal  high culture is flourishing in America The evidence In afrontpage story published a couple of weeks ago the paper noted thatAmericans are drinking microbrews instead of Bud and that you can now get acappuccino in Alpena Ark            Though itmight shock my Seattlebased colleagues Im not sure that better coffee is theultimate measure of a civilization But if we dont count Starbucks how do weknow that the arts are flourishing in America Theres some support for thenotion in a recent survey of public participation in the arts published by theNational Endowment for the Arts According to numbers extrapolated from a poll million people or half the adult population of the United Statesparticipate in the arts in some way A full  percent of us went to an artmuseum last year  percent attended classical music concerts From thesenumbers the NEA has derived a figure of  million classical music concertsattended in  vs  million in  and  million art museum visits in up from  million in             However the NEA points out that its  numbers arentcomparable to the  ones Weirdly the  survey was appended to theNational Crime Victimization Survey Has anyone in your household been muggedin the past  months Have you been to see Riverdance  The bleakcontext may have led to underreporting The  poll by contrast wasfreestanding but one can see how it might register false positives An NEAsurvey that asks whether you like to go to the theater opera ballet etcsubtly begs for affirmative answers And in fact the five year increaseindicated by the NEA is much greater than the numbers tabulated by variousartsservice organizationswhich in some cases report a decline where the NEAsees growth            But the chief limitation ofusing the NEA numbers as a proxy for the health of high culture is that its ademandside pictureit captures consumption rather than production It tellsus nothing about the quality or quantity of high culture being created in theUnited States today And in fact the new studys upbeat tone cuts directlyagainst the conclusions of a report issued by former NEA Chair Jane Alexanderon her way out The American Canvas study published in  argues that artsinstitutions are elitist complacent and largely hostile to popular audiencesLast year according to the NEA the arts were sick This year theyrethriving            Of coursenumbers can never resolve the inherently subjective question of culturalhealth For a consensus about whether a lot of masterpieces were painted orwritten in  check back in  years But it may be possible to come upwith a more rounded portrait of relative cultural wellbeingone that takesinto account how well artists are doing as well as how many butts are inauditorium seats            To that end I hereby initiate the                   Slate                ArtsIndex This is a measure based on statistics culled from various sources thatgive a clue about the health of different art forms Heres how it works Thebaseline is  points composed of six separate categories It breaks down asfollows  points for literature  for music  for the fine arts  fortheater  for film and  for dance On the basis of the numbers Ivegathered its hard to say how well any art formor culture as a wholeisdoing But in a year we should be able to say whether theyre doing better orworse If the music score rises to  that would suggest a  percentimprovement A total tally of  would mean an  percent decline in the healthof high culture

literature in the pastyear Sixtythree percent said yes The                   Slate                literature indexderives from three more compelling factors The first is the number of weeksnew works of literature spent on the Times bestseller list in the pastyear as it turns out out of a total of  What is literature Ratherthan attempting to gauge quality I have included all books that have literaryaspirations or are regarded as literature by most reviewers ColdMountain  yes The Partner  no Elmore Leonard yes Carl Hiaasenno As opposed to the commonly cited figure of total book sales this number isa reasonable standin for the question of how many Americans are readingnonpulp new novels Ive reserved the other  points for poetry and classicliterature Our proxy for verse is a fairly crude onethe number of books ofpoetry published For classics Im using sales from one publisher sincePenguin keeps most of the worlds great literature in print                           Music points

logichere is that while the first number gives a sense of the availability of operaas whole the second number gives a sense of whether new work is being added tothe standard repertoire Both statistics come from Opera America The third andfourth numbers provided by the American Symphony Orchestra League do the samething with orchestral music It would be nice to include chamber music butthere are simply no useful statistics Lastly while I wasnt able to find anyreliable numbers on jazz performance the Recording Industry Association ofAmerica keeps track of jazz CD sales relative to other kinds of music                           FineArts  points                         pointsattendance at art museums              million             pointsnumber of peopleemployed as painters sculptors craftartists and artist printmakers                         Artmuseum attendance is a reasonable proxy for how many people are experiencingart The American Association of Art Museum Directors reports a much smallerincrease in visits than the NEA Based on the constant number of museums thatresponded between  and  attendance rose from  million to million for a slightly smaller sample group than the

such as the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge Massthe Guthrie in Minneapolis and the Steppenwolf in Chicago For  theaterssurveyed in a forthcoming TCG study attendance was  million However inthe interest of having an applestoapples comparison in the future Im usingthe smaller sample of  theaters tracked over time In these aggregateattendance is up slightly over the past three yearsfrom  million in to  million in  This does not include Broadway musicals but thenwere looking at high culture Our other measure is the total number ofnonprofit theaters also according to TCG

film receipts were  million The firstnumber is likely to be higher for the yeartodate figure is million while the second looks to be much lowerthere being no FullMonty import hit this year Im using

companies                         Dance indicators have beenfalling since  when John Munger began keeping systematic track forDanceUSA This contradicts the NEA report a discrepancy possibly explained bya rise in attendance at school performances There are two useful measures ofdance strength The first is the average attendance per performance at the largest ballet companies which has declined from  in  to  lastyear The other is the average number of contract weeks for dancers at majorcompanieswhich includes modern as well as ballet companies That figure was in up from a low of  in  In other words the dance audience hasbeen declining while professional dancers are finding slightly more work Thissuggests philanthropy at work            I couldnt come up with aplausible indicator for architecture Nor have I devised one for criticismwhich perhaps selfservingly I consider to be an important component ofcultural health Lastly the                   Slate                Arts Index doesnt try tomeasureas the NEA survey doeshow many Americans are actively participatingin the arts as amateur singers writers and painters What the                  Slate                index does do is establish a baseline Next fall we shouldbe able to come back and say something meaningful about what kind of year thearts have had For what its worth Im predicting well hit
