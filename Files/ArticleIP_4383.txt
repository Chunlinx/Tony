                                 Camera Obscura            In Edgar Degas shipped a camera to his beloved sister Marguerite who was dying inBuenos Aires Argentina where she and her husband had fled from creditors Thecamera Degas explained was capable of both posed and instantaneous viewsWith no more than a month of practice she would be able to send him a fewgood portraitsincluding he specified a few days later some negatives thatI can have enlarged to see you better Degas enthusiasm for photography cantconceal the morbid undertow of his request He will never see her again butthis camera might get there in time And the negativeso apt a word in thiscontextwill assume her place Degas pragmatic association of photographywith death recalls Roland Barthes far more melodramatic one Photography maycorrespond to the intrusion in our modern society of an asymbolic Deathoutside of religion outside of ritual a kind of abrupt dive into literalDeath Degas sends no consoling words to his dying sister just a camera andthe hope that she has a month to learn how to use it            TheMetropolitan Museum of Art has assembled the  or so known photographs byDegas all dated with an occasional probable added during the years With this show the Metropolitan brings to a close an extraordinarycycle of Degas exhibitions that began with the huge retrospective of  yearsago and proceeded through such lesserknown materials as Degas monotypes hislandscapes and his private collection of works by other artists Theexhibition of Degas photographs some of which have never before been seen inpublic raises two questions What sort of photographer was Degas And what dothese photographs add to our understanding of him as an artist            You might think photography was perfectly suited to DegasBy  when he was in his mids he had left largescale historical andmythological subjects behind for good No more medieval costume dramas orSpartan youths flirting in freeze frame Degas spent the following decadedeveloping an art that reflected the jostling shocks and perpetual motion ofthe modern metropolis Closeups of musicians in orchestra pits withballerinas above them beheaded by the top of the frame Horses jutting theirheads into one side of a picture while carriages are chopped off by the otherA disheveled dandy his two daughters and his dog all facing in differentdirections and wedged into one corner of a picture while the broad expanse ofthe Place de la Concorde takes up the remaining space Odd croppings oddangles odd encounters Give that man a camera            It hasoften been suggested that Degas innovative urban perspectives were influencedby photography But the opposite is closer to the truth Degas manipulationsof perspective decentered compositions and so on were always latent in thepractice of Western painters he merely pushed them further than anyone elsehad The peculiar pictures that resulted made the new invention of photographyand especially the casually composed snapshots of the s and after seemless outrageous more artful Ambitious photographers followed Degas leadBut Degas came around to photography as a sort of afterthought            Degas had acquired a Kodak by the summer of  when hewas  and he took it along for trips to spa towns and watering holes Theamateur photography craze was such that fashionable hotels provided darkroomsfor vacationing shutterbugs Degas took some tricky landscape shots such as where the curvature of the path and the converging trees on either side of theroad give the illusion of a dead end against a migrating wall of trees Backin Paris Degas showed no interest in pushing such pleinair experimentsfurtherhe was no Atget in the making After all he had already perfected inpastel and paint a daytime art of apparent spontaneity with precisely the sortof visual jokes hed found on that treelined road What Degas discovered inphotography was a nighttime art of stasis and meditative inwardness Daylightis too easy he insisted What I want is difficultthe atmosphere of lampsand moonlight            So heturned afterdinner hours into photo shoots marshaling guests to pose incarefully orchestrated tableaux The major surprise of Degas photographs isthat the theatricality and staginess so resolutely banished from his paintingsflooded into his photographs At a time when the Kodak camera and roll filmfirst introduced in  made the instantaneous snapshot aestheticpossible Degas opted for an older approach the pose held for two or threeminutes the long exposure the atmospheric effects of lamplight on a blackground A night with Degas and his camera was according to his close friendDaniel Halvy two hours of military obedience Degas knew what he wanted andwould push till he got it Halvy recorded snippets of Degas imperious ordersAnd you Mademoiselle Henriette bend your headmorestill more Really bendit The twisting  one of only two surviving photographic nudes by Degasbends her head so far that it disappears in darkness            Degas photographic nocturnes evoke a Halloween world ofphantasms and ghostly intimations with death often lurking in the shadows In Louise a sort of surrogate sister to Degas appears to have fallen asleepwhile the lamp to the right blooms like her dream world In BibliothqueNationale Paris one of a suite of selfportraits Degas devoted housekeeperand cook looms above his penseur pose her head the top of a pyramidlike a muse figure or a protective guardian In the most complex of Degasphotographs his great dual portrait of the painter Renoir and the poetStphane Mallarm Museum of Modern Art New York Renoirs head is posed deadcenter in the composition with the vertical of the mirror frame bisecting hishead In the mirror itself Degas camera apparatus is visible but his own headis obliteratedthe flash of genius or the death of the authorby a sunburstof illumination            Despitehis obsessive care in arranging shots Degas the amateur photographer mademistakes and some of these led to further discoveries He preserved somedouble exposures of the Halvy family with intersecting bodies extendingvertically and horizontally and heads emerging here and there like ghostsAmong the most striking images in the show are three negatives of a balletdancer assuming poses familiar from Degas pastels see Arm OutstretchedThe glass negatives were too overexposed to print so Degas had them treatedwith chemicals to produce an orange and yellow effect like stained glassimages for a secular chapel            Why did Degas give up photography so soon after beingcaptivated by it Had he passed through the sadness and grief that accompaniedthe death of his sister and that helped spur his photographic activity as thecurator Malcolm Daniel asks in his catalog essay Well no Daniel concedessince Degas continued to mourn Marguerite who died in late October  andother close companions died during the years immediately following Danielleans toward a technical explanationthat Degas had solved the problem of themeditative lamplit nocturnal portrait            I wouldsuggest another cause Many of those portraits over a third of Degas totalphotographic output were of the Halvy family They were Degas closestfriends he dined with them regularly and treated them at a time when his ownfamily was dispersed and in financial trouble as virtually his own relativesThen came the accusation of treason in  against the French army officerAlfred Dreyfus who happened to be Jewish and the subsequent division ofFrench society into French nationalists convinced of Dreyfus guilt and thoseequally convinced of his innocence Degas was in the former camp and by would have his housekeeper Zo read aloud from antiSemitic tracts at thebreakfast table Two years later he could no longer tolerate any associationwith Jews including the thoroughly assimilated Halvys As Daniel Halvyreported An almost unbelievable thing happened in the autumn of  Ourlongstanding friendship with Degas which on our mothers side went back totheir childhood was broken off            The art historian Linda Nochlin has traced what she callsDegas perfectly ordinary antiSemitism to status anxiety The Degas familywhich sometimes changed their name to de Gas to suggest noble roots came toprominence through the same international banking connections the Jewishfinanciers they deplored had When his family fell on hard times Degas blamedit on the Jews One wonders whether the dark and shadowy world of hisphotographs might have had some association in his mind with the ambivalence hefelt toward the Jews he posed in such excruciating positions Degas accordingto Daniel Halvy carried his camera as proudly as a child carrying arifle            The Dreyfus case is all butunmentioned in the Metropolitan show and catalog The oversight is not theresult of an effort to avoid downbeat or offensive sides of Degas but rather afailure to understand the seismic shift in French society caused bylaffaire  Photography and French nationalism were also linked inDegas mind As Daniel Halvy wrote in his diary about a visit with Degas inDecember of  We went out he talked about France about photographyabout photography about France all mixed together with equal excitementWhen Degas walked out on the Halvy family he walked out on photography aswell
