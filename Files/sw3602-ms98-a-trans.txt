        okay well i dont see many of the current movies i usually wait till they come in the second run theaters     uhhuh uhhuh   but um what what ones have you seen lately   um well we we are the same we usually wait until they come out on video and then just rent them and watch them at home and even then we   umhum yep   dont watch a whole lot of the real current movies um we did go to see last weekend Star Trek Six   oh you did   yes my husband hes a well were both kind of Star Trek fans i wouldnt go as far to say that were trekkies but we we both enjoy Star Trek so we went to see that and um     umhum did you like it   we did we enjoyed it it was a good movie i guess its their last one and they the cast theyre getting pretty old i dont know if youre a Star Trek fan at all are you     im not but my husband is and he went last weekend to see it too   oh did he like it   yeah he did   we yes we did it was it was a good story and and they sign you know at the end they signed their name so i guess that that means that really is the end  so and um we just went or we rented City Slickers   huh okay i saw that recently   a couple weeks ago have you seen that one did you like it oh at the movie house or   yeah in fact i saw it twice well actually once it was on an airplane and then the second time it was at a um   oh   its interesting its an old uh theater not a movie theater but like a play theater   umhum umhum   that and theyve put in tables and chairs  then they show movies in there   well how fun   so its kind of neat yeah   oh yeah that was that was kind of a fun one  wed heard a lot about that and had waited until it came you know out on video and then rented it and enjoyed it um have you seen Doc Hollywood   umhum umhum yes   did you enjoy that one   yes   yeah we havent seen that either were waiting a couple more weeks and then well watch it is that fairly funny or   um yeah its its one of these lighthearted things its its not very serious but its it it was cute i really i enjoyed it so   uhhuh oh oh good how about Beauty and the Beast have you   no huhuh   we havent seen we promised our kids wed take them over Christmas vacation so probably in the next couple of weeks well see that one but   oh no    i havent seen that i saw Hundred and One Dalmatians   um oh did you oh thats fun i liked the do you have kids or did you go just for yourself just for yourself   yeah no  i went with my next door neighbor  our husbands both said no way   well how fun     it used to be my favorite movie when i was little so i went back and   oh now i wonder thats not not out on video is it   i dont think so   i wonder if thatll be the next one they release maybe if thats   i dont know but you know we went for a dollar it was fun   oh yeah   i really enjoyed it i didnt get bored or anything either   oh now now did you like do you like the little theater where you go and and watch the movies   yeah we have a real nice one its brand new      oh oh   and um i i suspect itll be a full priced theater when this highway goes in but right now its almost in the middle of nowhere   oh   so its not very crowded and its real inexpensive and its brand new so its its a really nice place to go   hm oh well thats fun yeah we we our little community doesnt have a movie theater but we the nearest town has a um   yeah   they have its a four you know four theaters in one that has the different shows going on   umhum umhum   and i know theyve gotten Addams Family have you seen that one have you Addams Family do you think are you going are you interested at all in that   no huhuh i dont know i think my husbandll want to see it so ill do the same thing ill wait till its less expensive   right right   because he said when he went to see Star Trek he was out in California with a friend he said it was like seven fifty a person   umhum wow my word and what how much is it for a movie there where youre at   i think its about six dollars yeah   is it we were when we went it was four fifty four fifty a person and that seems like a real lot to me even   wow yeah well i think you can get that maybe on a matinee here but        you know about six dollars is what theyre running and thats why i dont normally go to them      boy boy ill say not thats a thats a chunk we usually get go ahead and get the discount tickets but i dont think they were accepting them on on Star Trek or you know some of the newer ones i guess they dont   yeah yeah yeah thats right   to try and make their money and so so do you watch do you enjoy movies or   yeah yeah we usually go usually every weekend we go to one yeah yeah   do you oh thats fun so youve seen you have a wide variety under your belt then right   yeah well we never used to do that until this other theater went in and its you know its inexpensive and its entertainment for night   uhhuh right right   and um the only thing is that when people at work talk about the current movies i dont know whats going on but       you know about four weeks later i will   oh do they come that soon   yeah they have been lately it used to be youd have to wait months and months and now like i was just looking at the listings now this week they started showing All I Want for Christmas   oh wow yeah oh wow   and thats a very recent release   boy ill say i cant imagine why everybody doesnt wait till they come there because like you well like you say around here we have to wait   yeah well i dont know   oh a couple um probably six months to a year before they go to the dollar dollar theaters   yes yeah it used to be like that but now
