        and i guess   okay um so uh um uh do you have any favorite teams   well i kind of like them all i played for about eighteen years all all the way through college and then uh kind of hung them up after college but   oh i was going to say you played pro ball right     no not quite   not quite huh   made it yeah made it all the way through four years of college playing ball but   well thats pretty good   anyway uh being in Rochester you probably like the Mets   yes im actually a Mets fan im im one of these people whos actually a die hard Met fan and an avid Yankee hater     oh boy it the i think its like one or the other isnt it i mean you either   yeah its its i i i find it very strange um more people you know real Met fans dont like the Yankees and real Yankee fans dont like the Mets for some reason   yeah   i never found i never quite found a New York fan       ive always found a fan you know of of either one or the other and so that of course means that when it comes to the American League my favorite team is the Red Sox   oh okay   by default because i went to college also in Boston   i see yeah i i like the uh uh i guess if i had to pick a favorite team id i anymore uh well as i kind of grew up rooting for Philadelphia   oh   im from New Jersey originally   yeah so that thats sort of close enough   yeah well we were thirty miles south of them so   oh so you were pretty close   right yeah right down the river but uh so what are the Mets going to do this year without Strawberry   well i dont know um theres theres a part of me that says that you know im im sort of glad Strawberry went away       you know when when he sort of went away i started thinking yeah well he was performing fairly well but he really wasnt worth the baggage you know   yeah   um i think theyre okay i think theyre you know i think they have enough people who are who are who are still in their prime you know um i mean certainly if you look at them compared to lets say you know um   umhum   just eight years ago or something theyre theyre theyre theyre you know theyre sort of in in good standing whereas you know um  i think   yeah   i certainly dont think that theyre the eighty six team anymore   uh well i was going to talk to you about that eighty six team  that was that was the year that uh they beat Houston in uh extra innings right   yeah i right they were either beat Houston in extra innings and then and then they actually won the series by by sort of a sneaky route um against Boston   yeah yeah   when there was the ball that was sort of hit to Buckner to Buckner   yeah   i felt real bad about that but hey what can you do   hey the guys making millions he ought to be able to perform right   thats right well actually he he he was supposedly um there was there was something wrong with him at the time and i   well his knees were bothering him yeah   right and i and i understand that and i say hey if the guy cant play you dont blame the team that uh hit it to him you blame the team you know for putting him in   yeah for having him out there   thats right so   sure   so i i i was uh i was also i was in school at Boston at the time   oh oh boy   so i it was actually wonderful because where i was there were half Met fans and um half Sox fans   yeah i think we were all pretty much uh Astros fans in the in the National National League Championship Series but theres like two fellows   oh yeah   from uh Brooklyn       and they they were you know they were they were pretty much without having to say it they were pretty much Mets fans   yeah yeah well i guess they were uh i guess they must have been scared   no not really they they were they were pretty much thugs they werent scared of very much you know   after the uh well thats good well yeah Brooklyn boys i guess   yeah   you dont expect them to be uh much of anything but thugs no i know i was born there um     yeah really   yeah so i i was i was also born in Brooklyn so i so i can call myself a Brooklyn thug although im really not   okay okay well im not to say that all folks from Brooklyn are thugs but these two were definitely thugs and they were from Brooklyn         so im kind of hoping i i i guess uh anymore i pretty much pull for the Rangers though they were uh theyre theyre theyre they they have the i think they have the best facilities in the major leagues   yeah   i love going to watch a game in Arlington stadium its great     well that thats actually i think that makes something because i think and and and as much as sort of fan support helps   yeah   you know its good to have um   the only problem is its not large enough it only holds about i think they squeezed when Ryan struck out his five thousandth player they they squeezed about forty thousand people in there   yes it is kind of small   yeah so theyre theyre they have plans i mean the the owner tried to move them to Florida but uh   right   they ended up sticking around in Arlington and theyre going to build a new stadium in Arlington as a matter of fact not even in Dallas so thats   oh thats oh thats great so   thats something that were looking forward to   yeah thatll be nice i mean that that i think tends to just keep i think stadiums have worked tend to keep people happy   oh yeah case in point Toronto   and yeah exactly   yeah have you seen a game up there   uh i havent been to any Toronto games yet but um   oh boy i saw i i was up there on business uh last June and watched a game in the sky dome it was just phenomenal thats thats probably the pattern for the future of stadiums i think   of stadiums yeah well i i mean to get up there i mean the the best ive been up here so far you know up in in in up state New York is uh is um   yeah uhhuh   a Rochester Red Wings game   now is is Rochester where where is Cornell University   uh Cornell is in Ithaca   Ithaca   uh yeah so Cornell is about um somewhere uh about two and a half hours south of south and east of us   okay   so if you know where Lake Ontario is sort of is uh   yeah well Rochesters like right on the shores isnt it   yeah were about ten miles south of Lake Ontario actually whoever built the city was an idiot in my opinion because they built it they built it far enough from the city that it actually couldnt be a port city   yeah okay okay   um but that   uh well they say that from that space needle up in Toronto you can see the lights of Rochester on a clear night   oh really i never i hadnt actually known that   yeah   well um but we have our own um our own triple A team here   yeah   the Redwings which is the uh farm team for the Orioles so everybody hopes that uh they go all the way around here theyre the theyre the big team in Rochester   yeah okay yeah those games are fun to watch you you you watch those games   oh i yeah i actually we we we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because theyre fun because theyre   yeah   lots of really big you know lots of local fans you know small stadium you know um and theyll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes you know um   umhum umhum   especially you know and ill um ill make a day game or something but they really seem to um people really get into it i mean i   yeah   i cant i i again i cant make any predictions about them but i suspect theyll go uh theyll go far     yeah we used to like watching my my folks lived down in Beaumont and uh on on the campus of Lamar University they used to house the the Beaumont Golden Gators who were a double A team for the Padres i think but uh they they were fun games to watch   yeah those those are those are always the i i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes   sometimes well theres definitely a lot more hitting   yes its true well       its one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are uh uh you know i guess i guess when you start pitching real well well move them up bam you know there goes the little the uh worst team   yeah   yeah   yeah but um so what   so as far as the major league teams i dont know it the Rangers have been you you know every year they they always knock on a door early and then just go into their skid about you know the end of June       but they theyve got so much young raw talent its just amazing and then they just havent been able to put anything together   uh well the way i the way i see it is i mean um you know i i can use a Met analogy here   umhum   if youll think back a few years to when the Mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but werent very sort of well trained you know back to the you know maybe eighty um eighty four or or eighty three or or eighty five you know when they were first when they werent quite the eighty six team that that that they were um   yeah umhum right   i that that probably gives the readers a good shot for you know this year or next year i think it you know the young talent really sort of has to build itself up   yeah i mean theyve been theyve been young for a while and theyre almost almost starting to age a little bit here i just um yeah they theyre theyre really hurting pitching wise i mean theyve got Ryan but you know who knows       what hell be able to do hes been last year he started having some nagging injuries and   right but that thats if if   but itll itll be interesting to watch i hope to get up there we we usually try to get to opening day game theres several guys from our church try to go up there   oh that must be nice   yeah well i i guess were probably oh maybe a hundred fifty miles south of Dallas   well see that isnt too bad  a couple hours   no not too bad about it takes about two hours two and a half hours to get there   yeah well itd take me a good seven hours to get to Shay Stadium       so so i dont know i dont   thats probably because of the roads you just dont yeah we weve just got a freeway we just get right on the freeway and just go north   yeah well actually we can we can i can take a highway the whole way down but its still its um   well its so crowded up there   its its almost four hundred hours i mean i mean it its almost four hundred you know barring traffic its four hundred hours i mean i mean four hundred miles four hundred hours right  four hundred miles   golly   barring traffic so its um it its uh you know its its a heck of a drive we are substantially north of New York enough that uh we dont get to go play   yeah um   too often   well i dont know youre youre youre like a boat ride from how how far is it across the lake to Canada Toronto   Toronto oh Torontos only about two hours yeah Toronto is i mean i i want to go see   yeah you do you drive there or do you take the ferry or what   um i can ive actually ive driven but ive heard about the ferry as well havent taken it yet though have you taken it   yeah yeah its a its a beautiful city   yeah um i i really love i i think thats one of the most uh enjoyable things about being up here im only up here for school   i really like it umhum   so i   so and then and then you go back to New York after school   uh no probably south maybe Texas actually   or New York City oh really   some place south and warm i dont im not a warm im not a big uh im not a big uh  cold fan   well what what kind of weather are you having right now   uh right now were actually having uh its getting nice i mean it was in the high fifties today but three and a half weeks ago we had an ice storm   oh boy yeah weve been up in the oh seventies eighties even up in the nineties a couple weeks ago already   oh thats great   were its   yeah well about that same time branches were falling off ev erywhere and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks   golly because of the ice   okay it didnt make the national national national national news too much which i find really weird   hum   but um we were i mean um you know all schools were closed for almost for for over or for for a week   golly   there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive   huh illegal   yeah because they had so many power lines down and so many uh   oh yeah   and so many things like that so they were
