                                 Taken to the Cleaners            My dry cleaner charges to clean and press a mans shirt and  for a womans blouse Whats goingon here            The lawsof arithmetic allow only two possibilities Womens clothing must be associatedeither with higher costs or with higher profit margins for the dry cleanerUnfortunately neither theory seems terribly plausible            Lets start with the higher cost theory In its mostnaive form this theory predicts that if I move the buttons on my dress shirtsfrom the right side to the left the cost of laundering them will more thantriple That ones not going to fly So to give the theory a fair chance wehave to look for more significant differences between mens and womensclothing            Well like what You couldargue that womens clothing is typically made of more delicate fabrics thanmens But if thats the relevant factor why dont dry cleaners just quotedifferent prices for different fabrics For some materials such as silk theytypically do quote separate prices The question is why this practicedoes not completely displace that of distinguishing between mens clothes andwomens            Analternative version of the theory is that womens clothes are costlier toprocess because women demand higher quality work I cant disprove thatversion but I have no real evidence to support it either So in a search forbetter alternatives I called three different dry cleaners and asked fortheir explanations The first said that mens shirts are machinepressed while womens are hand pressed That left me wondering why they dontsimply quote different prices for different kinds of pressing The second saidthat womens shirts require specialized treatment because they are typicallydoused with perfume That left me wondering why men who use aftershave are notchronically dissatisfied with their dry cleaners The third said that this wastheir pricing policy and if I didnt like it I was free to shopelsewhere            In the absence of a clear convincing storyabout genderspecific costs lets see what kind of story we can tell aboutgenderspecific profit margins In other words lets ask whether my drycleaner is exploiting female customers through higher markups            To makesense of that theory you have to ask why dry cleaners would want todiscriminate specifically against women as opposed to say men That strategymakes sense only if men are more pricesensitive than women and hence morelikely to walk away in the face of a high markup But why should men be morepricesensitive You could argue that men are less diligent about cleanlinessand so more likely to respond to high prices by wearing unlaundered shirts Butas long as were dealing in stereotypes you could argue equally well thatwomen are more willing to do their own laundryin which case womenwould be more likely to walk away from a high price and it would make moresense to discriminate against men            So it isnt clear which gender is the more naturalcandidate for getting soaked at the cleaners But theres a more fundamentalreason to doubt that either gender can be victimized by pricediscrimination and here it is There are over half a dozen dry cleaners withineasy walking distance of my house If theyre all earning higher profits onwomens blouses than on mens shirts why hasnt any of them decided tospecialize in womens blouses            Let memake that more concrete Suppose the going prices are  for a mans shirtand  for a womans blouse even though under the theory were currentlyentertaining they are equally expensive for the cleaner to handle Then if Iwere a dry cleaner I would announce a uniform price of  for all shirts andblousesthereby attracting all the womens business and none of the mensBecause nobody has adopted that obvious strategy we should suspect thatdespite appearances the profit margin on womens clothing cant be much higherthan on mens            In fact the process wouldnt stop there Assoon as I announced a uniform price of  my neighbor would announce a priceof  Ongoing competition for the temporarily more lucrative womensbusiness would quickly eliminate any profit differential            Thatargument rests on the fact that dry cleaners are highly competitive IfMicrosoft ran the entire dry cleaning industry it might very well choose todiscriminate against women or men depending on market conditions But in theworld we live inor at least in the neighborhood I live inthere areso many interchangeable dry cleaners that none of them should be able to getaway with exploiting anyone            One of my colleagues wives insists Ive got thiswrongshe says shes so loyal to her own dry cleaner that no discounter canlure away her business If most customers are as devoted as she is then eachdry cleaner is like a miniMicrosoft with its own captive customer base Inthat case price discrimination can survive But I am instinctively skepticalthat many customers are as fanatically loyal as my colleagues wife            The theorythat only a monopolist can price discriminate is standard textbook fare andits borne out by a lot of observations Movie theaters have a certain amountof monopoly power on a given night a given moviegoer is likely to have astrong preference for a particular movie at a particular theater and theyprice discriminate by offering discounts to senior citizens which isequivalent to discriminating against everybody under the age of Airlines have even more monopoly poweronce you know where and when you wantto fly you are likely to have an extremely limited choice of airlinesandthey heavily discriminate against business travelers by charging more formidweek flights than for weekend flights when most travel is for leisure            By contrast in the most competitiveindustries there is no price discrimination As I am fond of pointing out tomy students youve never heard of a wheat farmer who offers senior citizendiscounts Likewise for gas stations which are ubiquitous and sell to everyoneat a single price            Well atleast thats what I used to tell my students But I might have to make asmall change in my lesson plan The gas station nearest our campus has justannounced a policy of senior citizen discounts on Wednesday afternoons Is thisprice discrimination in favor of seniors or does it reflect a genuinely lowercost of serving them            If you push me hard enough I can probably concoct somekind of story about lower costs Maybe seniors tend to drive cars with biggergas tanks so they buy  gallons at a time instead of  thereby saving onthe cost of processing credit cards A significant part of that cost is thetime spent waiting for the card to be approved during which the pump isunavailable But if this cost saving is significant why has only one localgas station recognized it And why is it significant only on Wednesdays            I have suggested to mycolleagues that none of us should be permitted to present ourselves to theworld as economists until we figure out what this gas station is up to Nobodyhas risen to the challenge A few have suggested that perhaps the gas stationowner is just a little quirky Maybe thats right But it would be far harderto believe that the entire dry cleaning industry is just a little quirkyEither there is enough monopoly power to sustain price discrimination or thereis some reason why womens clothes are incredibly expensive to clean and pressBut I have no idea which
