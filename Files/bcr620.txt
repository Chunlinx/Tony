                    Introduction        Breast cancer is a major cause of death among women in        the United States and worldwide     While cures are        probable if the cancer is detected early and remains        localized many patients will succumb to the disease if the        primary tumor metastasizes to secondary organs Although        significant progress has been made in detecting and        treating the primary tumor the ability to predict the        metastatic behavior of a patients tumor and to eradicate        or control recurrent disseminated malignancy remain major        clinical challenges in oncology        We have previously characterized an experimental system        that enables comparative molecular screening and functional        evaluation of candidate breast metastasisrelated genes in        an isogenic background     Two independent clones of        opposing metastatic phenotype were derived from the        MDAMB breast tumor cell line metasatic MA and        nonmetastatic NMC cell lines When inoculated into the        mammary fat pad of athymic mice both cell lines form        primary tumors While clone MA aggressively metastasizes        to the lung and lymph nodes the NMC clone is entirely        nonmetastatic Initial comparative gene expression analysis        of the two clones revealed the secreted integrinbinding        protein osteopontin OPN    to be significantly        increased in the metastatic MA cell line Conversely        the expression of thrombospondin TSP    and of        tyrosinaserelated protein TYRP was markedly        overexpressed in the nonmetastatic NMC cell line                    OPN is a secreted glycophosphoprotein expressed by a        number of cell types including leukocytes and epithelial        lineages and it has been implicated biologically in bone        development in immune system regulation     and in        multiple mechanisms through signal transduction via its        binding to integrins     OPN has been detected in        primary breast tumors and is elevated in the plasma of        patients with metastatic breast cancer      but an        association between elevated levels of primary tumor OPN        and metastatic burden has not been well established        TSP is a homotrimeric multidomain glycoprotein        synthesized and secreted by numerous cell types including        platelets vascular smooth muscle cells and keratinocytes            Due to its interaction with a wide variety of        proteins TSP has been implicated in a number of        biological processes including coagulation cell adhesion        the modulation of cellcell and cellmatrix interactions        control of tumor growth and metastasis and angiogenesis            Inhibition of tumor cell proliferation has been        achieved         in vivo by systemic treatment with        TSP peptide mimetics     but a correlation between        primary tumor TSP expression and poor prognosis has not        been clearly established     While there are reports        that these molecules can originate from tumor cells            the majority of reports have suggested that the major        source of both TSP and OPN is tumorassociated stroma           or infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes                   The melanogenic enzymes TYRP and TYRP are        wellcharacterized differentiation antigens recognized by        antibodies and T cells of patients with melanoma            The evaluation of TYRP expression in human breast lesions        has not been documented to date        The aim of the present work was to examine the cellular        distribution of OPN of TSP and of TYRP in human breast        tissue and to determine whether the relative expression        level of these three genes was associated with malignancy        or breast tumor metastasis To overcome the problem of        heterogeneity and stromal cell contamination in homogenized        tissue specimens specific cell types were isolated by        laser capture microdissection LCM prior to analysis We        used a combination of immunohistochemistry IHC LCM and        realtime quantitative PCR qPCR analysis of material        obtained from a panel of primary breast infiltrating ductal        carcinomas and nodal metastases and compared the target        gene expression levels with those found in nonmalignant        diseased tissue and in samples of normal breast tissue                    Materials and methods                  Tissue samples          Sixtyeight frozen human breast tissue specimens were          evaluated by LCM qPCR and IHC including  primary          tumors of infiltrating ductal carcinomas  primary          tumors with

addition eight          tumorassociated stromal components including          fibroblasts endothelial cells and inflammatory cells          were microdissected from primary tumors without known          metastases for analysis          Breast tissues were obtained from surgical specimens          at the John Radcliffe Hospital Oxford UK and at the          UCSD Medical Center Samples were obtained in random          order from the residue of tissue used for pathological          diagnosis that would otherwise have been discarded          Tissues were snapfrozen immediately after resection and          were stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis Four pairs          of additional formalinfixed paraffinembedded FFPE          specimens of primary infiltrating ductal carcinomas and          of matched nodal metastasis were also used for IHC only          total of  samples for IHC Histological diagnosis of          all samples was performed using HEstained cryostat          sections JWR The histological grade was assigned          according to the modified BloomRichardson grading scheme              Tissue samples were obtained and processed under          approval of the UCSD Institutional Review Board for          studying existing tissues X                          Laser capture microdissection          The total number of samples studied using LCM and qPCR          were

OPN antibody          was optimized using the secondary biotinylated rabbit          antirat antibody  and streptavidinhorseradish          peroxidase  DAKO Primary tumors recovered from          nude mice inoculated with the MA and NMC MDAMB          clones    were used as positive controls          Tumor specimen staining was scored as positive or          negative Positive staining was defined as  of the          tumor cells or the benign epithelial components examined          having distinct cytoplasmic staining The four additional          FFPE archived ductal carcinomas and the matched nodal          metastases            n   were stained with the          aforementioned antibodies using the antigen retrieval          method now described to assess the utility of the

                 Immunohistochemical detection of OPN TSP and          TYRP in human breast tissues          The efficacy and specificity of OPN TSP and TYRP          antibodies in IHC was tested by analysis of frozen tissue          xenografts of known target gene expression               Positive cytoplasmic staining was detected with the OPN          antibody in nine of   primary breast carcinomas          with nodal metastases A representative example is          depicted in Figure  Six of   metastatic tissue          samples and five of nine  primary tumors without          metastases were OPNpositive Incubation of fibroadenoma          and normal breast tissue specimens with the OPN antibody          also produced positive staining in the epithelial cells          of  of nonmalignant cases five fibroadenomas and          three normal breast tissues OPN was also regularly          observed in tumorinfiltrating inflammatory cells and          macrophages Fig  Although difficult to quantitate a          trend of OPN localization towards the epithelial layer          but not the myoepithelial layer was observed in normal          breast tissue Fig  Overall the degree and intensity          of OPN expression was qualitatively equal in samples of          adenomas adenocarcinomas and nodal metastases from          patients with disseminated disease The majority of          primary carcinomas  that were positive for OPN also          had concurrent OPNpositive metastases          IHC staining of breast tissue sections revealed          intracytoplasmic staining of TSP in six of            nodepositive primary carcinomas and in  of            metastases In this case all positive primaries had          positive associated metastases although some metastatic          tumors with positive TSP expression had negative TSP          stain in their primary tumors TSP staining was          positive in two of nine primary carcinomas without          metastases  Very weak staining was observed in          fibroadenoma and normal tissues and no TSP was          detected in breast tissue stromal components          A high percentage of nodepositive primary tumors           metastatic carcinomas  and  concordance          between primary tumor and associated metastasis          respectively primary carcinomas without metastases           benign breast specimens  and normal           breast specimens were positive for TYRP staining Fig           TYRP staining was confined to the cytoplasm and to          the epithelial components of the tissue The staining          achieved with all three antibodies was relatively          homogeneous across the tumor in positive cases and no          qualitative differences in staining were apparent at the          invasive edge of the carcinomas No correlation was found          between protein expression and tumor grade in the          infiltrating ductal carcinomas and no consistent          qualitative differences were revealed between primary          tissues with or without associated metastases                          LCM and qPCR analysis of breast tissues          While providing information on the cellular          distribution of target gene expression the technique of          onecolor chromogenic IHC staining can result in highly          variable data across samples and it relies on visual          scoring that is relatively subjective To obtain          accurate quantitative information on target gene          expression we employed qPCR technology The selection of          specific cell types from the heterogeneous cellular          composition of the tissue specimens was attained by LCM          This procedure allowed OPN TSP and TYRP mRNA          analysis in specific cells of interest in each case          eliminating the contribution from normal adjacent cells          that could cause difficulties in interpretation          The cells of interest in the majority of cases were          those of epithelial origin but eight specimens were also          used for the isolation of tumorassociated stroma          fibroblast endothelial and inflammatory cells for          comparison We measured the expression levels of the OPN          TSP and TYRP genes using a quantitative PCR assay          RTqPCR This analysis in line with the findings of          the IHC data confirms that breast tumor cells themselves          synthesize OPN TSP and TYRP in addition to          tumorinfiltrating macrophages in the case of OPN          Normal and nonmalignant breast epithelia and stromal          elements expressed reduced levels of OPN and TYRP          transcripts Figures   demonstrate the differential          expression pattern and the quantitative expression level          of each of the three genes in human breast tissues          Relative to the GAPDH transcript levels OPN expression          was found to be fold higher than TYRP expression in          all tissues examined TSP expression was comparable          with that of TYRP in malignant cells but was at the          limit of detection in normal and benign epithelia and          stromal components          OPN mRNA was found to be present in all microdissected          tissue samples examined Significantly elevated fold          levels of OPN transcripts were observed in cells of          epithelial origin dissected from primary carcinomas and          associated metastases over nonmalignant cell sources All          primary tumors combined            P   and all metastases            P   exhibited significantly          elevated OPN expression compared with normal epithelia          Fig  However there was no difference in OPN          expression between primary carcinomas with metastases and          those without metastases Nor was there a quantitative          difference in OPN expression between primary carcinomas          and matched metastases Fig           While trace amounts were detected due to the          sensitivity of PCR amplification thrombospondin          transcripts were essentially absent from breast tissue          epithelia obtained from normal and benign specimens and          there were no appreciable levels detected in stromal          tissue components However TSP levels were          significantly raised in malignant tissue epithelial          sources Fig  TSP levels were significantly higher          fold in all primary tumors            P   and in all metastases                     P   over normal breast          epithelia In line with the OPN patterns of expression          there was no significant difference in TSP levels          between primary tumors with or without metastases nor          between primary carcinomas and associated metastases          TYRP expression was higher than that of TSP but          lower than that of OPN fold to fold While TYRP          transcripts could be detected in all tissues examined          Fig  including malignant and nonmalignant sources          there were no significant quantitative differences          revealed between the types of tissue                            Discussion        A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms        involved in metastatic spread is needed to facilitate        advances in prognostic evaluation for individual patients        and in the design of therapeutic interventions to inhibit        the process In an effort to establish a methodological        framework for analysis of the molecules and the mechanisms        involved in this complex multistep process we previously        developed a welldefined experimental system in which the        role of candidate genes can be screened and tested            By serial dilution cloning of the MDAMB tumor cell        line and screening by orthotopic implantation into the        mammary fat pad of athymic mice we derived a pair of        breast tumor cell lines MA and NMC that originate        from the same breast tumor but that have diametrically        opposite metastatic capabilities Through multiple        molecular analyses we have identified and verified a number        of genes whose expression correlates with the metastatic        phenotype in this xenograft model The expression of the        proteins TSP and TYRP were found to correlate with the        nonmetastatic phenotype whereas OPN was significantly        elevated in the metastatic counterpart These findings        prompted us to investigate the occurrence and distribution        of these molecules in human breast tissues The        investigative approach was designed to detect and quantify        the three molecules in specific breast tissue components        data that were not previously available        Having detected all three proteins immunohistochemically        in normal benign and malignant breast epithelia the        quantitation of OPN TSP and TYRP mRNA was achieved        using LCM and qPCR This technique allows for the accurate        procurement of cells from specific microscopic regions of        tissue sections and therefore enables the molecular        genetic analysis of pure populations of malignant breast        cells in their native tissue environment     This        technical advance helps one to avoid the variation and        subjectivity associated with IHC and to overcome the        limitations of data interpretation caused by tissue        heterogeneity and normal stromal cell contamination in        homogenized tissue specimens Coupled with qPCR LCM can        reveal significant differences in specific gene expression        that are not accessible with relatively insensitive IHC        alone        We have demonstrated that human breast epithelia can        themselves synthesize OPN and to a lesser extent TSP        and TYRP         in vivo  and that elevated OPN and        TSP levels are indicative of malignancy Significant OPN        expression has been reported in a number of breast        epithelial cell lines      and so it is known that        cells of breast epithelial origin can synthesize OPN in        certain conditions But it is possible that         in vitro OPN expression is a        phenomenon of cell culture or that OPNpositive cells have        a selective growth advantage during extended passage        Synthesis of OPN was also observed in infiltrating        lymphocytes and macrophages a factor that would seriously        compromise efforts to quantify OPN in homogenized tissue        specimens Such analysis would highlight tumors with a high        level of infiltrating inflammatory cells rather than        evaluate the levels of the marker molecules in the        proliferative epithelia of a lesion        As observed in IHC tumorinfiltrating inflammatory        cells were presumably the stromal source of OPN Transcript        levels in normal and fibroadenoma epithelia were equal to        those found in isolated stroma indicating that the        scattered infiltrating macrophages not lymphocytes have        relatively high OPN expression The presence of        inflammatory infiltration is a serious problem in the        molecular analysis of tissue samples if the tissue is        homogenized prior to analysis The presence of OPN in        inflammatory cells highlights the advantage of        microdissection in this analytical context        High levels of OPN in breast tumor cell lines appear to        correlate with a more aggressive         in vivo phenotype             Transfection of OPN expression constructs into cells        producing noninvasive mammary epithelial tumors has been        reported to convert them to a malignant phenotype             Furthermore transfection of antisense OPN constructs or        OPNtargeting ribozymes into transformed tumorigenic cells        can result in impaired anchorageindependent growth as        well as in diminished tumorforming ability         in vivo      OPN is also        typically overexpressed in human tumors including breast        cancer      However the source of OPN in primary        breast tumors was originally thought to be infiltrating        macrophages rather than tumor cells themselves            By applying         in situ hybridization Tuck and        colleagues identified breast tumor cells as a source of OPN            Using a semiquantitative scoring system to        evaluate immunohistochemical staining these investigators        found a correlation between OPN positivity defined as         of tumor cells in a section staining for OPN in        lymph nodenegative primary breast carcinomas and patient        survival suggesting that tumor cells with elevated OPN        levels may behave differently with regard to disease        progression     Another recent study showed        immunohistochemically that while OPN protein is expressed        weakly in normal breast tissue OPN is expressed strongly         tumor cell staining in pregnantlactating tissue        and in the majority  of breast carcinomas These        investigators also found that the presence of OPN on tumor        cells is correlated with patient demise            Our LCMmediated transcript detection acts as an        important confirmation of breast tumor cell OPN synthesis        because IHC analysis does not rule out the possibility that        secreted proteins such as OPN and TSP are sequestered by        the tumor cells from the local environment Experiments        with cell lines show that tumor cells can bind soluble OPN        and can migrate towards an OPN concentration gradient             sequestration from the extracellular matrix         in vivo is thus pertinent In the        present study the epithelial layer appeared to express        more OPN than the myoepithelial cells suggesting some OPN        accumulation or induction via the myoepithelial layer or        via stromal interactions Unfortunately the resolution of        LCM does not enable the selection of epithelial cells from        myoepithelial cells and so we were unable to confirm this        quantitatively        The effect of TSP expression on tumor growth and        metastasis has been examined         in vivo by orthotopic inoculation of        TSPoverexpressing MDAMB cells A dosedependent        inhibition of spontaneous pulmonary metastases was        reported but this was paralleled by an inhibition of        primary tumor growth     TSP has also been        implicated in the phenomenon of concomitant tumor        resistance This refers to the ability of some large        primary tumors to hold smaller distant tumors in check        preventing their progressive growth Volpert and colleagues        demonstrated this phenomenon using tumors formed by the        human fibrosarcoma line HT in nude mice and obtained        data indicating that it was caused by secretion of TSP by        the primary tumor     Some of the properties        attributed to TSP are conflicting however TSP can be        both adhesive and antiadhesive         in vitro  can stimulate or inhibit        angiogenesis and can inhibit or enhance proteolytic enzyme        activity The composition of the matrix the availability        of cytokines and proteases and the expression of various        receptors in a given cellular environment might explain        these opposing functions        Our findings in the MDAMB metastasis model are in        agreement with TSP playing a role in the reduction of        metastatic potential     Clinically TSP expression        is inversely correlated with tumor grade and survival rate        in a number of cancers      most probably because of        the antiangiogenic effect of TSP A recent study        confirms this to be the case in breast cancer where        expression of TSP in stroma adjacent to ductal carcinoma         in situ is lost in cases with more        aggressive histological features     There are also        reports however that fibroblast TSP can induce matrix        metalloproteinase in breast tumor cells and gastric        cancer tumor cells and this in turn may lead to a more        invasive phenotype      In the present study TSP        was not expressed differentially in the stroma of benign        tissue specimens or malignant tissue specimens nor in the        epithelial component of breast tumors with or without        metastases The increased levels observed in malignant        breast epithelia suggest a shift in the balance between the        antiangiogenic and proinvasive effects of TSP during        tumor progression The precise biological role of TSP in        human tumor progression awaits more definitive study        In the present study TYRP mRNA was present but at        very low levels in breast tumor tissue in associated        stroma and in normal breast tissues However IHC reveals        that TYRP protein staining is easily detectable in many        samples The melanogenic enzymes tyrosinase TYRP and        TYRP are wellcharacterized differentiation antigens        recognized by antibodies and T cells of patients with        melanoma TYRP is a type I membrane protein expressed by        melanomas and normal melanocytes that was originally        characterized as an oxidase in the melanin biosynthetic        pathway Clinically TYRP is thought to be important as a        melanoma antigen that is highly antigenic to cytotoxic T        cells providing a potential target for melanoma vaccine        development     TYRP appears to be less expressed in        advanced primary lesions and metastases of human cutaneous        melanoma and uveal melanoma     Primary melanoma        samples express TYRP transcripts at higher levels than        melanoma metastases     and IHC analysis of malignant        melanocytic lesions has shown that the invasive cells of        primary melanomas are TYRPnegative            Our finding that TYRP is also expressed in the poorly        metastatic or noninvasive cell lines NMC     TD        MCF and DU     which are derived from human breast        cancers and prostate tumors that are nonmetastatic        indicates that this molecule is not exclusively expressed        in cells of the melanocytic lineage It has long been known        that the sera of patients who suffer from melanoma or        mammary carcinoma show higher tyrosinase activity than        normal sera    but to our knowledge this is the first        report of TYRP expression in human breast duct        epithelium The biological function of and any clinical        significance of TYRP expression in normal or malignant        breast carcinomas are presently unknown                    Conclusion        We have quantitatively analyzed transcripts of OPN of        TSP and of TYRP in microdissected human breast tissues        Elevated levels of OPN and TSP expression in primary and        metastatic carcinomas suggest that these genes may be        necessary for but not sufficient for dissemination Tumor        cells that synthesize matrixassociated factors such as OPN        and TSP may increase their ability to independently        manipulate their surroundings encouraging invasion and        migration These studies suggest that the quantitative        analyses of OPN andor TSP may be clinically useful in        identifying malignant lesions over benign lesions but they        are not as yet promising markers for the evaluation of        primary tumors for metastatic propensity                    Competing interests
