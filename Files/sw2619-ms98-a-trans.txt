          well um what  what do you think about the metric system uh do you uh find it usable have you tried much with it   well with with an engineering degree its of course its a whole lot easier   yeah umhum to use you mean uhhuh   because uh yeah if if somebody had is totally unfamiliar with it uh human nature being what it is we dont like to change   yes   uh it just makes absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because its all decimal   yes   and its so easy to convert from one set of units to another   umhum umhum well ive ive lived both in the United States and and in a country where they do use the metric system and uh so ive ive lived with pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over um the secret seeming to me is to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and pounds to kilometers   right   uh kilograms and i think thats what hung people up the most is they went now wait a minute an inch is two point fifty four centimeters how on earth am i every going to do the math   thats right right right   and the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail or whatever and you know  and leaving it at that and uh you know a kilogram weighs about this much and get used to it from scratch cause i still cant convert back and forth from inches to centimeters but im perfectly comfortable using either   uhhuh   and i think the real problem with this this weird conversion you see signs that say fifty five miles per hour and you know whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour you know people you know its hard to take it seriously   oh yeah   and as long as both were given you basically just dont read the kilometers per hour you just say well look read the miles per hour one the other one must be for someone else   thats right   uh i dont know i mean even Britain has converted over and we inherited this mess from them and uh   thats right its all their fault   well i mean its more our fault than theirs at this point because they they saw the light um i dont know why they were um were more able than we were except i think that they probably just said well were just going to start using the things now and you sort of have to force people to change since they dont want to   of course being part of the European community if everybody else did it they they were probably much more is much more necessary for them than for us     thats true thats thats probably true and America does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way  rather than adopting you know some other model   well uh theres an expression for that with eyes on the past backing confidently into the future   ive never heard that one thats very nice oh so im all for the metric system and converting over and i think i guess my feeling is the way to do it is is to just start giving weights you know have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers or just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and uh just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert remember me getting a package of something that said one pound is a package of dates mind you its was presumably something you weigh fairly precisely it said one pound  and then in parenthesis it said four hundred and fifty four point six grams   right right   and as near as i could tell seeing that was basically antimetric propaganda cause anyone who would say well look i can either buy a pound of something at four hundred sixty four point six grams which of course they couldnt weigh it out accurately anyway um every time i see something like that i think well thats thats an antimetric argument   yep well i i dont think itll it could ever happen with with a quick transition   you dont   no i i think that would be the easiest way but human nature being such as it is   umhum umhum   i would think it would take probably two or three years before people could could completely cut the cord   yeah oh oh thats what i was thinking by quick transition i didnt mean you know i didnt mean like Sweden going over to right hand drive or anything you know  at midnight tonight we all switch over or anything   did they switch   uh i believe so yeah and i think they did it overnight cause you know you cant do it gradually  thats an example of something you cant do gradually   well thats true it it has to be kind of a discreet transaction   yes it does  a quantum leap from left to right hand drive       and they but you know that must have taken uh that was something that had to be done quickly you know because of external circumstances but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of Europe or the rest of continental Europe and   interesting oh yes yeah yeah   you know but that must have been tremendously difficult to orchestrate um   im sure   so i i i i i think its essential that its done and i think the real trick is to avoid the you know a little more attention to human psychology and whereas people want round numbers and after all the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers so they dont deal with thirty seconds of an inch and so what the exact   exactly exactly   the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented really i think   well we do have the two liter soda pop bottles   uhhuh i saw that i saw that the other day i dont dont drink soda pop but i saw a two liter soda pop bottle so yeah things like that   yeah   are a good start and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the the you know the odd numbers you know  two point two pounds or something i think people will start getting a sense of gee the metric is the sensible one   right yes thats true well sure have enjoyed our talk   yes well get back to what youre doing and ill do the same i enjoyed talking with you too  okay byebye   okay God bless byebye
