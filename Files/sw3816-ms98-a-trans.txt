        ready so what do you think do we spend too much on the space program or     well i think they ought to spend uh i dont think they ought to spend overly spend on it but uh i dont see anything wrong with you know having a pretty good budget for it because uh   do you   heck i dont know i dont i think maybe one day they will uh find a good use for it you know maybe they havent all that much yet uh other than the little things theyve developed in this space shuttle   uhhuh yeah   the little experiments that theyve done and so forth you know   uhhuh   in uh i know they asked the question uh would you go if you had the chance and id go tomorrow   yeah we could oh really   if i had a chance   oh youre an adventurer huh   yeah right   what makes it what makes it so exciting for you   well i dont know i just it would be something ive never experienced before weightlessness id love to experience weightlessness thats something ive always uh thought would be fascinating you know   yeah that thatd be fun thatd be a lot of fun uhhuh thats true yeah id id have to id think once or twice but i think id probably do it just for the experience i  guess but itd be pretty interesting thats for sure   yeah yeah i think so when they had the uh accident you know back the space shuttle accident and i thought well maybe i wont go  you know but uh since then i thought well what the heck id go if it would be a one time once in lifetime experience id try it   uhhuh    oh yeah you couldnt couldnt pass it up thats for sure   no i dont think so   you think itll ever happen where theyll let itll be common or   uh it might it it very well may uh i think its sort a   uhhuh   had a setback because of that accident and uh and sometimes i get really disappointed because they have so many delays when they have a launch   yeah yeah thats true   and everything i think gee you know theyll never get this worked out it just seems like they they delay it more and more every time they have a launch   uhhuh yeah   so i dont know you know they seems like they sort of bog down theyre not really progressing right now to me   yeah im im kind of anxious to see what they do with this uh uh this space station theyre talking about  you know i think thatd be  a step to where you know in the right direction but   yeah yeah yeah yeah well i believe that uh theyll eventually make it to Mars you know maybe not in our lifetime but uh you know if this world is still here  at that time i think theyll i think theyll eventually do that      uhhuh yeah   yeah id uh just the way we progress i i like i say id hate to see them cut out the the  budget theres a lot of places you know that can use it but  just you know simple things like Teflon stuff like that all came from the Apollo mission  yeah things they developed   right is that right i didnt realize that   you know in that program you know i mean mean mean just common everyday things that we take for granted but   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   you know thats as an offshoot its kind of like the military budget you know theres a lot of things we use because they put so much money in the military   sure sure   that we end up using just a you know everyday stuff but something like that Teflon something you take for granted you use it every day but   yeah yeah yeah yeah   if it hadnt of been for something like that youd never you know really not have got it so   yeah well thats true thats true and i guess theyve got a lot of uh theyve done a lot of medical tests   uhhuh   uh in space too and uh i mean i dont know what theyve theyve actually come up with   uhhuh   but uh i know that medicine is another area that they used that theyve used in space a lot you know   well they said yeah uhhuh they say in you know in weightlessness theyre theyre able to do a lot of different things with the chemicals and minerals that they cant do with the gravity so   thats right right right   there could be some valuable i guess theres a shuttle going up tomorrow as far as i   is that no i dont even know about that   yeah i think its theyve been a little concerned because its kind of chilly its cold you know like you say so theyre worried about the   oh  yeah the the the ice   same thing that happened to the Challenger but they are going up to do some tests with some organisms uh organisms and stuff and weightlessness to see how they uh   right uhhuh   how they react to that and everything but so i think i think youre right though theyre getting little better and better sooner sooner you know sooner or later theyre going to make some major breakthroughs   right to the weightlessness yeah i think i think theyll work it out eventually yeah like you say it will be a major breakthrough right now theyre sort of sort of sitting still but i think eventually it will uh theyll it will come to them   uhhuh   you know   yeah its just a matter of time i guess nothing ever comes without nothing ever comes without some effort so   thats right well you know talking about the weightlessness ive uh ive uh noticed that theyve talked about like these Russian astronauts stay up there for nearly a year   uhhuh   you know they have a lot of problems with the im not sure what it is with the the muscle muscle tone and so forth because they uh   oh really   they have been weightless so long and then they course they exercise but its not the same as exercising with gravity and the i im not sure exactly   oh really i hadnt heard that   what the deal was but there were some problems with long term weightlessness   uhhuh oh really   yeah and they were trying to figure out how to solve that problem if they were planning on going to Mars because you know it would be a real long term talking about a couple of years i guess   yeah huh so it was just that their muscles werent as well toned as they started or   i im not sure if it was tone or exactly what it was but i i remember they had a lot of problems with their uh when when they got back to Earth uh walking you know they walk they couldnt walk very well   uhhuh   uhhuh oh really huh   when they finally made it back into gravity and uh im not sure exactly why that was you know i mean it was because of the weightlessness but im not sure physiologically what happened   yeah
