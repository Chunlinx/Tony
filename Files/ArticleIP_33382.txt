Bush is thefrontrunner that Steve Forbes is in second place and that Dan Quayle whofinished back in the pack with Lamar Alexander will soon join Alexander on thesidelines But Ames failed to resolve the fate of the candidates who came inthird and fourthElizabeth Dole and Gary Bauerand the one who skipped AmesJohn McCain For these three the postgame spin contest is crucial Heres aplayback of their takes on the straw poll results and a look ahead at theirplaybook of messages for the remainder of the race                           ElizabethDole                                       Playback                                        Top three Dole needed to get within striking distance ofBush and to seal off the rest of the pack behind her On Meet the Press Face the Nation  and Late Edition  she boasted that she hadcracked the top three Pundits bought the threewinners line treating Amesas a horse race win place and show and noting that no ones ever won theRepublican nomination without finishing in the top three at Ames Newspaperscramped for space confined their headlines to Bush Forbes and Dole ThoughDoles  percent was closer to Bauers  than to Forbes  she earned asolid third and a place among the leaders by crossing the doubledigitthreshold As Fox News Carl Cameron put it The other seven candidates couldnot crack double digits                            Race for third Since Bush and Forbes were expected tofinish first and second many pundits concluded as Lisa Myers put it onMeet the Press  that the real race here was for third Elizabeth Dolewon that The Boston Globe called Dole the winner of thiscontestwithinthecontest Dole touted her victory on every talk show andcited the Myers and Globe quotes in a press release At a newsconference an aide introduced Dole as the straw polls real winner                            Underdog In every TV interview Dole claimed to have beenoutspent by millions of dollars Her spokesman told reporters that on adollarpervote basis Elizabeth Dole trounced George Bush and Steve ForbesReporters love an underdog From a strict costbenefit standpoint the bigwinner may be Elizabeth Dole concluded Time                             Comeback kid Dismissive coverage of Dole before the strawpoll played to her advantage as everyone marveled at her surprisingly strongthird Dole Revived the Washington Post s front page proclaimed OnThis Week  George Will conceded There had been a lot of very skepticalstories about whether her people would show up She therefore I think is thebiggest winner                           Playbook                                        Race for second Forbes wants to fastforward the GOPtournament to a finals bracket Bush vs Forbes To prevent this Dole needs tocreate a semifinal playoffForbes vs Doleto determine who gets to playBush Despite Forbes huge financial advantage we finished close to secondDole told reporters Saturday night This is going to become a twopersonrace The press agreed Forbes had growing hopes  that he might upset Bushor finish a close second recalled the Post  Instead he finishedcloser to Dole than to Bush                            Experience Having narrowed the field to three Dole needsto focus the contest on criteria that favor her The first of these ispolitical experience of which Bush has little and Forbes has almost none Onevery talk show Dole vowed to demonstrate that the candidate with the mostexperience is more qualified than the candidates with the most money  Weretalking about president of the United States                            Gender This is the more obvious criterion thatdistinguishes Dole She hardly needs to mention itthe media bring it upanywaybut she invokes it subtly alluding as she did on two Sunday talkshows to women who drive their daughters halfway across the state to shake myhand a woman they dare to believe in Newspapers hail Doles female followersas evidence that she can attract new voters to the GOP

analogies tend to cut off the top tier at threerather than four eg bronze medal win place and show Bauer changedmetaphors telling reporters that he had reached the first rung of candidatesand that lower finishers might soon perish On Meet the Press  he calledhimself the breakout candidate While some pundits lumped Bauer with thewinners others offered him the next best positionleading the rest of thepackor at least distinguished him from the losers                            Social conservative quarterfinal This was Bauers big spinwin Like Dole he won a crucial contestwithinthecontest His scant marginover Pat Buchanan percent to  percentbecame a huge factor in thepostpoll analysis Pundits concluded that Bauer did what he had to do beat Pat Buchanan and therefore can legitimately say he is the candidate ofthe Christian right establishing himself as one of the winners the threeor four candidates who got their tickets punched to stay in the race Talkshow hosts reminded Buchanan that he had lost to Bauer and asked whetherBuchanan was finished                            Conservative semifinal Having scored well ahead of Bauerand Buchanan Forbes anointed himself the conservative in a twoman raceagainst Bush Bauer disagreed and the media took his side Forbes BauerBattle for Right the Post proclaimed concluding that because Forbesfailed to break away he and Bauer are likely to continue a long and toughfight for the leadership of the conservative wing                            Underdog Bauer couldnt claim to be more strapped thanDole so he claimed underdog status on the basis of low name recognitioninexperience and workingclass heritage I am running against some big bios the son of a former president the son of a tycoon and the wife of asenator Bauer argued on Late Edition  I have never run for presidentor office before And yet here we come in fourth place Newsweek sDavid Brooks wrote that Bauer overcame his own financial disadvantages andjoined Dole as the two surviving HaveNot candidates                           Playbook                                        Buchanan will defect Since Buchanans combativeness andloyal base make him hard to write off as a candidate his rivals have persuadedthe media at least to write him off as a Republican by inferring that his lowscore at Ames will prompt him to transfer to the Reform Party The moreBuchanan fends off comparisons to Bauer by emphasizing his protectionism themore he plays into this scenario                            Populism With Buchanan out of the way Bauer will go afterForbes When asked on television about Forbes claim to represent the rightBauer cited Forbes wealth and called himself the son of a maintenance manOn This Week  George Stephanopoulos agreed that Bauer is becoming thepopulist in the race noting that Bauers supporters love the fact that hewas the son of a janitor                            Conservatism If Bauer wins the social conservativequarterfinal and the conservative semifinal he gets to run as the Reagancandidate against BushGore moderation on abortion Hollywood China andother hotbutton issues This bracketbybracket tournament strategy reducesBauers obstacles from three candidates to two He can target Forbes knowingthat if he prevails either Bush or Dole will have vanquished the other in themoderate semifinal Indeed Doles success at Ames arguably helps Bauer bygiving Bush a semifinal contest                           JohnMcCain                                       Playback                                        Ames meant nothing to him Despite having skipped the strawpoll McCain was invited onto Face the Nation and Fox News Sundayto discuss it If youre going to be taken seriously Brit Hume asked himdont you have to face up to the fact when all the other candidates decidethat an event is worth attending  that maybe youve got to play too Inreply McCain repeatedly called Ames meaningless His chutzpah bowled overthe pundits Stephanopoulos called McCains noshow a pretty smart move andportrayed the  votes he won in the straw pollputting him in last placeamong active Republican candidatesas evidence of his strength                            Ames meant death for others Noting that McCain hadbypassed the event Quayle explained on Face the Nation that he tooalmost took a pass on this It wasnt until George Bush said he was going toparticipate that then I said OK weve got to do it out of respect to theIowa Republican Party The result Quayle pleaded was that he lost tocandidates who had been in Iowa years and months McCain explaining hisdecision to stay out espoused a less sentimental philosophy You always wantto fight on ground that is most favorable to you For this the media executedQuayle and spared McCain Quayle and Lamar Alexander might be gone but Ithink McCain is still in concluded NPRs Mara Liasson Ames was Vietnam inreverse McCain ducked the fight and Quayle took the beating                            Viability Once the dust has settled from the straw pollMcCain regally announced I will review the new political landscape and beginengaging the other Republican candidates Why does McCain get a bye Becausehe has convinced the media that he has enough money and support in NewHampshire South Carolina and other states to skip Iowa and catch fire laterNewsweek  the New York Times  the Los Angeles Times  andseveral TV pundits agreed that McCain remains formidable wasnt hurt by Amesand may well end up as the principal alternative to Bush                            Votebuying To undermine the straw polls authority as anarbiter of his candidacy McCain called it a fundraiser a sham and a jokein which campaigns spent millions to buy votes My campaign theme is totry to reform the system that is now awash with money and the influence ofspecial interests he argued on Fox News Sunday  Brit Humesretortthat this whole process isnt quite pure enough for youplayed rightinto McCains hands McCain doesnt need to persuade the media that his reasonsfor skipping Ames were morally sound He just needs to persuade them that hisreasons were moral rather than political                           Playbook                                        Real votes The votebuying complaint only gets McCain abye on the straw poll To get another bye on Februarys Iowa caucuses hellrely on two other moral arguments First hell claim that caucuses arentreal votes Well have real votes in New Hampshire McCain argued on FoxNews Sunday  Thats where real people are motivated to vote On Facethe Nation  he suggested that he would focus on the genuine ballotingprocess which takes place in New Hampshire and then South Carolina                            Ethanol Many pundits fancying themselves shrewd suggestthat McCains true reason for skipping Iowa is that he has taken a position onethanol subsidies thats unpalatable to voters in Iowa On This Week Stephanopoulos suggested that McCain might have to do something dramaticsuch as make a stand and say Were not going to compete in Iowa We thinkthese ethanol subsidies are an abomination  This is McCains greatesttriumph He has conned the media into disbelieving his political calculationsand accusing him instead of principle Ive taken a lot of unpopularpositions he conceded on Fox News Sunday                             Experience The longer McCain stays out of the race withoutdamaging his credibility the more the field narrows to his advantageAlexander and Rep John Kasich ROhio are already gone Quayle and Sen OrrinHatch RUtah wont be far behind If the field dwindles to Bush Forbes andBauer McCain can sell himself as the only experienced officeholder runningagainst Bush But Doles thirdplace finish at Ames coupled with her victoryin the postAmes spin contest complicates this plan            Soheres how the race shapes up Bauer will frame it as a populist showdownchiefly between himself and Forbes Forbes will frame it as a fight between theestablishment led by Bush and conservatives led by himself Dole willexploit feminism as well as feminine stereotypes pitching herself as thecandidate of change civility and moral renewal And McCain will fortify hiswar chest while his rivals battle and bleed Ames has organized thecontestants Let the games begin
