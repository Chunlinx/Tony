              Date Fri Jan            Its a fair cop I think all taxpayers should paythe same rate of tax I also think that equal treatment by government is auseful idea in the resuscitation of liberalism Go figure But Im not awealthypamperer Because todays punitive tax system means you paydisproportionately more the richer you are simply moving to an equal systeminevitably gives a break to the rich I didnt hide this in the New YorkTimes Magazine piece I said so explicitly But that doesnt mean I givethe rich special favors I give them the same favors as everyone else and bycombining a flat tax with tax reform take away large numbers of their goodiesfor good measure            Surowiecki is right in saying that technology makescomplicated things simpler to enforce but its also true that in our verycomplicated world the simpleisbeautiful mantra has increasing culturalappeal My point is not that the page tax code isnt easier to enforcewith technology It is My point is that the

might say what social justice is all about Old people get SocialSecurity and Medicare Poor people get Medicaid Young people get Head Startand free public school and free school lunches and later interestfreecollege loans Workers at the bottom of the pay ladder are guaranteed a minimumwage Wageearners are paid overtime while salaried workers are notUnemployed people get unemployment insurance            Perhaps Sullivan thinks all these too areexamples of paleoliberalism Id say theyre examples of liberal ideas thatenjoy the support of the vast majority of Americans as does the progressivetax Most Americans believe that once you make a certain amount of money eachadditional dollar matters less and therefore society has a larger claim on itMost Americans think theres a difference between making K a year and making million a year and that the state does well to recognize that differenceSullivan doesnt think this which is fine He just shouldnt pretend that theflat tax

ofevolution but also of what we imagine ourselves to be Culturebox decries theclassroom teaching of the evolutionary roots of rape even as a prelude toexplaining the hows and whys of resisting those

biological drives and moral imperatives it wont helpus one bitwell still be compelled by our natures to view objectivedescriptions of those drives as moral justifications for giving in to them            Now Culturebox may well be correct that hungryyoung males or hungry old defense attorneys or jurors of all ages andappetites are incapable of resisting the temptation of tout comprendretout

North Jersey which I think is close to the heartof what makes The Sopranos interesting There is something about theplace that makes it special and not only because I grew up there It could beits long multiethnic historyit was polyglot even in colonial times It couldbe its strange and thick class comingling wherein somebody in wastemanagement gets to live in a town with countryclub types Where come summereverybody heads to the shore And can we get the Sopranos to the shore for anepisode or two please But whatever the explanation North Jersey is a placewhere people wear their ethnic identity but lightly and where the workingclass has created such a strong pop culture of its ownthe football Giantsthe allnight diners Springsteen the boardwalk at the shorethat even thosewith money continue to cling to it rather than embrace elite culture Theydont go to Marthas Vineyard they just get a bigger house at theshore So what Im saying is that The Sopranos is as much about Jerseyas it is about the mob and if you dont like ithey who fuckin asked youanyway                           To reply clickhere                          Gerald Marzorati isthe editorial director of the New York Times Magazine
