                                  See You in Court            How can President Clintonsecure a censure agreement and avert a Senate trial Thats the questionpundits have naively debated since Clinton was impeached The naivet lies notin their answers but in the question Who says Clinton prefers censure In manyways hed be better off sabotaging the censure movement and polarizing thetrial                                          The chicken game The conventional wisdom says Clinton is afraid ofbeing convicted But is he the only one who fears that outcome AlthoughRepublican politicians poohpoohed the notion that theyd be voted out ofoffice in  for impeaching Clinton in  theyre less sanguine abouttheir chances of being voted out for throwing him out of office in  Thatsone reason why Senate Republicans have expressed far less enthusiasm forconvicting Clinton than House Republicans showed in impeaching him Whyshouldnt he call the GOPs bluff             Clintons legacy The conventional wisdom saysClinton must avert conviction in order to safeguard his legacy But wouldcensure serve his legacy better than a trial would Arguably impeachment hastarnished Clintons presidency as gravely as he could have imagined And manyanalysts think if hes forced to sign a bipartisan selfabasing censureresolution hell be humiliated broken and unable to pass any part of hisagenda in his final two years Could conviction and removal be much worse thanthat On this line of reasoning Clinton has little left to lose in a trial andmuch to gain Trial and acquittal might be his only hope of erasing the stainof impeachment                                          The ordeal The conventional wisdom says Clinton should waive hisdefense and avoid calling witnesses in order to shorten the trial and end hisordeal But whose ordeal is it Republican senators have been saying for daysthat they dont want to antagonize the public by calling witnesses and draggingout the trial for months Why not give them what they dont want The Houseprosecution team includes Rep Bob Barr RGa and other former federalprosecutors who are champing at the bit to call Monica Lewinsky and perhaps adozen other witnesses House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RTexas wants to dragevidence about other alleged Clinton sexual escapades into the trial Why notcall witnesses inflame these incendiary accusers and help them ignite theproceedings perhaps torching their own party in the process             Censure negotiations The conventional wisdom saysClinton shouldnt polarize the Senate along partisan lines because this woulddisrupt the movement toward a censure deal Its hard enough to work out a dealalready pundits observe given that Democrats want to soften the censureresolution while Republicans want to stiffen it But why is this partisan riftover the terms of censure bad for Clinton He doesnt need a censure deal toextinguish the threat of conviction All he needs is a censure proposal thatsatisfies  Democrats enough to dissuade them from voting to convict him Ifthe proposal fails thereby sparing Clinton any penalty whatsoever so much thebetter            From this standpoint apartisan impasse over the terms of censure is exactly what Clinton needs Thiscould be accomplished through various disputes such as whether Clinton mustconfess to perjury before the grand jury Republicans insist on it Democratswarn that it may kill the deal and whether he should be fined manyRepublicans demand it many Democrats say its unfair or unconstitutional Theimportant thing is that Clintons fingerprints mustnt be found on thesabotage His best way to navigate this dilemma is by subtly encouragingDemocrats to hold out for terms so soft that Republicans cant abide them             The sequence The conventional wisdomsays if Clinton fails to strike a censure deal with Senate Democrats andRepublicans they might vote to convict him But what if the two options areconsidered in reverse order Already several conservative Republican senatorsare demanding that the Senate complete the trial and vote on conviction beforenegotiating a censure deal But once conviction has been voted down whyshould Clinton negotiate He can play it both ways Cultivate the censuremovement in order to persuade Democrats to vote against conviction thensabotage censure by encouraging liberal and conservative zealots in the Senateto hold out for extreme terms Admittedly this scenario requires that Clintonignore whats best for the country and that his enemies save him throughreckless excess But that has been the story of the year                           Recent Frame Games                                       Clintons Final Escape Why the GOP will spare his presidencyposted Wednesday Dec                               Wag the Doubt The debate over Clintons Iraq attack blazes newfrontiers in cynicism posted Saturday Dec                                                       Photograph ofPresident Clinton by Zoraida Diaz
