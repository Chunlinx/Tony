                                 How to Appear Thoughtful            At the height of his Hamletact over whether to vote for the balancedbudget amendment Robert Torricellithe firstterm Democratic senator from New Jersey gave an interview to theNew York Times  I understand this will be one of the most importantvotes I ever cast he told the paper Im taking an extraordinary amount oftime talking about it Now another senator might have noted that he wasspending a lot of time thinking about the issue perhaps orlistening to the arguments on both sides But this is the Torchrememberwho in just a couple of months has distinguished himself as themember of the upper chamber most in love with the sound of his own voice Whenyou consider that his colleagues include Robert Byrd and Joe Biden that isreally something            Torricelli might be a blowhard but he isnt dumb After  years in the Househe seems to have figured out in a hurry how this Senate thing works I didntget here by design he told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday Feb He was referring to his role as the decision maker on the balancedbudgetamendment which is set to fail by one vote early next week This claim ofguilelessness was instantaneously belied by Torricellis suggestion that he andthree other Democratic undecideds had the narrow defeat of the bill ButTorricellis accomplishment was more than just manipulating the timing of hisannouncement to make himself the center of media attention He also showed howeasy it is in Washington to cultivate the appearance of thoughtfulness withoutdoing a minutes worth of actual thinking            The challenge of looking like a soulsearching statesmanwas made harder by Torricellis previous record on the issue As a member ofthe House he had voted in favor of the balancedbudget amendment in the sameversion he now opposes three different times During his recent campaign hesaid in unequivocal terms that he was in favor of the amendment donning hisrecord on the issue as a Kevlar shield against the charge that he was afiscally irresponsible liberal So his first order of business in the Senatewas to begin to lay the groundwork for a flipflop Torricelli didnt doanything so dramatic as to say he might have been wrong in the past Insteadhe reinterpreted his past position as semaphore He wasnt really votingto amend the Constitution at the time He was trying to send a message aboutfiscal irresponsibility to various presidents and to Congress When I conkedyou over the head with that frying pan I was merely indicating myconcern  Never mind that Torricelli was in the House himself being asfiscally irresponsible as the next guy In Congress people send messages tothemselves all the time            The secondstep is the fun part agonizing in public The national grandmaster of thistechnique is still the former governor of New York Mario Cuomo But in theSenate the great role model is  who held a national dialogue with himself in before finally choosing to cast the deciding vote in favor of the firstClinton economic plan But Kerrey carries off indecision better than Torricellidoes because with him its not an act He is truly paralytically ambivalentperpetually ruminating about whether he should run for president even whilerunning for president in  Torricelli was merely feigning indecision whenhe gave interviews to the New York Times and National Public Radio theweek before last saying how seriously he took the arguments on both sides andhow impressed he was with the deep consideration of important issues that tookplace in the Senate            Step  is negotiating with the folks who needyour vote At this stage you are the most popular guy in town The presidentinvites you over to watch the Super Bowl His aides respond to your smallesthint with servile alacrity David Broder calling for you on Line  And soforth Being the swing vote means you can ask for the moon and starsbut youcant ask for pork if you want to be seen as a deep thinker Demanding a bridgeas your price would be tacky especially in exchange for killing off abigticket fiscalausterity measure Six months down the road you can ask forall the post offices you want More dignified is to ask for some kind ofcommission In  Kerrey got a commission on entitlements in exchange forhis vote on the budget Torricelli had been expressing concern about the lackof capital budgetingthe inability under our system of federal accounting tospread out the costs of investment expenditure Presto After a conversationwith the president in which Torricelli made clear his intention on the votethe White House announced the formation of a capitalbudget commission toexamine this important issue Click to have Slates editor explain whats wrongwith Torricellis capitalbudget idea            The finalstep is coming up with a pretext for your decision Tim Johnson of South Dakotaused the possibility of Social Security cuts to justify his flipflop severaldays earlier but that was just to bear the weight of another senator even alight one So Torricelli took a different tack objecting to the Republicanversion of the amendment because it didnt contain any provision for theabovementioned capital budget and proposing an amendment to the amendment toprovide for one pending the report of the Torch Commission The merits of thatissue aside this was an absurd proposal in the context of debate about abalancedbudget amendment Balanced budgets and capital budgets arecontradictory ideas Being against the former because it doesnt provide forthe latter is like saying you dont like a house because it doesnt havewheels            After the amendments sponsor Orrin Hatch of Utah refusedto accept this change Torricelli took the Sorry wish I could help line Ineed the gentleman from Utah to explain to me how a generation unborn incircumstances unforeseen will deal with renewed military hostilities a deeprecession or the problem of declining economic competitiveness Nice bit ofasknotting that generation unborn in circumstances unforeseen Reverse wordorder will get you everywhere in the Senate After his endless speech on theSenate floor in defense of our founding ancestors Torricelli repaired to theSenate radio and TV gallery to continue his monologue I have struggled withthis decision more than any  I have ever made in my life Torricelli saidChins were stroked Editorials were penned hailing the decision A strange newmantle of respect descended on Bob Torricelli            Of course truly thoughtfulsenators dont go in for this kind of rigmarole Take the nowretired PaulSimon of Illinois who took a courageous position in support of thebalancedbudget amendment and held to it consistentlyeven in  when theDemocrats were one vote short and wouldnt have succeeded in defeating theamendment without the help of Republican Mark Hatfield I think Simon was wrongon the merits but I never questioned his sincerity on the issue Or takeTorricellis predecessor Bill Bradley Bradley took the same position thatTorricelli did on the balancedbudget amendment after actually thinkingabout it and without making a fuss            But quietcontemplation is not Torricellis mtier To quote again from the predecisionpiece in the Times                            After a long discourseon the ins and outs of his vote Mr Torricelli drops a hint that when itmatters he will not desert his party The US needs to determine a properlevel of debt he said and its possible several members could emerge to usevotes on this to force new creative talking                        Or more creatively yetmaybe one new senator could just stop talking for a while
