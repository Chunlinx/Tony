              hi im Susan Linnstaedter   where you calling from   uh im in Dallas   okay all right so am i   okay you understand the topic   uh yeah umhum   okay im going to go hit the button   so what do you think about the death penalty   uh well ive mixed feelings i guess youd say its its not something that uh i mean uh you know it doesnt make me happy   umhum   but uh on the other hand you know the present alternatives at least in Texas are not real good i mean its an all or nothing proposition you know you either you either uh give somebody a death penalty or   umhum umhum   theyre out on the streets in a very short time to uh have have a repeat performance of whatever they did um   umhum   and i guess uh you know i guess i should mention im an attorney and i used to do some criminal work and um   oh hum   as long as its reserved for special purposes and as long as as uh you know the judicial process thats afforded to someone pretty much   for psychopathic killers and stuff   you know makes you feel good about that youve got the right guy then i guess i i can live with it   yeah umhum well whatd you think about Jeffrey Dahmer now   uh i havent been keeping up with that ive been in and out of of town and i havent kept up with it whats happening to him   well well he got fifteen life sentences   umhum uh so they went ahead and ruled him uh at least legally sane to stand trial   for uh sane right umhum   okay   well okay so i see he can get up to fifteen life sentences and uh i he with no chance for parole but uh   see we dont have that in Texas thats the problem   hum   is is you cant give somebody life without parole at least at this point   uhhuh well huh thats not very good   no i mean you know uh a life sentence they get time and a half for um time served and uh if they get made a trustee they get good time um which is like two two days for every day they serve   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh hum   and they can really be out or eligible for parole in a fairly short space of time   now whats uh what is a life term if someone gets a life term whats the earliest they can get out   i want to say uh you know theyve changed things since i used to since i used to practice that kind of work but i think that   uhhuh   somebody told me that  within ten or twelve years they would be um eligible for parole   wow   i mean its not very long   umhum well now i know in uh in Virginia i i think its about the same i want to say each life term youre eligible for parole within fifteen years   umhum   and uh i knew um   well see also in Texas its real unusual for them to do what they call stack them stack the penalties   uhhuh uhhuh oh   they they will they will cause the penalties to run concurrently   oh okay yeah see they should make consecutively i dont like this concurrent stuff   yeah i mean on on something like a like a Jeffrey Dahlmer or somebody like that you know that definitely i mean you know why go through the farce of having a parole hearing   right right   you know whats going to happen if you let him out i mean we and in Texas too i mean i smaller states like Vermont uh and places like that have some real innovative   umhum   rehabilitation type activities that they can do in their penal system and in a in a state like Texas we dont have that   right hum   they get down there we are warehousing people basically   yeah   and they go down there and they maybe pick up a few tricks you know how to be worse and uh and then you turn them loose on society and i just dont think that thats i dont think thats right i dont think thats fair     umhum see thats what what i dont like is warehousing you know i mean if you make them useful you know put them in jail and make them do something you know   yeah   uh i dont know make license plates you know   something yeah   i mean it to me uh for me to pay i mean what does it cost uh per year to uh to keep uh an inmate i think they said its something like eighteen thousand dollars per per person is is what we were paying per inmate thats a lot of money   uh its a lot yeah   you know i mean some people dont even make that much money a year you know   huhuh   and i think thats free   well and and if you consider the fact that with with all the the federal lawsuits that went on and all the standards that there are for how you can and cannot treat prisoners and and what theyre entitled to have   uhhuh uhhuh umhum   frankly you know its its considered cruel and inhumane for a prisoner at the state penitentiary to live in conditions that would look pretty attractive to some of the homeless people who have not committed a crime   yeah yeah   you know i mean we just our system is is is kind of skewed somehow or another   yeah   and like i say i mean you know i cant i cant tell you i feel good about the fact that we put people to death   uhhuh uhhuh   i mean i really uh you know deep down i guess that bothers   well
