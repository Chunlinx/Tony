                            It goes without saying that the cellular plasma membrane effectively creates a barrier        between the inside intracellular area and outside extracellular area of the cell it        defines In order for the cell to sense and respond to its environment including other        cells and the supporting structures that comprise the extracellular matrix ECM and for        the environment to influence cell function including cell growth and movement        bidirectional signaling across the plasma membrane has to be mediated by receptors and        other structures About two decades ago it became widely appreciated that many of the cell        surface receptors that mediate cellcell and cellECM interactions were structurally and        functionally related and the term integrins was coined to reflect the capacity of        members of this family to integrate the extracellular and intracellular environment Hynes         Integrinmediated interactions are vital to the maintenance of normal cell        functioning because of their ability to mediate insideout intracellular to extracellular        and outsidein extracellular to intracellular signaling Integrin dysfunctions are        associated with numerous human disorders such as thrombosis atherosclerosis cancer and        chronic inflammatory diseases Despite a total of nearly  integrinrelated articles        in the literature intensive effortmore than  articles per monthcontinues to focus on        understanding the roles of integrins in both physiological and pathological processes                    The Integrin Family        The integrin family comprises  or more members that are found in many animal species        ranging from sponges to mammals Hynes  They consist of two distinct associated        subunits noncovalent heterodimers where each subunit   consists of a single        transmembrane domain a large extracellular domain of several hundred amino acids composed        of multiple structural domains and typically a small cytoplasmic domain of somewhere        between  residues Figure  The extracellular domains bind a wide variety of        ligands whereas the intracellular cytoplasmic domains anchor to cytoskeletal proteins In        this manner the exterior and interior of a cell are physically linked which allows for        bidirectional transmission of mechanical and biochemical signals across the plasma        membrane and leads to a cooperative regulation of cell functions including adhesion        migration growth and differentiation A central topic in the integrin research over the        past decade has been the mechanism of insideout activation Liddington and Ginsberg         In their resting state integrins normally bind the molecules that activate them with low        affinity Upon stimulation a cellular signal induces a conformational change in the        integrin cytoplasmic domain that propagates to the extracellular domain Integrins are        transformed from a low to a highaffinity ligand binding state Such insideout regulation        of integrin affinity states is distinct from the outsidein signaling observed upon        activation of most other transmembrane receptors eg growth factorgrowth factor        receptor interactions including integrins The insideout signaling protects the host        from excessive integrinmediated cell adhesion which could for example lead to        spontaneous aggregation of blood cells and have profound pathological consequences                    The Heads and Tails of InsideOut Signaling        Mutational studies provided the initial hints that disruption of the noncovalent clasp        between  and  cytoplasmic tails is clearly the event within the structure of the integrin        that initiates insideout signaling Point mutations in the  and  cytoplasmic tails that        are near the membrane or deletion of either region result in constitutive activation of the        receptor OToole et al   Hughes et al  Mutating a single specific        residue in the cytoplasmic tail of either subunit led to integrin activation but a double        mutation which would have allowed retention of a salt bridge between the subunits did not        Hughes et al suggesting that integrin insideout activation is dependent upon        regulation of the interaction between the two subunits In support of this hypothesis        peptides corresponding to  and  cytoplasmic tails have been shown to interact with each        other Haas and Plow  Since these original observations there has been an intensive        effort to understand the mechanism for regulation of integrin activation by the cytoplasmic        region for a recent review see Hynes  On the road toward this goal Ginsberg and        colleagues discovered that the head domain of a cytoskeletal proteintalinplays a key role        in binding to integrin  cytoplasmic tails and inducing integrin activation Calderwood et        al  Many other intracellular proteins bind to the  and  cytoplasmic tails Liu et        al  but the importance of talin in integrin activation is particularly convincing        since it has been confirmed by multiple laboratories Vinogradova et al  Kim et al         Tremuth et al  using various methods including overexpression and gene        knockdown siRNA approaches Tadokoro et al  In  Springer and coworkers        provided evidence for a model by which separation of the Cterminal portions of the  and         subunits results in insideout activation They showed that replacement of the        cytoplasmictransmembrane regions by an artificial linkage between the tails inactivates        the receptor whereas breakage of the clasp activates the receptor Lu et al  Takagi        et al  Shortly thereafter the model gained direct and strong experimental support        from a structural analysis in which the membraneproximal helices of the two subunits were        found to clasp in a weak handshake that could be disrupted by talin or constitutively        activating mutations Vinogradova et al  The model has been further verified by        other biophysical studies Kim et al  and extended to other integrins Vinogradova et        al  Since the membraneproximal regions of integrin  and  cytoplasmic tails are        highly conserved the generalization of this signaling mechanism to all integrins was to be        anticipated A dynamic image of how such cytoplasmic unclasping occurs at the membrane        surface can now be modeled Figure  Vinogradova et al                     Straightening Out the Outside        On the extracellular side groundbreaking insights were provided when the crystal        structure of the extracellular domain of integrin         v          the nomenclature identifies the particular  and  subunits was        determined Xiong et al  In addition to the exquisite structural details the        overall conformation was surprisingly bent Figure  which contrasted with structures        revealed by the earlier electron micrographic studies that showed an extended stalklike        structure Weisel et al  Springer and coworkers used a series of        biochemicalbiophysical experiments to suggest that the bent structure represents an        inactive form of integrin Takagi et al  whereas activation induces a switchblade        shift that converts the bent form to the extended form Figure  A molecular picture has        emerged for integrin insideout activation where a cellular signal induces the        conformational change of talin exposing its head domain allowing it to bind to the integrin         cytoplasmic tail This interaction unclasps the complex between the cytoplasmic tails        which then allows a conformational shift in the extracellular domain from a bent to a more        extended form for highaffinity ligand binding Figure  Takagi et al         The activated integrins may then undergo clustering whereby the transmembrane domain of        each type of subunit the  or  interacts with itselfcalled homotypic oligomerization of        the transmembrane domains Figure  Li et al  Ligand occupancy and receptor        clustering initiates outsidein signaling that in turn regulates a variety of cellular        responses see below The three steps in Figure  occur as part of a dynamic equilibrium        and perturbation of any step can shift the equilibrium leading to transient partial or        permanent integrin activationinactivation depending on the extent of perturbation For        example deletion of aIIb cytoplasmic tail completely removes the clasp and permanently        activates the receptor OToole et al  whereas a particular disease mutation may        only impair the clasp and partially activate the receptor Peyruchaud et al  While        the model in Figure  is based on direct structural evidence for the cytoplasmic face        Vinogradova et al  Kim et al  and the extracellular domain Takagi et al         the changes in the transmembrane region remained speculative In this issue of         PLoS Biology  Luo et al  provide what is to our knowledge the        first experimental evidence for the transmembrane domain separation an event suggested by        the model shown in Figure  By selectively altering the residues that can interact with        one another the authors defined a specific transmembrane domain interface in resting         IIb          and showed that this interface is lost upon activation of this        integrin Backed by extensive structural and biochemical data on the integrin        cytoplasmicextracellular domains this transmembrane domain study takes the next vital        step toward a more complete understanding of the unclasping mechanism for integrin        activation Although the energy required for lateral separation of the transmembrane        domains in membrane appears to be high the third step in Figure  clustering via        transmembrane domain oligomerization may compensate for it                    Filling in the Pieces        Despite the molecular level of our understanding of integrin activation a number of key        questions remain unresolved Although we know that the membraneproximal clasp on the        integrin cytoplasmic face controls the integrin activation the distal side of either the         or  cytoplasmic tails may also play a role in integrin activation since other mutations        indicate that the Cterminal membrane distal region is important in regulating integrin        activation via a mechanism that is yet unknown Thus the picture for the cytoplasmic        facecontrolled insideout activation may be substantially more complicated than specified        in Figure  There may exist other factors such as negative regulators in cells that bind        to the cytoplasmic tails or their complex and control the conformational change required        for integrin activation Also there may be pathways other than the talinmediated one that        lead to integrin activation Structures of the integrin cytoplasmic face bound to talin and        the many other proteins known to bind to the cytoplasmic tails of integrins will        undoubtedly provide further insights In the transmembrane region although there is ample        evidence for heterodimeric transmembrane domain association Adair and Yeager         Schneider and Engelman  Gottschalk and Kessler  Luo et al  and dissociation        upon integrin activation Luo et al  a definitive structural view is missing Some        studies have proposed that homooligomerization is essential for inducing integrin        activation Li et al  However the data provided by Luo et al do not appear to        support this model On the extracellular side while the Cterminal unclasping and        separation of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions appears to relieve the structural        constraint and may allow the unbending of the extracellular domain to attain the        highaffinity ligand binding state Takagi et al  a thorough molecular understanding        of this process awaits high resolution structures of the intact receptor in inactive and        active forms                    What About OutsideIn        Upon the insideout activation integrins bind to specific extracellular matrix        proteins However for the integrins to grip tightly to the extracellular matrix to mediate        cell adhesion and migration the integrin cytoplasmic domains must be anchored to the        cytoskeleton Giancotti and Ruoslahti  This is achieved by outsidein signaling        ie when an integrin binds to the extracellular ligand it clusters with other bound        integrins resulting in the formation of highly organized intracellular complexes known as        focal adhesions that are connected to the cytoskeleton The focal adhesions incorporate a        variety of molecules including the cytoplasmic domains of the clustered integrins        cytoskeletal proteins and an extensive array of signaling molecules The high local        concentrations of these molecules facilitate cascades of downstream intracellular responses        via proteinprotein interactions which are linked to the cytoskeleton as well as to        complex intracellular signaling networks Although many intracellular components involved        in outsidein signaling have been identified and much has been learned about various        signaling pathways involved in outsidein signaling Giancotti and Ruoslahti  a        molecular view of how the various events occur in time and space is still very uncertain        In particular little structural insight has been obtained for early outsidein        intracellular events following ECMintegrin binding eg upon ECM engagement How is the        integrin cytoplasmic domain connected to the cytoskeleton How is this connection regulated        during cell adhesion and migration The next wave of structural information may provide        insights into these important and fertile areas of investigation
