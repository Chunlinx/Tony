                    Background        Systematic microarraybased studies are rapidly        advancing the fields of biology and medicine Most        commonly mRNA expression levels are measured on a global        often genomewide scale Studies employing this approach        have contributed to our understanding of diverse biological        processes from yeast physiology     to human cancer            More recently microarraybased approaches have been        used to characterize physical properties of the genome for        example by mapping transcription factor binding sites            and histone modifications             Microarraybased genome mapping protocols utilize the        technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP to        isolate genomic DNA associated         in vivo with a transcription factor        of interest or with histones exhibiting a particular        posttranslational modification In ChIP whole cells are        treated with formaldehyde to covalently link DNA and        associated proteins and the resulting mix is fragmented by        sonication ProteinDNA complexes are then isolated using        antibodies specific for a protein of interest eg a        transcription factor or a histone exhibiting a particular        covalent modification Finally crosslinks are reversed        and protein degraded to yield purified DNA Microarrays        have proven particularly valuable for the unbiased analysis        and identification of DNA isolated by ChIP        Microarraybased mapping poses unique technical        challenges For example ChIP typically yields only        submicrogram quantities of DNA Hence an amplification        step is required to generate sufficient quantities of        nucleic acid for microarray analysis This contrasts with        typical mRNA expression analyses where microgram quantities        of mRNA are available for direct analysis Furthermore        genomic DNA lacks a universal sequence tag for priming        amplification and labeling steps Again this contrasts        with expression analysis where the mRNA  polyA tail        provides a useful priming sequence for cDNA synthesis        These obstacles have been overcome by two related        protocols both of which are based on the polymerase chain        reaction PCR The first protocol uses a ligationmediated        PCR strategy LMPCR in which ChIP DNA is ligated to short        DNA linkers and then PCR amplified using the linker        sequence for priming     The second uses a random        amplification strategy RPCR in which template DNA is        first copied using a specialized primer with degenerate         sequence and known  sequence and then PCR amplified        using the known  sequence for priming       In both        cases the PCR steps yield quantities of nucleic acid        sufficient for microarray analysis Labeled product can be        generated by incorporating fluorescent or otherwise        modified nucleotides during PCR LMPCR has been used in        several studies including a systematic genomewide        location analysis of yeast transcriptional activators            and an unbiased search for EF binding sites in a        subset of human promoters     Studies employing the        RPCR approach include genomewide analyses of silencing        enzymes    and histone modifications     in yeast        and a mapping of GATA binding sites within the human        globin locus            There are however limitations of a PCRbased approach        Due to the exponential kinetics of PCR amplification        sequencedependent and lengthdependent biases may be        amplified exponentially Furthermore theoretical        considerations suggest that amplification of low abundance        species can be highly variable Alternative amplification        approaches have been developed for microarraybased mRNA        analyses A widely used protocol developed by Eberwine and        colleagues uses Tbased linear amplification     In        this procedure double stranded cDNAs are synthesized from        mRNA by reversetranscription priming off the  polyA        tail and second strand synthesis T promoters are        incorporated during the cDNA synthesis and T RNA        polymerase is subsequently used to transcribe multiple RNA        copies from each cDNA this process is termed in vitro        transcription or IVT Recent studies have applied this        approach to microarray analysis and found that it        faithfully preserves the initial representation of RNA        species       Other reports suggest that PCRbased        amplification may also preserve this representation            However IVT remains more attractive from a theoretical        perspective as biases should be less severe due to the        linear nature of the amplification            To improve the accuracy of microarraybased genome        mapping protocols we have developed a linear amplification        protocol for genomic DNA This protocol uses a terminal        transferase tailing step and second strand synthesis to        incorporate T promoters at the ends of the DNA fragments        prior to IVT We find that this approach efficiently        amplifies as little as  ng of genomic DNA Here the        protocol is presented along with a systematic evaluation of        its efficacy and fidelity                    Results                  Tbased amplification of genomic DNA          The Tbased IVT protocol for linear amplification of          genomic DNA is shown in Figure  Since ChIP DNA is          fragmented randomly and lacks a universal sequence for          priming we optimized a terminal transferase step to add          polyT tails to the  ends of each DNA strand We are          able to generate tails with a tight distribution around          an optimal length of  bps by including a low          concentration of a terminating dideoxycytidine nucleotide          data not shown An anchored primer adapter was designed          that contains a  T promoter and a  polyA  bps in          length stretch terminating in a single C G or T base          This adapter is annealed to the genomic DNA fragments          and Klenow is added for second strand synthesis In          addition to extending the primer adapter the           exonuclease activity of Klenow should trim  polyTs in          excess of the  bps complementary to the adapter and          allow fill in of the appropriate complementary bases Fig           For each dsDNA species present in the starting          material these reactions generate two dsDNAs with T          promoters at opposite ends          The reaction products are used as template for IVT          using the Eberwine method     From a starting          material of ChIP DNA from    yeast cells this          protocol yields between  and  g RNA This yield          compares favorably with RPCR which yields up to  g          DNA from equivalent starting material To more precisely          evaluate the efficiency and fidelity of the linear          amplification protocol we generated a large pool of          starting material by restricting yeast genomic DNA with          Alu I cuts AGCT leaving blunt ends and gelpurifying          fragments within a size range of  bps We          subjected  ng of the Alu I digest to amplification by          IVT and by RPCR The IVT yielded almost  g RNA while          the RPCR yielded  g DNA Table  We compared the          Alu I digest with the amplified products by          gelelectrophoresis Fig  The IVT product retains          essentially the same size distribution as the starting          material In contrast the RPCR product appears to          underrepresent lower molecular weight species                          Limiting primer input improves yield          While analyzing the size distribution of the IVT          product we noted a low molecular weight species that          roughly corresponds in size to the primer adapter IVT          protocols are reportedly sensitive to excess starting          concentrations of the T primer Baugh and colleagues          were able to improve yields when amplifying mRNA by          decreasing the concentration of T primer     When          we limited the mass of T primer adapter to approximately          five times that of the starting material with a lower          limit of  ng by decreasing the second strand synthesis          reaction volume this low molecular weight species          disappeared without decreasing overall yields data not          shown In this way we were able to efficiently amplify          just  ng from the Alu I digest with a yield of  g          Table                           Evaluation of linear amplification by          hybridization          We went on to evaluate the fidelity of the linear          amplification protocol by microarray analysis          Restriction by Rsa I cuts GTAC leaving blunt ends and          gelpurification were used to generate a second          population of DNA Since Alu I and Rsa I cut at different          sites the resulting digests contain different          distributions of DNA species  ng of each pool were          amplified by IVT DNA probes generated by reverse          transcribing the amplified RNA were fluorescently          labeled Cy for Alu I Cy for Rsa I pooled and          hybridized to microarrays containing the yeast open          reading frames After hybridization the microarrays were          washed and scanned and CyCy ratios calculated We          also hybridized Alu I and Rsa I probes generated by RPCR          from  ng starting material as well as probes generated          by direct labeling of  g starting material          First we assessed the reproducibility of the IVT          protocol Three Alu I  Rsa I datasets were independently          generated using the IVT protocol Each dataset contains           ratios that each reflect the relative abundance of          DNA corresponding to a specific array feature yeast ORF          in the two digests We found the IVT protocol to be          highly reproducible correlation coefficients calculated          between the replicate datasets averaged  This          reproducibility is maintained even when only  ng          starting material are used correlation of  The          direct labeling and RPCR protocols are also highly          reproducible with mean correlations of  and           respectively Fig A          Next we assessed the fidelity of amplification by          comparing the IVT and RPCR datasets with the direct          labeling dataset We assumed the direct labeling dataset          to most accurately represent the true distribution of          species in the Alu I and Rsa I digests since no          amplification was required to obtain these data The          three datasets collected for each protocol were averaged          and correlation coefficients calculated between the          resulting composite datasets The correlation between the          IVT dataset and the direct labeling dataset is  Fig          A This value increases to  when features with          ratios close to  are excluded from the calculation The          correlation between the RPCR dataset and the direct          labeling dataset is  Fig A It rises to  when          features with ratios close to  are excluded          Correspondingly the highest ranking features in the          direct labeling dataset overlap extensively with the          highest ranking features in the IVT dataset and to a          lesser extent with the highest ranking features in the          RPCR dataset Fig B          The high correlation between the IVT and direct          labeling datasets is evident in the scatter plot shown in          Fig  An analogous plot portrays the lower correlation          between the RPCR and direct labeling datasets These          plots also illustrate another difference between the          amplification protocols an examination of best fit lines          calculated for each of the plots suggests that dynamic          range is increased by IVT amplification slope            but decreased by RPCR amplification slope   To          quantify dynamic range we determined the ratio values          for data points two standard deviations above and below          the mean and calculated the range between these values          by dividing the high ratio by the low ratio For the          direct labeling dataset the high and low ratios are           and  respectively for a range of  The range for          the IVT dataset is  while that for the RPCR dataset          is  Table

closely confirming the high          reproducibility observed for each method Consistent with          the correlation analysis the individual replicates for          the IVT and direct labeling protocol cluster together          while the RPCR replicates cluster in a separate arm of          the dendrogram Most of the  features shown in the          cluster diagram exhibit consistent coloring across the          diagram indicating that the direction of enrichment is          consistent for all replicates However the cluster          diagram highlights two groups of genes purple stripes          whose ratios in the RPCR dataset are inconsistent with          their ratios in the direct labeling and IVT datasets                            Discussion        We have developed a Tbased linear amplification        protocol for the amplification of genomic DNA The protocol        was specifically designed to amplify DNA isolated by ChIP        for use in genome mapping protocols However it may be        useful for other studies that require amplification of        small quantities of DNA in a sequence independent manner        eg DNA array comparative genomic hybridization            Although Tbased approaches for amplification of mRNA        have been described        these rely on the         polyA tails for priming and incorporation of the T        promoter Fragmented genomic DNA such as that generated by        ChIP does not contain such a universal sequence Our        protocol overcomes this obstacle by adding  polyT tails        to the ends of the DNA fragments for use in priming much        like mRNA polyA tails Efficient tailing by terminal        transferase requires the template DNA to be free of         phosphate groups and is highly dependent on whether this        template contains blunt or overhangingends For DNA        fragments generated by ChIP or bluntend restriction        these limitations are effectively overcome by prior        phosphatase treatment by using recombinant terminal        transferase enzyme and by spiking a small quantity of        terminating nucleotide into the tailing reaction        We compared our IVT protocol to a commonly used PCR        protocol that uses a partially degenerate primer to amplify        genomic DNA in a sequence independent manner RPCR        Initial analyses reveal specific advantages of the IVT        approach First yields from IVT are significantly higher        than those obtained using RPCR Table  with a        foldamplification similar to that obtained in mRNA linear        amplification protocols      Since  g of amplified        RNA are sufficient to generate probe for a microarray        experiment RNA from a single IVT amplification can be used        for several analyses A second advantage is that the IVT        protocol maintains the size distribution of the starting        material more effectively than RPCR Fig         To more precisely characterize amplification bias we        developed a test system involving the microarraybased        analysis of two distinct populations of genomic DNA These        populations were generated by cutting genomic DNA from        yeast with a different restriction enzyme and        sizepurifying the resulting digest The resulting pools        an Alu I digest and a Rsa I digest contain microgram        quantities of genomic DNA sufficient for several        amplification trials Importantly these quantities are        also sufficient for direct microarray analysis by direct        labeling this is not the case for the small quantities of        DNA isolated by ChIP Although this direct analysis does        require a single round of synthesis to incorporate dye        labels no amplification is involved Hence we used direct        labeling as a gold standard to validate the IVT and RPCR        methods        We carried out a series of hybridization experiments        using the different protocols to compare the Alu I and Rsa        I digests All three protocols were highly reproducible in        our hands However we found the direct labeling data to be        significantly more concordant with the IVT data than with        the RPCR data This higher concordance is evident as        higher correlations between the datasets and greater        overlap among high ranking features Fig  Consistent        with these findings when the datasets are subjected to        hierarchical clustering the direct labeling and IVT        datasets cosegregate Fig  This clustering analysis        also reveals discrete subsets of features whose ratios in        the RPCR dataset are inconsistent with their ratios in the        direct labeling and IVT datasets In addition to portraying        species representation accurately the IVT dataset displays        a significantly expanded dynamic range Taken together        these observations suggest that IVT has considerable        advantages over RPCR        However our finding that IVT is more faithful than        RPCR comes with its own caveats and does not necessarily        imply that RPCR is an unreliable approach First of all        it should be noted that the restriction digest analysis is        an imperfect surrogate for ChIP experiments the random        fragmentation of DNA in ChIP and the systematic cutting in        the restriction analyses each place different constraints        on an amplification method Many of the discordant ratios        in the RPCR dataset likely result from a combination of        the nonrandom fragmentation in the Alu I  Rsa I        experiment and the ineffectiveness of RPCR in amplifying        low molecular weight species When these discordant genes        are removed the correlation between the RPCR and direct        labeling datasets increases to  If the analysis is        further limited to features with ratios reflective of a        fold or greater intensity difference the correlation is         compare with correlation of  for IVT versus        direct Most mapping experiments are primarily interested        in these enriched or depleted features Our initial        experiences analyzing ChIP DNA by IVT suggest that results        obtained using either amplification method are compatible        with overall correlations around  CLL SLS        BEB unpublished These analyses suggest that IVT and        RPCR are both valid approaches for microarraybased genome        mapping However we expect that the greatly increased        dynamic range and improved fidelity obtained through IVT        will facilitate the identification of additional biological        trends within these data                    Conclusion        In conclusion we have presented a novel linear        amplification protocol for genomic DNA We find that this        protocol generates higher yields and better maintains the        size distribution of the starting material than an        alternative RPCR approach Extensive microarraybased        analyses suggest that improvements in yield dynamic range        and fidelity render linear amplification a better option        for genome mapping studies                    Methods                  Preparation of genomic DNA from yeast          Genomic DNA used in amplification protocols was

using Klenow fragment and random          primers and incorporating aminoallyl dUTP as described          at httpwwwmicroarraysorg                          Microarrays hybridization and scanning          Yeast ORFs were amplified from a set of  plasmids          using universal primers as described     This set of          ORFs was printed on separate slides hydrated and          snapdried as described     Mixed CyCylabeled          probes were hybridized to microarrays for  h at          C After hybridization microarrays were washed as          described    and scanned with a GenePix B scanner          with GENEPIX PRO  software Axon Instruments          Microarray data are available at          httpwwwschreiberchemharvardedu                          Microarray data processing          The CyCy ratio for each array element was          calculated using GENEPIX PRO  log            transformed and normalized using          the default computed normalization method used by the          Stanford Microarray Database     We applied a high          stringency data selection keeping only microarray          elements for which at least  of the measurements          within a set of experiments had fluorescence intensity in          both channels at least fold over background intensity           array elements passed these selection criteria                          Comparison of amplification methods          IVT RPCR and direct labeling procedures and          hybridizations were each carried out in triplicate To          assess reproducibility of each method the correlation          coefficients were calculated for all possible          combinations of pairs within each set of replicates and          then averaged Next a single averaged dataset was          generated for each method by determining the geometric          mean for each array element from a given set of          replicates To assess the degree of similarity among the          different methods correlation coefficients were          calculated in pairwise comparisons of these averaged          datasets An additional correlation coefficient was          calculated between averaged datasets using only those          features whose ratios in the direct labeling dataset          reflect at least a fold change either up or          down          Hierarchical clustering of the nonaveraged replicate          datasets was carried out using the Cluster program with          average linkage using Pearson correlation as the          similarity metric     Clusters were visualized using          TreeView     To assess the degree of overlap among          the different methods the number of features among the          top  log            CyCy ratios was determined for          each pairwise comparison and plotted in Venn Diagrams          with the overlap region scaled to the number of features          To assess the dynamic range characteristics of the three          methods the range of the data for each method was taken          as an interval extending  standard deviations on either          side of the mean across the entire array                            Authors
