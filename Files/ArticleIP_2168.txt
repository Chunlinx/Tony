                      By MichaelKinsley                        Twenty years ago theSupreme Court made a mess of campaignfinance reform A Watergateinspired lawof  had placed dollar limits on campaign contributions and campaignspending for federal offices In Buckley vs Valeo  the courtruled that spending limits violate the First Amendment The government cannotrestrict your right to spend money communicating the message of your choiceThe court upheld contribution limits on the reasoning that contributing moneyto someone else is not an act of speech Spending limits for presidentialcampaigns were allowed as a quid pro quo for accepting federal funds            Havingcontribution limits but no spending limits creates all sorts of weirdanomalies above all the shadowy and often farcical distinction betweenindependent and coordinated expenditure If your spending is coordinated inany way with the campaign youre supporting its held to be an inkindcontribution subject to limits Unless that is you yourself are thecandidate in which case you may spend and coordinate to your hearts contentIt all makes perfect sensein theory            The court wandered back into this thicket last month andwandered out again Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee vsFederal Election Commission held that the government cannot restrictspending by the state Republican Party on behalf of a Republican Senatecandidate But the opinions were all over the lot Some Justices said that thespending was independent and therefore OK Some said it was coordinated but OKanyway in the case of a political party Some said it was coordinated andtherefore not OK And Clarence Thomas said the whole game was absurdbecause contributions deserve First Amendment protection just likeexpenditure            Theofficial googoo position for  years has been that Buckley vs Valeois wrong for the opposite reason Spending limits should be OK too Theshorthand argument is that money isnt speech Spending limits dont preventanyone from expressing an opinion At most they regulate the volume of speechnot the content Efforts to level the playing field of politics and reducepolitical corruption by reducing the role of money actually serve FirstAmendment interests The New York Times has published innumerableeditorial riffs on these themes            But how would the New York Times feel about areform that did the same thing in the field of newspapers That is a lawdesigned to level the playing field and promote diversity in an increasinglyconcentrated industry vital to the political debate The law would limit theamount anyone could spend in a year for the purpose of publishing a newspaperThe law would place no limits on what could be said in a newspaperonlyon what could be spent on a newspaper And suppose that the limit weresomewhat less than the Times now spends less even than its inhousedownsizers dream of spending The Times  I think would find seriousFirst Amendment difficulties with such a law            As thisexample shows money indeed is speech Restrictions on peoples right to spendmoney expressing themselves is a very realand unconstitutionalrestrictionon their right of free speech The government certainly may address the problemof unequal voices in the political debate It may do so through devices thatincrease the quantity or volume of speech such as financial subsidies or freeTV time To some extent the government neednt be impartial It can promote themessages it prefers drugs are bad over messages it doesnt drugs arefun What it should not be allowed to do is to level the debate by reducingthe volume or quantity of someones speech And that means money            So is Clarence Thomas right Are contribution limits nodifferent Thomas opinion is part of an increasingly popular line amongconservatives that the best campaign reform would be to repeal the old rulesnot to pass new ones Senate Republicans last month killed a reform bill thatwould have cracked down on PACs soft money and other current arrangementssome people dont care for A major Republican talking point was thatcontribution limits are an offense against freedom of speech            Itsfun to see Justice Thomas and Republican senators calling for antimajoritarianjudicial activism What they are saying is that even though contribution limitsare so popular that voters are clamoring for more and even though these limitsare embodied in a law duly enacted by a majority in Congress and signed by thepresident unelected judgesI believe thats the usual epithetshould tellthe people they cant have their way George Will has written column aftercolumn sermonizing about First Amendment excesses lecturing sternly about thedifference between speech and action and ridiculing the idea that forexample flagburning sends a political message and therefore qualifies forFirst Amendment protection Yet there he is in Newsweek last weekhuffing that campaignfinance reform has done more damage to constitutionalvalues than Watergate and endorsing Thomas notion that politicalcontributions are acts of political expression as well as exercises infreedom of association            Thats the argument and its pretty weak Unlike sayburning the flag the act of making a political contribution is not primarilyintended to send a message In fact the contribution would often be unknown ifit werent for federal reporting regulations As the court reasoned in the message implicit in a campaign contributionI support Candidate Xhaslittle to do with the size of the contribution A bigger contribution may ormay not mean I really really support Candidate X Freedom ofassociation is an even bigger stretchone that Justice Thomas would laugh outof court if some liberal proposed it Contribution limits dont stop you fromassociating publicly or privately with a candidate or cause working for thecampaign or even signifying your association by donating money They mayprevent you from associating with the senator at an exclusive cocktail partyfor lobbyists and other large giversbut thats the whole idea            A muddy distinction likethe one between independent and coordinated campaign spending usuallysignifies that the underlying principle needs work In this case theprinciplegiving First Amendment protection to campaign spending but not tocontributionsis widely mocked from both directions As it happens thoughthe Supreme Court got it just about right  years ago                                                     Michael Kinsley iseditor of SLATE
