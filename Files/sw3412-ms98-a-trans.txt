                 okay uh i guess uh you have any uh favorite foods   well i like to eat um i like to bake a lot im not a gourmet cook but um  just enjoy a lot of oldfashioned cooking   umhum yeah i i used we used to get the uh magazine Gourmet and uh stuff like that uh i i did try   umhum     a few of the the recipes in there and   well how did those those turn out   uh well i made a a um a bread pudding uh fancy style and it came out really good   umhum well that sounds good my son takes the Gourmet um or the Bon Appetite   yeah uh   a magazine and he has prepared several dishes uh  and theyve turned out really well one of those is uh was  i dont even i dont even know what the name of the recipe is to this point but um it was just beef cooked with a a lot of wine and and uh all kinds of spices the rosemary and those kind of things and it turned out really really well   umhum i see yeah i i do a lot of i did ive done some uh you know things like chicken and and stuff in there but i i deviate from it i i never like to follow  sometimes if theres something uh in there that i i dont like ill substitute it with something else and   umhum   and so uh i like to experiment   well well i do too uh in fact uh lot of times i will just uh decide on a a meat and then just put some things around it add some gravies or or um uh sauces and   umhum   the the thing ive found thats bad about that if i dont write it down while im being creative and it turns out wonderfully a lot of times the next time i think about it i dont have that recipe in mind i cant exactly remember exactly how i fixed it   yeah   so ive learned that when i am creative like that that i try and make sure i write that down   umhum   um one of the things that i have had a lot of fun doing is collecting recipes uh well not really a i dont have lots but i have collected a few recipes from restaurants and uh we have um i dont know what part of the country youre from in but im in Dallas   im in the northern area up here in Wisconsin Minnesota   okay well im in Dallas Texas and um here for years and years weve had a waffle shop downtown its closed now but they had famous waffles and i happen to have that recipe right in front of me which is really um doesnt look like a heart healthy recipe at all but its delicious if youre into waffles   yeah uh well i i like waffles but i usually go to restaurant and eat them   umhum umhum   i uh i dont even have a waffle iron   well  you need one of those for sure but it has um  like milk and it has half halfandhalf in it   yeah   and uh  course real butter and   i like all those things that arent good for you   the me too me too and im beginning to show it too     yeah i uh i mean we we do use a lot of the the margarines and that but i do miss actual butter   umhum i dont uh use butter unless i do some special things uh usually around the holidays   huh   and i tend to um feel like i can justify use the use of butter during that time uh not only just you know to put into the recipes but to serve on the table too   yeah well i i know its something that my wife picked up was uh we uh made some um butter from uh you just take heavy whipping cream   umhum   and you keep churning it until it turns to butter so   well ive done that a couple of times not on purpose     yeah   i did that by accident a couple of times one of the things that i think im going to try this um uh  this year for Thanksgiving is i um ive talked to a a gentleman who prepares turkeys by deep frying them have you heard of that   no   he deep fries the turkeys whole in a peanut oil and he says that um and i havent tasted them um but he claims that they are juicy and just very very good um he prepares he can prepare up to a thirty two pound turkey uh with the method that that he uses which is just a big vat with you know lots and lots of the the peanut oil   umhum yeah   so i think that i think thats um
