If youre a b you are certainly alaterborna bold compassionate iconoclast            Sulloway is hardly the first to extract personalitydistinctions from birth order His twist is to use Darwinism to show how thefamilial struggle among siblings for parental attention accounts for everythingin society from social rebellions to scientific revolutions In Sullowaysuniverse firstborns are dictatorial types who just dont get it but theyrehappy to oppress freedomloving laterborns who do So how does Sulloway explainthat the greatest scientific revolutionary of the  th centuryAlbert Einstein is a firstborn He doesnt            Sulloway surprise hes the third of four alsothinks his findings should be applied to selecting corporate leaders In anutshell Oldests need not apply As devoted as he is to birth order as apersonality determinant Sulloway allows other variables to creep into histheory to account for those rare firstborn revolutionaries Whenever oneencounters a firstborn radical and family life does occasionally producethem such individuals are likely to have experienced substantial conflictwith a parent Parentoffspring conflict makes honorary laterborns out of somefirstborns This is a little like saying all men prefer dogs and all womenprefer cats So a man with a cat is either an honorary woman or the cat is anhonorary dog                                             Ease

that Hippocrates believedthe answer was in the balance of four bodily fluids or humorsblood blackbile phlegm and yellow bile This notion lives on in our language today Weall know people who are essentially hotblooded or melancholy which literallymeans black bile or phlegmatic or who view the world with a jaundiced eyePlato less interested in humans inner states than in their behavior asmembers of the state redefined the four humors in social terms as artisansguardians rationals and idealists According to psychologist David Keirseyyou are one of Platos four types you were born that way you will always bethat way and you can find out which one you are by taking the temperamentsorter quiz on his Website Sample questions When the phone rings do you a hurry to get itfirst or b hope someone else will answer Do you find visionaries andtheorists a somewhat annoying or b rather fascinating            Keirsey does not muckaround in your excretions in order to determine your personality His criteriacome from Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung by way of an American motherdaughterteam named Katharine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers who created theMyersBriggs Type Indicator The two women translated Jungs idea thatpersonality is composed of four pairs of preferencesthe most famous beingextroverted and introvertedand created a systematic test to discern peoplestypes Keirsey has redefined these four pairs this way            Expressive E or Reserved I            Observant S or Introspective N            Toughminded T or Friendly F            Scheduling J orProbing P Probing might better be defined as looking for alternatives            The four sets of pairs can be matched up different wayswith Keirsey organizing these into those Platonic groups offour For example Im an NT which makes me a Rational therefore naturallycurious restless and doubting More specifically Im an ENTP As Keirseywrites A rough draft is all they need to feel confident and ready to proceedinto action  They have been known to engage in brinkmanship with theirsuperiors  ENTPs like to spar verbally with their loved ones            OK he nailed me As an example of how uncanny thetype sorter can be take Bill Clinton who Keirsey classifies as an ESFP InKeirseys book Please Understand Me II  ESFPs are described asinclined to be impulsive and selfindulgent which makes them vulnerable toseduction  Pleasure seems to be an end in itself  they will do what theyfeel like in the moment rather than what is good for them in the long run blaming someone else if things dont turn out well  Intent on pleasingeverybody ESFPs can appear fickle even promiscuous to other types On theother hand maybe Clinton is just too hotblooded                                             Ease of Use                Good Irecommend taking the Temperament Sorter II and ignoring the Character Sorterwhich I found confusing and not particularly accurate                                             Applicability                High Ifeel I now understand better why I keep acting that way Its also given me thesly sense that I know why other people are acting their way Of course thatsvery ENTP of me                                             GandhiExplanation                According to Keirsey Gandhi is an Idealist an NFwhat else More specifically an INFJ INFJs have an unusually strong desireto contribute to the welfare of others  INFJs are scarce little more thanone percent of the population which is too bad considering their usefulnessin the social order                           INTELLIGENCE                        Until Harvard professor Howard Gardner came alongintelligence was like the Soviet Union It was large permanent and unifiedThen in  he published his book Frames of Mind The Theory of MultipleIntelligences  which cleaved intelligence into seven components Recentlylike a breakaway republic Gardner has added an eighth intelligence and isconsidering a ninth            Gardner rejects the notion that intelligence is asingle general capacity that can be measured by taking a test He believesan intelligence is the ability to solve problems or create products in a waythat society valuesthat having it must have conferred an evolutionaryadvantage to us and that there is biological evidence for it That is anintelligence can be destroyed due to brain injury which could be called theman who mistook his wife for a hat criterion Gardner says if you excel atone type of intelligence it has no bearing on whether youll be skilled atanother Instead of burdening people with eight ways to be inadequate insteadof one multiple intelligence advocates says the theory liberates people tofind their own set of strengths            The seven original intelligences are linguisticmusical logicalmathematical spatial bodilykinesthetic interpersonal andintrapersonal my favorite since I have a genius for selfabsorption Thelatest addition is naturalist intelligence Gardner defines it as the abilityto recognize and classify plants minerals and animals Gardner says you cansee it in action in people who know every kind of dinosaur or sneaker orautomobile He is also considering adding existential intelligence which hesays refers to the inclination to ask Who are we Where do we come fromWhats it all about Why do we die This could also be known as the Oygevalt  intelligence Since I felt that his theory left out people whoare skilled at the use of the senses of taste and smell I lobbied him to addculinary intelligence Gardner wasnt biting I decided to forgo making a pitchfor my own area of brilliance procrastination intelligence            One of Gardners missions is to apply his work tothe classroom since he believes schools are designed by people excelling inlinguistic and logicalmathematical intelligences to reward people who sharethose intelligences He also believes that while our propensity toward certaintypes of intelligence is inborn our abilities are not fixed Understanding ourareas of strength and weakness he says can provide more selfawareness andhelp users move to a higher level of skill                                             Ease of Use

probably get to work on The BileBible  But if Hippocrates were Japanese he wouldnt be at all surprisedTheyve been obsessed with blood type and personality for almost  years Theyalso choose mates with compatible blood types and their corporations assemblework teams based on blood type Luckily the Japanese economy died in time tosave us from the corporate bloodletting fad Until now            In Eat Right for Your Type  naturopath PeterJ DAdamo writes that our ancient genetic heritage is represented today in thefour human blood groupsO A B and ABand that we must follow thenutritional dictates that evolution laid down He says Type O is the mostancient blood group the one of the carnivorous biggame hunter theselfreliant risktaking optimist A later mutation is Type A he writes thatof people adapting to an agrarian diet who were cooperative lawabiding yethighstrung Next came Type B from the Mongolian nomads the most flexible andcreative of the blood types Finally a modern quirk is the rare AB peoplewho are somewhat confused edgy sensitive yet charismatic According toDAdamo eat the right foods for your type and your immune system will bestrengthened and youll lose weight            Unfortunately DAdamos understanding of humanorigins is according to Dr Eric Meikle of the Institute of Human Origins atArizona State University completely worthless According to Meikle there isno evidence that Type O is the earliest blood typequite the opposite since Aand B occur in chimpanzees Nor is it likely that humans went from beingprimarily carnivores to omnivores Among living huntergatherers he says mostof their calories come from vegetable matter because bagging game isdifficult People who are able to eat the most meat are agriculturists saysMeikle They keep animals raise them and eat them            Not surprisingly this kind of information is oflittle interest when youve got a new companion volume  Cook Right for YourType  to your best seller Greg Kelly a naturopath
