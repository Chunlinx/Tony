                there you go     what do you think invades your privacy   oh well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something you know that that try to sell you the newspaper and uh what carpet cleaning and uh what else roof repair uh and enough well i think its a waste of paper the people that always leave uh junk mail and because um you just end up throwing it away most of the time probably eighty percent of the the junk mail that you get is is um something that you dont need and the same way with those calls what is it oh MCI MCI really does even when you tell them no they keep calling back   MCI whats that   MCI its the long distance telephone company   oh now see i i really dont have much trouble with i just say no thank you and hang up   umhum well they wont they wont take a no for an answer here for some reason they just keep calling back   i had a carpet service call up three times   umhum   all within in an hour but i uh i do telemarketing   uhhuh   so uh im very polite and i just say no thank you and say no thank you very politely and i hang up and   uh   dont bother me after that   yeah   so i think the only thing that really bothers me is if when somebody contacts me and they try to get information out of me like the Census Bureau United States Census Bureau that bothered me   umhum oh yeah umhum   i didnt feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even      right   that i think is my invasion privacy because its the government        and i dont understand what their need to know is   umhum   and i think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy if somebody wants personal information out of me but telephone calls i figure they dont bother me one way or the other   umhum   uh i know when i do telemarketing um im a soft person  if if someone says i am not interested ill just say fine and back out   umhum   and i make very good sales but im not uh as i said        im not half as pushy as these people because i dont really care i mean if if theyre not interested fine you know thats it     you cant force them to be   right   no   and im not pushing something down their throat that uh i dont think is a good item anyway that i dont think i could do anyway   uhhuh        but i feel like oh movie stars or sure its part of their i guess theyre   portray being a movie star they get themselves in these rag sheets but uh i think they go too far i think thats invasion of privacy   oh yeah because they follow them around twenty four hours a day   yeah  oh yeah   and you know they do Ted Kennedy of course hes breaking the law all the time so its a different story then        you know but but Ed McMahon i mean you know who cares about Ed McMahon hes probably hasnt done anything interesting in the last thirty years that theyve been on the air       you know and he has a chauffeur maybe he drinks but he never drives a car either you know its not the same with Johnny Carson   no i think my seriously my classification of of invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information   umhum   and putting it falsely out or just bombarding me for the answers      without your and without your permission umhum   right this to me is is my invasion of privacy   right   anytime i can honestly say no or throw the paper away or but you can always write to uh oh i forgot the name of it and stop the junk mail that ive done because i dont want junk mail anyway so i wrote to them when it came on the air so i dont get any of that bull that it works by the way   oh good   but uh the telephone doesnt bother me because i leave it half the time on uh you know answering service anyway unless im home   umhum   so i figure i can turn it off one way or the other but i think thats the only bottom line thing that i dislike because it does other than the U S Census um what was it oh the the carpet place that called me three times   umhum   that i felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place and called me three times i mean one should be sufficient   thats right   but if people dont use the telephone its like i dont know when the police has their project going and i dont know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things thats the only way i know   umhum   and uh thats it   well you have to have the telephone but you cant you know and and its sometimes its hard to screen out all the calls that you dont want   well see theres no way of knowing thats you know thats the problem like the product i sell   umhum   uh i sell mostly to older people which cant get it in a normal public situation the only way wed get to them is by telephone   um   and uh most of them like it because the company i work for is nationwide and uh reputable and they know that hey were backing it one hundred percent   umhum   but if we were denied the right to call people up these people would never be able to get it because your normal companies that offer it do not offer it in the amounts that we do and theyd never have it then at that point   hm uhhum   because we offer it in a very low you know quantity so i mean i i dont know what to do as far as thats concerned but it is nerve racking i mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone but at least as i said you can always say no thank you   right umhum     i gather you get a lot of telephone calls   sometimes yeah some days it just rings off the wall   yes yes yes in other words you own your own home      no no uhhuh   i think thats where they hit most of us like i own my own home and you just know about what time like some days i hate staying home because the phone rings all the time but uh i dont know i havent been able to figure that out something else to do about it when they call up and want to say well tell me this this this this and ill give you a free something or another   umhum   my answer is no thank you i dont need it and they say well dont you want to know whats free and i say no        if i have to give them so much to answer the questions to get fifty rolls of film or something like that theyre taking something away from me and i dont like that   right yeah   even if i guess its for coupons they they have a survey they run and it i guess it one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking   uhhuh   and they ask that you know they start out and they ask you even even to your income level i think thats you know whether you buy a TV dinner or not i dont think it has anything to do with what
