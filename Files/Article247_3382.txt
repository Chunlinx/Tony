                                 The Bell Epoch                        Its hard to imagine David but when The Coming of PostIndustrialSociety was first published in  much of the controversy it generatedarose from the threat it seemed to present to scientific Marxism How dare Bellsuggest that there might be an interim postindustrial stage between thetwilight of monopoly capitalism and the dawn of socialism You are right thatMarx is not in vogue at the moment although there are somesoidisant Marxist guerrillas stirring in Colombia I do not know ofany Bellist guerrillas anywhere except perhaps at the American EnterpriseInstitute            You are of course bang right about stock options muddying the olddichotomy between the capitalist and working classesalthough some people havetold me that they can feel quite proletarian when their options are underwater            Before delving back into this slagheap of a book for additional nuggetslet me take a breather and say a few more words about Bell the man                           He marks himself off from his fellow New York intellectuals by describinghimself as a social democrat in economics a liberal in politics and aconservative in culture               In the mid s he and Irving Kristol founded the policy journal ThePublic Interest  arguing that with the end of ideology the ladder to theCity of Heaven must be an empirical one based on hardheadedproblemsolving               Nonetheless in the s Bell refused to be lumped with Irving Kristol andthe neocons saying Whenever I read about neoconservatism I think Thatisnt neoconservatism its just Irving                Although it is not always apparent in his writing Bell can be wittysometimes wickedly so About his late brotherinlaw the loveable butnotoriously irascible Alfred Kazin he once remarked Were all human butAlfred abuses the privilege               An index of Bells stature abroad An international jury has just honoredhim with the Prix Tocqueville which carries a cash award of  Frenchfrancs Previous recipients include Raymond Aron Karl Popper and OctavioPaz               Yiddish was Bells first language as he grew up on New Yorks Lower EastSide An uncle changed the family name from Bolotsky to Bell                        Now back to the book The more I think about Bells farsightedness the lessimpressed I am by it Most of the trends he wrote about were well establishedby the early s The United States had already become the first nation in theworld in which services had come to dominate manufacturing both in employmentand as a share of GNP Computerization had been under way for two decadesInformation technology had been playing an increasing role in industrialproduction since after the Second World War when the field of operationsresearch inventory control etc was invented to help the US miliarymanage its massive war effort When Bell peers into the future toward the year his forecasts are often the opposite of what has proved to be the caseFor instance he predicted that more and more public outcomes would bedetermined by government technocrats rather than the market the way thingsare say in France That has not happenedas witness for instance healthcare which after the political fiasco of Hillary Clintons abortive reformis increasingly being governed by insurance companies and HMOs            So what is Bells achievement in this book He was the first to identify thestructural changes in American society that led to the information age Hedreamed up a conceptual scheme full of ideal types and whatnot that tiedeverything together I dont think that conceptual scheme has a whole lot ofexplanatory or predictive valuethe way Marxs would if only it were truebutat least it has helped us to see the postindustrial society steadily andwhole and as something qualitatively different from the industrial societythat it superseded By naming the thing Bell ushered it into existence Thanksto him we see it as obvious a clich            One thing still bothers me though Bell often writes about information asthough it is something we consume directly something that makes us happy Infact our utility functions as economists call them have not reallychanged The final goods from which we derive satisfaction are food andmanufactured objectsthe products of agricultural and industrial societyInformation has transformed the mode of production rationalized it madeproduction and markets more efficient and so on But the informationrevolution has not changed the nature of the good life Or has it David
