        how do you fill about drugs testing     will im sorry i have i had mixed fillings about it um at originally i thought all man im all for it totally then you know and then um   umhum   uh after i got to thinking about it after its been around a while now i think well its theres you know uh maybe it not quite should not be quite as a as wide spread as i as i use to think it should be you know maybe in certain depends on the job really you know   umhum yeah   i happen to work uh in a medical profession and uh i work at a hospital and i think thats a good one that that it should be required at you know i myself wouldnt mind taking it   umhum   but i do also believe there are times when um you you can come out on the bad end of the stick you know uh because of it   well yeah im im more of the uh im kind of more against it than i am for it i i think that people i think people should more be they should be judge on you know their performance and i   yeah yeah sure   i guess it kind of seems to me thats it kind of a you know   yeah   the positive you the test type thing that you know people should pay attention to how there employees are you know the supervisors   thats right thats right and then   should keep an eye on them i i think that should be the the deciding factor in umhum   yeah well i agree with that to i mean if you can if there is a reason you might think you need to check them maybe so but um if there doing good performance if i had a good record yeah thats a good point you know why why should you      and it also kind of i mean   you know   i dont know it it kind of frighten me in in one way because it it seems like its um its kind of a personal you know your   yeah sure   checking you know your body and everything and if if they can if they can you know do a do a drug test you know they can   thats right thats right and um really really where whats the next step you know yeah and uh cause myself i drink and uh you im im sure that you know when will they   you you know get get away with testing other things yeah exactly yeah i mean thats a drug as well its just   thats true thats true and whats whats really the difference there alcohol is worst than a lot of drugs that they might uh consider illegal you know  and um but they um uh   uhhuh thats true      i mean i know in alcohol i mean if you if you drink the night before and what if you have the test the next day maybe that will be the next step is alcohol testing you know breath analyzers or something   uhhuh well right now with a with air line pilots and stuff i i now my stepfather works for Northwest Airlines and they had a   yeah yeah   a thing a a while back and he knew one of the guys that got in trouble for i guess he had gone out the night before   uhhuh uhhuh   and um had had to much to drink and you are not suppose to drink within i think i think its like twelve hours or twenty four i know theres a certain   uhhuh before they go a back on there jobs   yeah before before they get back on the job and and he had been been within that time period   yeah right yeah   and   yeah thats thats thats yeah i know its   they got they came down on on him hard for that   im sure he did and he was probably perfectly capable you there was nothing at all that he couldnt have done you know as far as his job     yeah yeah it just change it vary so much from person person to person is  its a subjective type thing   you know thats true thats true yeah and uh i mean i never thought about it but you know you may drink and uh drink a hole lot one night and you may be going out going somewhere the next day like Sunday afternoon and you you be perfectly fine all over again and uh if they did a test on you you might not pass   you never know   you know just just from the night before and um you know thats thats sort like the drugs testing you know   umhum and it it seems there there are a lot of profession now it seems like um you know am sure the president of the United States doesnt get drug tested but hes got a lot of responsibilities and   thats right yeah   uh as as seems like you know some things   yeah   if there are going to do it you know like i know a lot of government um jobs are   yeah thats thats true yeah thats true   require drug testing you know it seems like they should uh not   right i know what you are saying   be you know they should not be hypocritical about it   thats right if you know um if you know if theyre going to do it just do it totally nation wide every job there is you know or or else you know just dont do it   they having such a big problem with the   i mean it makes good sense   the drug war anyway its   yeah really i mean thats where the real problem is i mean um but where i work uh i think they have talked about it you know and uh but nothing like that has come up at all you know   yeah uhhuh am surprise they they dont work i work for uh Georgia Tech Research Institute im a student employee and they have got a   yeah uhhuh   you know we work on a lot of government project and stuff but um but you know some of them require   yeah yeah   i mean some people are working with some kind of classified information but non of that i  think   right right   but uh they dont require any type of testing there and i remember i was in uh   yeah yeah   i was in the Air Force for uh a little while and they had a random type thing going   yeah yeah uhhuh uhhuh   so every i mean every i mean im a rejoining basic trainer or      right right   just one mourning like every one from you know this flight or what every would be tested   sure sure   its kind of a random thing   right right   but then i know of some other jobs
