                                 Jeremy Rifkins Spurious Suit Against Monsanto                        At this point shareholders in lifesciences giant Monsanto have to bewondering what else can go wrong Last year the companys prospective mergerwith American Home Products unraveled in acrimony over leadership and strategyquestions The companys agribusiness unit which it had once planned to makethe center of its operations became the target of serious opposition in Europeto genetically modified seeds and crops Even as the major stock indicescontinued to rise briskly Monsantos shares have languished And this pastweek has seen bad news on two different fronts Last Tuesday a classactionlawsuit orchestrated by environmental gadfly Jeremy Rifkin was filed againstthe company while today investors reacted to news of Monsantos planned mergerwith Pharmacia  Upjohn by sending the companys shares down percent            Ive written enough here about the vices of mergers and those vices arewelldocumented enough to make any extended comment on the MonsantoPharmaciadeal superfluous Theres no good reason to think that this deal will work andit smacks of a move madeby both Monsanto and Pharmaciato preempt otherperhaps hostile suitors So the Streets reaction to the deal was sensibleThe one interesting element of that reaction though was that investors werefrustrated that as part of the deal Monsanto will be spinning off just percent of its agribusiness unit That unit is now generally acknowledged to bea drain on the companys stock price and so Monsanto shareholders have beenhoping for a full spinoff But in the wake of this deal tax considerationsmake anything more than a  percent spinoff next to impossible to pulloff            In the long run that may actually be a good thing Given the ongoing uproarover genetically modified crops an uproar that has played an important role inthe opposition to the World Trade Organization and that has become a key tradeissue between the United States and Europe agribusiness certainly seems to bea shortterm loser But half of all the soybean crops and a third of all thecorn in the United States are already genetically modified varieties and thepossibilities of using genetic modification to increase crop yields and protectagainst pesticides to say nothing of creating vitaminenhanced crops are sowideranging that it seems difficult to imagine they will be dismissed out ofhand            Of course thats exactly what Jeremy Rifkin would like to do The lawsuitfiled last week on behalf of a small group of American farmers and a Frenchorganic farmer was a haphazard and scattershot collection of charges that mighthave been designed to demonstrate the excesses to which the US legal systemcan be driven The lawsuit accuses Monsanto of introducing products withouttesting them sufficiently for safety misleading farmers about these productsand monopolizing the patents and sale of these unsafe products In other wordsits a classaction unsafeproduct fraud antitrust lawsuit The damages beingasked for are unspecified but Rifkin has said they could amount to hundredsof millions of dollars How he reached that figure remains unclear            The suit is exactly what it appears to be a publicity stunt To begin withMonsanto hasnt violated any law by selling genetically modified seeds and infact its products have been certified by the FDA which needless to say doesnot certify normal seeds And the company cant be accused of selling unsafeproducts because theres no evidence that the products are unsafe Thats whythe suit just says they should have tested more The fraud charge seems equallyspurious since Monsanto has been straightforward about its testing proceduresAnd as for the antitrust charge the fact that Novartis DuPont Dow andAstraZeneca are all named in the suit as coconspirators though not actualdefendants makes the monopoly charge a bit hard to believe Perhaps we couldnext sue Ford GM DaimlerChrysler Toyota and Volkswagen for monopolizing theauto market            Obviously there are important issues about geneticallymodified agriculturethat have yet to be resolved And just as obviously the major agribusinesscompanies have hurt themselves by obstinately opposing things like labeling ofgenetically modified crops which is now required in Japan the EU and SouthKorea But classaction lawsuits are not useful ways of determining publicpolicy Perhaps the most ridiculous aspect of this whole farce is Rifkins useof the word populist to describe the suit They are though very usefulways of fomenting illconsidered controversies And in that sense I supposethe suit is already a great success
