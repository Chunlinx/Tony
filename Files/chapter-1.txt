WE HAVE SOME PLANES    Tuesday September   dawned temperate and nearly cloudless in the eastern United States Millions of men and women readied themselves for work Some made their way to the Twin Towers the signature structures of the World Trade Center complex in New York City Others went to Arlington Virginia to the Pentagon Across the Potomac River the United States Congress was back in session At the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue people began to line up for a White House tour In Sarasota Florida President George W Bush went for an early morning run    For those heading to an airport weather conditions could not have been better for a safe and pleasant journey Among the travelers were Mohamed Atta and Abdul Aziz al Omari who arrived at the airport in Portland MaineINSIDE THE FOUR FLIGHTSBoarding the Flights    Boston American  and United  Atta and Omari boarded a  AM flight from Portland to Bostons Logan International Airport    When he checked in for his flight to Boston Atta was selected by a computerized prescreening system known as CAPPS Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System created to identify passengers who should be subject to special security measures Under security rules in place at the time the only consequence of Attas selection by CAPPS was that his checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that he had boarded the aircraft This did not hinder Attas plans    Atta and Omari arrived in Boston at  Seven minutes later Atta apparently took a call from Marwan al Shehhi a longtime colleague who was at another terminal at Logan Airport They spoke for three minutes    It would be their final conversation    Between  and  Atta and Omari along with Satam al Suqami Wail al Shehri and Waleed al Shehri checked in and boarded American Airlines Flight  bound for Los Angeles The flight was scheduled to depart at     In another Logan terminal Shehhi joined by Fayez Banihammad Mohand al Shehri Ahmed al Ghamdi and Hamza al Ghamdi checked in for United Airlines Flight  also bound for Los Angeles A couple of Shehhis colleagues were obviously unused to travel according to the United ticket agent they had trouble understanding the standard security questions and she had to go over them slowly until they gave the routine reassuring answers    Their flight was scheduled to depart at     The security checkpoints through which passengers including Atta and his colleagues gained access to the American  gate were operated by Globe Security under a contract with American Airlines In a different terminal the single checkpoint through which passengers for United  passed was controlled by United Airlines which had contracted with Huntleigh USA to perform the screening    In passing through these checkpoints each of the hijackers would have been screened by a walkthrough metal detector calibrated to detect items with at least the metal content of a caliber handgun Anyone who might have set off that detector would have been screened with a hand wanda procedure requiring the screener to identify the metal item or items that caused the alarm In addition an Xray machine would have screened the hijackers carryon belongings The screening was in place to identify and confiscate weapons and other items prohibited from being carried onto a commercial flight    None of the checkpoint supervisors recalled the hijackers or reported anything suspicious regarding their screening    While Atta had been selected by CAPPS in Portland three members of his hijacking teamSuqami Wail al Shehri and Waleed al Shehriwere selected in Boston Their selection affected only the handling of their checked bags not their screening at the checkpoint All five men cleared the checkpoint and made their way to the gate for American  Atta Omari and Suqami took their seats in business class seats D G and B respectively The Shehri brothers had adjacent seats in row  Wail in A Waleed in B in the firstclass cabin They boarded American  between  and  The aircraft pushed back from the gate at     Shehhi and his team none of whom had been selected by CAPPS boarded United  between  and  Banihammad in A Shehri in B Shehhi in C Hamza al Ghamdi in C and Ahmed al Ghamdi in D Their aircraft pushed back from the gate just before     Washington Dulles American  Hundreds of miles southwest of Boston at Dulles International Airport in the Virginia suburbs of Washington DC five more men were preparing to take their early morning flight At  a pair of them Khalid al Mihdhar and Majed Moqed checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight  bound for Los Angeles Within the next  minutes they would be followed by Hani Hanjour and two brothers Nawaf al Hazmi and Salem al Hazmi    Hani Hanjour Khalid al Mihdhar and Majed Moqed were flagged by CAPPS The Hazmi brothers were also selected for extra scrutiny by the airlines customer service representative at the checkin counter He did so because one of the brothers did not have photo identification nor could he understand English and because the agent found both of the passengers to be suspicious The only consequence of their selection was that their checked bags were held off the plane until it was confirmed that they had boarded the aircraft    All five hijackers passed through the Main Terminals west security screening checkpoint United Airlines which was the responsible air carrier had contracted out the work to Argenbright Security    The checkpoint featured closedcircuit television that recorded all passengers including the hijackers as they were screened At  Mihdhar and Moqed entered the security checkpoint    Mihdhar and Moqed placed their carryon bags on the belt of the Xray machine and proceeded through the first metal detector Both set off the alarm and they were directed to a second metal detector Mihdhar did not trigger the alarm and was permitted through the checkpoint After Moqed set it off a screener wanded him He passed this inspection    About  minutes later at  another passenger for Flight  Hani Hanjour placed two carryon bags on the Xray belt in the Main Terminals west checkpoint and proceeded without alarm through the metal detector A short time later Nawaf and Salem al Hazmi entered the same checkpoint Salem al Hazmi cleared the metal detector and was permitted through Nawaf al Hazmi set off the alarms for both the first and second metal detectors and was then handwanded before being passed In addition his overtheshoulder carryon bag was swiped by an explosive trace detector and then passed The video footage indicates that he was carrying an unidentified item in his back pocket clipped to its rim    When the local civil aviation security office of the Federal Aviation Administration FAA later investigated these security screening operations the screeners recalled nothing out of the ordinary They could not recall that any of the passengers they screened were CAPPS selectees We asked a screening expert to review the videotape of the handwanding and he found the quality of the screeners work to have been marginal at best The screener should have resolved what set off the alarm and in the case of both Moqed and Hazmi it was clear that he did not    At  Majed Moqed and Khalid al Mihdhar boarded the flight and were seated in A and B in coach Hani Hanjour assigned to seat B first class soon followed The Hazmi brothers sitting in E and F joined Hanjour in the firstclass cabin    Newark United  Between  and  Saeed al Ghamdi Ahmed al Nami Ahmad al Haznawi and Ziad Jarrah checked in at the United Airlines ticket counter for Flight  going to Los Angeles Two checked bags two did not Haznawi was selected by CAPPS His checked bag was screened for explosives and then loaded on the plane    The four men passed through the security checkpoint owned by United Airlines and operated under contract by Argenbright Security Like the checkpoints in Boston it lacked closedcircuit television surveillance so there is no documentary evidence to indicate when the hijackers passed through the checkpoint what alarms may have been triggered or what security procedures were administered The FAA interviewed the screeners later none recalled anything unusual or suspicious    The four men boarded the plane between  and  All four had seats in the firstclass cabin their plane had no businessclass section Jarrah was in seat B closest to the cockpit Nami was in C Ghamdi in D and Haznawi in B    The  men were aboard four transcontinental flights    They were planning to hijack these planes and turn them into large guided missiles loaded with up to  gallons of jet fuel By  AM on the morning of Tuesday September  they had defeated all the security layers that Americas civil aviation security system then had in place to prevent a hijacking The Hijacking of American  American Airlines Flight  provided nonstop service from Boston to Los Angeles On September  Captain John Ogonowski and First Officer Thomas McGuinness piloted the Boeing  It carried its full capacity of nine flight attendants Eightyone passengers boarded the flight with them including the five terrorists The plane took off at  Just before  it had climbed to  feet not quite its initial assigned cruising altitude of  feet All communications and flight profile data were normal About this time the Fasten Seatbelt sign would usually have been turned off and the flight attendants would have begun preparing for cabin service    At that same time American  had its last routine communication with the ground when it acknowledged navigational instructions from the FAAs air traffic control ATC center in Boston Sixteen seconds after that transmission ATC instructed the aircrafts pilots to climb to  feet That message and all subsequent attempts to contact the flight were not acknowledged From this and other evidence we believe the hijacking began at  or shortly thereafter    Reports from two flight attendants in the coach cabin Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney tell us most of what we know about how the hijacking happened As it began some of the hijackersmost likely Wail al Shehri and Waleed al Shehri who were seated in row  in first classstabbed the two unarmed flight attendants who would have been preparing for cabin service    We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight Ong speculated that they had jammed their way in Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key to force one of them to open the cockpit door or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way    At the same time or shortly thereafter Attathe only terrorist on board trained to fly a jetwould have moved to the cockpit from his businessclass seat possibly accompanied by Omari As this was happening passenger Daniel Lewin who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari was stabbed by one of the hijackersprobably Satam al Suqami who was seated directly behind Lewin Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him not realizing that another was sitting behind him    The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace pepper spray or some other irritant in the firstclass cabin in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane They claimed they had a bomb    About five minutes after the hijacking began Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary North Carolina via an ATT airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight This was the first of several occasions on  when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training which emphasized that in a hijacking they were to communicate with the cockpit crew The emergency call lasted approximately  minutes as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground    At  Ong reportedThe cockpit is not answering somebodys stabbed in business classand I think theres Macethat we cant breatheI dont know I think were getting hijacked She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants    At  one of the American employees receiving Ongs call in North Carolina Nydia Gonzalez alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth Texas reaching Craig Marquis the manager on duty Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airlines dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit At  the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft Six minutes later the air traffic control specialist in Americans operations center contacted the FAAs Boston Air Traffic Control Center about the flight The center was already aware of the problem    Boston Center knew of a problem on the flight in part because just before  the hijackers had attempted to communicate with the passengers The microphone was keyed and immediately one of the hijackers said Nobody move Everything will be okay If you try to make any moves youll endanger yourself and the airplane Just stay quiet Air traffic controllers heard the transmission Ong did not The hijackers probably did not know how to operate the cockpit radio communication system correctly and thus inadvertently broadcast their message over the air traffic control channel instead of the cabin publicaddress channel Also at  and again at  Amy Sweeney got through to the American Flight Services Office in Boston but was cut off after she reported someone was hurt aboard the flight Three minutes later Sweeney was reconnected to the office and began relaying updates to the manager Michael Woodward    At  Ong reported that the plane was flying erratically A minute later Flight  turned south American also began getting identifications of the hijackers as Ong and then Sweeney passed on some of the seat numbers of those who had gained unauthorized access to the cockpit    Sweeney calmly reported on her line that the plane had been hijacked a man in first class had his throat slashed two flight attendants had been stabbedone was seriously hurt and was on oxygen while the others wounds seemed minor a doctor had been requested the flight attendants were unable to contact the cockpit and there was a bomb in the cockpit Sweeney told Woodward that she and Ong were trying to relay as much information as they could to people on the ground    At  Ong told Gonzalez that the plane was flying erratically again Around this time Sweeney told Woodward that the hijackers were Middle Easterners naming three of their seat numbers One spoke very little English and one spoke excellent English The hijackers had gained entry to the cockpit and she did not know how The aircraft was in a rapid descent    At  Sweeney told Woodward that passengers in coach were under the impression that there was a routine medical emergency in first class Other flight attendants were busy at duties such as getting medical supplies while Ong and Sweeney were reporting the events    At  in Americans operations center a colleague told Marquis that the air traffic controllers declared Flight  a hijacking and think hes American  headed toward Kennedy airport in New York City Theyre moving everybody out of the way They seem to have him on a primary radar They seem to think that he is descending    At  Gonzalez reported losing phone contact with Ong About this same time Sweeney reported to Woodward Something is wrong We are in a rapid descent    we are all over the place Woodward asked Sweeney to look out the window to see if she could determine where they were Sweeney respondedWe are flying low We are flying very very low We are flying way too low Seconds later she saidOh my God we are way too low The phone call ended    At  American  crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City    All on board along with an unknown number of people in the tower were killed instantly    The Hijacking of United  United Airlines Flight  was scheduled to depart for Los Angeles at  Captain Victor Saracini and First Officer Michael Horrocks piloted the Boeing  which had seven flight attendants Fiftysix passengers boarded the flight    United  pushed back from its gate at  and departed Logan Airport at  By  it had reached its assigned cruising altitude of  feet The flight attendants would have begun their cabin service    The flight had taken off just as American  was being hijacked and at  the United  flight crew completed their report on a suspicious transmission overheard from another plane which turned out to have been Flight  just after takeoff This was United s last communication with the ground    The hijackers attacked sometime between  and  They used knives as reported by two passengers and a flight attendant Mace reported by one passenger and the threat of a bomb reported by the same passenger They stabbed members of the flight crew reported by a flight attendant and one passenger Both pilots had been killed reported by one flight attendant The eyewitness accounts came from calls made from the rear of the plane from passengers originally seated further forward in the cabin a sign that passengers and perhaps crew had been moved to the back of the aircraft Given similarities to American  in hijacker seating and in eyewitness reports of tactics and weapons as well as the contact between the presumed team leaders Atta and Shehhi we believe the tactics were similar on both flights    The first operational evidence that something was abnormal on United  came at  when the aircraft changed beacon codes twice within a minute At  the flight deviated from its assigned altitude and a minute later New York air traffic controllers began repeatedly and unsuccessfully trying to contact it    At  in Easton Connecticut a man named Lee Hanson received a phone call from his son Peter a passenger on United  His son told him I think theyve taken over the cockpitAn attendant has been stabbed and someone else up front may have been killed The plane is making strange moves Call United AirlinesTell them its Flight  Boston to LA Lee Hanson then called the Easton Police Department and relayed what he had heard    Also at  a male flight attendant called a United office in San Francisco reaching Marc Policastro The flight attendant reported that the flight had been hijacked both pilots had been killed a flight attendant had been stabbed and the hijackers were probably flying the plane The call lasted about two minutes after which Policastro and a colleague tried unsuccessfully to contact the flight    At  the flight took a heading toward New York City    At  Flight  passenger Brian David Sweeney tried to call his wife Julie He left a message on their home answering machine that the plane had been hijacked He then called his mother Louise Sweeney told her the flight had been hijacked and added that the passengers were thinking about storming the cockpit to take control of the plane away from the hijackers    At  Lee Hanson received a second call from his son Peter Its getting bad DadA stewardess was stabbedThey seem to have knives and MaceThey said they have a bombIts getting very bad on the planePassengers are throwing up and getting sickThe plane is making jerky movementsI dont think the pilot is flying the planeI think we are going downI think they intend to go to Chicago or someplace and fly into a buildingDont worry Dad If it happens itll be very fastMy God my God    The call ended abruptly Lee Hanson had heard a woman scream just before it cut off He turned on a television and in her home so did Louise Sweeney Both then saw the second aircraft hit the World Trade Center    At  United Airlines Flight  struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center    All on board along with an unknown number of people in the tower were killed instantly    The Hijacking of American  American Airlines Flight  was scheduled to depart from Washington Dulles for Los Angeles at  The aircraft was a Boeing  piloted by Captain Charles F Burlingame and First Officer David Charlebois There were four flight attendants On September  the flight carried  passengers    American  pushed back from its gate at  and took off at  At  the flight reached its assigned cruising altitude of  feet Cabin service would have begun At  American  transmitted its last routine radio communication The hijacking began between  and  As on American  and United  the hijackers used knives reported by one passenger and moved all the passengers and possibly crew to the rear of the aircraft reported by one flight attendant and one passenger Unlike the earlier flights the Flight  hijackers were reported by a passenger to have box cutters Finally a passenger reported that an announcement had been made by the pilot that the plane had been hijacked Neither of the firsthand accounts mentioned any stabbings or the threat or use of either a bomb or Mace though both witnesses began the flight in the firstclass cabin    At  the aircraft deviated from its assigned course turning south Two minutes later the transponder was turned off and even primary radar contact with the aircraft was lost The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center repeatedly tried and failed to contact the aircraft American Airlines dispatchers also tried without success    At  American Airlines Executive Vice President Gerard Arpey learned that communications had been lost with American  This was now the second American aircraft in trouble He ordered all American Airlines flights in the Northeast that had not taken off to remain on the ground Shortly before  suspecting that American  had been hijacked American headquarters concluded that the second aircraft to hit the World Trade Center might have been Flight  After learning that United Airlines was missing a plane American Airlines headquarters extended the ground stop nationwide    At  Renee May called her mother Nancy May in Las Vegas She said her flight was being hijacked by six individuals who had moved them to the rear of the plane She asked her mother to alert American Airlines Nancy May and her husband promptly did so    At some point between  and  Barbara Olson called her husband Ted Olson the solicitor general of the United States She reported that the flight had been hijacked and the hijackers had knives and box cutters She further indicated that the hijackers were not aware of her phone call and that they had put all the passengers in the back of the plane About a minute into the conversation the call was cut off Solicitor General Olson tried unsuccessfully to reach Attorney General John Ashcroft    Shortly after the first call Barbara Olson reached her husband again She reported that the pilot had announced that the flight had been hijacked and she asked her husband what she should tell the captain to do Ted Olson asked for her location and she replied that the aircraft was then flying over houses Another passenger told her they were traveling northeast The Solicitor General then informed his wife of the two previous hijackings and crashes She did not display signs of panic and did not indicate any awareness of an impending crash At that point the second call was cut off    At  the autopilot on American  was disengaged the aircraft was at  feet and approximately  miles west of the Pentagon    At  controllers at the Dulles Terminal Radar Approach Control observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed This was later determined to have been Flight     At  Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport advised the Secret Service of an unknown aircraft heading in the direction of the White House American  was then  miles westsouthwest of the Pentagon and began a degree turn At the end of the turn it was descending through  feet pointed toward the Pentagon and downtown Washington The hijacker pilot then advanced the throttles to maximum power and dove toward the Pentagon    At  American Airlines Flight  crashed into the Pentagon traveling at approximately  miles per hour    All on board as well as many civilian and military personnel in the building were killed    The Battle for United  At  United Airlines Flight  took off from Newark New Jersey Liberty International Airport bound for San Francisco The aircraft was piloted by Captain Jason Dahl and First Officer Leroy Homer and there were five flight attendants Thirtyseven passengers including the hijackers boarded the plane Scheduled to depart the gate at  the Boeing s takeoff was delayed because of the airports typically heavy morning traffic    The hijackers had planned to take flights scheduled to depart at  American   United  and United  and  American  Three of the flights had actually taken off within  to  minutes of their planned departure times United  would ordinarily have taken off about  minutes after pulling away from the gate When it left the ground at  the flight was running more than  minutes late    As United  left Newark the flights crew members were unaware of the hijacking of American  Around  the FAA American and United were facing the staggering realization of apparent multiple hijackings At  they would see another aircraft strike the World Trade Center Crisis managers at the FAA and the airlines did not yet act to warn other aircraft    At the same time Boston Center realized that a message transmitted just before  by the hijacker pilot of American  included the phrase We have some planes    No one at the FAA or the airlines that day had ever dealt with multiple hijackings Such a plot had not been carried out anywhere in the world in more than  years and never in the United States As news of the hijackings filtered through the FAA and the airlines it does not seem to have occurred to their leadership that they needed to alert other aircraft in the air that they too might be at risk    United  was hijacked between  and  and awareness of that hijacking began to spread after  American  was hijacked between  and  By  FAA and airline officials began to comprehend that attackers were going after multiple aircraft American Airlines nationwide ground stop between  and  was followed by a United Airlines ground stop FAA controllers at Boston Center which had tracked the first two hijackings requested at  that Herndon Command Center get messages to airborne aircraft to increase security for the cockpit There is no evidence that Herndon took such action Boston Center immediately began speculating about other aircraft that might be in danger leading them to worry about a transcontinental flightDelta that in fact was not hijacked At  the FAAs New England regional office called Herndon and asked that Cleveland Center advise Delta  to use extra cockpit security    Several FAA air traffic control officials told us it was the air carriers responsibility to notify their planes of security problems One senior FAA air traffic control manager said that it was simply not the FAAs place to order the airlines what to tell their pilots    We believe such statements do not reflect an adequate appreciation of the FAAs responsibility for the safety and security of civil aviation    The airlines bore responsibility too They were facing an escalating number of conflicting and for the most part erroneous reports about other flights as well as a continuing lack of vital information from the FAA about the hijacked flights We found no evidence however that American Airlines sent any cockpit warnings to its aircraft on  Uniteds first decisive action to notify its airborne aircraft to take defensive action did not come until  when a United flight dispatcher Ed Ballinger took the initiative to begin transmitting warnings to his  transcontinental flights Beware any cockpit intrusion Two ac aircraft hit World Trade Center One of the flights that received the warning was United  Because Ballinger was still responsible for his other flights as well as Flight  his warning message was not transmitted to Flight  until     By all accounts the first  minutes of Flight s crosscountry trip proceeded routinely Radio communications from the plane were normal Heading speed and altitude ran according to plan At  Ballingers warning to United  was received in the cockpit Within two minutes at  the pilot Jason Dahl responded with a note of puzzlement Ed confirm latest mssg plzJason    The hijackers attacked at  While traveling  feet above eastern Ohio United  suddenly dropped  feet Eleven seconds into the descent the FAAs air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft During the first broadcast the captain or first officer could be heard declaring Mayday amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit The second radio transmission  seconds later indicated that the fight was continuing The captain or first officer could be heard shouting Hey get out of hereget out of hereget out of here    On the morning of  there were only  passengers on United  in addition to the  hijackers This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of  But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation    The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on  operated in fiveman teams They initiated their cockpit takeover within  minutes of takeoff On Flight  however the takeover took place  minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight Mohamed al Kahtani had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Floridas Orlando International Airport in August    Because several passengers on United  described three hijackers on the plane not four some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals usually air carrier or FAA personnel We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers or anyone else sat there on this flight All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class and they seem to have used them We believe it is more likely that Jarrah the crucial pilottrained member of their team remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized and once inside he would not have been visible to the passengers    At  a hijacker probably Jarrah made or attempted to make the following announcement to the passengers of Flight Ladies and Gentlemen Here the captain please sit down keep remaining sitting We have a bomb on board So sit The flight data recorder also recovered indicates that Jarrah then instructed the planes autopilot to turn the aircraft around and head east    The cockpit voice recorder data indicate that a woman most likely a flight attendant was being held captive in the cockpit She struggled with one of the hijackers who killed or otherwise silenced her    Shortly thereafter the passengers and flight crew began a series of calls from GTE airphones and cellular phones These calls between family friends and colleagues took place until the end of the flight and provided those on the ground with firsthand accounts They enabled the passengers to gain critical information including the news that two aircraft had slammed into the World Trade Center    At  the FAAs Cleveland Air Route Traffic Control Center overheard a second announcement indicating that there was a bomb on board that the plane was returning to the airport and that they should remain seated    While it apparently was not heard by the passengers this announcement like those on Flight  and Flight  was intended to deceive them Jarrah like Atta earlier may have inadvertently broadcast the message because he did not know how to operate the radio and the intercom To our knowledge none of them had ever flown an actual airliner before    At least two callers from the flight reported that the hijackers knew that passengers were making calls but did not seem to care It is quite possible Jarrah knew of the success of the assault on the World Trade Center He could have learned of this from messages being sent by United Airlines to the cockpits of its transcontinental flights including Flight  warning of cockpit intrusion and telling of the New York attacks But even without them he would certainly have understood that the attacks on the World Trade Center would already have unfolded given Flight s tardy departure from Newark If Jarrah did know that the passengers were making calls it might not have occurred to him that they were certain to learn what had happened in New York thereby defeating his attempts at deception    At least ten passengers and two crew members shared vital information with family friends colleagues or others on the ground All understood the plane had been hijacked They said the hijackers wielded knives and claimed to have a bomb The hijackers were wearing red bandanas and they forced the passengers to the back of the aircraft    Callers reported that a passenger had been stabbed and that two people were lying on the floor of the cabin injured or deadpossibly the captain and first officer One caller reported that a flight attendant had been killed    One of the callers from United  also reported that he thought the hijackers might possess a gun But none of the other callers reported the presence of a firearm One recipient of a call from the aircraft recounted specifically asking her caller whether the hijackers had guns The passenger replied that he did not see one No evidence of firearms or of their identifiable remains was found at the aircrafts crash site and the cockpit voice recorder gives no indication of a gun being fired or mentioned at any time We believe that if the hijackers had possessed a gun they would have used it in the flights last minutes as the passengers fought back    Passengers on three flights reported the hijackers claim of having a bomb The FBI told us they found no trace of explosives at the crash sites One of the passengers who mentioned a bomb expressed his belief that it was not real Lacking any evidence that the hijackers attempted to smuggle such illegal items past the security screening checkpoints we believe the bombs were probably fake    During at least five of the passengers phone calls information was shared about the attacks that had occurred earlier that morning at the World Trade Center Five calls described the intent of passengers and surviving crew members to revolt against the hijackers According to one call they voted on whether to rush the terrorists in an attempt to retake the plane They decided and acted    At  the passenger assault began Several passengers had terminated phone calls with loved ones in order to join the revolt One of the callers ended her message as followsEveryones running up to first class Ive got to go Bye    The cockpit voice recorder captured the sounds of the passenger assault muffled by the intervening cockpit door Some family members who listened to the recording report that they can hear the voice of a loved one among the din We cannot identify whose voices can be heard But the assault was sustained    In response Jarrah immediately began to roll the airplane to the left and right attempting to knock the passengers off balance At  Jarrah told another hijacker in the cockpit to block the door Jarrah continued to roll the airplane sharply left and right but the assault continued At  Jarrah changed tactics and pitched the nose of the airplane up and down to disrupt the assault The recorder captured the sounds of loud thumps crashes shouts and breaking glasses and plates At  Jarrah stabilized the airplane    Five seconds later Jarrah asked Is that it Shall we finish it offA hijacker respondedNo Not yet When they all come we finish it off The sounds of fighting continued outside the cockpit Again Jarrah pitched the nose of the aircraft up and down At  a passenger in the background saidIn the cockpit If we dont well die Sixteen seconds later a passenger yelledRoll it Jarrah stopped the violent maneuvers at about  and saidAllah is the greatest Allah is the greatest He then asked another hijacker in the cockpit Is that it I mean shall we put it down to which the other repliedYes put it in it and pull it down    The passengers continued their assault and at  a hijacker said Pull it down Pull it downThe hijackers remained at the controls but must have judged that the passengers were only seconds from overcoming them The airplane headed down the control wheel was turned hard to the right The airplane rolled onto its back and one of the hijackers began shouting Allah is the greatest Allah is the greatest With the sounds of the passenger counterattack continuing the aircraft plowed into an empty field in Shanksville Pennsylvania at  miles per hour about  minutes flying time from Washington DC    Jarrahs objective was to crash his airliner into symbols of the American Republic the Capitol or the White House He was defeated by the alerted unarmed passengers of United IMPROVISING A HOMELAND DEFENSEThe FAA and NORAD    On  the defense of US airspace depended on close interaction between two federal agencies the FAA and the North American Aerospace Defense Command NORAD The most recent hijacking that involved US air traffic controllers FAA management and military coordination had occurred in  In order to understand how the two agencies interacted eight years later we will review their missions command and control structures and working relationship on the morning of     FAA Mission and Structure As of September   the FAA was mandated by law to regulate the safety and security of civil aviation From an air traffic controllers perspective that meant maintaining a safe distance between airborne aircraft    Many controllers work at the FAAs  Air Route Traffic Control Centers They are grouped under regional offices and coordinate closely with the national Air Traffic Control System Command Center located in Herndon Virginia which oversees daily traffic flow within the entire airspace system FAA headquarters is ultimately responsible for the management of the National Airspace System The Operations Center located at FAA headquarters receives notifications of incidents including accidents and hijackings    FAA Control Centers often receive information and make operational decisions independently of one another On  the four hijacked aircraft were monitored mainly by the centers in Boston New York Cleveland and Indianapolis Each center thus had part of the knowledge of what was going on across the system What Boston knew was not necessarily known by centers in New York Cleveland or Indianapolis or for that matter by the Command Center in Herndon or by FAA headquarters in Washington    Controllers track airliners such as the four aircraft hijacked on  primarily by watching the data from a signal emitted by each aircrafts transponder equipment Those four planes like all aircraft traveling above  feet were required to emit a unique transponder signal while in flight    On  the terrorists turned off the transponders on three of the four hijacked aircraft With its transponder off it is possible though more difficult to track an aircraft by its primary radar returns But unlike transponder data primary radar returns do not show the aircrafts identity and altitude Controllers at centers rely so heavily on transponder signals that they usually do not display primary radar returns on their radar scopes But they can change the configuration of their scopes so they can see primary radar returns They did this on  when the transponder signals for three of the aircraft disappeared    Before  it was not unheard of for a commercial aircraft to deviate slightly from its course or for an FAA controller to lose radio contact with a pilot for a short period of time A controller could also briefly lose a commercial aircrafts transponder signal although this happened much less frequently However the simultaneous loss of radio and transponder signal would be a rare and alarming occurrence and would normally indicate a catastrophic system failure or an aircraft crash In all of these instances the job of the controller was to reach out to the aircraft the parent company of the aircraft and other planes in the vicinity in an attempt to reestablish communications and set the aircraft back on course Alarm bells would not start ringing until these effortswhich could take five minutes or morewere tried and had failedNORAD Mission and Structure NORAD is a binational command established in  between the United States and Canada Its mission was and is to defend the airspace of North America and protect the continent That mission does not distinguish between internal and external threats but because NORAD was created to counter the Soviet threat it came to define its job as defending against external attacks    The threat of Soviet bombers diminished significantly as the Cold War ended and the number of NORAD alert sites was reduced from its Cold War high of  Some within the Pentagon argued in the s that the alert sites should be eliminated entirely In an effort to preserve their mission members of the air defense community advocated the importance of air sovereignty against emerging asymmetric threats to the United States drug smuggling nonstate and statesponsored terrorists and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile technology    NORAD perceived the dominant threat to be from cruise missiles Other threats were identified during the late s including terrorists use of aircraft as weapons Exercises were conducted to counter this threat but they were not based on actual intelligence In most instances the main concern was the use of such aircraft to deliver weapons of mass destruction    Prior to  it was understood that an order to shoot down a commercial aircraft would have to be issued by the National Command Authority a phrase used to describe the president and secretary of defense Exercise planners also assumed that the aircraft would originate from outside the United States allowing time to identify the target and scramble interceptors The threat of terrorists hijacking commercial airliners within the United Statesand using them as guided missileswas not recognized by NORAD before  Notwithstanding the identification of these emerging threats by  there were only seven alert sites left in the United States each with two fighter aircraft on alert This led some NORAD commanders to worry that NORAD was not postured adequately to protect the United States    In the United States NORAD is divided into three sectors On  all the hijacked aircraft were in NORADs Northeast Air Defense Sector also known as NEADS which is based in Rome New York That morning NEADS could call on two alert sites each with one pair of ready fighters Otis Air National Guard Base in Cape Cod Massachusetts and Langley Air Force Base in Hampton Virginia    Other facilities not on alert would need time to arm the fighters and organize crews    NEADS reported to the Continental US NORAD Region CONR headquarters in Panama City Florida which in turn reported to NORAD headquarters in Colorado Springs ColoradoInteragency Collaboration The FAA and NORAD had developed protocols for working together in the event of a hijacking As they existed on  the protocols for the FAA to obtain military assistance from NORAD required multiple levels of notification and approval at the highest levels of government    FAA guidance to controllers on hijack procedures assumed that the aircraft pilot would notify the controller via radio or bysquawkinga transponder code of the universal code for a hijack in progress Controllers would notify their supervisors who in turn would inform management all the way up to FAA headquarters in Washington Headquarters had a hijack coordinator who was the director of the FAA Office of Civil Aviation Security or his or her designate    If a hijack was confirmed procedures called for the hijack coordinator on duty to contact the Pentagons National Military Command Center NMCC and to ask for a military escort aircraft to follow the flight report anything unusual and aid search and rescue in the event of an emergency The NMCC would then seek approval from the Office of the Secretary of Defense to provide military assistance If approval was given the orders would be transmitted down NORADs chain of command    The NMCC would keep the FAA hijack coordinator up to date and help the FAA centers coordinate directly with the military NORAD would receive tracking information for the hijacked aircraft either from joint use radar or from the relevant FAA air traffic control facility Every attempt would be made to have the hijacked aircraft squawk  to help NORAD track it    The protocols did not contemplate an intercept They assumed the fighter escort would be discreet vectored to a position five miles directly behind the hijacked aircraft where it could perform its mission to monitor the aircrafts flight path    In sum the protocols in place on  for the FAA and NORAD to respond to a hijacking presumed thatthe hijacked aircraft would be readily identifiable and would not attempt to disappearthere would be time to address the problem through the appropriate FAA and NORAD chains of command andthe hijacking would take the traditional form that is it would not be a suicide hijacking designed to convert the aircraft into a guided missile    On the morning of  the existing protocol was unsuited in every respect for what was about to happenAmerican Airlines Flight FAA Awareness Although the Boston Center air traffic controller realized at an early stage that there was something wrong with American  he did not immediately interpret the planes failure to respond as a sign that it had been hijacked At  when the flight failed to heed his instruction to climb to  feet the controller repeatedly tried to raise the flight He reached out to the pilot on the emergency frequency Though there was no response he kept trying to contact the aircraft    At  American  turned off its transponder immediately degrading the information available about the aircraft The controller told his supervisor that he thought something was seriously wrong with the plane although neither suspected a hijacking The supervisor instructed the controller to follow standard procedures for handling a no radio aircraft    The controller checked to see if American Airlines could establish communication with American  He became even more concerned as its route changed moving into another sectors airspace Controllers immediately began to move aircraft out of its path and asked other aircraft in the vicinity to look for American     At  the following transmission came from American  American  We have some planes Just stay quiet and youll be okay We are returning to the airport    The controller only heard something unintelligible he did not hear the specific words we have some planes The next transmission came seconds later American  Nobody move Everything will be okay If you try to make any moves youll endanger yourself and the airplane Just stay quiet    The controller told us that he then knew it was a hijacking He alerted his supervisor who assigned another controller to assist him He redoubled his efforts to ascertain the flights altitude Because the controller didnt understand the initial transmission the manager of Boston Center instructed his quality assurance specialist to pull the tape of the radio transmission listen to it closely and report back    Between  and  in accordance with the FAA protocol Boston Center managers started notifying their chain of command that American  had been hijacked At  Boston Center called the Command Center in Herndon to advise that it believed American  had been hijacked and was heading toward New York Centers airspace    By this time American  had taken a dramatic turn to the south At  the Command Center passed word of a possible hijacking to the Operations Center at FAA headquarters The duty officer replied that security personnel at headquarters had just begun discussing the apparent hijack on a conference call with the New England regional office FAA headquarters began to follow the hijack protocol but did not contact the NMCC to request a fighter escort    The Herndon Command Center immediately established a teleconference between Boston New York and Cleveland Centers so that Boston Center could help the others understand what was happening    At  the Boston Center controller received a third transmission from American     American  Nobody move please We are going back to the airport Dont try to make any stupid moves    In the succeeding minutes controllers were attempting to ascertain the altitude of the southbound flightMilitary Notification and Response Boston Center did not follow the protocol in seeking military assistance through the prescribed chain of command In addition to notifications within the FAA Boston Center took the initiative at  to contact the military through the FAAs Cape Cod facility The center also tried to contact a former alert site in Atlantic City unaware it had been phased out At  Boston Center reached NEADS This was the first notification received by the militaryat any levelthat American  had been hijacked    FAA Hi Boston Center TMU Traffic Management Unit we have a problem here We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York and we need you guys to we need someone to scramble some Fs or something up there help us out    NEADS Is this realworld or exercise    FAA No this is not an exercise not a test     NEADS ordered to battle stations the two F alert aircraft at Otis Air Force Base in Falmouth Massachusetts  miles away from New York City The air defense of America began with this call    At NEADS the report of the hijacking was relayed immediately to Battle Commander Colonel Robert Marr After ordering the Otis fighters to battle stations Colonel Marr phoned Major General Larry Arnold commanding general of the First Air Force and NORADs Continental Region Marr sought authorization to scramble the Otis fighters General Arnold later recalled instructing Marr to go ahead and scramble them and well get authorities later General Arnold then called NORAD headquarters to report     F fighters were scrambled at  from Otis Air Force Base But NEADS did not know where to send the alert fighter aircraft and the officer directing the fighters pressed for more informationI dont know where Im scrambling these guys to I need a direction a destination Because the hijackers had turned off the planes transponder NEADS personnel spent the next minutes searching their radar scopes for the primary radar return American  struck the NorthTower at  Shortly after  while NEADS personnel were still trying to locate the flight word reached them that a plane had hit the World Trade Center     Radar data show the Otis fighters were airborne at  Lacking a target they were vectored toward militarycontrolled airspace off the Long Island coast To avoid New York area air traffic and uncertain about what to do the fighters were brought down to military airspace to hold as needed From  to  the Otis fighters stayed in this holding pattern    In summary NEADS received notice of the hijacking nine minutes before it struck the North Tower That nine minutes notice before impact was the most the military would receive of any of the four hijackings United Airlines Flight  FAA Awareness One of the last transmissions from United Airlines Flight  is in retrospect chilling By  controllers at the FAAs New York Center were seeking information on American  At approximately  shortly after entering New York Centers airspace the pilot of United  broke in with the following transmission    UAL  New York UAL  heavy    FAA UAL  go ahead    UAL  Yeah We figured wed wait to go to your center Ah we heard a suspicious transmission on our departure out of Boston ah with someone ah it sounded like someone keyed the mikes and said ah everyone ah stay in your seats    FAA Oh okay Ill pass that along over here    Minutes later United  turned southwest without clearance from air traffic control At  seconds after the impact of American  United s transponder code changed and then changed again These changes were not noticed for several minutes however because the same New York Center controller was assigned to both American  and United  The controller knew American  was hijacked he was focused on searching for it after the aircraft disappeared at     At  while the controller was still trying to locate American  a New York Center manager provided the following report on a Command Center teleconference about American     Manager New York Center Okay This is New York Center Were watching the airplane I also had conversation with American Airlines and theyve told us that they believe that one of their stewardesses was stabbed and that there are people in the cockpit that have control of the aircraft and thats all the information they have right now    The New York Center controller and manager were unaware that American  had already crashed    At  the controller noticed the transponder change from United  and tried to contact the aircraft There was no response Beginning at  the controller made repeated attempts to reach the crew of United  Still no response The controller checked his radio equipment and contacted another controller at  saying that we may have a hijack and that he could not find the aircraft    Another commercial aircraft in the vicinity then radioed in with reports over the radio of a commuter plane hitting the World Trade Center The controller spent the next several minutes handing off the other flights on his scope to other controllers and moving aircraft out of the way of the unidentified aircraft believed to be United  as it moved southwest and then turned northeast toward New York City    At about  the controller in charge notified a New York Center manager that she believed United  had also been hijacked The manager tried to notify the regional managers and was told that they were discussing a hijacked aircraft presumably American  and refused to be disturbed At  the New York Center controller searching for United  told another New York controller we might have a hijack over here two of them    Between  and  a manager from New York Center told the Command Center in Herndon    Manager New York Center We have several situations going on here Its escalating big big time We need to get the military involved with us    Were were involved with something else we have other aircraft that may have a similar situation going on here    The other aircraft referred to by New York Center was United  Evidence indicates that this conversation was the only notice received by either FAA headquarters or the Herndon Command Center prior to the second crash that there had been a second hijacking    While the Command Center was told about this other aircraft at  New York Center contacted New York terminal approach control and asked for help in locating United     Terminal I got somebody who keeps coasting but it looks like hes going into one of the small airports down there    Center Hold on a second Im trying to bring him up here and get youThere he is right there Hold on    Terminal Got him just out of  now    Center Do you know who he is    Terminal Were just we just we dont know who he is Were just picking him up now    Center at  Alright Heads up man it looks like another one coming in    The controllers observed the plane in a rapid descent the radar data terminated over Lower Manhattan At  United  crashed into the South Tower    Meanwhile a manager from Boston Center reported that they had deciphered what they had heard in one of the first hijacker transmissions from American  Boston Center Hey    you still there    New England Region Yes I am    Boston Center    as far as the tape Bobby seemed to think the guy said that we have planes Now I dont know if it was because it was the accent or if theres more than one but Im gonna Im gonna reconfirm that for you and Ill get back to you real quick Okay New England Region Appreciate it    Unidentified Female Voice They have what    Boston Center Planes as in plural    Boston Center It sounds like were talking to New York that theres another one aimed at the World Trade Center    New England Region Theres another aircraft    Boston Center A second one just hit the Trade Center    New England Region Okay Yeah we gotta getwe gotta alert the military real quick on this    Boston Center immediately advised the New England Region that it was going to stop all departures at airports under its control At  Boston Center confirmed for both the FAA Command Center and the New England Region that the hijackers aboard American  said we have planes At the same time New York Center declared ATC zeromeaning that aircraft were not permitted to depart from arrive at or travel through New York Centers airspace until further notice    Within minutes of the second impact Boston Center instructed its controllers to inform all aircraft in its airspace of the events in New York and to advise aircraft to heighten cockpit security Boston Center asked the Herndon Command Center to issue a similar cockpit security alert nationwide We have found no evidence to suggest that the Command Center acted on this request or issued any type of cockpit security alertMilitary Notification and Response The first indication that the NORAD air defenders had of the second hijacked aircraft United  came in a phone call from New York Center to NEADS at  The notice came at about the time the plane was hitting the South Tower    By  the mission crew commander at NEADS learned of the second explosion at the World Trade Center and decided against holding the fighters in military airspace away from Manhattan    Mission Crew Commander NEADS This is what I foresee that we probably need to do We need to talk to FAA We need to tell em if this stuff is gonna keep on going we need to take those fighters put em over Manhattan Thats best thing thats the best play right now So coordinate with the FAA Tell em if theres more out there which we dont know lets get em over Manhattan At least we got some kind of play    The FAA cleared the airspace Radar data show that at  when the Otis fighters were about  miles away from the city the fighters exited their holding pattern and set a course direct for Manhattan They arrived at  and established a combat air patrol CAP over the city    Because the Otis fighters had expended a great deal of fuel in flying first to military airspace and then to New York the battle commanders were concerned about refueling NEADS considered scrambling alert fighters from Langley Air Force Base in Virginia to New York to provide backup The Langley fighters were placed on battle stations at  NORAD had no indication that any other plane had been hijacked    American Airlines Flight  FAA Awareness American  began deviating from its flight plan at  with a slight turn toward the south Two minutes later it disappeared completely from radar at Indianapolis Center which was controlling the flight    The controller tracking American  told us he noticed the aircraft turning to the southwest and then saw the data disappear The controller looked for primary radar returns He searched along the planes projected flight path and the airspace to the southwest where it had started to turn No primary targets appeared He tried the radios first calling the aircraft directly then the airline Again there was nothing At this point the Indianapolis controller had no knowledge of the situation in New York He did not know that other aircraft had been hijacked He believed American  had experienced serious electrical or mechanical failure or both and was gone    Shortly after  Indianapolis Center started notifying other agencies that American  was missing and had possibly crashed At  Indianapolis Center asked Air Force Search and Rescue at Langley Air Force Base to look for a downed aircraft The center also contacted the West Virginia State Police and asked whether any reports of a downed aircraft had been received At  it reported the loss of contact to the FAA regional center which passed this information to FAA headquarters at     By  Indianapolis Center learned that there were other hijacked aircraft and began to doubt its initial assumption that American  had crashed A discussion of this concern between the manager at Indianapolis and the Command Center in Herndon prompted it to notify some FAA field facilities that American  was lost By  the Command Center some FAA field facilities and American Airlines had started to search for American  They feared it had been hijacked At  the Command Center advised FAA headquarters of the situation    The failure to find a primary radar return for American  led us to investigate this issue further Radar reconstructions performed after  reveal that FAA radar equipment tracked the flight from the moment its transponder was turned off at  But for  minutes and  seconds between  and  this primary radar information on American  was not displayed to controllers at Indianapolis Center    The reasons are technical arising from the way the software processed radar information as well as from poor primary radar coverage where American  was flying    According to the radar reconstruction American  reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at  east of its last known position The target remained in Indianapolis Centers airspace for another six minutes then crossed into the western portion of Washington Centers airspace at  As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft two managers and the controller responsible for American  looked to the west and southwest along the flights projected path not eastwhere the aircraft was now heading Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American     In sum Indianapolis Center never saw Flight  turn around By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west Although the Command Center learned Flight  was missing neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets American  traveled undetected for  minutes on a course heading due east for Washington DC    By  FAAs Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center They knew American  was lost At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American  had said we have some planes Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a nationwide ground stop While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters the Command Center ordered one at     The Command Center kept looking for American  At  it advised the Dulles terminal control facility and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets At  they found one Several of the Dulles controllers observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed and notified Reagan National Airport FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service The aircrafts identity or type was unknown    Reagan National controllers then vectored an unarmed National Guard C H cargo aircraft which had just taken off en route to Minnesota to identify and follow the suspicious aircraft The CH pilot spotted it identified it as a Boeing  attempted to follow its path and at  seconds after impact reported to the control towerlooks like that aircraft crashed into the Pentagon sirMilitary Notification and Response NORAD heard nothing about the search for American  Instead the NEADS air defenders heard renewed reports about a plane that no longer existed American     At  NEADS received a report from the FAA FAA Military Boston Center I just had a report that American  is still in the air and its on its way towardsheading towards Washington NEADS Okay American  is still in the air    FAA Yes    NEADS On its way towards Washington    FAA That was anotherit was evidently another aircraft that hit the tower Thats the latest report we have    NEADS Okay    FAA Im going to try to confirm an ID for you but I would assume hes somewhere over uh either New Jersey or somewhere further south    NEADS Okay So American  isnt the hijack at all then right FAA No he is a hijack    NEADS HeAmerican  is a hijack    FAA Yes    NEADS And hes heading into Washington    FAA Yes This could be a third aircraft    The mention of a third aircraft was not a reference to American  There was confusion at that moment in the FAA Two planes had struck the World Trade Center and Boston Center had heard from FAA headquarters in Washington that American  was still airborne We have been unable to identify the source of this mistaken FAA information    The NEADS technician who took this call from the FAA immediately passed the word to the mission crew commander who reported to the NEADS battle commander Mission Crew Commander NEADS Okay uh American Airlines is still airborne Eleven the first guy hes heading towards Washington Okay I think we need to scramble Langley right now And Im gonna take the fighters from Otis try to chase this guy down if I can find him    After consulting with NEADS command the crew commander issued the order at Okay    scramble Langley Head them towards the Washington area    If theyre there then well run on them    These guys are smart That order was processed and transmitted to Langley Air Force Base at  Radar data show the Langley fighters airborne at  NEADS decided to keep the Otis fighters over New York The heading of the Langley fighters was adjusted to send them to the Baltimore area The mission crew commander explained to us that the purpose was to position the Langley fighters between the reported southbound American  and the nations capital    At the suggestion of the Boston Centers military liaison NEADS contacted the FAAs Washington Center to ask about American  In the course of the conversation a Washington Center manager informed NEADSWere looking we also lost American  The time was  This was the first notice to the military that American  was missing and it had come by chance If NEADS had not placed that call the NEADS air defenders would have received no information whatsoever that the flight was even missing although the FAA had been searching for it No one at FAA headquarters ever asked for military assistance with American     At  the FAAs Boston Center called NEADS and relayed the discovery about an unidentified aircraft closing in on WashingtonLatest report Aircraft VFR visual flight rules six miles southeast of the White House    Six southwest Six southwest of the White House deviating away This startling news prompted the mission crew commander at NEADS to take immediate control of the airspace to clear a flight path for the Langley fightersOkay were going to turn it    crank it up    Run them to the White House He then discovered to his surprise that the Langley fighters were not headed north toward the Baltimore area as instructed but east over the ocean I dont care how many windows you break he said Damn it    Okay Push them back    The Langley fighters were heading east not north for three reasons First unlike a normal scramble order this order did not include a distance to the target or the targets location Second a generic flight planprepared to get the aircraft airborne and out of local airspace quicklyincorrectly led the Langley fighters to believe they were ordered to fly due east  for  miles Third the lead pilot and local FAA controller incorrectly assumed the flight plan instruction to go  for  superseded the original scramble order    After the  call to NEADS about the unidentified aircraft a few miles from the White House the Langley fighters were ordered to Washington DC Controllers at NEADS located an unknown primary radar track but it kind of faded over Washington The time was  The Pentagon had been struck by American  at  The Langley fighters were about  miles away    Right after the Pentagon was hit NEADS learned of another possible hijacked aircraft It was an aircraft that in fact had not been hijacked at all After the second World Trade Center crash Boston Center managers recognized that both aircraft were transcontinental  jetliners that had departed Logan Airport Remembering the we have some planes remark Boston Center guessed that Delta  might also be hijacked Boston Center called NEADS at  and identified Delta  a  jet that had left Logan Airport for Las Vegas as a possible hijack NEADS warned the FAAs Cleveland Center to watch Delta  The Command Center and FAA headquarters watched it too During the course of the morning there were multiple erroneous reports of hijacked aircraft The report of American  heading south was the first Delta  was the second    NEADS never lost track of Delta  and even ordered fighter aircraft from Ohio and Michigan to intercept it The flight never turned off its transponder NEADS soon learned that the aircraft was not hijacked and tracked Delta  as it reversed course over Toledo headed east and landed in Cleveland    But another aircraft was heading toward Washington an aircraft about which NORAD had heard nothing United     United Airlines Flight  FAA Awareness At  after having been in the air for  minutes United  acknowledged a transmission from the Cleveland Center controller This was the last normal contact the FAA had with the flight    Less than a minute later the Cleveland controller and the pilots of aircraft in the vicinity heard a radio transmission of unintelligible sounds of possible screaming or a struggle from an unknown origin    The controller responded seconds later Somebody call ClevelandThis was followed by a second radio transmission with sounds of screaming The Cleveland Center controllers began to try to identify the possible source of the transmissions and noticed that United  had descended some  feet The controller attempted again to raise United  several times with no response At  the controller began to poll the other flights on his frequency to determine if they had heard the screaming several said they had    At  a third radio transmission came over the frequencyKeep remaining sitting We have a bomb on board The controller understood but chose to respond Calling Cleveland Center youre unreadable Say again slowly He notified his supervisor who passed the notice up the chain of command By  word of the hijacking had reached FAA headquarters    FAA headquarters had by this time established an open line of communication with the Command Center at Herndon and instructed it to poll all its centers about suspect aircraft The Command Center executed the request and a minute later Cleveland Center reported that United  may have a bomb on board At  the Command Center relayed the information concerning United  to FAA headquarters At approximately  Cleveland advised the Command Center that it was still tracking United  and specifically inquired whether someone had requested the military to launch fighter aircraft to intercept the aircraft Cleveland even told the Command Center it was prepared to contact a nearby military base to make the request The Command Center told Cleveland that FAA personnel well above them in the chain of command had to make the decision to seek military assistance and were working on the issue    Between  and  the Cleveland controller observed United  climbing to  feet and immediately moved several aircraft out its way The controller continued to try to contact United  and asked whether the pilot could confirm that he had been hijacked    There was no response    Then at  a fourth radio transmission was heard from United  Ziad Jarrah Uh this is the captain Would like you all to remain seated There is a bomb on board and are going back to the airport and to have our demands unintelligible Please remain quiet    The controller responded United  understand you have a bomb on board Go ahead The flight did not respond    From  to  a Command Center facility manager provided frequent updates to Acting Deputy Administrator Monte Belger and other executives at FAA headquarters as United  headed toward Washington DC At  Cleveland Center lost United s transponder signal The controller located it on primary radar matched its position with visual sightings from other aircraft and tracked the flight as it turned east then south    At  the Command Center learned from news reports that a plane had struck the Pentagon The Command Centers national operations manager Ben Sliney ordered all FAA facilities to instruct all aircraft to land at the nearest airport This was an unprecedented order The air traffic control system handled it with great skill as about  commercial and general aviation aircraft soon landed without incident    At  the Command Center updated FAA headquarters that United  was now twentynine minutes out of Washington DC At   minutes after Cleveland Center had asked about getting military help the Command Center suggested that someone at headquarters should decide whether to request military assistance FAA Headquarters Theyre pulling Jeff away to go talk about United     Command Center Uh do we want to think uh about scrambling aircraft    FAA Headquarters Oh God I dont know    Command Center Uh thats a decision somebodys gonna have to make probably in the next ten minutes    FAA Headquarters Uh ya know everybody just left the room    At  FAA headquarters informed the Command Center that the deputy director for air traffic services was talking to Monte Belger about scrambling aircraft Then the Command Center informed headquarters that controllers had lost track of United  over the Pittsburgh area Within seconds the Command Center received a visual report from another aircraft and informed headquarters that the aircraft was  miles northwest of Johnstown United  was spotted by another aircraft and at  the Command Center advised FAA headquarters that one of the aircraft had seen United  waving his wings The aircraft had witnessed the hijackers efforts to defeat the passengers counterattack    United  crashed in Pennsylvania at   miles from Washington DC The precise crash time has been the subject of some dispute The  impact time is supported by previous National Transportation Safety Board analysis and by evidence from the Commission staff s analysis of radar the flight data recorder the cockpit voice recorder infrared satellite data and air traffic control transmissions    Five minutes later the Command Center forwarded this update to headquarters Command Center OK Uh there is now on that United     FAA Headquarters Yes    Command Center There is a report of black smoke in the last position I gave you fifteen miles south of Johnstown    FAA Headquarters From the airplane or from the ground    Command Center Uh theyre speculating its from the aircraft FAA Headquarters Okay    Command Center Uh who it hit the ground Thats what theyre speculating thats speculation only    The aircraft that spotted the black smoke was the same unarmed Air National Guard cargo plane that had seen American  crash into the Pentagon  minutes earlier It had resumed its flight to Minnesota and saw the smoke from the crash of United  less than two minutes after the plane went down At  the Command Center advised headquarters of its conclusion that United  had indeed crashed    Despite the discussions about military assistance no one from FAA headquarters requested military assistance regarding United  Nor did any manager at FAA headquarters pass any of the information it had about United  to the militaryMilitary Notification and Response NEADS first received a call about United  from the military liaison at Cleveland Center at  Unaware that the aircraft had already crashed Cleveland passed to NEADS the aircrafts last known latitude and longitude NEADS was never able to locate United  on radar because it was already in the ground    At the same time the NEADS mission crew commander was dealing with the arrival of the Langley fighters over Washington DC sorting out what their orders were with respect to potential targets Shortly after  and having no knowledge either that United  had been heading toward Washington or that it had crashed he explicitly instructed the Langley fighters negative negative clearance to shoot aircraft over the nations capital    The news of a reported bomb on board United  spread quickly at NEADS The air defenders searched for United s primary radar return and tried to locate other fighters to scramble NEADS called Washington Center to report NEADS I also want to give you a headsup Washington    FAA DC Go ahead    NEADS United nine three have you got information on that yet FAA Yeah hes down    NEADS Hes down    FAA Yes    NEADS When did he land Cause we have got confirmation FAA He did not land    NEADS Oh hes down Down    FAA Yes Somewhere up northeast of Camp David    NEADS Northeast of Camp David    FAA Thats the last report They dont know exactly where    The time of notification of the crash of United  was  The NEADS air defenders never located the flight or followed it on their radar scopes The flight had already crashed by the time they learned it was hijackedClarifying the Record    The defense of US airspace on  was not conducted in accord with preexisting training and protocols It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction As it turned out the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes notice on the first hijacked plane no advance notice on the second no advance notice on the third and no advance notice on the fourth    We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew Individual FAA controllers facility managers and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert in groundstopping local traffic and ultimately in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly    More than the actual events inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings raising questions about the adequacy of the response Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the militarys capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources In addition they overstated the FAAs ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning    In public testimony before this Commission in May  NORAD officials stated that at  NEADS received hijack notification of United  from the FAA This statement was incorrect There was no hijack to report at  United  was proceeding normally at that time    In this same public testimony NORAD officials stated that at  NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American  This statement was also incorrect The notice NEADS received at  was that American  had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington DC    In their testimony and in other public accounts NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American  United  or both These statements were incorrect as well The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American  was heading south as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS Continental Region headquarters and NORAD and other records Yet this response to a phantom aircraft was not recounted in a single public timeline or statement issued by the FAA or Department of Defense The inaccurate accounts created the impression that the Langley scramble was a logical response to an actual hijacked aircraft    In fact not only was the scramble prompted by the mistaken information about American  but NEADS never received notice that American  was hijacked It was notified at  that American  was lost Then minutes later NEADS was told that an unknown plane was  miles southwest of the White House Only then did the already scrambled airplanes start moving directly toward Washington DC    Thus the military did not have  minutes to respond to American  as testimony to the Commission in May  suggested It had at most one or two minutes to react to the unidentified plane approaching Washington and the fighters were in the wrong place to be able to help They had been responding to a report about an aircraft that did not exist    Nor did the military have  minutes to respond to United  as would be implied by the account that it received notice of the flights hijacking at  By the time the military learned about the flight it had crashed We now turn to the role of national leadership in the events that morningNATIONAL CRISIS MANAGEMENT    When American  struck the World Trade Center at  no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked While that information circulated within the FAA we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before     Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN    Within the FAA the administrator Jane Garvey and her acting deputy Monte Belger had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed    Others in the agency were aware of it as we explained earlier in this chapter    Inside the National Military Command Center the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident At about  the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American  the scrambling of jets was not discussed    In Sarasota Florida the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E Booker Elementary School where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small twinengine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center The Presidents reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error    At  before entering the classroom the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice who was at the White House She recalled first telling the President it was a twinengine aircraftand then a commercial aircraftthat had struck the World Trade Center adding thats all we know right now Mr President    At the White House Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center The Vice President was wondering how the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower    Elsewhere in the White House a series of  meetings was about to begin In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedulesThe Agencies Confer    When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center nearly everyone in the White House told us they immediately knew it was not an accident The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York    The FAA and White House Teleconferences The FAA the White House and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before  Because none of these teleconferencesat least before  included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings    At about  security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies including the Defense Department The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic it was of little value and there were other important tasks The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of  Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call    At the White House the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism Logs indicate that it began at  and included the CIA the FBI the departments of State Justice and Defense the FAA and the White House shelter The FAA and CIA joined at  The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconferenceat about was the physical security of the President the White House and federal agencies Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American  had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington Indeed it is not clear to us that the video teleconference was fully under way before  when the Pentagon was struck    Garvey Belger and other senior officials from FAA headquarters participated in this video teleconference at various times We do not know who from Defense participated but we know that in the first hour none of the personnel involved in managing the crisis did And none of the information conveyed in the White House video teleconference at least in the first hour was being passed to the NMCC As one witness recalled It was almost like there were parallel decisionmaking processes going on one was a voice conference orchestrated by the NMCC    and then there was the White House video teleconference    In my mind they were competing venues for command and control and decisionmaking    At  the conference received reports of more missing aircraft  possibly  aloft and learned of a combat air patrol over Washington There was discussion of the need for rules of engagement Clarke reported that they were asking the President for authority to shoot down aircraft Confirmation of that authority came at  but the commands were already being conveyed in more direct contacts with the PentagonThe Pentagon Teleconferences Inside the National Military Command Center the deputy director for operations immediately thought the second strike was a terrorist attack The job of the NMCC in such an emergency is to gather the relevant parties and establish the chain of command between the National Command Authoritythe president and the secretary of defense and those who need to carry out their orders    On the morning of September  Secretary Rumsfeld was having breakfast at the Pentagon with a group of members of Congress He then returned to his office for his daily intelligence briefing The Secretary was informed of the second strike in New York during the briefing he resumed the briefing while awaiting more information After the Pentagon was struck Secretary Rumsfeld went to the parking lot to assist with rescue efforts    Inside the NMCC the deputy director for operations called for an allpurpose significant event conference It began at  with a brief recap two aircraft had struck the World Trade Center there was a confirmed hijacking of American  and Otis fighters had been scrambled The FAA was asked to provide an update but the line was silent because the FAA had not been added to the call A minute later the deputy director stated that it had just been confirmed that American  was still airborne and heading toward DC He directed the transition to an air threat conference call NORAD confirmed that American  was airborne and heading toward Washington relaying the erroneous FAA information already mentioned The call then ended at about     It resumed at  as an air threat conference call which lasted more than eight hours The President Vice President Secretary of Defense Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley all participated in this teleconference at various times as did military personnel from the White House underground shelter and the Presidents military aide on Air Force One    Operators worked feverishly to include the FAA but they had equipment problems and difficulty finding secure phone numbers NORAD asked three times before  to confirm the presence of the FAA in the teleconference The FAA representative who finally joined the call at  had no familiarity with or responsibility for hijackings no access to decisionmakers and none of the information available to senior FAA officials     All times given for this conference call are estimates which we and the Department of Defense believe to be accurate within a   minute margin of error    We found no evidence that at this critical time NORADs top commanders in Florida or Cheyenne Mountain coordinated with their counterparts at FAA headquarters to improve awareness and organize a common response Lowerlevel officials improvisedfor example the FAAs Boston Center bypassed the chain of command and directly contacted NEADS after the first hijacking But the highestlevel Defense Department officials relied on the NMCCs air threat conference in which the FAA did not participate for the first  minutes    At  the NMCCs deputy director for operations a military officer opened the call from the Pentagon which had just been hit He beganAn air attack against North America may be in progress NORAD whats the situation NORAD said it had conflicting reports Its latest information was of a possible hijacked aircraft taking off out of JFK en route to Washington DC The NMCC reported a crash into the mall side of the Pentagon and requested that the Secretary of Defense be added to the conference    At  NORAD briefed the conference on the possible hijacking of Delta  Two minutes later staff reported that they were still trying to locate Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice Chairman Myers The Vice Chairman joined the conference shortly before  the Secretary shortly before  The Chairman was out of the country    At  a representative from the White House shelter asked if there were any indications of another hijacked aircraft The deputy director for operations mentioned the Delta flight and concluded that that would be the fourth possible hijack At  the commander of NORAD directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations fully armed    At  an Air Force lieutenant colonel working in the White House Military Office joined the conference and stated he had just talked to Deputy National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley The White House requested  the implementation of continuity of government measures  fighter escorts for Air Force One and  a fighter combat air patrol over Washington DC    By  when United  crashed in Pennsylvania there had been no mention of its hijacking and the FAA had not yet been added to the teleconference    The President and the Vice President The President was seated in a classroom when at  Andrew Card whispered to him A second plane hit the second tower America is under attack The President told us his instinct was to project calm not to have the country see an excited reaction at a moment of crisis The press was standing behind the children he saw their phones and pagers start to ring The President felt he should project strength and calm until he could better understand what was happening    The President remained in the classroom for another five to seven minutes    while the children continued reading He then returned to a holding room shortly before  where he was briefed by staff and saw television coverage He next spoke to Vice President Cheney Dr Rice New York Governor George Pataki and FBI Director Robert Mueller He decided to make a brief statement from the school before leaving for the airport The Secret Service told us they were anxious to move the President to a safer location but did not think it imperative for him to run out the door    Between  and  the staff was busy arranging a return to Washington while the President consulted his senior advisers about his remarks No one in the traveling party had any information during this time that other aircraft were hijacked or missing Staff was in contact with the White House Situation Room but as far as we could determine no one with the President was in contact with the Pentagon The focus was on the Presidents statement to the nation The only decision made during this time was to return to Washington    The Presidents motorcade departed at  and arrived at the airport between  and  During the ride the President learned about the attack on the Pentagon He boarded the aircraft asked the Secret Service about the safety of his family and called the Vice President According to notes of the call at about  the President told the Vice PresidentSounds like we have a minor war going on here I heard about the Pentagon Were at war    somebodys going to pay    About this time Card the lead Secret Service agent the Presidents military aide and the pilot were conferring on a possible destination for Air Force One The Secret Service agent felt strongly that the situation in Washington was too unstable for the President to return there and Card agreed The President strongly wanted to return to Washington and only grudgingly agreed to go elsewhere The issue was still undecided when the President conferred with the Vice President at about the time Air Force One was taking off The Vice President recalled urging the President not to return to Washington Air Force One departed at about  without any fixed destination The objective was to get up in the airas fast and as high as possibleand then decide where to go    At  the tower supervisor at Reagan National Airport picked up a hotline to the Secret Service and told the Services operations center that an aircraft is coming at you and not talking with us This was the first specific report to the Secret Service of a direct threat to the White House No move was made to evacuate the Vice President at this time As the officer who took the call explained I was about to push the alert button when the tower advised that the aircraft was turning south and approaching Reagan National Airport    American  began turning south away from the White House at  It continued heading south for roughly a minute before turning west and beginning to circle back This news prompted the Secret Service to order the immediate evacuation of the Vice President just before  Agents propelled him out of his chair and told him he had to get to the bunker The Vice President entered the underground tunnel leading to the shelter at     Once inside Vice President Cheney and the agents paused in an area of the tunnel that had a secure phone a bench and television The Vice President asked to speak to the President but it took time for the call to be connected He learned in the tunnel that the Pentagon had been hit and he saw television coverage of smoke coming from the building    The Secret Service logged Mrs Cheneys arrival at the White House at  and she joined her husband in the tunnel According to contemporaneous notes at  the Vice President was still on the phone with the President advising that three planes were missing and one had hit the Pentagon We believe this is the same call in which the Vice President urged the President not to return to Washington After the call ended Mrs Cheney and the Vice President moved from the tunnel to the shelter conference room    United  and the Shootdown Order On the morning of  the President and Vice President stayed in contact not by an open line of communication but through a series of calls The President told us he was frustrated with the poor communications that morning He could not reach key officials including Secretary Rumsfeld for a period of time The line to the White House shelter conference roomand the Vice President kept cutting off    The Vice President remembered placing a call to the President just after entering the shelter conference room There is conflicting evidence about when the Vice President arrived in the shelter conference room We have concluded from the available evidence that the Vice President arrived in the room shortly before  perhaps at  The Vice President recalled being told just after his arrival that the Air Force was trying to establish a combat air patrol over Washington    The Vice President stated that he called the President to discuss the rules of engagement for the CAP He recalled feeling that it did no good to establish the CAP unless the pilots had instructions on whether they were authorized to shoot if the plane would not divert He said the President signed off on that concept The President said he remembered such a conversation and that it reminded him of when he had been an interceptor pilot The President emphasized to us that he had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft    The Vice Presidents military aide told us he believed the Vice President spoke to the President just after entering the conference room but he did not hear what they said Rice who entered the room shortly after the Vice President and sat next to him remembered hearing him inform the President Sir the CAPs are up Sir theyre going to want to know what to do Then she recalled hearing him say Yes sir She believed this conversation occurred a few minutes perhaps five after they entered the conference room    We believe this call would have taken place sometime before  to     Among the sources that reflect other important events of that morning there is no documentary evidence for this call but the relevant sources are incomplete Others nearby who were taking notes such as the Vice Presidents chief of staff Scooter Libby who sat next to him and Mrs Cheney did not note a call between the President and Vice President immediately after the Vice President entered the conference room    At  the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraftpresumably hijackedheading toward Washington That aircraft was United  The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA The FAA may have been tracking the progress of United  on a display that showed its projected path to Washington not its actual radar return Thus the Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania    At some time between  and  a military aide told the Vice President and others that the aircraft was  miles out Vice President Cheney was asked for authority to engage the aircraft    His reaction was described by Scooter Libby as quick and decisive in about the time it takes a batter to decide to swing The Vice President authorized fighter aircraft to engage the inbound plane He told us he based this authorization on his earlier conversation with the President The military aide returned a few minutes later probably between  and  and said the aircraft was  miles out He again asked for authorization to engage The Vice President again said yes    At the conference room table was White House Deputy Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten Bolten watched the exchanges and after what he called a quiet momentsuggested that the Vice President get in touch with the President and confirm the engage order Bolten told us he wanted to make sure the President was told that the Vice President had executed the order He said he had not heard any prior discussion on the subject with the President    The Vice President was logged calling the President at  for a twominute conversation that obtained the confirmation On Air Force One the Presidents press secretary was taking notes Ari Fleischer recorded that at  the President told him that he had authorized a shootdown of aircraft if necessary    Minutes went by and word arrived of an aircraft down in Pennsylvania Those in the shelter wondered if the aircraft had been shot down pursuant to this authorization    At approximately  the shelter started receiving reports of another hijacked plane this time only  to  miles out Believing they had only a minute or two the Vice President again communicated the authorization to engage or take out the aircraft At  Hadley told the air threat conference call I need to get word to Dick Myers that our reports are theres an inbound aircraft flying low  miles out The Vice Presidents guidance was we need to take them out    Once again there was no immediate information about the fate of the inbound aircraft In the apt description of one witness It drops below the radar screen and its just continually hovering in your imagination you dont know where it is or what happens to it Eventually the shelter received word that the alleged hijacker  miles away had been a medevac helicopter    Transmission of the Authorization from the White House to the Pilots The NMCC learned of United s hijacking at about  At this time the FAA had no contact with the military at the level of national command The NMCC learned about United  from the White House It in turn was informed by the Secret Services contacts with the FAA    NORAD had no information either At  its representative on the air threat conference call stated that NORAD had no indication of a hijack heading to DC at this time    Repeatedly between  and  a lieutenant colonel at the White House relayed to the NMCC that the Vice President had confirmed fighters were cleared to engage inbound aircraft if they could verify that the aircraft was hijacked    The commander of NORAD General Ralph Eberhart was en route to the NORAD operations center in Cheyenne Mountain Colorado when the shootdown order was communicated on the air threat conference call He told us that by the time he arrived the order had already been passed down NORADs chain of command    It is not clear how the shootdown order was communicated within NORAD But we know that at  General Larry Arnold instructed his staff to broadcast the following over a NORAD instant messaging system  Vice president has cleared to us to intercept tracks of interest and shoot them down if they do not respond per General Arnold    In upstate New York NEADS personnel first learned of the shootdown order from this message Floor Leadership You need to read this    The Region Commander has declared that we can shoot down aircraft that do not respond to our direction Copy that    Controllers Copy that sir    Floor Leadership So if youre trying to divert somebody and he wont divert Controllers DO Director of Operations is saying no    Floor Leadership No It came over the chat    You got a conflict on that direction    Controllers Right now no but Floor Leadership Okay Okay you read that from the Vice President right Vice President has cleared Vice President has cleared us to intercept traffic and shoot them down if they do not respond per General Arnold In interviews with us NEADS personnel expressed considerable confusion over the nature and effect of the order    The NEADS commander told us he did not pass along the order because he was unaware of its ramifications Both the mission commander and the senior weapons director indicated they did not pass the order to the fighters circling Washington and New York because they were unsure how the pilots would or should proceed with this guidance In short while leaders in Washington believed that the fighters above them had been instructed to take out hostile aircraft the only orders actually conveyed to the pilots were to ID type and tail    In most cases the chain of command authorizing the use of force runs from the president to the secretary of defense and from the secretary to the combatant commander The President apparently spoke to Secretary Rumsfeld for the first time that morning shortly after  No one can recall the content of this conversation but it was a brief call in which the subject of shootdown authority was not discussed    At  the Vice President updated the Secretary on the air threat conference Vice President Theres been at least three instances here where weve had reports of aircraft approaching Washingtona couple were confirmed hijack And pursuant to the Presidents instructions I gave authorization for them to be taken out Hello    SecDef Yes I understand Who did you give that direction to    Vice President It was passed from here through the operations center at the White House from the shelter    SecDef OK let me ask the question here Has that directive been transmitted to the aircraft    Vice President Yes it has    SecDef So weve got a couple of aircraft up there that have those instructions at this present time    Vice President That is correct And its my understanding theyve already taken a couple of aircraft out    SecDef We cant confirm that Were told that one aircraft is down but we do not have a pilot report that did it    As this exchange shows Secretary Rumsfeld was not in the NMCC when the shootdown order was first conveyed He went from the parking lot to his office where he spoke to the President then to the Executive Support Center where he participated in the White House video teleconference He moved to the NMCC shortly before  in order to join Vice Chairman Myers Secretary Rumsfeld told us he was just gaining situational awareness when he spoke with the Vice President at  His primary concern was ensuring that the pilots had a clear understanding of their rules of engagement    The Vice President was mistaken in his belief that shootdown authorization had been passed to the pilots flying at NORADs direction By  there was however another set of fighters circling Washington that had entirely different rules of engagement These fighters part of the th Wing of the District of Columbia Air National Guard launched out of Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland in response to information passed to them by the Secret Service The first of the Andrews fighters was airborne at     General David Wherleythe commander of the th Wingreached out to the Secret Service after hearing secondhand reports that it wanted fighters airborne A Secret Service agent had a phone in each ear one connected to Wherley and the other to a fellow agent at the White House relaying instructions that the White House agent said he was getting from the Vice President The guidance for Wherley was to send up the aircraft with orders to protect the White House and take out any aircraft that threatened the Capitol General Wherley translated this in military terms to flying weapons freethat is the decision to shoot rests in the cockpit or in this case in the cockpit of the lead pilot He passed these instructions to the pilots that launched at  and afterward    Thus while the fighter pilots under NORAD direction who had scrambled out of Langley never received any type of engagement order the Andrews pilots were operating weapons freea permissive rule of engagement The President and the Vice President indicated to us they had not been aware that fighters had been scrambled out of Andrews at the request of the Secret Service and outside the military chain of command    There is no evidence that NORAD headquarters or military officials in the NMCC knewduring the morning of September that the Andrews planes were airborne and operating under different rules of engagementWhat If    NORAD officials have maintained consistently that had the passengers not caused United  to crash the military would have prevented it from reaching Washington DC That conclusion is based on a version of events that we now know is incorrect The Langley fighters were not scrambled in response to United  NORAD did not have  minutes to intercept the flight NORAD did not even know the plane was hijacked until after it had crashed It is appropriate therefore to reconsider whether United  would have been intercepted    Had it not crashed in Pennsylvania at  we estimate that United  could not have reached Washington any earlier than  and probably would have arrived before  There was only one set of fighters circling Washington during that time framethe Langley Fs They were armed and under NORADs control After NEADS learned of the hijacking at  NORAD would have had from  to  minutes to locate the flight receive authorization to shoot it down and communicate the order to the pilots who in the same span would have had to authenticate the order intercept the flight and execute the order    At that point in time the Langley pilots did not know the threat they were facing did not know where United  was located and did not have shootdown authorization    First the Langley pilots were never briefed about the reason they were scrambled As the lead pilot explained I reverted to the Russian threat    Im thinking cruise missile threat from the sea You know you look down and see the Pentagon burning and I thought the bastards snuck one by us    You couldnt see any airplanes and no one told us anything The pilots knew their mission was to divert aircraft but did not know that the threat came from hijacked airliners    Second NEADS did not have accurate information on the location of United  Presumably FAA would have provided such information but we do not know how long that would have taken nor how long it would have taken NEADS to locate the target    Third NEADS needed orders to pass to the pilots At  the pilots over Washington were emphatically told negative clearance to shoot Shootdown authority was first communicated to NEADS at  It is possible that NORAD commanders would have ordered a shootdown in the absence of the authorization communicated by the Vice President but given the gravity of the decision to shoot down a commercial airliner and NORADs caution that a mistake not be made we view this possibility as unlikely    NORAD officials have maintained that they would have intercepted and shot down United  We are not so sure We are sure that the nation owes a debt to the passengers of United  Their actions saved the lives of countless others and may have saved either the Capitol or the White House from destruction    The details of what happened on the morning of September  are complex but they play out a simple theme NORAD and the FAA were unprepared for the type of attacks launched against the United States on September   They struggled under difficult circumstances to improvise a homeland defense against an unprecedented challenge they had never before encountered and had never trained to meet    At  that morning an assistant to the mission crew commander at NORADs Northeast Air Defense Sector in Rome New York was working with his colleagues on the floor of the command center In a brief moment of reflection he was recorded remarking that This is a new type of war    He was and is right But the conflict did not begin on  It had been publicly declared years earlier most notably in a declaration faxed early in  to an Arabiclanguage newspaper in London Few Americans had noticed it The fax had been sent from thousands of miles away by the followers of a Saudi exile gathered in one of the most remote and impoverished countries on earth
