Session Implementing Preventive Interventions inEmergency Medicine Strategic ConsiderationsLarry M Gentilello MDIndividuals who may benefit from alcohol counseling are oftenunaware of their need for treatment The provision of alcoholinterventions in emergency departments ED may provide anopportunity to treat individuals who are currently not activelyseeking such care Due to their lack of awareness of their problemthese patients are unlikely to present for treatment on theirownTreatment does not need to be sought actively to be effectiveHowever motivation can facilitate treatment Studies suggest thatphysicians can opportunistically capitalize on the motivatingeffects of acute injuries or medical conditions that requireemergency care to convince patients of the need for behaviorchange This process may identify patients who have not yetdeveloped severe dependence thereby preventing the development ofmore intractable stages of alcoholism Finally such interventionsmay have the potential to decrease repeated use of emergencydepartment resourcesRandomized trials of inexpensive screening and interventionprotocols that are feasible for use in the brief contact setting ofthe emergency department have been shown empirically to beeffective when used in a variety of settings outside the ED Arecent analysis of  randomized trials each of which was limitedto one session and consisted of less than one hour of motivationalcounseling demonstrated that heavy drinkers were twice as likelyto moderate their drinking when compared with those who did notreceive an interventionBrief interventions were specifically designed to targetpatients who are drinking at hazardous levels but have not becomedependent Some patients treated in emergency departments need moreintensive treatment such as inpatient or outpatient therapy orparticipation in selfhelp groups Brief interventions may be usedto motivate such patients to seek or accept a referral to moreintensive treatmentAs proven alcohol interventions emerge a systematic effort isneeded to incorporate them into emergency department practice Thepublic policy objectives of Healthy People  include routineemergency department screeningThe provision of such interventions is currently not routine Avariety of changes at the individual system and policy level willbe needed to accomplish this goal This paper describes the factorsthat have limited the provision of alcohol intervention andcounseling in emergency departments and provides an agenda tofoster their implementationKnowledge and attitudes of emergency department staffPhysician advocacy plays an important role in influencingscreening practices by increasing awareness of the problem and bygenerating support for screening and intervention services Asurvey of surgeons working in an emergency department found thatthe most significant predictor of screening was the attendingphysicians perception that their responsibilities includedscreening However  did not routinely screen and  did notbelieve that screening was the responsibility of emergencydepartment staff Routine screening and intervention will requireengendering a sense of role responsibility among emergencydepartment clinicians towards addressing substance abuseThis shift will require correcting misconceptions about thevalidity and generalizability of treatment research results andtheir relevance to the emergency department population Theliterature suggests that these misconceptions are the result of arelative lack of physician education and training in substanceabuseIn the survey mentioned previously  of respondents indicatedthat they had no prior training in screening or detection ofalcohol problems and more than  were not familiar with any ofthe commonly used alcohol screening questionnaires such as theCAGE or MAST Another survey found that less than  ofemergency medicine residency programs teach residents about thequantity frequency of alcohol use questions needed to establish anearly diagnosis of an alcoholrelated disorder A more recentsurvey of program directors found that the average emergencymedicine residency program devotes only three curricular hours tosubstance abuse trainingThe lack of education about screening is illustrated by the factthat the most commonly cited reason for failure to screen is lackof timeHowever an effective battery of screening tools that requireminimal time and disruption to implement is already available Ascreening blood alcohol level can be obtained easily when blood isdrawn for other purposes A simple questionnaire such as the CAGEcan easily be incorporated into a routine history and physicalexamination Detecting hazardous drinking in the absence ofdependence can be accomplished by asking several questions aboutquantity and frequency of use eg using the first threequestions of the AUDIT which are easily memorized Lack ofknowledge rather than lack of time is a more likely explanationfor failure to screenMany physicians do not screen because they believe that askingpatients about substance use is intrusive Physicians who do notscreen are three times more likely to have this belief thanphysicians who routinely screen Studies suggest that patients donot share this concern Trials of alcohol screening in primarycare general medical clinics trauma centers and emergencydepartments demonstrate a high rate of patient acceptanceSome physicians are willing to detect alcohol use but theybelieve that clinical judgment is reliable and formal screening isunnecessary However numerous studies document that physiciansgenerally fail to diagnose alcohol problems unless a formalscreening protocol is used In one study researchers screened patients for alcohol problems but the results were notprovided to staff The clinical detection rate for screenpositivepatients ranged between  and  depending on the type ofservice providerSimilar results were found in a study of injured patientstreated in the emergency department The staff was asked tosubjectively determine if patients were intoxicated BAC  gdl or had a chronic alcohol problem Although  of patientswere intoxicated sensitivity was only  and sensitivitydecreased to  among patients who were severely injuredendotracheally intubated or brain injured Specificity was alsopoor More than  of patients who were thought to be intoxicatedhad no alcohol in their blood Patients age income and insurancestatus significantly influenced both sensitivity and specificityPatients were also screened with the CAGE and SMAST Staffidentified fewer than  of screenpositive patients Formalscreening protocols are needed because clinical judgment isunreliable and subject to biasA key reason that screening is not performed is the widely heldperception that treatment is not effective In the trauma centersurvey mentioned previously only  of respondents believed thatbrief interventions are at least moderately effective Nearlyhalf believed that there are not enough treatment resources tomake screening worthwhile An assessment of blood alcohol testingpractices found that  of physicians who do not measure bloodalcohol concentration believe the test is not clinicallyimportant because knowledge of the patients blood alcohol leveldoes not benefit the patientSkepticism about treatment benefits is apparently widespreadOne study of  randomly selected emergency departmentphysicians found that only  believed that mental healthprofessionals psychologists and psychiatrists can effectivelyaddress alcohol problems Their perception of treatment efficacyprovided by other staff physicians and surgeons was even lower This confirms the lack of knowledge regarding the progress inalcohol treatment that has led to expert consensus recommendationsthat all patients at risk for alcohol problems should be screenedand counseled or referred for counselingChanging belief systems clinical practices and cognitivebarriers is a slow process and a formidable challengeImplementation will require increasing emergency departmentphysicians knowledge in order to increase confidence in screeningskills and to dispel myths about the futility of treatmentHowever information alone may not change clinical practice Forexample only  of survivors of myocardial infarction are treatedwith betablockers by their primary care physician despite thefact that expert consensus panels consider this omission a seriousmedical errorStudies of educational strategies to change physician behaviorsuggest that informational material and formal CME conferences havelittle impact while outreach activities by professionalorganizations and opinion leaders conducting onsite educationalprograms produce positive change However many people becomeleaders of organizations because they reflect the needs andattitudes of members and therefore they are not likely toradically change the culture of the organization The majority ofopinion leaders in emergency medicine reflect the current beliefthat alcohol problems are outside their practicedomain Unless emergency medicine staff with an interest inintegrating alcohol treatment services into emergency care assumegreater prominence and leadership in their field effecting changewithin this specialty will be slow and unevenImplementation will therefore require the emergence of leaderswho endorse the concept that alcohol screening and intervention istheir responsibility Funding for alcoholrelated research needs tobe provided to emergency department personnel on a priority basisbecause such funding will lead to their professional developmentincrease their national stature lead to their advancement inprofessional societies lead to association with policymakers andenhance their opportunity to become opinion leaders Thedevelopment of credible opinion leaders who are emergency medicineclinicians who will endorse and advance the concept of alcoholscreening and intervention is the best means of fosteringattitudinal change within that specialty Changes in a specialtypractice are more likely to occur if they are supported by researchconducted within that same discipline Advances in one specialty donot necessarily affect the practice of another Articles publishedin journals devoted to psychiatry or substance abuse will havelittle impact on the practice of emergency medicine Traditionallylittle interaction has occurred between emergency medicinephysicians and substance abuse treatment providers Each specialtyoperates within its own domain with little integration of servicesacross specialities and they do not publish in common journalsThis tendency for medical specialties to operate within their owndiscipline with little crossdissemination of information suggeststhat ED staff must be involved in conducting intervention trials inorder to popularize the concept within their own fieldA MEDLINE search of papers published using the MESH termsalcoholism AND treatment AND intervention yielded  publicationsduring the calendar year  None of these were published injournals devoted to emergency medicine None of the trials ofalcohol interventions in emergency departments were published injournals likely to be encountered by emergency care providersIt is therefore not surprising that emergency physicians andstaff lack knowledge about substance abuse and have failed toembrace research advances in screening and interventionCurrent funding sources are not structured to foster thedevelopment of leaders in emergency medicine who endorse theconcept that addressing alcohol problems is their responsibilityObtaining funds from study sections on emergency care is difficultbecause peerreviewers do not view alcoholrelated research asbeing vital There are equally formidable obstacles when attemptingto obtain funding from alcohol study sections Reviewers may not befamiliar with the characteristics of an emergency department as aunique clinical community They also prefer the use of highlycontrolled diagnostic and demographic groups in order to obtainunambiguous answers to isolate the active ingredient of treatmentefficacy While this approach has led to great strides inunderstanding how treatment works it may not be practical in therealworld setting of the emergency department and may generatestudies with little external validityWe therefore have a dilemma Grant applications submitted byemergency medicine specialists that do not use the methodologicprocesses preferred by alcohol research study sections are usuallygoing to lose when competing against grants submitted by recognizedalcohol research specialists On the other hand studies conductedby alcohol research specialists may not provide clinically relevantintervention protocols are not likely to be noticed or consideredcredible by emergency medicine physicians and will have littleimpact on practice There is little point in funding research oninterventions that are unlikely to be implementedThe design and peerreview of studies on alcohol interventionsin the emergency care setting should be geared more towardsembracing the perspectives of emergency medicine specialists Suchindividuals are in the best position to understand what researchquestions are important and what type of interventions are feasibleand generalizable While their grant applications may not have themethodologic design that study sections composed of alcoholresearch specialists are accustomed to funding such research willlead to the development of research methodologies appropriate tothe emergency department settingResearch conducted by emergency medicine physicians will helpestablish a sense of role responsibility within the field and thisattitude will be disseminated within the specialty by the workproduct that is published and presented at practicespecificprofessional meetings Thiswill foster the development of a culture of acceptance of roleresponsibility to screen and intervene and develop lobbyingpressure to do so within the field of emergency medicineEmergency departments are frequently the only point of contactwith the health care system for indigent patients Emergencydepartment interventions are consistent with the No Wrong Door toTreatment theme of the National Treatment Plan Alcohol problemsamong emergency department patients consume an extraordinary amountof health care dollars Studies on alcohol interventions inemergency departments should consume a proportionate amount ofresearch dollarsInadequate access to treatmentineffective treatmentEffective lowcost interventions that require minimaladditional staff to implement are already available Due toemergency department time constraints socalled briefmotivational interventions are the intervention model most likelyto be successfully implemented No other existing model is likelyto be useful in the realworld setting of the typical emergencydepartmentThe empirical support for brief interventions is excellent anddoes not need further conceptual verification As suggested by theInstitute of Medicine the standards for forming a reasonableconsensus leading to a recommendation to provide briefinterventions have already been met Experts already recommendmoving beyond clinical trials to national dissemination There isno need to plow new ground and perform research to develop newinterventions for emergency department useA  metaanalysis of  alcohol treatment modalities foundthat brief motivational counseling ranks near the top in fourcategories total amount of research to investigate the modality methodological quality of research  number of studiesdemonstrating improved outcomes and  cost effectivenessTherefore research should not focus on foundational andefficacy trials but on the practical matter of successfullyadapting proven intervention techniques to the emergency departmentsetting It is acknowledged that treatment must have documentedefficacy in particular populations of patients However theemergency department is the entry point for medical care for abroad spectrum of problem drinkersThere is little reason to believe that intoxicated patients whopresent to the emergency department represent a special populationto whom current research results do not apply Patients withalcohol problems experience an average of  injuryrelatedevents requiring outpatient or inpatient care per year Visits tothe emergency department are so common among substanceabusingpatients that it is unlikely they represent a specialtreatmentresistant subgroupThe opposite may be the case Alcoholrelated medical problemsespecially injuries occur in the entire population of alcoholusers Moderate and even light drinkers often require emergencycare because many alcoholrelated events are not related to totalalcohol consumption but rather to the activities the patientengages in while drinking and to where when and with whom alcoholis consumed Patients with severe dependence have adisproportionate share of alcoholrelated medical consequences butit is estimated that such patients generate only a fraction of allalcoholrelated problemsAlcoholrelated problems occur at lower rates but in muchgreater numbers among patients with mild to moderate alcoholproblems because such patients constitute the greatest proportionof the drinking population Thus if all patients with severeproblems stopped drinking a substantial number of patients withalcoholrelated problems would still present to the emergencydepartment For example driving while intoxicated overlaps withalcoholism but it constitutes an important issue in its own rightbecause surveys consistently show that a substantial number ofindividuals who do not meet diagnostic criteria for alcohol abuseor dependence admit to having driven an automobile whileintoxicated For many of these patients brief interventionsdemonstrate significant effects on subsequent alcohol intake andemergency department resource utilization when used as standalonetreatmentOther patients may require more extended treatment Briefinterventions may play an important role in motivating suchpatients to accept a treatment referral or can be used to establishmotivation while waiting for access to publicly fundedtreatment One trial Project Assert provided briefinterventions and used an active referral process to gain access tothe marginal capacity of the substance abuse treatment system forthose who needed additional care Its success led to its adoptionbyBoston Medical Center as a valueadded service in the emergencydepartment Patients without insurance may also be referred tocommunity resources and selfhelp groups Those with insurance haveat least some access to treatment services to which they can bereferredEmergency department physicians may obtain the trainingnecessary to perform the intervention but in most hospitalsstaffing constraints will prevent them from being the primaryproviders of this service Furthermore instilling this knowledgeand sense of responsibility throughout the field will require toobroad a change in service culture for this approach to be readilyadopted Time demands and current practice standards are likely tolimit the role of emergency department physicians to setting thestage for an interventionData suggest that few patients comply with a simple referral toseek treatment after emergency department discharge Thereforeemergency departments should have dedicated staff onsite who canprovide interventions This places the responsibility to performthe intervention in the hands of individuals who are alreadycommitted to providing the service and avoids dependence onphysicians who are unlikely to acquire such commitment untilsignificant attitudinal changes occurTwo decades of mental health services research in primary caresettings support the concept that the most effective method ofdelivering psychosocial services is through collaboration betweenmental health consultants and primary care providers Acollaborative model using emergency department physicians to screenand mental health professionals to perform the intervention is theapproach that is most likely to be widely adoptedAlcohol use among emergency department patients is not likely aproblem that can be tackled by a single disciplineInterdisciplinary research is more likely to facilitate thedevelopment and implementation of emergency departmentinterventions that work in the real world Collaborative care hasthe potential to benefit both emergency department and mentalhealth professionals Data suggest that substance abuse counselorsmay find that a medical or surgical crisis increases patientmotivation As a result their services may be more effectivewhen conducted in the emergency department environment To dateall published studies on emergency department or trauma centerinterventions have used the collaborative careapproachFinancial considerationsDespite the prevalence of alcohol use disorders hospitaladministrators are likely to raise concerns about hiring additionalstaff to conduct interventions because they do not consideraddressing alcohol problems as part of their mission Socialworkers and similar individuals are available but shifting theburden to these individuals will still require hiring additionalemployees It will be necessary to provide evidence that hiringstaff to perform interventions is in the best interests ofstakeholders and is fiscally responsible Therefore studies areneeded to assess the nominal costs of implementation and any costoffsets that occur This has already occurred in family medicinewhich is currently the medical service with the highest screeningrateThere is reason to believe that costeffectiveness can bedemonstrated For insured patients counseling services arebillable under existing CPT current procedural terminology codeswhen delivered by qualified staff Studies on brief interventionsconducted in other settings demonstrate that a substantial portionof the reduction in costs is related to a reduction in use ofemergency department and hospital resourcesStudies of costeffectiveness should include not only directmedical costs but also societal costs Federal state and countysources fund many emergency departments particularly those inurban areas It is estimated that direct medical costs constituteonly  of total costs related to substance abuse with theremainder being related to problems such as property damage crimeabsenteeism and unemployment Study outcomes should bemultidimensional and assess a broad array of outcomes because thetrue stakeholders are society at large Research that coversmultiple outcomes in addition to medical ones addresses audienceswith different needs and priorities and encourages their supportfor provision of intervention services and financial resourcesStudies should therefore use a variety of databases includingnot only emergency department records but also general medicalrecord reviews and insurance and MedicareMedicaid claims to detectoutpatient visits Although claims data provide the most accurateinformation about health care use ensuring adequate followup forpurposes of obtaining information from patient selfreport isimportant because many people do not report alcoholrelated eventsto insurance companies In order to interest other stakeholderssuch as policymakers and health care providers additionaldatabases should be used to assess otheroutcomes for example motor vehicle records to detect crashespolice records to assess criminal activities and state vitalstatistics registries the Social Security Death Index and theFatal Accident Reporting System FARS to detect mortalityHealth care policyPhysicians have voiced a common concern about alcohol screeningthe potential denial of reimbursement for medical services providedto patients if they have a positive blood alcohol or drug screenThe Uniform Individual Accident and Sickness Policy Provision LawUPPL a model law drafted by the National Association ofInsurance Commissioners NAIC in  provides insurers with thisright The NAIC is an organization of insurance regulators from the states the District of Columbia and the  US territories Itprovides a forum for the development of uniform policy andaddresses the need to coordinate regulation of multistateinsurersThe model law states The insurer shall not be liable for anyloss sustained or contracted in consequence of the insureds beingintoxicated or under the influence of any narcotic unlessadministered on the advice of a physician Thirtyeight statesadopted the law and four others have adopted it with provisionalrestrictions that apply only to narcotics or to injuries sustainedwhile committing a felony However it is obvious that if screeningis not performed the provision cannot be applied Physicians areunlikely to screen if it affects their legitimate expectation forfinancial remuneration for patient care The main effect of thislaw has not been to decrease insurance claims but to discouragephysicians from screening for alcohol problemsIn practice the UPPL applies to only a fraction of patientstreated in the emergency department Many patients are uninsured orcarry policies that do not enforce this provision Howeveremergency physicians do not engage in analysis of insurancecontracts before providing care and are therefore unaware of thetype of coverage if any carried by the patient As a result fearof financial loss generally prompts physicians to treat allpatients as if the UPPL applies to themThe NAIC recently adopted an amendment to the UPPL which states This provision may not be used with respect to a medicalexpense policy and  For purposes of this provision medicalexpense policy means an accident and sickness insurance policythat provides hospitalmedical and surgical expense coverage The National Conferenceof Insurance Legislators NCOIL an organization of statelegislators whose main area of public policy concern is insurancelegislation and regulation recently passed a resolution askingstates to repeal the UPPLThe primary instruments of public policy for NCOIL and the NAICare model laws and guidelines Model legislation forms a uniformbasis from which all states can deal with regulatory issues Thebasic legislative structure of insurance regulation requires somedegree of uniformity throughout the states However states arefree to maintain their own insurance codes They may either adoptthe models intact modify them to meet their specific needs orignore them Emergency physicians should provide their legislativerepresentatives and insurance regulators with information about howthe UPPL adversely affects their ability to implement alcoholintervention programs and encourage them to implement the changesrecommended by the NAIC and NCOILA serious concern expressed by physicians is that documentingalcohol use in the medical record has the potential to abridgepatient confidentiality about sensitive issues Patients withsubstance abuse disorders may face stigmatization and otherpotentially serious consequences if screening results are notprotected Fear of stigmatization gave rise to federal regulationsand laws protecting information related to substance abuse Theintent of these regulations is to encourage individuals to seektreatment for substance abuse by reducing the risk that they willbe stigmatized The laws are contained in the Code of FederalRegulations  CFR Part  Confidentiality of Alcohol and DrugAbuse Patient RecordsThe regulations apply to hospitals that have either anidentified unit that provides substance abuse treatment or medicalpersonnel whose primary function is the provision of alcohol andother drug abuse diagnosis treatment or referral for treatmentCFR Part   The law specifically states that recordsgenerated by emergency and trauma physicians are not coveredbecause their primary function is not to provide substance abusecounseling Presumably this would not harm the congressionalintent of attracting people to treatment because patients do notcome to the emergency department with the intention of receivingsubstance abuse treatmentIf an emergency department hires staff whose primary function isscreening and intervention the application of this law will needto bereconsidered by emergency physicians and hospitals If a bloodalcohol level is obtained to facilitate treatment of an illness orinjury it is not under special protection However if it isobtained in order to engage the patient in treatment theinformation is protected under the above federal regulations thatrequire the express written permission of the patient before itcan be shared with others A special Consent for the Release ofConfidential Information form must be signed in order for thisinformation to be released Under federal regulations a generalmedical consent form is not sufficientRecommendations Emergency medicine physicians should increase theirknowledge skills and confidence in alcohol screening andintervention To accomplish this and change current practicepatterns studies on alcohol interventions should be framedfocused and performed by emergency medicine physicians Given the magnitude of alcohol problems and the ability ofemergency departments to identify patients who might not otherwiseseek treatment funding agencies should give high priority toresearch on alcohol problems in EDs Research support should be primarily for services researchnot the development of new intervention models or prototypesTranslational studies that develop methods of adapting alreadyvalidated interventions into emergency department practice areneeded Data obtained from practically oriented translationalstudies will help to develop guidelines for optimal resourceallocation by determining the subpopulation of patients for whombrief interventions are most effective They will also provide aframework for future investigations that target nonresponsivepatients in need of more extensive services Studies should beconducted using a collaborative process that involves mental healthspecialists and other appropriate professionals Research is needed on referral strategies for more severelyimpaired nonresponsive patients to assist them in gaining accessto resources already available in their communities This researchshould include studies on the use of nocost services such asselfhelp or stepprograms using for example abbreviated forms of the TwelveStep Facilitation Therapy Manual developed for use in ProjectMATCH The step arm of Project Match had the best outcomes inthe study regardless of matching considerations Research studies of costeffectiveness are needed toconvince physicians and administrators that having staff availableto address alcohol problems is an integral component of thepractice of medicine and part of their mission Since costbenefitanalysis is critical to overcoming resistance to implementationresearch groups should include health care economists or healthservices researchers Emergency and trauma physicians their respectiveprofessional organizations and alcohol advocacy groups shouldcontact their state insurance regulator state department of healthand human services and legislators involved in insurance issues tourge amending state insurance codes that financially penalizehospitals and physicians who screen for alcohol Emergency departments should designate specific individualsto assume the role of obtaining and interpreting

monograph series Rockville MD National Instituteon Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism  NIH Publication NoResponse to Dr Larry Gentilellos PresentationStephen M Hargarten MD MPHI am honored to have the opportunity to participate in thistimely conference It is my belief that our deliberations anddiscussion should greatly assist the articulation of a focusedthoughtful research agenda for addressing alcoholrelated problemsin the emergency department ED settingMy comments are intended to link this research agenda with theunique strategic position of the emergency department and toreflect on the new partnership of the federal agencies and careproviders represented here today I think this effort reflects thephilosophy of emergency medicine which seeks out collaboratorspartners and advisors for all of the problems that may arise inthe EDI feel strongly that the EDbased research agenda should addressthe spectrum of problems that present daily to the ED Screeningand interventions for alcoholrelated problems must be integratedinto the practice of emergency medicine and all of the emergencydepartments clinical activities The research agendas translationto practice should reflect the spectrum of alcohol use and relatedproblems as well given that the ED is inundated with patients whohave alcoholrelated problems A series of carefully structuredsingle questions needs to be developed that can identify atriskusers alcohol abusers and alcoholics When I first beganpracticing the extent of screening consisted of the question Areyou a drinking manExciting research now is pinpointing which intervention reallybrief brief shortterm longterm is most effective as well aswhere it is most effectively delivered emergency departmenthospital andor treatment center While all of the answers arenot yet known the progress is encouragingIt is evident that additional research is needed to  refinethe set of single questions that improve efficacy and efficiency identify highrisk groups essential to focused effectivescreening and  match the alcoholrelated problem to theinterventionThis is the essence of the traditional biomedical researchmodel I look forward to the day when the next Joint Commissionhospital visit includes the requirement to demonstrate our ED andhospitalbasedscreening and intervention toolbox that addresses this patientpopulation with alcohol problemsHealth care settings should be considered safe effectivepatientcentered timely efficient places of equitable care Thesedescriptors of health care quality from the recent Institute ofMedicine report should be applied to all patients withalcoholrelated problemsI think Dr Gentilellos presentation nicely outlined theelements of the biomedical model and approach Dr Gentilello hasmade a significant contribution to the insurance industryspolicies toward alcoholrelated problems Many trauma surgeons andemergency physicians oppose alcohol screening in the currentenvironment because of concerns about nonpayment for services Iappreciate the advances being made to integrate screening intoemergency departments and I agree with Dr Gentilellos assessmentof the barriers to making screening a reality Physicians andother providers knowledge skills and attitudes can all createbarriersAt this point I want to depart from the biomedical researchmodel to discuss the importance of an epidemiologic shift towardspopulation health I feel that the research agenda should alsointegrate the public health model The ED is in a strategicposition to inform the public and policymakers about the scope andnature of alcoholrelated problems in the ED An epidemiologicshift from screening to surveillance from individual patientsinside the ED to populations of patients outside the ED will serveto understand atrisk behaviors of groups of patients theagentvehicle of morbidity and mortality alcohol and theenvironment in which these groups interface with alcoholPolicyrelevant studies are needed to address the marketingdistribution and sale of alcohol to highrisk groups andenvironments Research that examines pricing schemes and marketingstrategies that are associated with collegebased binge drinking isneeded A set of single policyrelevant questions should beroutinely asked such as Where did you buy the alcohol andWhere were you drinking before you were injured Linking theabuseindividual behavior questions to when and where the alcoholwas consumed has important implications Research that evaluatespolicy interventions linked with reliable accurate surveillanceinformation can influence policy changes such as lowering the legallimit of a drivers BAC or extending DWI laws to cover snowmobiledrivingResearch on changing social norms for alcohol use and abuse isneeded for practitioners and patients given that alcoholrelatedproblems are still largely viewed as a social issue not a medicalproblem Addressing emergency medicine training will be verychallenging since emergency medicine professionals might have theirown social norms of at risk alcohol usage that will influence theireffectiveness and interestThe emergency departmentbased research agenda need not belimited to the biomedical model It should be extended to includehealth services research and access to matched therapeuticinterventions It should also use the public health modeladdressing behavior the agent vehicle and the environment andthe injury control model prevention acute care andrehabilitation By using different models the research agenda canaddress treatment and policy issues and develop and evaluateprevention strategies at the primary secondary and tertiarylevels Ultimately this multiple approach will help us to reachour shared goal of fewer alcoholrelated deaths and injuriesReference Committee on Quality of Health Care Institute of MedicineCrossing the Quality Chasm A new health system for the stcentury Washington DC National Academy Press Comments on Implementing Preventive Interventions in EmergencyMedicine Strategic ConsiderationsLinda C Degutis DrPHDr Gentilello has raised many important issues in his paperMany of them point to the lack of knowledge of the evidence thatscreening and intervention for and treatment of alcohol problemscan be effective in decreasing morbidity and mortality This iscertainly an area where we can be proactive in highlighting theevidence that these strategies work and for those who arepractitioners in modeling behaviors that include screeningintervention and referral for patients who have alcoholrelatedproblemsOther areas also need to be addressed and some definitions needto be clarified For example Dr Gentilello performed a MEDLINEreview using the term alcoholism While this term may refer tothe patients who are dependent on alcohol it does not necessarilycapture atrisk drinking or hazardous drinking patterns It willnot capture the patient who drinks six or eight drinks a few timesa month drives a motor vehicle and is injured in a crash Usingthe term alcohol and searching the indexes of two of the primaryemergency medicine journals Annals of Emergency Medicine andAcademic Emergency Medicine  citations were selected for theyears  Of these  were original articles that eitherhad alcohol in the title or were clearly examiningalcoholrelated problems There was also a trend toward anincreasing number of articles published in the later years Onlyone article appeared in  while nine were published in Several other articles published in  discussed alcohol as arisk factor for particular injuries or disease In  AcademicEmergency Medicine which is published by the Society for AcademicEmergency Medicine published two papers that includedrecommendations for screening and intervention for alcohol problemsin the emergency department So it does not seem that editorialboards are not accepting articles about alcohol problems Perhapsthe issue is that the number of researchers in this area is smalland therefore few papers are submittedDr Gentilello makes several recommendations in his paper Hestates that the studies need to be framed focused and performedby emergency medicine physicians using a collaborative process Itis necessary that emergency physicians perform research in thisarea but the contribution of other researchers should not benegated nor should other researchers be discouraged from workingin this area What is important is that a team approach be taken tobuild upon the strengths of alcohol research methodologistsepidemiologists economists social workers nurses and others whohave specific contributions to makeFocusing research support on health services researchers isimportant but the opportunities to develop new methods ofintervention should not be eliminated Translational studies willhelp in the adaptation of interventions in emergency medicinepractice but interventions evolve over time and new methods aredeveloped and tested Emergency medicine should participate in thisresearch Researching strategies for engaging emergency departmentpatients in treatment especially those with high recidivism rateswould be of tremendous benefit to the field of emergency medicineExamining costeffectiveness is also important as practitionersare constantly asked to do more with less and patients face thethreat of cuts in essential services in order to trim budgetsWith respect to policy Dr Gentilello deserves a great deal ofcredit for the work that he has done with the National Associationof Insurance Commissioners NAIC and the National Conference ofInsurance Legislators NCOIL He has been very effective inconvincing them that it is necessary to change their policies sothat practitioners would not fear that screening for alcoholproblems could place their patients in jeopardy of losing insurancecoverage Other policy questions need to be answered as well Wouldreimbursement for screening and brief intervention increasescreening and intervention and subsequently decrease morbidityand mortality To what extent do emergency department patients havecoverage for alcohol and other drug problems and how does thisaffect their ability to enter treatment when they are referredHave state substance abuse parity laws decreased the number ofpeople who need to seek treatment through the ED rather than otherfacilities What degree of confidentiality can be assured withrespect to records of alcohol screening and intervention in the EDand how does this affect screening and intervention ratesAs we already know this is a complex problem that probably doesnot have simple solutions I think that some clarifications arenecessary to ensure we are using common language and commondefinitions In the field of injury epidemiology and injurycontrol we try to avoid the use of the term accidents andinstead use terms such as injury events When describing patientswho have manifested problems with alcohol we should usedefinitions such as atrisk drinking abuse and dependenceto define the continuum of alcohol problems that we see We alsoneed to be clear about the disease processes that we are interestedin studying To many health care practitioners the term traumameans something very different than the term injury Traumaoften connotes injuries of significant severity to requiretreatment by specialized care providers whereas injury often isperceived as meaning relatively minor physical injury The terminjury is more inclusive and should be used as trauma is asubset of injury If we cannot converse with and understand oneanother there is little hope that we can effectively deliver ourmessage outside of our fieldThere are additional complexities to doing research in theemergency department setting created by the physical environmentthe practice environment the everincreasing demand for emergencycare as evidenced by increases in ED visits and the financialconstraints that affect the type of realworld interventions thatcan be implemented and evaluated In addition we often havedifficulties with Institutional Review Board IRB approvals asalcohol problems are still viewed as sensitive issues and someIRBs are uncomfortable approving this type of researchThe field of emergency medicine is young and evolving anddeveloping its evidence base for clinical practice This is leadingto much debate among emergency physicians about their role inproviding preventive services The Society for Academic EmergencyMedicine is addressing these issues through its Public Health TaskForce as well as through sessions at its annual meeting andarticles in Academic Emergency Medicine Research in this area isin its very early stagesBecause the field of emergency medicine is young large numbersof established researchers do not exist To increase researchcapacity we need to teach people how to do the research throughfellowships faculty development programs and grants mentoredresearch awards and other programs that foster the development ofnew researchersTranslational research as well as the communication of findingsto the community and evaluation of implementation is anotherchallenge Funding for translational research has been inadequateas has a focus on sustainability of interventions that areimplemented once an evaluation has ended Along with encouragingthe implementation of effective interventions in the ED setting itis also necessary to develop strategies to ensure sustainability ofthose interventionsOne area of research that has not received much attention in ourdiscussions over the past two days is that of policy research Thistype of research tends to focus on population impact rather thanon impact on the individual patient or practitioner Oftenpolicies are created and implemented with no study of theireffectiveness or the unintended consequences that arise from theirimplementation Dr Gentilello has highlighted one specific policyarea but there are many other policy directions that must beevaluated These policies may be public or private and may beimplemented on the institutional local state or national levelFor example in Connecticut we recently lost funding fortransporting patients to substance abuse treatment services It isnot hard to imagine the impact of this but it was only inexamining the cost to referring institutions that a movement toreinstate the funding began Now our task is to identify morecosteffective ways of providing the needed services before fundingis cut yet againWe are currently involved in the evaluating Connecticut PublicAct  which has several provisions The primary goal of thislegislation is to implement universal screening for alcohol andother drug problems among injured patients admitted to acute carehospitals Other provisions include development of model continuingeducation standards for health professionals and plans forincluding training about alcohol and other drug problems in thestandard curricula for health professionals attending institutionsof higher learning The original law signed by the governorrequired screening of all injured patients admitted to an acutecare hospital as well as injured patients who required theactivation of a trauma team response or who were transferred to orfrom an acute care institution Many emergency physicians in thestate interpreted the law to mean that they would have to performscreening of injured patients presenting to the emergencydepartment They vehemently objected to this policy and were ableto have the legislature include a technical correction thatclarified that screening is requiredamong injured patients who are admitted to acute care hospitalsas inpatients rather than implying that all injured patientspresenting to the ED be screened Given this reaction byphysicians are we ready to ask for broader implementation of thesepoliciesThe lack of acceptance of screening as a routine part ofpractice is only one of the barriers that we face Policies havebeen developed on the basis of evidence that treatment foraddiction is effective Several states have passed substance abusetreatment parity legislation that requires insurers to covertreatment for alcohol and other drug AOD problems to the sameextent that they cover treatment for other diseases There is nofederal legislation to this effect so the result is that in statesthat have parity laws many people are still not guaranteedcomparable coverage for AOD treatment because their insurance plansare governed by federal law under the Employees Retirement IncomeSecurity Act ERISA In addition some insurance plans do notoffer any coverage for AOD problems so the parity statutes do notapply to them Of course people who lack health insurance haveeven more limited access to treatmentMany people who are under the jurisdiction of the criminaljustice system have AOD problems In addition evidence exists thattreatment of these problems leads to a decrease in crime Butlittle has been done to ensure that people involved in this systemreceive necessary treatment for their disease Instead there isoften a tendency to criminalize addiction and to treat theproblem through arrests and prison terms Some states such asConnecticut require that anyone who is incapacitated by alcohol betransported to an acute care facility rather than jail The intentof this law was to bring people into the treatment system and toavoid the consequences of unrecognized severe problems withalcohol Currently emergency departments in Connecticut see manypatients with acute alcohol intoxication on a daily basis butfunds for treatment are limitedThe education of practitioners in the process of screening andbrief intervention is another area that needs study To promulgatea standardized approach to patients with cardiac problems theAdvanced Cardiac Life Support course was developed Similarly theAdvanced Trauma Life Support course provides a standardizedapproach to the initial care of the injured patient Both of thesecourses as well as others such as Advanced Pediatric Life Supportand Prehospital Trauma Life Supportcombine didactic sessions with skillbuilding sessions toimprove practitioner knowledge and skills in these areas Perhapswe need to develop a similar approach for screening andinterventionan Advanced Alcohol Problem Identification andIntervention courseDespite the evidence of the relationship between alcohol andinjury we still do not have strong support for screening andintervention from our colleagues who deliver trauma care In themost recent version of the American College of Surgeons monographOptimal Care of the Injured Patient which describes standards ofcare for verification of trauma centers the requirement thattrauma centers be able to perform blood alcohol testing waseliminated The message this sends may be interpreted in severalways a there is not a sufficient relationship between alcohol andinjury to justify testing for alcohol use in injured patientsb issues of alcohol use among injured patients are not in thepurview of the trauma team c nothing can be done to address theissue of alcohol problems among injured patients so testing doesnot help or d not testing protects the patient and thepractitioner from various legal issuesDr Gentilello recommends the development of an ED alcoholresearch center While his idea of highlighting this area ofresearch holds great merit operationalization is problematic Ifthere is an ED alcohol research center will there also be aprimary care alcohol research center a trauma alcohol researchcenter and a critical care alcohol research center His proposalrather than bringing the field together can lead to fragmentationwithin the small group of researchers who are doing work in thisareaThe importance of developing partnerships with public healthresearchers and practitioners alcohol researchers communitybasedorganizations and others has been discussed It is important thatwe look at the impact of interventions not only in the academicenvironment that is populated by students residents and facultybut also in community practice and rural settings We need toexplore the impact of interventions in settings such as the IndianHealth Service that serve distinct populationsFinally I would like to address the issue of funding Much ofthe research that is being done in this area is not supported bythe National Institutes of Health but by other federal agenciessuch as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention theNational Highway Traffic SafetyAdministration the Substance Abuse and Mental Health ServicesAdministration and the Health Resources and ServicesAdministration We need to consider the impact of the fundingpolicies of these agencies both in promoting research and ingrowing the field of alcohol research in emergency medicine Thesmaller agencies often include indirect costs as well as directcosts within the budget cap for a particular project While thismay not be problematic in an institution with an indirect rate of it is very difficult for a researcher at an institution withan indirect rate of  or higher to compete as much of the budgetis taken up by indirect costs In addition this type of fundingpolicy discourages the research community from collaborating withacademic centers because the researchers perceive that the bulk ofthe budget is going to some administrative group with whom theyhave no interaction and who has no interest in what the researchersare doingIn summary alcohol problems are a significant issue foremergency department patients A growing body of evidencedemonstrates that interventions in the emergency department areeffective and that treatment referral can work The opportunitiesfor research in this area are great and we need to work to developresearch capacity There is a need for interdisciplinary teams ofresearchers who can draw on one anothers knowledge and strengthsAlthough funding strategies can be improved funding is availablefor this work We have already come a long way and much is left todoReferences DOnofrio G Bernstein E Bernstein J Woolard RH BrewerPA Craig SA Zink BJ Patients with alcohol problems in

noted that wemust demonstrate the value of interventions to hospitaladministrators if we want extra staff for interventions He alsoechoed Gentilellos comment about the need to individualizeinterventions In his multicenter study interventionists feltrestricted by a standard intervention sensing that variation wasneeded to meet different clients needsGentilello said that research methodologists want interventionsto be standardized so that they know why a treatment is workingHowever if they cannot use those interventions in their clinicalsetting the interventions are of no useElinor Walker commented that something about an interventionmust be standardized in order to assess its costeffectivenessGentilello suggested that the salaries of fulltime employeescould provide cost data and blood alcohol tests and admission ratescould provide effectiveness dataLinda Degutis added that interventions have to be monitored Ifa standardized intervention is not used audio tapes can at leastgive an idea of how it worksCarl Soderstrom agreed with Gentilello that alcoholrelatedresearch must be published not in substance abuse journals but inpublications read by emergency and trauma surgery staff Forexample he noted that the American College of Surgeons Resourcesfor Optimal Care of the Injured Patient  which containsguidelines for the certification of trauma centers omitted therequirement to test patients blood alcohol content for the firsttime in  years He admitted that many times a positive bloodalcohol test in patients with head injuries can be troublesomeHowever when he explored the reasons for the omission he foundthat the group that wrote the latest version of the AmericanCollege of Surgeons resource guide did not have access to data thatproved that treatment had any value Regarding the issue ofnonpayment for services provided to alcoholimpaired patients heobservedthat insurance companies rarely take advantage of their currentlegal right to deny payment due to alcohol useStephen Hargarten said that screening for alcohol applies notonly to the potential for interventions but also to the patientsoverall quality of care including safety from injury due toalcohol impairment or from alcohol withdrawal during the acutephase of treatment for medical or surgical conditionsGentilello observed that his publications in trauma journalshave earned him a great deal of attention and have raisedawareness He said that changes in emergency medicine practice willrequire publication of studies in journals that reach emergencymedicine practitionersPhillip Brewer noted that at annual meetings of the Society forAcademic Emergency Medicine SAEM papers dealing with substanceabuse were spread over other categories such as geriatrics andinjury One of the goals of the Substance Abuse Interest Group ofSAEM was to authorize a substance abuse category for abstracts andsessions at the annual meeting To date SAEM has not agreed to aseparate category The idea of prevention in emergency medicine hastaken root for injury and domestic violence he said but not yetfor substance abusePeter Rostenberg agreed that forsaking the BAC prevents goodmanagement and good medicine At his hospital attending physiciansare responsible for dealing with the results of alcohol screens andthey receive a letter when they fail to do so He observed thatthis system had been effective largely because physicians had seenpatients recoverRichard Longabaugh urged that collaborative studies includehealth services researchers He noted that there is an Rinteractive project that allows for great collaboration acrossdisciplines He also encouraged researchers to continue publishingin journals about their own areas of expertise Although he toohad concerns about standardized manuals he noted that studies showthat such manuals do not result in poorer treatments He suggestedthe use of decision trees in the manuals which can lend moreflexibility to clinical applications of research Depending on thepatient and the setting paths can be traveled very quickly andadapted quickly as wellGentilello agreed that we should all keep publishing in ourvarious disciplines However he reiterated that if we do notpublish in trauma and emergency medicine journals practices willnot change He said it is easier to change a field from within thanfrom the outside He also emphasized the importance of fundingemergency medicine specialists not just alcohol researchers toconduct this researchRichard Brown observed that although the grant review process atNIH can be difficult the experience of resubmitting grants hasstrengthened his work The process can be a learning opportunityand result in more sound research He speculated that if manydependent patients can have spontaneous remissions then researchon whether brief interventions could help them seems warrantedHowever he thought that guidelines to require screening inemergency departments were premature particularly without fundingto support required changes Instead he advocated implementingdemonstration projects that use different models Consistentevaluation across the models would determine if they actually makea difference He thought that without this type of researchrequirements would cause a rebellion against practice changesHargarten noted that it has not been long since the JointCommission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations JCAHOmandated policies and procedures to enhance domestic violencescreening and intervention in every ED in the country He thinksscreening for alcohol problems in EDs is on the horizon In orderto get reasonable requirements and uniform adherence in the EDs in the country it will be necessary for an external body likeJCAHO to be thinking about this now In the meantime we need to bedoing research that will make sure that appropriate requirementsare adopted With respect to the methodological issues we mustbalance rigorous followthrough and longterm studies with studiesthat are germane to emergency departments Collaboration withrigorous methodologists is important but those collaborations haveto focus on what can be accomplished specifically in the EDsettingGentilello clarified that he had not criticized the peerreviewprocess but that panels reviewing alcohol interventions in EDsshould include representatives of emergency medicine Grant reviewpanels should consider proposals from the perspective of theemergency physician not the perspective of the psychiatrist whoprobably has not been inan ED for many years Since alcohol interventions in the ED cutacross different disciplines the peerreview group should embracemultiple perspectives Methodologies that work in the emergencydepartment come from deciding what is feasible in that environmentand adapting interventions that have been shown effective in otherclinical settings Results from such studies will be usedDavid Fiellin recommended using current mechanisms like theRobert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholars program to train physiciansin methodology clinical epidemiology and health services researchso that review committees will include members who areknowledgeable about the ED setting and clinical researchHargarten endorsed that idea but added that there was littlefunding for training in clinical research in emergencymedicineGentilello agreed that lack of funding was a problem Many youngsurgeons become interested in alcohol interventions and writegrants but when their studies are not funded they lose interestand move on to other subjectsRonald Maio cautioned that we should not abandon the randomizedcontrolled trial RCT Gentilellos results had a powerful impacton trauma surgeons because his study was an RCT When we adaptproven interventions to new settings we change many factors so weneed to have an RCT He recalled the s when many ED procedureswere adapted for use in the field by EMS without appropriateevaluation Now it is difficult to justify many of those changesRegarding collaboration he mentioned that partnering withspecialists in substance abuse gave him a greater understanding ofthat specialty and increased the quality and credibility ofsubsequent proposals He said an NIAAA fellowship is one way ofgetting further trainingDaniel Pollock wondered how we could use research as a force forpositive change in the clinical setting He recounted thatGentilellos goal for research was to modify interventions thatwork in other settings for use in EDs rather than creating newones He asked what types of outcomes would indicate successfuladaptation Would they be patient outcomes or process measuresGentilello replied that the outcome depends on the audience Foraddiction specialists or psychiatrists an outcome of reduceddrinking would probably be appropriate Surgeons would probably beinfluenced more by an outcome of reduced readmissions to the traumaservice He surmised therefore that reduction in recidivism mightbe a suitable outcome for emergency physiciansPollock asked how to differentiate that type of study from doinga clinical trialGentilello suggested that clinical trials are important becausethey change practice He thought a successful multicenter trialcould lead to the creation of a standard of careEdward Bernstein observed that one site cannot address all thequestions raised at this conference He suggested that NationalAlcohol Screening Day an NIAAAsponsored event is an opportunityfor EDs in many institutions to collaborate in evaluating the AUDITscreening instrument in the ED It could be the first step towardmulticenter studies He also believed that research should havepolicy implications and that funding sources should require thisapplicability He suggested that NIAAA reclaim indirect grant costsfrom institutions that did not implement positive findings fromtheir researchRichard Ries responded to Bernsteins indirect cost proposal byendorsing a doubling of indirect costs for institutions thatadopted positive findings as standard operating procedures afterthe grant period was over This would reward institutions forputting clinical preventive services into practice He reasoned weshould prefer motivational strategies He observed concern duringthe conference that control groups in intervention studies get muchalcoholrelated assessment which can act as an intervention Healso agreed with Gentilello that decreased alcohol intake might notbe as important an outcome to ED staff as decreased revisits tothe ED Since brief interventions only lead to modest changes inalcohol intake perhaps studies should focus on reinjury or healthcare use as the primary outcome Then followup interviews wouldhave to do less alcohol intake assessment and that would mean lessintervention effect on the control groupGentilello concurred commenting that insurance claims data canbe a useful source of followup data as can a simple phone call toinquire whether a patient has returned to the doctor recentlyCheryl Cherpitel related difficulties as a nonMD publishing inmedical journals She wondered if articles by nonMDs would betaken seriously by physicians who work in clinical areas If theywould medical journals might need to be educated to acceptarticles from nonMDs If nonMD alcohol methodologists couldpublish more easily in these journals they could have a biggerimpact on practices in the EDGentilello remarked that the attitudes of reviewers for surgicaljournals vary considerably He once submitted an article with confidence intervals and it was rejected because it had no pvalues He related that his alcohol studies used to be returnedwithout being reviewed Reviewers have become more accepting Theyno longer require him to strike any references that show alcoholtreatment is effective He believes that trauma research requiresmultidisciplinary input and that research by nonMDs is takenseriously However getting that work published requirespersistence Submitting this work helps educate editors andreviewersHargarten observed that the impediments to publishing seem to belessening and that the work of Cherpitel and others is vitalSoderstrom noted that large grants provide a great deal of dataPapers that are clinically applicable to functioning practice inthe emergency department and the trauma center belong in thosejournals He asserted that papers on methodology or more complexareas need to be included in other appropriate journalsBrewer commented that having a paper published is different fromhaving an impact on clinical practice Most patients in emergencydepartments are seen in nonacademic centers Physicians in theseenvironments may doubt the applicability of research done inacademic centers He suggested we need research on how to getphysicians to screen in the emergency department One of the wayswe get physicians to do this is to get JCAHO to require itDaniel Hungerford observed that the RichmondKotelchuck modelsuggests that changes in practice result from effort applied to allthree elements of the modelpolitical will social strategy andknowledge base It might seem that research activities apply onlyto the knowledge base aspect of the model However importantresearch activities need to be carried out in all three elements ofthe modelRobert Woolard favored continuing intervention research in EDsHe believed that the realities of our practice settings help drivethe development of new ways of delivering counseling for examplecomputerbased methods While emergency physicians may not have thetime or interest the patients do He suggested that research intrauma centers and EDs can help alcohol researchers learn moreabout the interventions they have already developed and can evenlead to novel interventions
