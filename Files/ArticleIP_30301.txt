                                  Kissingers Comeback Tour            Henry Kissinger like an aging rock star who keepssqueezing one more year out of the same old hits has embarked on yet anothercomeback tour The former secretary of state has just released Years ofRenewal  a page behemoth about his service to President FordMeanwhile Robert D Kaplan has lionized Kissinger in this monthsAtlantic This tributea bow from the great pessimist of the s tothe great pessimist of the srevisits Kissingers  doctoraldissertation and finds it brave a persuasive account of why realism keepsthe peace better than idealism And Kissinger is popping up on TV screens withalarming frequency delivering his gloomy assessments of the Kosovo bombing andthe frost in USChina relations            Kissinger of course has never gone entirely outof fashion His press savvy charm and resolute courtship of the rich andpowerful have ensured that he always remains plenty visible Like RichardNixonto whom he is eternally yokedKissinger has spent his years out ofpower spinning endlessly spinning his record and revising it whennecessary Like Nixon Kissinger has been trying to escape a black mark on hiscareer Vietnam rather than Watergate And as with Nixon this spinningoccasionally produces vindication as it has for the past few months Kissingeris back in vogue not because he is saying anything new Hes only saying whathe has been saying for  years Hes back in vogue because his doleful realismframes the debate for Republicans who oppose Clintons foreign policyespecially Clintons China and Kosovo policies            Kissingers vindicationisnt complete because the current talk is silent on Vietnam But Vietnamvindication could be just around the corner Click for more            Much of the current fascination with Kissinger grows out ofthe journalistic debate over Years of Renewal  Years of Renewal it must be said does not seem a promising start for any kind of debate Thethird and final thank God volume of Kissingers memoirs it drones on aboutan entirely forgettable period in American history The MayaguezIncident Quick can you tell me what that was about Or Basket III I didntthink so            But beneath the welter ofdetails about Cyprus and Angola Kissinger makes a surprising claim arguingthat his toughbutaccommodating policy toward the Soviets in the mids leddirectly to the confrontational Reagan tactics that won the Cold War in thes According to Kissinger the breathing space created by dtente gave theUnited States time to recover from Vietnam without retreating intoisolationism thus setting the table for Reagan            Many commentators including Kaplan have embracedKissingers interpretation But others especially Robert Kagan in the NewRepublic have savaged Years of Renewal for its selfservingrevisionism Now that the USSR has collapsed they say Kissinger ispretending that he was much tougher on the Soviets than he ever was In themost telling example Kagan slams Kissinger for taking credit for the Helsinki human rights provisions Thats Basket III These provisionsbecame a key weapon of Sovietbloc dissidents in the s In fact Kagan saysKissinger was skeptical of Basket III and had virtually nothing to do withit            The fight over whetherdtente helped win the Cold War is not simply academic It especially mattersfor current USChina relations If Kissingerian dtente helped break theSoviets then presumably Kissingerian dtente could help tame todays ChineseIn the s Kissinger downplayed ideological conflict with Soviet Communistsin favor of soothed relations just as Sinoapologists including Kissingertoday ignore Chinas Communist authoritarianism human rights violations andsuppression of democracy Idealistic conservatives such as Reagan despisedKissingers accommodationist policies during the s The USSR was an evilempire not simply a dance partner in the great geopolitical waltz Likewisetodays idealistic conservatives still despise Kissinger and detect in Yearsof Renewal s dtente argument an excuse to coddle China It is nocoincidence that Kagan the sharpest critic of Years of Renewal  is alsothe strongest China hawk around author of many antiBeijing articles for theWeekly Standard             The Kissinger comeback wouldnt be possible without thespectacle of Republican foreign policy confusion Since the end of the ColdWar the GOP has divided itself into Wilsonian idealists such as the folks atthe Standard  who believe the United States should be the globalcrusader for justice and the rest of the party which isnt sure what itbelieves but loathes Clinton Kosovo where the idealists favored interventionand other Republicans didnt has deepened this divide            Kissinger seems an unlikely guide for the lostRepublicans After all he backed the Kosovo bombing on the grounds that NATOhaving started fighting must win to preserve its credibility But beneathKissingers reluctant support was a larger principle The United States has novital interest in Kosovo so the United States never should have involveditself there at all US interests not US ideals should ultimatelydetermine our foreign policy            It is this gloomy but coherent vision that has madeKissinger a favorite of floundering antiKosovo Republicans It is this samevision that Kaplan so admires Kissinger offers them a stiff foreign policyframework a set of principles sharply contrasted to Clintons ad hocism Hegives the Republicans intellectual window dressing to what would otherwise bejust more incoherent antiClintonism This is not as glorious as another stintas secretary of state but the  Kissinger will happily accept theassignment
