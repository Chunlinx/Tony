                so how you like New Jersey   uh its pretty good you know you get uh closer to the uh coast here and you do get a good bit of uh smog and stuff especially from all the uh fuel cracking towers and chemical plants   right i guess uh i dont know what part of New Jersey youre in but i guess its uh fairly industrial   yeah its when you get further east towards New York City it gets very industrial   right uhhuh   but im im about uh thirty miles west of there so you have uh actually green trees and such that you dont notice that that other part of New Jersey exists actually very   yeah yeah right     yeah you you go even a few wide miles out and you got uh farms and everything so you relatively clear air   right   but uh   well i dont know about you but ive always considered automobiles to be probably the the prime contributor i mean theres a lot of contributors but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that   oh definitely definitely its uh you know there are a large number of them on the road theyre all   yeah   yeah going and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair   thats yeah thats thats a big issue is you know a lot of states dont have a uh inspection law so you get you get a lot of people out there without ETR emission control systems on their cars and things like that   oh even even where you do have the inspections you know the inspection is once a year   yeah and its like   you get the car thats in the accident and muffler falls off or something and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that   sure right i guess from what i hear though uh next year Ford is coming out with their electric cars theyre actually coming out with the first prototypes in California   yeah that and i think also some of the uh car companies are coming out with uh gas powered fleets   yeah   so you natural gas powered rather than uh gasoline   right i hope i im hoping that comes along quick   uh i was reading a an article in Time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast thats going and i guess its its really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize and i know thats not due to uh its not due to to gasoline or to you know carbon monoxide so much as the CFCs but   it it is coming from cars though   uh yeah i think thats a thats a contributor definitely   i mean the uh car air conditioners is one of the major leaking sources of uh the uh freon which is one of the major fluorocarbons chlorofar chlorofluorocarbons   right right yeah i guess right now what theyre what theyre primarily worried about is third world countries because i guess United States and and Russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating CFC production but   well it it   it go ahead   no its the type of thing there that uh you know the Third World countries are less industrial and they want to become industrial   umhum   so theyre on the different part of the cycle of the US the US used you know all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today   right and thats one of the arguments that the Third World countries have been using is that basically they dont want to have to pay for our mistakes   if if that makes any sense uh in terms of   or or they want the right to make the same mistakes themselves to bootstrap them up to the way where we got to   exactly exactly uh those of kind of yeah those are joining arguments but uh i dont know thats thats kind of an interesting situation there uh what they dont realize those third world countries what they dont realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the poles and its its increasing even as far near the Equator as like Florida and Cuba and those places   yeah   so its kind of an interesting situation its not   not a real good one actually but   no well you also have the very close related thing of the uh rain forest destruction   yeah   which is the main source of whats clearing out the atmosphere and   uhhuh   replacing some of the pollutants   yeah yeah you dont get that that source of cleansing anymore are have you been in big cities a long time   mostly ive mostly been in the east coast so thats going between Atlanta Washington DC area   okay so youve got yeah those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard i would think     well not not as hard as some places out west because you dont get the uh major pollution sources as you do out in Denver with the with the inversion and Los Angeles and all rest of California which is just terrible it sounds   yeah Denvers definitely yeah thats one of the worst sure yeah Denvers that that real good uh that real good uh example of sitting in a valley kind of like Mexico City does i guess Mexico City is historically been one of the worst in the world for that   uhhuh yeah   but ive been pretty lucky ive lived in cities that really havent had that much of a problem although uh im really kind of based in Orlando Florida and there you can tell that its getting worse i mean it it definitely its not at a level comparable to Los Angeles or Denver but you can   yeah there its almost all automobiles because theres not that much in the way of heavy industry you know that would be causing it   exactly yeah and theres not that much in terms of of public transportation down there there is but its kind of its   umhum
