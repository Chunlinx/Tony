                    Background        Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness but its        molecular etiology is poorly understood Glaucoma involves        retinal ganglion cell death and optic nerve damage that is        often associated with elevated intraocular pressure IOP                       It is becoming increasingly clear that many forms of        glaucoma have a genetic component      and much        current research is focused on identifying chromosomal        regions and genes that contribute to glaucoma              Identifying such loci allows screening for individuals with        an increased risk of developing glaucoma            Identifying genes contributing to elevated IOP and glaucoma        is only the first step however and animal models will        provide systems for subsequent hypothesis testing and        experimental dissection of pathogenesis        Due to conservation in mammalian physiology and the        powerful tools of mouse genetics mice are a very important        experimental system for probing the functions both in        health and disease of many genes recently identified by        sequencing the human genome     We have focused on        developing the mouse system for IOP and glaucoma studies                  Mice are expected to be extremely        helpful in characterizing genes and mechanisms that affect        IOP or the susceptibility of the optic nerve and retina to        glaucomatous damage            Very little is known about the magnitude of IOP of        various mouse strains or IOP fluctuation in mice with time        or other factors Previously we developed a method to        measure IOP in mice and reported initial findings on the        magnitude of mouse IOP     The procedure involves        direct measurement of pressure following cannulation of the        anterior chamber The initial experiments demonstrated that        in our hands careful ocular cannulation has a very minor        effect on IOP average of  mmHg mode  mmHg and        demonstrated significant differences in intraocular        pressure levels between four mouse strains Here we        provide an update including an extensive strain survey        and show that the methodology is reliable and produces        reproducible data over extended periods of time                    Results                  A broad range of IOPs between strains          Figure shows the average IOP of a number of inbred          mouse strains that were housed in the same environmental          conditions There is a wide range of IOP with strain          BALBcJ having one of the lowest average IOPs             mmHg and strain CBACaJ one of the highest IOPs             mmHg Significant differences exist among various          strains P   for all groups ANOVA comparing          strains within each sex group          Clinical and histological analysis of the eyes of all          studied strains see Table  did not identify anatomic          or pathologic features that might account for the          differences in IOP For example the iridocorneal angle          and aqueous humor drainage structures are open to the          anterior chamber and have normal morphology in both          BALBcJ and CBACaJ mice Figure  More than  of          CBACaJ mice had IOPs of over  mmHg which increases          risk for glaucoma in humans We aged a small group of          these mice n   to  years and histologically analyzed          their optic nerves and retinas but they did not develop          glaucoma                          Strain differences are reproducible          To assess the consistency of IOP in specific strains          we measured IOP in different cohorts of each strain          maintained under similar conditions at different times          We purposefully included strains at each end of the IOP          spectrum and strain CBLJ B that is commonly used          for genetic experiments Figure  The average IOP of          different cohorts of strains CBACaJ CBACaHN both high          end of spectrum and B were consistent over time This          was true of most strains assessed on multiple occasions          Average IOP for age matched mice of the same strain          assessed at different times typically differed by no more          than  mmHg and the differences were usually smaller          Strain PJ was the most variable strain with the          average IOP fluctuating by up to  mmHg          Despite the general consistency of IOP the average          IOPs of some strains have changed in a reproducible          manner The IOPs of BALBcJ mice low end of spectrum          were very similar for the past several years around           mmHg Between early  and  however the IOP of          this strain did jump from approximately  mmHg to          approximately  mmHg Figure  During this period the          room in which our animals were housed and the          manufacturer of the mouse diet were changed Over the          same period the IOP of AJ also increased dramatically          from    mmHg n   in  to    mmHg          n   in  The increased IOP in AJ also was          reproducible with the average IOP of mice assessed in          the year  being    mmHg n            Importantly the IOPs of strains B and CHHeJ did not          change during this time B    mmHg in  and             mmHg in  n  and  CHHeJ             mmHg in  and    mmHg in  n   and                                    Effect of age on IOP          We focused on the commonly used B PJ and          CHHeJ strains to determine the effects of age on IOP          Figure  In B age had a significant effect on IOP P            IOP was slightly decreased at both  months             mmHg and  months    mmHg          compared to  months    mmHg and  months             mmHg Although the decrease was of a similar level          to the variation observed in  month old mice see Figure           the IOPs of control young mice see Methods analyzed          at the same times as the various B age groups did not          decrease For example control mice analyzed at the same          time as the  month  month and  month B age groups          had IOPs of    mmHg n      mmHg n               mmHg n   respectively IOP was          even lower in the  month B mice    mmHg and          again the average IOP of young controls measured at the          same time was not changed    n            In strain PJ IOP did not differ significantly          with age between  and  months but was lower in           month old mice P   compared to all younger          ages Figure  Despite a  mmHg dip in IOP at  months          there were no significant IOP differences between CHHeJ          mice at each age tested P   for age Although the          effect of age has not been thoroughly assessed in other          strains no obvious agerelated differences have been          identified in other strains analyzed at multiple ages          except for the glaucomatous DBAJ and AKXDTy strains                                        Effect of sex on IOP          Although we have not rigorously assessed the effect of          sex on IOP in many strains sex specific differences have          not been detected in the majority of strains for which          both sexes have been analyzed and have proven          inconsistent even within an individual strain analyzed          multiple times Strains B and PJ have been          extensively evaluated at multiple ages between  and           months of age Sex differences were always absent in          strain PJ and typically absent in strain B In          strain B however males infrequently had significantly          higher IOP than females For example in one experiment          B males had an average IOP of    mmHg n            whereas the average IOP of females was    mmHg n            P   If real this sporadic sex difference          was not dependent on age sometimes occurring in a group          of B mice at a particular age and sometimes not          occurring in a separate group of the same age                          Anesthesia protocol avoids IOP alteration and          allows detection of diurnal differences          All IOPs were assessed using an anesthetic regime of           mgkg ketamine and  mgkg xylazine defined as X          Initial experiments suggested that an almost identical          dose  mgkg ketamine and  mgkg xylazine of          anesthesia had no effect on IOP during the experimental          period with IOP being measured as soon as possible after          the mouse was unconscious typically minutes     To          further assess the effects of anesthesia we measured IOP          in groups of genetically identical B mice subjected to          different doses X X and X at  and  minutes          after administration Figure  For all doses IOP          decreased by  minutes P   for time The greater          the dose the greater the decrease in IOP At the  minute          measurement however IOP was the same using all doses          suggesting that the anesthetic effect on IOP had not yet          occurred To identify any early window when it may be          possible to assess IOP without an obvious anesthetic          effect  mice of strain B were anesthetized with the          X dose and IOP was measured at  minute time points          between  and  minutes after administration Figure           The mean IOP of groups analyzed at each time point did          not differ P   indicating that the IOP depressing          effect of anesthesia occurs later than  minutes after          administration Similar results were obtained using           strain PJ and  strain DBAJ mice with the X          dose PJ P   DBAJ P   In support of a          later effect of anesthesia since general anesthesia is          reported to mask diurnal variation in IOP     we          identified increased IOP during the dark compared to the          light period of the day in several tested strains Figure           In these experiments IOP measurements were made          between  and  minutes after administration of          anesthesia                          Blood pressure does not correlate with IOP          An initial study of the relationship between blood          pressure and IOP in mice did not detect a good          correlation R   Figure                           Myocalleles do not associate with the magnitude of          IOP          Mutations in the myocilin gene            MYOC  cause human glaucoma To          determine if allelic variation in the mouse           Myoc gene associated with IOP in          mouse strains we analyzed the gene in an assortment of          strains with different IOPs Two alleles were identified          One of these alleles had a  nucleotide insertion in the          promoter region ccagagcagggt between positions  and           compared to the previously published sequence and          is called the insertion allele The other allele was          identical to the published sequence     The          insertion allele also had a previously reported          substitution A to G ThrAla in exon  and several          other single base changes in the promoter region              The presence or absence of this allele does not associate          with IOP as it is present in strains with a range of IOPs          Figure                           Genetic alterations and IOP                      Y Chromosome            The Y chromosome has been implicated in strain            specific blood pressure differences in rats                 To test if the Y chromosome of strain Ola alters            IOP in relation to that of strain B we compared the            IOPs of pure B males and consomic B males that had            the POla Y chromosome backcrossed for             generations No differences in IOP were detected            between these groups of mice Figure  P                                  Car            To test if deficiency of carbonic anhydrase II leads            to decreased IOP we analyzed mice of a B background            that were genetically similar but with normal or mutant            alleles of the             Car gene      There was            no difference in IOP between normal and mutant mice            Figure  P                                  Lepr            To test if genetic perturbations that cause obesity            and diabetes can alter IOP we compared mice that were            genetically similar but were either homozygous or            heterozygous for a leptin receptor mutation              db  that results in obesity and            diabetes before  months of age on the CBLKSJ strain            background used     IOP was modestly but            significantly elevated in obese diabetic homozygous            mutants    mmHg compared to nonobese            nondiabetic heterozygotes    mmHg P              Figure                                 Tyr            To determine if albinism alters IOP we analyzed B            mice that were either pigmented or albino The albino            mice were homozygous and coisogenic for a mutant allele            of tyrosinase              Tyr             c              J  that arose on the otherwise            pigmented B background In  month old mice            homozygosity for             Tyr             c              J resulted in increased IOP               mmHg compared to wild type pigmented mice               mmHg P   The same was true for            independent cohorts of mice of different ages that were            analyzed at different times Figure A In contrast            to pigmented B mice Figure  the IOPs of the albino            B mice were not increased at measurement during the            dark compared to light period of the day P              Figure B                                      Discussion                  IOP differences are reproducible and amenable to          genetic analyses          We report the IOPs of over  genetically different          mouse strains that were housed in the same environmental          conditions The magnitude of IOP differences between          strains and the good reproducibility of readings over          time will allow the use of genetic approaches to identify          genes that underlie these differences Using our method          a trained investigator can measure the IOPs of  mice in          an hour Thus it is feasible to assess sufficient numbers          of mice for quantitative trait locus QTL analysis          methods and to use these methods to identify chromosomal          regions contributing to strain differences in IOP The          strain survey we report provides valuable information for          designing these experiments The throughput and          reproducibility also is sufficient for mutagenesis          screens       These are important approaches as          they may allow the association of genes with IOP and          glaucoma whose currently known functions do not suggest          that they affect aqueous humor dynamics or do not          immediately identify them as likely glaucoma          candidates                          No effect of anesthetic protocol on IOP during a           minute measurement window                      Similarities and differences to rat            studies            Our results agree with the time course of            cardiovascular depression caused by intraperitoneal            administration of ketamine and xylazine in rats In            that study anesthesia had a minor effect on blood            pressure during the first  minutes following            injection but a strong hypotensive effect between             and  minutes that continued for more than an hour                In contrast intraperitoneally administered            ketamine  mgkg was shown to rapidly decrease IOP            in a different rat study     IOP decreased            significantly between a conscious measurement and the            first possible measurement under anesthesia defined as            time  IOP decreased further by the next reading at             minutes after which it remained stable for the            duration of the experiment  minutes     The            time  measurement in that study was at a very similar            state of anesthesia as our  and  minute time points            starting as soon as possible and within  to             seconds of adequate anesthesia and the  minute rat            time point was similar to our  and  minute            measurement times Thus although both rat and mouse            studies show that anesthesia decreases IOP the studies            do not agree on the timing of the effect The IOP            depression occurred very soon after anesthesia in the            rats but was delayed in the mice                                    Environment may influence the effect of          anesthesia          Factors that may influence the effect of anesthesia          include the species strain and environment used          Essentially the same dose of ketamine and route of          administration was used in both the rat and mouse IOP          studies In mice the strain does not appear to be          important as no early effect of anesthesia was present in          the three distantly related laboratory strains    we          studied in detail and we have not observed any obvious          effect during this period in any analyzed strain          Environmental differences may be important Cage          cleanliness changing frequency and housing density can          alter drug metabolism and the effect of anesthesia in          rats      The type of bedding used also may be          important We use wood shavings for bedding and wood          shavings expose the mice to terpenes Terpene          administration or environmental exposure to terpenes in          wood shavings alters drug resistance and decreases the          effect of anesthetic agents in both rats and mice                                            Risk factors for increased IOP                      Age            Although within the range of variability observed in            young mice the IOP of B mice modestly decreased            around  year of age This decrease was statistically            significant compared to young mice measured at the same            time At  years of age the IOP of B mice had            decreased further though an effect of anesthesia in            these very old mice cannot be ruled out     The            IOP of PJ mice also decreased with age but only at            the oldest age examined  months Decreasing IOP            correlates with increasing age in the human Japanese            population      Further studies of B mice may            allow experimental investigation of this effect            Additional studies may also identify  normal mouse            strains that develop increased IOP with age as            generally occurs in Western populations      We            previously demonstrated that the glaucomatous strains            DBAJ and AKXDTy develop elevated IOP with age                                                Gender            In the examined strains we found no consistent            differences in IOP between males and females This was            true at all ages for the  strains that were aged to             months or older This is in agreement with a number of            human studies which show that IOP is equal between the            sexes      However some studies have found            sexspecific differences typically with higher IOP in            females and the magnitude of the difference increasing            after  years of age      Of possible            relevance we previously reported that female mice of            strains DBAJ and AKXDTy develop elevated IOP at            an earlier age than males                                     Blood pressure            Some but not all human studies have reported a            positive association between IOP and blood pressure                 Our comparison of the relationship between            blood pressure and IOP in young adult female mice of            different mouse strains whose blood pressures differed            up to  mmHg did not reveal a positive correlation            Further studies are needed to determine if blood            pressure correlates with IOP in males and to determine            the relationship between blood pressure and IOP in            various mouse strains with age                                Obesity and diabetes            Obesity or higher body mass index have been            implicated by some but not other studies as risk            factors for increased IOP and glaucoma                   Similarly diabetes or the combination of diabetes            and obesity have been variably associated with elevated            IOP and glaucoma           To test if            genetic perturbations that cause obesity and diabetes            can alter IOP we compared groups of mice that were            genetically similar except that they were either            homozygous or heterozygous for a leptin receptor            mutation              db  that results in early onset            obesity and diabetes The obese diabetic mice had            higher IOPs than their lean nondiabetic littermates            Thus epidemiological associations between increased            IOP and obesity or diabetes are supported by this work            and appear to be functionally relevant Further            experiments with obese nondiabetic or diabetic            nonobese mice will help to characterize the separate            effects of these risk factors                                    IOP is increased during the dark period of the          day          Diurnal variation in IOP is common in humans and          laboratory animals     The molecular mechanisms          underlying the diurnal rhythm are not defined but          increased aqueous humor production or flow occurs during          the period of increased IOP in both rabbits and humans                Small changes in the resistance to aqueous          humor drainage may also contribute to diurnal differences          in IOP      We first suspected IOP changes with          time of day when the IOP of a group of B mice measured          in the hour prior to onset of the dark period appeared to          be higher than at other times of day Previously a rise          of IOP was reported to occur before onset of the dark          period in rats     and rats and rabbits were shown          to have higher IOP during the dark period compared to the          light period       Thus we compared the IOPs of          mice at different times of day and identified several          strains with significantly higher IOP during the dark          compared to the light period The magnitude of the          difference varies with strain and was greatest in SWRJ          The IOP increase in the dark is not dependent on          functional rod and cone photoreceptors since these cells          degenerate in SWRJ mice due to homozygosity for the           Pdeb           rd mutation In agreement with          this finding circadian regulation of wheel running by          light was previously reported in mice lacking rods and          cones     Interestingly the IOP of strain CBACaJ          which has one of the highest daytime IOPs does not appear          to increase in the dark Further more detailed studies          are needed to define the characteristics of the diurnal          rhythm of intraocular pressure in mice and to determine          whether it is lacking or has a different timing in strain          CBACaJ Analysis of these mouse strains may increase          understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling          diurnal rhythms of IOP and that may be relevant to          glaucoma                          Cardeficiency does not alter IOP          Bicarbonate formation is important for aqueous humor          secretion from the ciliary processes and carbonic          anhydrase CA facilitates this secretion There are          multiple forms of CA and the CAII isoform is reported to          be the predominant form in the ciliary processes               Our experiments show that a genetic deficiency of          CAII in mice homozygous for a mutation in the           Car gene does not alter IOP CAIV          activity was recently demonstrated in the ciliary          processes    and so our data may support a more          substantial role for CAIV compared to CAII in aqueous          humor secretion It also is possible that CAII          substantially contributes to aqueous humor secretion but          that functional mouse CAIV is sufficient to prevent an          effect of CAII deficiency on IOP in           Car mutant mice In support of a          role for both enzymes a greater than  inhibition of          CA is required for significant reduction of aqueous          secretion                               Tyrosinase deficiency results in increased          IOP          Tyrosinase is the first enzyme of the pigment          production pathway Tyrosinase deficiency causes albinism          and has various ocular consequences These include          alteration of the number of ipsilaterally projecting          retinal axons and substantially increased light          penetration past the iris     It is not known if          these abnormalities affect mammalian IOP Here we show          increased IOP in mice lacking tyrosinase activity          compared to otherwise genetically identical pigmented B          mice Additionally IOP differences between the light and          dark period of the day were detected in the pigmented but          not the albino B mice Thus albinism can affect the          diurnal pattern of IOP changes In agreement with this          result mice with albino eyes that are homozygous for          tyrosinase or pink eye dilution mutations have altered          diurnal rhythms compared to pigmented mice              Albinism by itself is either not sufficient to alter the          diurnal rhythm of IOP or alters it in different ways          depending upon genetic background however since the          albino strains BALBcByJ and SWRJ had increased IOP          during the dark Diurnal rhythms are known to depend on          visual pathways and to respond to light intensity          Exposing rats to  hours of low light abrogates the          diurnal fluctuation of IOP and results in constantly          elevated IOP     Further experiments will determine          the nature of the diurnal rhythm of IOP in the albino B          mice and if its alteration or other mechanisms result in          IOP elevation                            Conclusions        A broad range of reproducible IOP differences exists        between inbred mouse strains and a diurnal rhythm of IOP        exists in different strains Various factors have been        variably associated with risk for increased IOP in humans        Genetically uniform mice can be used to study the effects        of these risk factors on IOP In trained hands our        measurement procedure is reliable accurate and rapid        enough to allow large scale genetic studies of factors        determining IOP Mice have great potential for helping to        characterize the molecular mechanisms affecting IOP                    Materials and Methods                  Animal husbandry          All experiments were performed in compliance with the          ARVO statement for use of animals in ophthalmic and          vision research All mice were bred and maintained at The          Jackson Laboratory Mice were housed in cages containing          white pine bedding and covered with polyester filters          For most experiments the mice were fed NIH   fat          chow           ad libitum  and their water was          acidified to pH  to  B mice develop diet induced          diabetes when maintained on a high fat diet     To          ensure that we were analyzing the effect of age and not          diabetes the B mice in the aging experiment were fed          NIH  fat chow We have found no differences in IOP          between B mice housed on the  fat and  fat versions          of this otherwise identical diet The mice were group          housed and the cages were changed one time per week If          any cage appeared soiled between scheduled changes the          mice were placed in a clean cage The environment was          kept at C with a  hour light  hour dark cycle          The colony was monitored for specific pathogens by The          Jackson Laboratorys routine surveillance program see          httpwwwjaxorgfor specific pathogens                          Intraocular pressure          Intraocular pressures were measured as described          elsewhere      The mice were typically          acclimatized to the procedure room for at least  weeks          prior to measurement but sometimes between  and           weeks Although it was not possible to include all          strains in each measurement period mice of different          strains were intermixed As demonstrated here the IOPs          of CBLJ are very consistent over time and so these          animals were interspersed with experimental mice during          all experiments to ensure that calibration had not          drifted and that the system was functioning optimally          Whenever possible the investigator measuring IOP did not          know the genotypes of the animals It was not possible to          analyze all age groups of each strain at the same time in          the aging experiments Therefore to control for          potential IOP changes due to measurement time and not          age approximately  month old B mice were assessed at          the same time as each age group All dark period          measurements were made between  and  hours after the          lights turned off The room was equipped with dim red          lights and mice were protected from all light exposure          during set up Each mouse was briefly exposed to the red          light when the anesthetic agents were administered When          adequate anesthesia was achieved after  to  minutes          the mouse was placed on the measurement platform and the          white light of the microscope was turned on for          approximately  and a half minutes to allow ocular          cannulation IOP measurement and postmeasurement tests             that guard against artifactual data The white light          was used at very low intensity and was dim but we cannot          rule out the possibility that this brief exposure altered          the IOP All other mice were protected from light          exposure throughout the time an individual mouse was          analyzed                          Blood pressure          The blood pressures of conscious mice of each strain           to  females per strain were measured with a          tailcuff system as reported     except that  days          of training were used The mice were analyzed in the same          procedure room as was used for IOP measurment                          Clinical examinations          For most strains anterior chambers were examined with          a slit lamp biomicroscope     At least  mice of          each strain shown in figure were evaluated However the          anterior chambers of CBLKSJ mice were only evaluated          under a dissection microscope at the time of IOP          measurement                          Histological analysis          Eyes from at least  mice of the listed strains were          fixed  paraformaldehyde or Feketes          acidalcoholformalin fixative processed paraffin          embedded and sectioned as previously reported               except that the paraformaldehyde was buffered with  M          phosphate buffer All strains other than CBACaHN and          CBLKSJ strains were evaluated The eyes of CBACaJ and          BALBcJ mice were also fixed and processed for plastic          embedding Historesin Leica Heidelberg Germany and          sectioned as previously reported      Saggital          sections including the pupil and optic nerve were          collected and analyzed as they contain most ocular          structures                          Analysis of Myoc          Exons and the
