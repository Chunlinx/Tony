        did they say anything   no   i guess we got ten minutes or something like that i dont know   oh okay   so what do you think   um i think they should do it     yeah   i i do because um with all all the sports you know and everything theyre doing there and also because whenever youre dealing with drugs like if you if you are on drugs then that affects the way you work and everything   umhum i agree but i think theyre slow  in testing  you know i dont know   yeah   about yours but mines they so slow they tested some people twice three times and some people havent been tested at all   oh really     umhum   well see um and i worked for a steel mill the past two summers     uhhuh   and i had to go through you know a physical and everything and before they even told you you were hired like they just called me in for an interview       and i went in for my interview and then right there he said okay go down to the company hospital and youll go through a physical so you know i mean it was really good that way because they they tested everyone right away   umhum   and you didnt you didnt have any notice you know so like if you were doing drugs then like you didnt have a way you know to stop i mean it was still in your body     yeah     yeah   i like that i know when i i was in that like  in the service and we didnt have we used to have to go every other month or whenever   uhhuh   to uh just do do we called it the golden flow but  and they did random drug testing just because   you know Uncle Sam but ive always thought that they were slow  as far as outside of the government you know   uhhuh     because ive always im im use to it   oh really     its no big deal   yeah well see you know i well     i guess if youre not doing anything its no big deal people call it invasion of privacy not to me its not because first of all if youre not doing anything theyre not invading anything   right   you know and if youre taking medication from a doctor thats no big deal either   yeah because like what   because then theyll or you have a prescription   yeah you know what too whenever they did that for me like you know we had to take they did it blood and urine       and um they they gave you a paper right there and they said if you were out drinking or if you went out for a good time last night go ahead and write down that you did have beer or you did have alcohol or if you are on medicine go ahead and write down what medicine you are on   uhhuh   okay but i you know so they allotted for you know things like that like you know people didnt know they were being tested well you might have had a drink last night you know and that would show up too       yeah   yeah   well see they dont do a blood test to us   they just do a urine test which i think they should do a a blood test because then that tells them that you know they testing for  drugs but i think its like i tell and then you know they have all this smoking stuff why dont they just test for alcohol because thats between drugs and alcohol thats it   umhum     thats the biggest killer there is i think they should do both of them   umhum   you know because then that that way theyll theyll get rid of they can help the alkies and then they can help the people thats on drugs   yeah and then uh it got you know it got backfired on a lot of kids too because a lot of kids   you know     um like you know like somehow they missed the physical or something   yeah   you know and they wrote down that they uh werent but then they went back and they checked them like maybe a week after they were working and if they had drugs in their body i mean they were fired on the spot there was no ifs ands or buts about it     oh oh yeah   uhhuh   umhum i thats all right   yeah yeah i think this way too because in that steel mill i mean someone     and see some people always talk about the kind of job you do   umhum   but it would that wouldnt be fair if they tested just people with strenuous jobs   yeah   because you know you you got your your your pilots and your your air traffic controllers your nurses your doctors   uhhuh yeah   yes i would want all those people checked but then you got your bus drivers your truck drivers are checked because my husband drives a truck they he has to pass a physical   uhhuh   you know but i think why dont they and and to me its wrong to check just the people that you think are affecting the public   yeah   you know   uhhuh   why not just check everybody so   yeah yeah see they checked everyone in the mill too and then that was hard because you know someone would come in and they had a problem well then if i like some of the jobs i was doing was very dangerous you know       we were working with that steel thats thousands of degrees hot and i would have to cover for him you know like i would have to do two jobs for someone just because they they think theyre being smart or something   umhum   you know and i mean they even had um the the higher up management people would even come in periodically and have unexpected checks you know   yep   so it was really good you know they were checking you know visually and       uh with the blood and the urine tests     well thats all right   yeah i thought it was really good   because they check our bosses and everything and i think thats the way it should be if they going to check you know that way you cant stay well they didnt check my boss you know yeah they checked him too  so everybodys getting checked its not like its just little peons its everybody   uhhuh yeah yes right   and that thats the way i think they should do it that way it is random you know its random because some people is already gone two three times and some people aint went at all   uhhuh     and they just when your number comes up your number comes up   yeah right and then uh they checked us like once during the middle of the summer also   umhum   you know like its not like they just like well then the second time when i got hired i knew what was coming you know so then they checked us again in the middle of the summer     yeah   so i thought that was really good too i dont i   well i think if youre doing something really bad  its going to show up   uhhuh       yeah   you know     yeah   i dont think you can hide   certain drugs   no i think it what is it like       i know even even like steroids well how long does it take for marijuana to get out of your body   thats thirty days   see so there still     they said it was thirty days but on one of my our our thing is they said that youd have to the way the test is youd have to really be smoking for it to show up and i dont think thats right   oh really i thought it would show up with no matter what amount we   thats what he told thats what they tell you but i think it is i think itd show up no matter what if you doing it then its going to show up   yeah and and steroids i mean that kind of drug thats a lot longer   yeah   that takes a lot longer to get out of your body   i think they should check everybody everywhere thats working because see they got this and thats just like even all the football players yeah i think they ought to check them because you get kids looking up to them and here they are strung out on drugs what good is that you know thats not good   thats right yeah and even and even uh       i dont know sometimes i think they should even check the the music you know the entertainment   oh yeah because the the   with with uh the movie stars and and the singers and everything   yeah because they get strung out too   yeah     theyre no different   umhum     but i guess you know thats they contract they dont   and theyre out winning awards you know and then and then the younger kids think theyre great and everything     but yet and then theyre strung out on drugs secretly   exactly   you know they go off because they have a drug problem   uhhuh   huhuh  thats not right   yeah you know what i thinks i bunch of bull too is whenever um they um really you know like nationwide or you know popular people they do have a problem and they come out and they say theyre having the problem so then they get more publicity because they admitted they have a problem and theyre trying to fix it   yeah   well what about the Joe Shmoe whos an alcoholic and hes trying to fix it you know but hes not getting any   he theyre not testing him because they only testing for drugs     yeah right   and i think they should test for alcohol   uhhuh   because we have some alkies too boy you can smell it on they breath       you know its bad when you can smell alcohol on somebody but theres nothing you can do because they not drunk         but you know they drink constantly  to get that breath smell   uhhuh yeah   you know but i said no they they getting on the smokers and stuff but i think i because like i told one guy i says smokers dont kill people in a wreck from being smoking   thats right   you know drunk people kill people from being drunk   thats true i never thought of it that way but thats true   so why are you know why dont they just to me they ought to just do the blood test for alcohol   umhum   and i said theyll have more people then     yeah oh definitely   i mean you know i can understand like on a Monday   yeah but then you can look at it there too well alcohols legal     yeah but so is cigarettes   yeah     you know so why charge me more   uhhuh   so you know drugs is not is is is not legal   some of them are   yeah umhum   and some people are addicted to prescription drugs   exactly yeah   and so whats the difference   umhum   you know they still got a drug habit but theyre legal   thats true   they got a drug problem but its legal you know its like huhuh huhuh no they need they need some help too   uhhuh       umhum umhum   because they check those and i know one girl she was on some kind of medication   but see they didnt bother her because she had a prescription   yeah     but i mean what if she was hooked on them you know   thats true   how they going to know just because she has a prescription     how are you going to tell if shes hooked on them youd have to take her off them you know some people i mean thats they they they go off them and they theyre going to die   umhum yeah so you need to to me if they going do a they need to keep checking like if somebodys got some drugs in they system   umhum     and its all prescription its fine but what kind of drug is it     yeah   you know and then how long are they supposed to take it   uhhuh   if they people have prescriptions for Valium but theyre not supposed to take Valium twenty four hours a days you know all the time thats for if they have a problem   yeah   and and then see that way youll find out if they have a problem because if they keep taking it they have a problem     yeah   or they wouldnt keep taking them   uhhuh and then also after you know they can find out whenever their prescription ends and then find out you know how long it will take for that to be out of their system and then test them again     and test them again and see if they have it again   uhhuh   umhum because you know they dont give you a whole bunch of them pills   yeah   because they gave my husband some when his mother passed but that was for like to calm him down   right   you know but see now theyre gone   uhhuh   i think they gave him like four pills no and then that was it   yeah yeah       uhhuh     but see now they they would be out of his system but if he was to be tested
