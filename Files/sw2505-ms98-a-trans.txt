        talk about the activities that we dont do  uh   yeah i i dont have any children so but i i have a lot of friends with children  and i know they spend a lot of time with them  which is good   thats good to hear yeah and  i havent uh well ive been  around a lot of people lately at work at my job that dont have a lot of values   you know     so its its always nice to see people that like each other  and like uh families that get along with each other and like to do things together   yeah yeah they have a lot of values i love that  do they have children     um the one the the most valueless girl doesnt  but shes married now i im not quite sure why  i i think he said that hed give her a big ring and         she got married to him   oh thats wonderful   but  its its its its kind of weighed on me and then the  other day my husband and i met a couple who whore theyre just gonna have their first child and  they really like each other       and theyre real happy with one another and she says things like  im really glad when he comes home and theres not enough time to spend with him in the evening and  im like   oh thats neat   really   thats good you know i like to see that you know i have uh some friends that uh first of all   yeah   uh the girls joined they have two girls one joined the Girl Scouts and the other was in the Brownies  and then the mother got involved as a leader and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with  doing nature hikes for them and working with the Girl Scout camp here in Dallas and then going out to  um Betty Perot Camp and working with the horses and stuff and theyre gone a lot and they take their girls and they go away for weekends and  in the winter time even you know to do work with the Girl Scouts and i think its neat   oh yeah   you know theyve really become very much involved in in just that one organization  which the organization can use the help too  so i i wish i could see more of that you know   right well on Sunday we just met uh a family we were thinking about getting Maine Coon Cat and we went over to a lady that breeds them here in town and  uh her daughter actually it was her she said that her husband said to her daughter  you need a hobby         so she chose the cats and you can tell its a family hobby the cats theyre all a part of it and it was really neat because they all were interested in each other and and the cats and they raise champion cats   ooh  those are neat cats too   so theyve done really well yeah ive just learned about that breed   theyre really nice looking cats i have seven cats but theyre all mongrels   well thats what were gonna end up getting   well theyre the ones that need the homes   oh yeah   you know mine were just all um strays in the neighborhood little baby kittens dropped and stuff and it just kind of built  one at a time just kind i couldnt you know one time two of them came  at once and i cant turn a hungry cat down   oh i know   so you know and the last one that i picked was here uh the kids brought him over and said he was injured  and it was winter time and i said i just cannot have another cat i just cannot have another cat  and i looked out there and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all and i said i cant stand it i brought him in so   oh   those are my children we dont have very many activities  but     no i know what you mean our cat hates other cats and the weve tried to get her to like  other cats and she just uh she wants to be around human beings and she does not wanna be around other cats so our next were gonna try it with a kitten and see if her maternal instincts come out   huh lots of luck is she spayed oh yeah real maternal   yeah  were hoping its our last hope   shell eventually i mean mine you know i have five males and  two females everybodys spayed everybodys neutered  and we still have a scrap every now and then nothing real bad you know a slap here and there but  um they put up with each other and they will eventually  her nose will be out of joint for a while and shell hiss and growl and  slap every now and then but theyll shell finally accept it you know they really dont have any choice in my  in my household  we have a little bit of uh  a fight for whos boss mean a male cats are are real you know real territorial and so thats the big battle here       you know uh whos whos top dog  well top cat i guess you know but um we i dont i dont know i dont have a problem with it  i think they   umhum   just learn to accept and i have two dogs too and theyve  slapped the dogs around too  every now and then  so   yeah yeah thats true theyve got to keep them in line   yeah but shell accept another cat eventually as long as you make her feel um  like shes still loved and everything  so   yeah well those Maine Coon cats were great they were fourteen pounds and   and theyre   oh theyre just gorgeous but yeah  three hundred and fifty dollars for a kitten and i think of those i think of the kittens at the pound   oh my gosh  yeah three hundred and fifty dollars   i just yeah yeah and they are lovely but   ooh house payment  that is is a lot of money   right yeah and then shes saying you know you cant let them outside and you cant do all this stuff and im like ooh   i dont let mine out anyway but  i let two of them out just in the back yard every now and then but my cats are inside im afraid  you know with neighbors it people throw rocks at them and people run over them and i i just you know i just dont       i know so and and now theyve lost the desire most of them dont even try to get you know to go out i just have two  that drive me crazy that i let out in the back you know but i wont let them get if they start going in the front and stuff i bring the m in     oh   you know i just worry i guess im too protective but  you know i see these cats that are  wandering around the neighborhood and too they can catch diseases really easy just by touching a nose to another cat they can contact leukemia   yeah yeah yeah   feline leukemia  so we know we try try real hard to keep them healthy   uh we just bought a acre a house with an acre to try to  so shell shell have some room to walk around and not off of a busy street were were choosing our house for our cat isnt that bad   oh how neat people do it for their children i mean why not well you know why not why not   oh them too  well because i he loves shes one of those that loves outside and she doesnt go far but she just wants to be able to have that freedom   yeah yeah  well if youre off off a road you know away from a road and youre off of the main road you said away from a road  you know and you keep an eye on her its probably okay  im just real   yeah yeah   i dont know i guess im in a neighborhood and its  its just real tough on animals here you know when i every time i see one run over i just you know it makes me sick  so   yeah it gets hard especially with the cars oh i know   you know but  anyway we kind of got off the subject of children except that i consider them my children   yeah yeah our cats are our kids or  i we we got married a few months
