                                 The Gay Marriage Backlash                        Dear Joe            So I got married this weekend Yesterday to be exact at half past oclock on an impossibly sunny morning overlooking the San Francisco Bay andits spectacular Golden Gate Bridge There was a touch of wind blowing off thewater which was enough to keep my guests cool but not enough to blow theircarefully coifed hair into a mousse mess The amber light sparkled all alongthe bay as the city of San Francisco lay like a crown jewel in thedistance            If I say so myself it was a completely perfect wedding to go along with theperfect weather There were of course the superficial details of theeventfrom the wildflower arch in front of which we took our vows to the towerof festively decorated individual cupcakes that an ingenious baker handfashioned into a unique kind of wedding cake to the delightful surprise I gotyesterday each time I noticed the antique ring around my finger that hadpreviously and always been bare And there were the much more profound momentsthat come from finally committing to a person for the rest of yourlifelooking into each others eyes as you are promising to love and cherishone another the joy radiating from the sea of faces of loved ones who hadtraveled from near and far to share in the event the rush of happiness astheir glasses clinked in a unified toast to our shared lives that lay aheadwith so much possibility            Imagine my chagrin then to read an AP story that had popped up over thesame weekend that several Republican presidential candidates had pledged tooppose allowing gays and lesbians to adopt children samesex relationshipsunder the term marriage discussion of homosexuality in schools and federallaws to specifically protect homosexuals from discrimination part of anoverall effort by a dozen antigay groups in this latest election cycle            Well since I had just held one of these dreaded samesex weddings ickyterm dont you thinkI prefer my nephews bridebride hitchingphraseology I guess they told me Except of course I dont seem to bepaying an ounce of attention to the continuing and perplexingly tirelessefforts of these groups and the candidates they manage to strongarm intointolerance Apparently a great gob of Republicans had signed on althoughonly Utah Sen Orrin Hatch and publisher Steve Forbes and no even though hisfather Malcolm was widely rumored to be gay I am not going to go there inthis obviously ironic twist of dysfunctional familial fate had confirmed theirpledges            One plus Sen John McCain of Arizona GOPs Xena Elizabeth Dole andcurrent phenom Gov George W Bush of Texas did not sign along withDemocratic candidates Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley the former USsenator from New Jersey and all around niceseeming fellow            So what am I to make of all this The antigay groups never seem to want togive up on their battle to meddle in the private lives of American citizenswhile more and more people are learning more and more about the lives of gaypeople like me every day The venues are manyfrom massive news coverage ofthe coming out of a television star named Ellen I loved the Yep Im Gaytitle in Time magazineit was more like Of course shes a big homosince most of gay America had gaydared Ms Degeneres from the second she walkedonscreen to the tragedy of the brutal and senseless killing of MatthewShepherd Now I am not a political personin fact I am nearlyantipolitical Being a reporter all my life I have naturally shunned anysidetaking And covering the Internet as I do now its not GOP for me butIPO            And yet there I was yesterday standing up in front of a crowd of peopleand hundreds more the night before at a prewedding party we alsothrewdoing something that is apparently at the heart of our current politicaldebate Now I know I live in San Franciscothe Super Bowl of sin cities tosomebut I did not get the feeling that I was some radical cancer that hadinvaded the body politic I simply felt like I was someone in love with akindred soul who wanted to be able to declare that in a way that had beengoing on since the beginning of time            Its hard to imagine then that given these complex times with so manyimportant issues to deal with that are likely to challenge this country goingforward there seems to be such intense focus on this topic Id like to knowwhat you think about this because I cannot for the life of me see why thisissue seems to inflame so many Is it the religious thing Is it the last gaspof a former culture that wants to hold back the new one Is it just asmokescreen to inflame voters rather than actually inform them I only know thewords of guest after guest who came up to toast my partner who talked of lovecommitment family and the future and not much of politics            My partner told one guest she was marrying but it was a girl and not aboy            Well came the response People have been marrying girls forcenturies            I could not have said it better myself So I wont            CheersKara
