                                  Reno Divorce            Even by Washington standards Janet Reno hassuffered a wicked case of conventionalwisdom whiplash After famously takingresponsibility for the botched FBI raid in Waco in  she was lionized forher refreshing readiness to be held accountable Before long however thebuckstopshere clich grew stale and the story line changed It becameBecause of Renos managerial incompetence and the disarray she presided over atthe Justice Department a lot of innocent Branch Davidians died unnecessarilyVersion  is at least as dubious as Version  Originally hailed as the verybest appointee of the Clinton administration bar none by Morton KondrackeReno has more recently been called the presidents worst major Cabinetappointment by the editors of the Weekly Standard             The latest and mostdramatic turnabout has been on the question of Renos independence Theapproved view until recently was that Reno had made herself irrelevantaWashington nonplayerby being so intractable and prissy Various articlespublished in  and  included mutterings from White House officials thatthe attorney general had no relationship with the president and that officialswould love nothing more than an excuse to replace her after the election Morerecently however Republicans have insinuatedand the news media havereflectedthe view that Reno is not just a team player but a political shillfor the White House This is because she refuses to appoint an independentcounsel in the campaignfinance scandal  The New York Times  in arecent editorial raised doubts about Renos loyalty to the public NewtGingrich the historian went well beyond that comparing Reno to RichardNixons Attorney General John Mitchell who went to jail for obstruction ofjustice            Gingrichs comments are as offensive as usual but even themilder form is absurd People do play against type from time to time but thecharge that Reno has suddenly become a docile tool of the White House simplydoesnt wash Her decision on the independentcounsel issue may be good orbadbut it is legally defensible and the evidence that Reno has been swayedby political factors doesnt amount to a prima facie case            The first point is Renosown background and personality As state attorney in Dade County Fla Renoacquired a reputation not just for integrity but for an almost fanaticalprobity She asked the governor to appoint an independent counsel to prosecuteher own mother when the late Jane Reno was arrested for drunken driving InMiami as in Washington Reno was criticized for her management style for hersentimental notions about crime and for her general mulishness But until afew months ago no one ever accused her of bending the law            Even if she were a different sort of person the case thatReno is acting politically in not appointing an independent counsel would fallapart over the issue of motivation  When calls first came for anindependent counsel in November Reno might have been vulnerable to pressureShe was by all accounts eager to stay on as attorney general in anadministration that was not at all eager to keep her Until some time after theInauguration Clinton might have got away with getting rid of her while he wasreplacing others in the Cabinet            But politicalcircumstances have changed since then The best thing Reno could possibly do toguarantee her own job security is to appoint an independent prosecutor If shedid Clinton could never get rid of her If he tried it would be treated likea version of the infamous Saturday Night Massacre when Nixon kept firingJustice Department officials who wouldnt fire special prosecutor ArchibaldCox            Whether Renos decision not to appoint is correct on themerits is another question which wont be settled here But it is prettyclearly within the bounds of reasonableness Renos critics have beenimprecise and often contradictory on the question of why they think she mustappoint an independent counsel Under the law the attorney general is obligedto do so if she comes across specific and credible evidence of criminalwrongdoing by a highlevel official covered by the act She also has thediscretionary powers to appoint an independent counsel if she feels there wouldbe a personal financial or political conflict of interest if normal JusticeDepartment procedures were followed            Though it is blindinglyobvious to Renos critics that criminal acts were performed by highlevelClinton officials they dont agree among themselves about which actions bywhich officials qualify Sen John McCain RAriz thinks its Al Goresfundraising calls from his office Common Cause thinks its Bill Clintonscoordination of softmoney expenditures from the White House Orrin HatchRUtah thinks its letting John Huang into the White House            Reno says that no accusation against either Gore or Clintonmeets the specific and credible standard Gore she asserts in a lengthyresponse to a request from Hatch was raising soft money which is not coveredby the regulation that prohibits solicitations from government buildings Thecoordination of softmoney expenditures that Clinton was involved in she saysisnt illegal I think this last interpretation is unfortunate because itopens the floodgates for unlimited contributions from corporations and laborunions which is what the postWatergate election reforms were supposed toprevent But legally Reno is on pretty firm ground            That leaves the more vagueanddiscretionarylanguage about personal financial or political conflict ofinterest No one has suggested that Reno has a financial or personal stake inthe latest scandal Hatch and others have made the case that she faces apolitical conflict Reno is an appointee of the administration presiding overan investigation that is potentially embarrassing and damaging to theadministration But the standard for appointing an independent counsel cant bethat broad Attorneys general face political conflicts every daywhether tobring cases against enemies associates friends even relatives of members ofthe administration Given a broad interpretation the conflictofinterestprovision would require dozens if not hundreds of independent counsels Renohas apparently construed this ambiguous provision in the only way one sensiblycan It gives her a wider berth than the specific and credible language butit does not require her to appoint an independent counsel every time someone inthe opposing party detects the appearance of a political conflict            Paradoxically caving in to her critics wouldbolster Renos reputation for fearless independence If the attorney generalhad ordered up an independent counsel not only would her job have been securebut the New York Times and maybe even Sen Hatch would be swooningover her once again Standing up to them and doing what she evidently feels isright means being taken for a Clinton hack To her great credit Reno has thusfar rejected the perception of independence in favor of the genuinearticle
