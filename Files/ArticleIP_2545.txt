                                 Search Me            Imagine walking into yourlocal library to look for a book Hoping for a librarian to guide you you areconfronted instead by a bewildering array of entrepreneurs each offering tofind what youre looking for But none has cataloged the whole library eachhas cataloged a different part of it each uses a different system and none isterribly satisfactory That is the situation on the Internet today            Theoldfashioned librarian still has an edge over the vast resources and computingpower of the Internet in several ways First a library offers more valuablestuff  Certainly there is more raw information on the Web than in anylibrary But the kind of stuff people are actually willing to pay for is sadlylacking So long as publishers fear cannibalizing their salesor arent ableto make money maintaining Web sitesthere will be books and periodicals thatare only available offline or online for a fee You can read the WallStreet Journal free at your library but you have to pay to read iton the Web And of coursethere are forafee search services like LEXISNEXIS that allow you to read documents online butfor the time being serious researchespecially for the budgetarilychallengedstill usually leads to paper            Libraries also have a distributed cataloginginfrastructure  This means that everyone shares a common cataloging systemWhen a new book gets published a single library will do the work to abstractand catalog it then share that work with all the others This effortcoordinated by the OnlineComputer Library Center is assisted by standards for cataloginginformation  The Dewey Decimal System and the Library of Congress are bothschemes that help guarantee that a book can be found the same way in differentlibraries            Mostimportant though libraries invite reduced expectations  No one expectsto walk into a library and get a list of every book that contains the wordpoker organized by subject title and author Were just happy to look uppoker in the online card catalog and find the books that are actuallyabout poker And typically wed be just as happy not to find the references toredhot poker or poker faced            Of the many Internet search services Yahoo comes the closest to thiscardcatalog approach It does it the oldfashioned way hiring people to lookat each site and assign it an abstract and one or more categories This is easyfor people to understand but its not comprehensive Even very diverse sitesseldom appear in more than a few categories For instance a search for Slateclick here shows it somewhere under the Politicscategory but not the Movie Reviews or Economicscategories Yet Slate runs a movie review every week and has published manyarticles on economics            Even if Yahoo wanted to bethis comprehensive the humans cataloging the materials cannot possibly keep upwith the ever changing nature of the Web To stay current they would have toread every page of every site every day To solve this problem most othersearch services use computers instead of humans to do their cataloging Theirmachines scan every Web page they can find by a process known as crawling seemy discussion of crawling in a previous Webhead column and put every word on every pageinto a giant index            One of the first sites totake that approach was Infoseek Click here to search for slate The naive user might expect tosee a link to our home page But the problem is that our home page includes fewinstances of the word slatemany fewer than say the home page of a dealerof roofing materials or pool tables is likely to Thats the limitation of asystem based on text indexing It doesnt really know what a page is aboutjust what words appear on it Using a little artificial intelligence thecomputer tries to decide which pages are more about a given word than othersbut its not always successful            HotBot is another searchsite Try the slate search by clicking here By the way as you try out these searches you maysee an advertisement for Slate That means we bought the rights to the wordslate Whenever someone searches for it our ad shows up On the Web you canbuy wordsisnt that great            Excites site uses some of thatartificial intelligence to help you refine your searches Try searching forslate by clicking here If you find a page that you like you can click on more likethis Excite will return a list of pages which look like the page youclicked on That means that similar words appear on the pages with similarfrequency Sometimes this works more often it returns pages that seemimpressively unrelated For instance this search for pages like the Slate parody Stale yields not only Slate a goodguess but also the Steel Lunch Boxes Web page not a good guess butentertaining nonetheless            AltaVistas site takes aweirder approach to this idea of refining searches Search for Slate byclicking here Adding or subtracting words from your search criteriacan help find what youre looking for For instance adding Kinsley andsubtracting roofing would probably increase your chances of finding our homepage Their LiveTopics technology attempts to help you do this They look upslate in their index and see that it often occurs on the same page as roofso they suggest this as a possible refinement of the search But since thesesuggestions are generated by computer they can be very weird To see this inaction click on one of the LiveTopics links on the AltaVista searchresultspage How did Adaptec or Skadden get on the list Your guess is as good asmine Well for Skadden its not such a mystery considering that Slate ispart of the name of the DC law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher Flom            The best solutions for searching will probably result froma combination of humans and computers If AltaVistas list of searchrefinements was generated by a human for instance it might be more helpfulIf the producers of every site cataloged it themselves then Yahoo wouldnthave a hard time keeping up with them Of course everyone would have to agreeon standard ways to do this and if everyone agreed forprofit search siteslike Yahoo probably wouldnt be necessary So dont be surprised if the statusquo lasts just a little while longer
