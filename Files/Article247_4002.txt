                                 One Word Son Chinacom                        You might have thought the biggest winner on Wall Street in the wake of theUnited States and Chinas agreement on terms for China to enter the World TradeOrganization would have been the company thats been loudest in its support forChinese entry namely Boeing But in what may be yet another sign of the adventof an economy based on bits and not atomsor at least of the mainstreamacceptance of the idea of that economythe biggest winner today byfar was what a shock an Internet company Chineselanguage content providerChinacoms shares rose  percent today on news of the accord raising thecompanys market cap to  billion            Chinacom went public as a Nasdaq stockmeaning that its actual sharestrade on the Nasdaq as opposed to what are called American depositaryreceiptsin July and its shares have now risen more than fourfold The leaptoday was prompted by one of Chinas key concessions to the United States toallow foreign equity investmentup to  percentin both Chineseownedtelecommunications companies and Internet companies This was a prettysignificant aboutface considering that just two months ago the Chinesegovernment took a public stand against foreign involvement in the ChineseInternet industry and that many thought that the government would draw a linearound the Net even if it conceded on telecom Todays concessions open thedoor to myriad partnershipshow far off can AOL China beand the idea seemsto be that Chinacom has a key foothold in the market            When you consider that Chinacom has only  registered users in acountry of more than a billion people calling its foothold key seems ratherdubious But the truth is that its next to impossible to think about businessin China in freemarket terms In a real market brands are vulnerable andfirstmover advantageslike the ones that Compuserve and Prodigy had inInternet access in the United States for examplecan be lost as a result ofcompetition But in a market in which political connections remain essentialand state intervention can come at any time a firstmover advantage insofaras it seems to reflect state sanction if not support appears to be rathermore significant            The paradox inherent in all of this of course is that the Internet reallyis an incredibly destabilizing technology both economically and politicallyand yet the Chinese government is doing its best to hold it fixed even thoughholding it fixed if thats possible is the best way to destroy its value Theviral spread of information on the Internet the incredibly rapid andinexpensive growth of user communities and businesses the facilitation ofglobal market relationships These are the hallmarks of the Netnot merely inthe minds of the digerati but also in the minds of investors Theyre the onlythings that make a company like Yahoo worth  billion or a company likeChinacom worth  billion Yet these are the thingseven after todaysaccordfor which the Chinese government has very little affection            The romantic idea is that the combination of real free trade the Internetand modern telecommunications will eventually bring down the hideboundpolitical and economic structures that still rule China Now the romantic ideamay be right and greater access to the Net and greater free trade arecertainly good things But the truth banal as it may seem is that we stilldont really know very much about how the potentially democratizing Internetreally functions in a thoroughly undemocratic society just as we dont reallyknow very much about how the marketrevolutionizing Internet functions in anoncapitalist economy Obviously if the romantic idea is right the upside isso immense that todays  million rise in Chinacoms market cap will be amere drop in the bucket But in a way the companys name is the perfectconjoining of two wordsChina and comwhose real value lies not in what isbut only always in what may be
