                                 iLA Timesi Part II Calling Willes Bluff            Chatterbox has experienced much frustration trying to figure out preciselywhats gone amiss at the Los Angeles Times  First it was reported byRick Barrs in New Times LA  that the Times was sharingadvertising revenue from a special issue of its Sunday magazine with thesubject of that special issue the new Staples Center sports arena Thiscreated a predictable and justified uproar at the paper which caused thepublisher Kathryn Downing to apologize and mumble some nonsense about how shewas unfamiliar with newspaper etiquette which encouraged reporters and editorsat the paper to push editor Michael Parks to assign a story about the wholefiasco which he eventually did to David Shaw the papers Pulitzerwinningmedia critic It also prompted Chatterbox to puzzle over the apparent financialinsanity of a deal in which the LA Times paid the Staples Center or  million dollars in exchange for what seemed at best  worth ofservices            When Chatterbox wrote the earlieritem he was unaware that even before the New Times LA scoop DanTurner of the Los Angeles Business Journal had broken another piece ofthe Staples Center storynamely that the sports arena had contacted theteams concessionaires and various corporate sponsors connected to the StaplesCenter and asked them to buy ads in the Sunday magazine the ads themselveswere sold by the Times s advertising department This story is notavailable online Now that Chatterbox is better informed he stillsuspects the deal was a ripoff for the LA Times  Surely an aggressivesales staff for a virtualmonopoly newspaper like the Times could shakedown these advertisers just as effectively But Chatterbox must admit that hedoesnt know what other goodies the Times may have extracted from theStaples Center            Chatterbox also doesnt know how common it is for newspapers to enlist thepeople they write about to sell ads The New York Times  after initiallycovering the LA Times story quite aggressively subsequently had toadmit that in  the Boston Globe  which it owned then and continuesto own ran a special section on its new downtown sports arena theFleet Center which relied on ads procured by  the Fleet Center We treatedthem as a sales agent and paid them a commission for ads that they soldGlobe spokesman Richard Gulla told the Times  Felicity BarringerWill it happen today No            Chatterbox would love to see Downing lose her job andthis is probably toomuch to hope forsee her boss Times Mirror chief Mark Willes get cannedtoo Still Chatterbox doesnt really think a ritual sacrifice will addressthe basic underlying problem When media outlets strike secret business dealswith other businesses readers are unable to evaluate whether these deals mightbe compromising news coverage            This is not true of advertising whichsay what one will about itscorrupting effect on news coveragealways by definition  disclosespotential conflicts to readers It would be wonderful if publications could nowbe persuaded never to raise revenue by any means other than sales andadvertising but thats probably impractical Newspaper circulation has afterall been declining for many years A much better step would be fornewspapers magazines Web sites TV and radio news shows etc todisclose to consumers on a regular basis whatever nonadvertisingdeals they have going Newspapers for example could run a small daily boxof agate type providing this information with perhaps a longer summaryprovided once or twice a year            Why reporters didnt clamor for disclosure long ago at the LATimes and elsewhere is a bit of a mystery Probably it reflected ayearning to remain blissfully ignorant of trends in the news business for aslong as was humanly possible Most reporters Chatterbox knows are moreinterested in maintaining their virginity than in actually helping to maintainthe integrity of the business organizations they belong to The LATimes staffs cultlike attachment to Otis Chandlerthe former publisherand descendant of the papers founding family who last week wrote a letter supporting the staff revoltseems typical of thisineffectuality Times reporters have according to a report in todays Washington Post  lately beentaping photocopied portraits of Chandler to newsroom walls in silent protestagainst whats being done to his legacy Chandler was indeed a heroicpublisherthe Times was a mediocre paper when he took it over a greatone when he stepped downand it would be wonderful if he were reinstated orallowed a say about the papers fate But by all accounts he wont be despiteowning more LA Times stock than anyone else hes outgunned on theboard by an assortment of younger much more crass and stockpriceobsessedChandler cousins            A more productive way for LA Times staff members to rebel would beif they demanded to learnand share with readerscomprehensive informationabout the papers undisclosed sources of income and labor By doing so theywould be endorsing Mark Willes view that the wall between the news andbusiness sides of newspapers needs to be breached But they would have thesatisfaction of knowing they were breaching it in a way that Willes and his ilkwould find unpleasant precisely to the extent that it exposed unpleasantpractices            Because Chatterbox thinks disclosure of nonadvertising business revenuesources should be a newsindustry norm he will hereby do a little disclosingof his own When Chatterbox mentions a book that is in print he usuallyprovides a link to it at barnesandnoblecom This is because Barnes and Noblepays                   Slate                a sliver of the proceeds whenever someone buys througha                   Slate                link Chatterbox who has no ethical objections to thisarrangement is free to say whatever he wants about the book in questionfrequently he says the book is no good He is under no pressure to mentionparticular books or indeed to mention any books at all and does so only whenhe thinks his readers might want to examine his source material Chatterboxdoes the same thingbringing no financial benefit to                   Slate               withthe other various source links he provides But readers of this column shouldbe under no illusion that its in the business of finding the
