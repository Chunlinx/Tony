                            A malaria vaccine called METRAP which targets the preerythrocytic stage of the        disease was not effective at reducing natural infection rates in semiimmune African        adults according to the report of a randomized controlled trial published this month in         PLoS Medicine  This first field efficacy trial was an important        milestone in the progression of new recombinant vectored vaccines to deployable products        says Adrian Hill University of Oxford United Kingdom the lead investigator of the        study The safety profile was excellent and the efficacy data provide a first indication        of the levels of cellular immunogenicity that will be required for preventing infection        he says        Hill and his coworkers used a heterologous primeboost vaccination technique They gave        the volunteers two vaccinesa DNA priming vaccine followed by a modified vaccinia virus        Ankara MVA that acted as a booster The DNA and MVA vaccines both had the same insert        coding for thrombospondinrelated adhesion protein TRAP a preerythrocytic antigen and a        string of T cell epitopes called ME for multiple epitopes        Hills team had previously shown that METRAP vaccines given in primeboost sequence        could induce large T cell responses in healthy volunteers from the UK and could delay        parasitemia in a sporozoite challenge test Nat Med   The next step was to do a        randomized controlled trial in Gambia to determine whether this vaccination strategy could        provide protection against natural         Plasmodium falciparum infection        The researchers recruited volunteers from  Gambian villages that were close to the        alluvial flood plain and so were at high risk of developing malaria They randomly assigned        the  volunteers to receive either two doses of the DNA METRAP vaccine followed by a        single dose of MVA METRAP or three doses of rabies vaccine This threedose schedule is        similar to the one used by the World Health OrganizationUnited Nations Childrens Fund        Expanded Program on Immunization Two weeks before the third dose was given all the        volunteers received antimalarial drugs to clear bloodstage         P falciparum infections        The time to first infection the primary end point of the study was similar in the two        groups with an estimated vaccine efficacy of only  However the effector T cell        response to the TRAP antigen T measured one week after the third vaccination was         times higher in the DNAMVA vaccine group than in the rabies vaccine group        It is absolutely crucial that results like these are published since the failures as        well as the successes need to be documented if we are to move towards rational strategies        for optimizing malaria vaccines says Tom Smith from the Swiss Tropical Institute who was        not involved in the study At the same time it makes sense to move on quickly without        shedding too many tears in a field that is moving much faster than it was before the        recent injections of money from the Gates Foundation but where it is still impossible to        secondguess the results of field trials This is partly because we do not have any good        proxy measures of effective immunity in         P falciparum  and partly because this is a fertile area for        trying out new techniques such as DNA vaccines where there is still a lot to learn        Hill is planning to do further trials that address the important question of whether        this type of vaccine can prevent the symptoms of malaria The next step says Hill is        to assess newer vaccine regimes that employ two viral vectors rather than DNA and to study        prevention of malaria rather than infection
