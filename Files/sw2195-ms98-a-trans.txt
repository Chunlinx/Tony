                 weve my husbands retired and we vacationed a lot and i think ive had a lot in the meantime im not sure i would have picked that one either  shall we have a go at it   uhhuh sure        okay trial by jury   um i think one of the facets of living in a small town is that often times you are uh sitting in on a jury trial where you might be acquainted with at least maybe not that person but part of their family   uhhuh so that might lead you to a biased uh decision perhaps if you were uhhuh   i would think so   on the other hand um i dont know if course the judge as all the expertise in that field and hes trained for that and and im sure there are certain rules that are set down that he goes by uh along the way to make a decision but perhaps the jury can um give their uh input as to what they think need to be done and then maybe he can go from there uh have you ever sat on a jury trial   yes i have   yeah i have too and i found it real interesting but   i did to yes   but we werent given any opportunity to make a decision as to what would happen we just said whether or not we thought the party was guilty   um   and he took it from there   uh the last trial i sat on at the end of the session the prosecuting attorney called us into a private room and more or less instructed us to find her not guilty because even though they knew and they proved that she had set fire to her car in order to collect the insurance money that would we find her guilty she would simply flee the state and avoid any prosecution of any kind whatsoever which we did find her guilty against his instruction and she did flee the state   uhhuh   but       but she was guilty and we just didnt understand why he was doing that   uhhuh that would merely make for some odd behavior on the on their part   my husband sat in on a jury trial a murder trial that lasted for two weeks   uhhuh   that left him uh i mean in the very beginning he was convinced that the person was not guilty and at the end of their deliberations he finally voted uh guilty uh   uhhuh   which surprised me that that uh through the jury discussion they were able to convince him against his original opinion so maybe that speaks well for juries   yeah i i remember the one that i sat in on we had quite a problem coming to a conclusion and and we came back with so many people this way and so many that way and the judge told us we couldnt leave until we came to a decision and we just could not we were split and he kept us there one evening until seven uh and everyone wanted to go home and so they were willing some of them were willing to change their uh decision just to get out of uh out of the jury room   that doesnt seem fair does it   no and i i couldnt believe they would do that so maybe in a way it should be left up to the judge because uh maybe the jury isnt uh going to give them an honest decision   uhhuh   you know i i dont know i guess if if we had more power were just people off the street so to speak and   uhhuh   we dont have the the uh background to maybe make that decision   the only thing that frightens me about that is the Graylord cases in uh Chicago where so many judges were guilty of so much misjustice from the bench   uhhuh   that after all theyre only people too in that theyre subject to corruption just like any other human being and they do have a lot of power   uhhuh uhhuh it seems uh sometimes it seems uh rather i guess rather uh odd that one person would have that deciding factor he would be the sole factor uh determining a persons outcome i guess though but the jury still has their input and maybe he goes uh has a lot to decide has to decide a lot from what the jury has input to the case too   maybe we both agree then that we need to keep juries and   i think so   i think so   we could go on   i think weve reached a decision  nice visiting with you bye   i think we have thank you byebye
