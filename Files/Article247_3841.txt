                                 Word Wars                        Dear Dennis            The last few weeks have been good ones for popular discussion of languageMonica Lewinskys father is suing a TV show for using his daughters name torefer to a sex act a woman chosen to run one of the worlds largest law firmshas decided to refer to herself as chairman and Senator Jesse Helms used thedelightful word floccinaucinihilipilification the longest word in the firstedition of the Oxford English Dictionary  in a letter to PresidentClinton            I hope we can talk about some of these issues this week But the one thingthats been most striking recently is the response to an On Language columnby Margalit Fox in the New York Times Magazine  Ms Fox filling in forWilliam Safire wrote about a common language myth that some dialects areintrinsically better than others            Ms Fox citing various linguists and explaining things quite clearly saidthat negative reactions to nonstandard dialects are the result of socialfactors not linguistic ones the dialectswhether ebonics Brooklynese orPeter Jenningsare just as regular and logical as any other variety ofEnglish            To us as linguists this is familiar and noncontroversial I had thoughtthat Ms Foxs presentation would be viewed by the general public asnoncontroversial as well but I was mistaken The letters column last week hadno fewer than six angry letters calling us intellectual diddlers andwellpaid academic theorists who confine our victims to minimumwagejobs It was even implied that considering dialects to be linguistically equalwas a pernicious threat to common sense logic science and our basicpolitical freedoms Who knew            It would seem that the writers of such letters themselves lack common senseor at least the ability to understand simple language Ms Fox was very clearthat languages were considered equal on purely linguistic grounds and thatvalue judgments were socially determined The linguists who spoke in favor ofdiversity were certainly not advocating the abandonment of language teachingjust a better understanding of how language works            Its too bad that a genuine effort to spread this understanding has to meetwith such hostility dont you think            BestJesse
