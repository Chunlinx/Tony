                    Background        Fibronectin can control many aspects of cell behavior        including cell growth migration and differentiation            Fibronectin exists in the blood as a dimer but in        tissues it is in the form of an insoluble fibrillar matrix        The fibrillar form of fibronectin is thought to be the most        relevant form in vivo because this is the form with which        most cells interact     Various lines of evidence        suggest that the fibrillar matrix form of fibronectin        exerts effects on cells that are not duplicated by the        dimeric form of fibronectin For example high        concentrations of dimeric fibronectin enhance cell        migration whereas high concentrations of fibrillar        fibronectin reduce cell migration     Also inhibition        of fibronectin matrix assembly has been shown to inhibit        cell growth in various systems       These findings        suggest that fibrillar fibronectin may stimulate signal        transduction pathways in cells that are either not        stimulated or only marginally stimulated by dimeric        fibronectin        Fibronectin matrix assembly is a cellmediated process        that requires the activity of integrins        The        integrin that is primarily responsible for assembling        fibronectin into the matrix is  although v llb        and  can also function in this capacity                 In addition to integrins fibronectin matrix        assembly also depends on selfassociation sites within        fibronectin For example the Nterminal  kDa region the         sttype III repeat and the  thtype III repeat are        thought to be important for the proper alignment of        fibronectin molecules during matrix assembly                   We and others have shown that a recombinant        protein representing a portion of the first type III repeat        protein IIIC can affect fibronectin matrix assembly and        cell growth        Moreover a mutant recombinant        fibronectin molecule that is lacking the first seven type        III repeats has been shown to lead to defective fibronectin        matrix assembly in cell culture and in vivo and to        inhibition of cell proliferation      Although the        matrix produced with fibronectin lacking the first seven        type III repeats was somewhat aberrant this study does        show that some matrix assembly can occur without the first        type III repeat Therefore several approaches reveal that        the fibronectin type III repeats and especially the first        type III repeat play important roles in the regulation of        fibronectin matrix assembly and cell growth        IIIC is known to inhibit cell proliferation             Recently IIIC also known as anastellin has been shown        to inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth and metastasis            In the present study we examine how cells interact        with and respond to IIIC with a particular focus on        signaling through the RasERK pathway We find that cells        can adhere and spread on IIIC and that two classes of        receptors function in cell adhesion to IIIC integrins        and cellsurface proteoglycans                    Results                  Cell attachment and spreading on the first type III          repeat of fibronectin          IIIC is a recombinant fibronectin fragment that          encompasses most of the first type III repeat but is          missing the A and B strands of the repeat     We          had previously found that IIIC inhibited the growth of          normal diploid smooth muscle cells SMCs in culture              During these experiments we noticed that the presence          of IIIC in the culture medium affected the morphology          of cells at early times after plating As shown in Figure           cells plated onto fibronectin coated dishes attached          and spread well typically containing numerous          lamellipodia per cell Fig A panel FN Cells seeded          onto fibronectin coated dishes with IIIC in the culture          medium spread more extensively and in a more circular          pattern at early times after plating than cells plated on          fibronectin in the absence of IIIC Fig A panels FN          and FNC and Fig B Cells cultured on fibronectin for           hours show approximately the same extent of spreading          as cells on fibronectin plus IIIC Fig B indicating          that IIIC accelerated the rate of spreading of the          cells but did not affect the eventual extent of          spreading The effect on cell morphology was specific for          IIIC because the negative control protein III C a          recombinant protein derived from the  thtype III repeat          in fibronectin which similar to IIIC is missing the          A and B strands of this repeat had no effect on the          morphology of the cells Fig A panel FNC and Fig          B Interestingly the effect of IIIC on cell          morphology was seen even when the plates had           not been coated with fibronectin          Fig A panel C and Fig B indicating that intact          fibronectin was not required for cell attachment and          spreading when IIIC was in the culture medium Again          the negative control protein III C had no effect on          cell morphology cells seeded onto uncoated plates with          III C in the culture medium remained rounded and did          not appreciably spread over several hours Fig A panel          C and Fig B These results indicated that IIIC          had an effect on the morphology of freshly plated cells          Moreover the plates did not need to be coated with any          adhesive protein prior to seeding the cells with IIIC          in the culture medium indicating that IIIC may have          adsorbed onto the tissue culture plastic and that cells          then attached and spread on the adsorbed IIIC          To directly test whether cells were able to bind to          IIIC coated on a dish various concentrations of either          fibronectin IIIC or III C were coated onto dishes          and cell attachment to these substrates was measured As          shown in Figure  cells attach well to fibronectin and          to IIIC but not to III C coated on a dish On a          molar basis IIIC was less effective at supporting cell          attachment than fibronectin however it was clear that          RASMCs do attach and spread well on IIIC coated on a          dish The morphology of the cells seeded onto the          IIICcoated wells was indistinguishable from the          morphology shown in Fig A panel C                          Role of integrins in cell attachment to          IIIC          The attachment of RASMCs to IIIC was analyzed          further to determine the role played by integrins as          potential adhesive receptors for IIIC Various          integrinblocking reagents were tested for their ability          to block RASMC attachment to IIIC and to fibronectin          The adhesion of SMCs to fibronectin is mediated through           integrins      We confirmed these previous          findings for our RASMCs by showing a complete block of          cell attachment to fibronectin by EDTA an agent that          blocks all integrins anti blocking mAb and RGD          peptide but not by the negative control RAD peptide          Fig A Antifibronectin antibodies also effectively          blocked RASMC attachment to fibronectin Fig A          Heparin did not inhibit cell attachment to fibronectin          Fig A however it did modestly reduce cell spreading          on fibronectin  inhibition of cell spreading data          not shown These results indicate that RASMC adhesion to          fibronectin is mediated by  integrins          Blocking studies indicated that cell attachment to          IIIC was partially mediated by  integrins For          example RASMC attachment was partially blocked by EDTA          anti mAb and RGD peptide Fig B indicating the          involvement of integrins However cell attachment was          also partially blocked by heparin which did not inhibit          cell attachment to fibronectin Fig Aand B Hep          samples indicating that a nonintegrin receptor also          mediated cell attachment to IIIC A complete block of          cell attachment to IIIC was only observed when heparin          was combined with integrin blocking agents eg heparin           anti mAb or heparin  RGD peptide Fig B          Antifibronectin antibodies modestly inhibited cell          attachment but antiIII C antibodies effectively          blocked cell attachment to IIIC Fig B These          results demonstrate that cell attachment to IIIC was          mediated through both  integrins and another class of          receptors on RASMCs          One way in which integrins were originally shown to be          fibronectin receptors was by affinity chromatography of          radioiodinated cell surface proteins on a fibronectin          column      Consistent with these earlier studies          cell surface radioiodination of RASMCs followed by          affinity chromatography on fibronectin Sepharose and          elution with EDTA revealed the binding of two major bands          at  kDa and  kDa Fig Elane under FN These          sizes match those of the  and  integrin submits          respectively that have been shown by affinity          chromatography to bind to the cell binding domain ie           thtype III repeat of fibronectin                  Affinity chromatography on a IIIC Sepharose column          revealed the binding of three major bands of sizes           kDa  kDa and  kDa Fig Elane under C The           kDa and  kDa bands likely represent the  and           subunits as above while the  kDa band may represent          either the  or  integrin subunits which are known to          be expressed by VSMCs     Affinity chromatography on          the control III C column yielded no radioiodinated          proteins that were eluted from the column Fig Elane          under C These results are consistent with the          hypothesis that one or more pi integrins act as receptors          for IIIC Taken together with the integrinblocking          results described above it is clear that RASMC adhesion          to IIIC is partially mediated through  integrins                          Cell adhesion to IIIC activates ERK          Integrins are known to activate signaling pathways in          cells        Among the most wellstudied          signaling pathways is the RasMAPK pathway leading to          activation of ERK and ERK     We therefore decided          to test the effect of cell adhesion to IIIC on ERK          activation As expected treatment of RASMCs with PDGF          resulted in activation of ERK Fig  PDGF lanes          Plating RASMCs onto a fibronectin coated dish in the          absence of growth factors yielded moderate activation of          ERK which peaked at  min then decreased somewhat          over the next  min of the experiment Fig  bottom          panel However plating cells onto a IIIC coated dish          gave strong activation of ERK which peaked at  min          and remained relatively constant for the subsequent           min Fig  top panel The control protein III C did          not appreciably stimulate ERK phosphorylation Fig           C lanes both panels Thus the adhesion of RASMCs to          IIIC resulted in robust activation of ERK that was          comparable to the activation obtained with PDGF                          ERK activation by IIIC is dependent on           integrins          As shown above several agents that block  integrin          function partially inhibit cell attachment to IIIC We          therefore tested the effects of these agents on ERK          activation by IIIC The results obtained with ERK          activation closely paralleled the results obtained with          cell attachment to IIIC except that the individual          blocking agents were relatively more efficient at          inhibiting ERK activation For example heparin EDTA          anti mAb and RGD peptide all significantly inhibited          ERK activation by cell adhesion to IIIC Fig           Heparin was most effective and completely blocked ERK          activation Fig  In contrast the negative control          RAD peptide did not inhibit ERK activation by IIIC          Fig  CRAD lane These results indicate that both          integrins and the class of receptors inhibited by heparin          were required for IIIC mediated activation of          ERK                          Role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans in cell          adhesion to IIIC and ERK activation by IIIC          Because heparin was able to inhibit the attachment of          cells to IIIC and the activation of ERK by IIIC          we tested the effect of other glycosaminoglycans on          IIIC stimulated ERK activity Heparin heparan          sulfate and dermatan sulfate blocked ERK activation by          IIIC Fig  and cell adhesion to IIIC not shown          In contrast hyaluronic acid chondroitinsulfate and          chondroitinsulfate had no effect on the ability of          IIIC to stimulate ERK activity Fig  or on the          adhesion of cells to IIIC not shown It is possible          that heparin heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate          inhibit IIIC mediated cell adhesion and ERK          activation due to common chemical features For example          heparin heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate all          contain iduronic acid residues whereas chondroitin          sulfate and hyaluronic acid do not The results presented          above indicate that a heparan sulfate proteoglycan HSPG          or dermatan sulfate proteoglycan on the surface of RASMCs          may serve as a receptor for IIIC          To further explore the possibility that a cell surface          proteoglycan serves as a receptor for IIIC RASMCs were          treated with the glycosaminoglycandegrading enzymes          seeded onto IIIC and analyzed for the activation of          ERK Heparitinase treatment but not chondroitinase          ABC treatment decreased the amount of ERK activation          by IIIC Fig  Heparitinase treatment also inhibited          cell adhesion by  while chondroitinase ABC          treatment did not inhibit cell adhesion to IIIC not          shown This result is consistent with the idea that          HSPGs but not chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans serve as          signaling receptors for IIIC          To identify the cell surface proteoglycans that may          serve as receptors for IIIC RASMCs were labeled with          SO            and cell lysates were applied to          IIIC and III C columns The most highly labeled          band migrating in a smear at about  kDa bound          efficiently to the IIIC column Fig A compare flow          through and elution lanes This proteoglycan resisted          elution by  M urea but was eluted by boiling the          Sepharose beads in SDS Fig A This same proteoglycan          did not bind appreciably to the III C column Fig          A Heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC treatment of the          SO            labeled samples revealed that the           kDa proteoglycan was composed mostly of HSPGs Fig          B These results indicate that most of the cell surface          HSPGs of RASMCs can bind to IIIC in affinity          chromatography          RASMC HSPGs were analyzed further by immunoblotting          with the monoclonal antibody G which specifically          recognizes desaturated uronates on the heparan sulfate          stubs that remain associated with core proteins after          heparitinase digestion     Complete digestion of          RASMC lysates with heparitinase reveals major bands at           kDa and  kDa indicating that these are the sizes of          the major HSPG core proteins not shown RASMC lysates          were subjected to partial heparitinase treatment full          digestion was not performed in order to allow some GAGs          to remain associated with the core proteins then applied          to either IIIC or III C Sepharose As shown in Fig           most of the  kDa and  kDa HSPGs bound to IIIC          Sepharose but not to III C Sepharose In addition the          presence of heparin in the lysate inhibited the  kDa          and  kDa HSPGs from binding to the IIIC column Fig           compare C and CH lanes The inhibition of  kDa          and  kDa binding to IIIC by heparin suggests that          these HSPGs may serve as receptors for IIIC in cell          adhesion and ERK signaling                            Discussion        We have found that cells can interact with a portion of        the fibronectin first type III repeat leading to cell        adhesion and activation of ERK and that this signaling        requires both cell surface HSPGs and integrins RASMCs are        able to adhere to and spread on IIIC Adhesion to IIIC        results in robust activation of ERK comparable to that        seen with PDGF stimulation Several independent lines of        evidence indicate that cell surface HSPGs and  integrins        act as receptors for IIIC and are required for cell        adhesion and ERK activation by IIIC For example various         integrin blocking agents inhibit cell attachment to        IIIC and ERK activation by IIIC In addition        inhibition by heparin heparansulfate and heparitinase        but not by chondroitin sulfates or chondroitinase ABC all        point to the importance of HSPGs as receptors Affinity        chromatography with I surface labeled proteins resulted        in the binding of proteins of the appropriate sizes of         integrins to both FN and IIIC columns Moreover affinity        chromatography with SO          labeled cells suggests that HSPGs        with core protein sizes of  kDa and  kDa serve as        IIIC receptors Taken together these results indicate        that the first type III repeat of fibronectin can serve as        a cell binding domain and that both integrins and cell        surface HSPGs function as receptors for this type III        repeat        Our results demonstrate that both integrins and cell        surface HSPGs are required for robust ERK  activation        when cells adhere to IIIC These results are one of the        first demonstrations that HSPGs can activate the ERK        signaling pathway Another example of this closely        parallels our findings     The adhesion of Jurkat T        cells to thrombospondin has been shown to require the        cooperation of three classes of receptors  integrins        CD and HSPGs     Adhesion of the Jurkat T cells to        thrombospondin stimulates ERK activation and the        binding of HSPGs to thrombospondin is required for this        signaling The particular HSPGs that mediate ERK        activation in Jurkat T cells have not been identified        however the authors speculate that syndecans may        participate in the adhesion and signaling in that system            This may also be the case in our system as        described below        One major family of cell surface HSPGs is the syndecan        family There are  members in the syndecan family        syndecan through      Syndecan  and         are known to bind to extracellular matrix proteins and        syndecan and  have been shown to support stress fiber        formation in conjunction with integrins                The HSPGs we have identified as IIIC receptors have        core proteins that migrate at the approximate sizes of        syndecan  kDa core protein and syndecan  kDa        core protein     It is therefore possible that our         kDa and  kDa HSPGs represent syndecan family members As        described above the syndecans may cooperate with         integrins and CD to activate the ERK signaling pathway in        T cells     A similar mechanism may apply to the        adhesion of RASMCs to IIIC Future studies will determine        the identity of the HSPGs that act as IIIC receptors        The RasMAPK pathway is typically thought to be a part        of a mitogenic pathway     However we and others have        shown that prolonged treatment with IIIC can inhibit cell        proliferation      and here we show that cell adhesion        to IIIC can activate ERK One possible explanation for        this apparent discrepancy is that although ERK are often        involved in mitogenesis in SMCs ERK activation can lead to        inhibition of proliferation     This occurs through        ERKmediated stimulation of PGE          production which then inhibits the        proliferation of SMCs     Further experiments will        determine whether RASMCs produce PGE          after treatment with IIIC Another        possibility is that IIIC stimulates other signaling        pathways apart from the ERK pathway and that one of the        other signaling pathways inhibits proliferation of the        cells The relationship between ERK activation stimulation        of other signaling pathways and growth inhibition by IIIC        will be elucidated by future experiments        The IIIC protein has recently been shown to inhibit        angiogenesis tumor growth and metastasis     Those        findings along with our present findings reveal some        intriguing parallels between IIIC and the angiogenesis        inhibitor endostatin     For example both IIIC and        endostatin are fragments of matrix proteins and can inhibit        angiogenesis and tumor growth In addition recent work has        shown that cells interact with endostatin through two        classes of receptors integrins and glypicans cell surface        HSPGs      This parallels our findings in this        present report that cells interact with IIIC through        integrins and cell surface HSPGs Therefore IIIC and        endostatin may inhibit angiogenesis through related        mechanisms involving both integrins and HSPGs Future work        will determine the relative contributions of these two        classes of receptors in the biological effects of        IIIC                    Conclusions        We have found that cells can interact with the        fibronectin first type III repeat leading to cell adhesion        and activation of ERK and that this signaling requires        both cell surface HSPGs and integrins Results from various        independent types of experiments indicate that the first        type III repeat of fibronectin can serve as a cell binding        domain and that both integrins and cell surface HSPGs        function as receptors for this type III repeat                    Materials and

SpragueDawley rats as          described previously     RASMCs were cultured in          DMEM supplemented with  FBS and glutamine PenStrep          RASMCs were typically between passages  and  for          experiments                          Recombinant protein production          Proteins IIIC and III C previously called III             were produced in bacteria and          purified as described previously     IIIC          encompasses fibronectin amino acids           AsnAlaProGlnThrSerThrPro and III C amino          acids  LeuProSerSerThrAlaValThr          according to the previously published numbering method              The recombinant proteins were expressed by the          pQE vector which places a His coding sequence at          the Cterminus of each protein The proteins were          purified on Niagarose columns and were  pure as          judged by SDSPAGE and coomassie staining Stock protein          solutions were typically  M for IIIC and  M for          III C in PBS          AntiIIIC antibodies were produced by immunizing          rabbits with IIIC After one month the rabbits were          boosted and serum samples were collected every two weeks          The rabbit serum was applied to an affinity column to          purify the antiIII C antibodies In order to avoid          purifying antibodies to the His tag in IIIC the          affinity column was made with a GST fusion protein The           sttype III repeat of fibronectin was expressed as a          fusion protein coupled to GST and this GSTFN fusion          protein was coupled to Sepharose and used in affinity          purification Bound antibodies were eluted with  mM          triethylamine pH  and the pH was neutralized with           M Tris pH  the antibody concentration
