                    Background        Reversible protein phosphorylation is gaining        recognition as a potentially important mechanism of        posttranslational regulation in protozoan parasites        especially those belonging to the         Apicomplexan family The        dephosphorylation of phosphoproteins is universally        catalyzed by protein phosphatases that are classified into        two major functional groups protein tyrosine phosphatase        PTP and protein serinethreonine phosphatase PP        although enzymes with various degrees of dualspecificity        are also encountered         The majority of        SerThr phosphatases belong to three classical groups        namely PP PPA and PPB calcineurin and possess        similar primary structures in their catalytic cores              PP in particular exhibits an extremely high degree        of sequence conservation through evolution and its        orthologs and isoforms are found in all eukaryotic cells             In various organisms PP regulates such diverse        cellular processes as cell cycle progression protein        synthesis carbohydrate metabolism transcription and        neuronal signaling      underscoring its profound        importance in biology The PP and PPA phosphatases are        differentially affected by natural toxins such as okadaic        acid OA and microcystinLR For example the        characteristic IC          values for OA fall in the range        PPA  nM PP  nM whereas PPB is highly        resistant to both       In contrast tautomycin        affects PP and PPA nearly equally but fails to inhibit        other phosphatases            In the past few years a number of phosphatase        activities and putative sequences have been reported in         P falciparum     These include a        PPA     a PPBlike activity     a unique        chimeric PPC     two putative sexualstage        phosphatases  PP    and PP     and a        tetratricopeptide repeatcontaining phosphatase PP            Preliminary studies revealed the presence of a protein        phosphatase activity in crude extracts of RBCgrown         P falciparum that exhibited        toxinsensitivity resembling that of PP            Uninfected RBC in contrast possessed mainly a PPAlike        activity Because of its potential importance in a variety        of signalling pathways of the parasite we have turned our        attention to defining the PP phosphatase and its        regulation in         P falciparum         In this communication we report the exact sequence of a        PP cDNA in         P falciparum  the corresponding        gene sequence in         P falciparum chromosome  the        enzymatic properties of the recombinant enzyme and its        inhibition by mammalian physiological PPinhibitors        namely inhibitor I and inhibitor I        Posttranscriptional gene silencing using synthetic short        interfering RNA siRNA molecules has been recently used to        ablate specific mRNAs and thus produce phenotypic        mutations in specific genes      We have adopted        this technology to knockdown specific gene products in RNA        viruses that are obligatory intracellular parasites            In the present study we have successfully used a similar        strategy to generate phenotypic PPdeficient         P falciparum parasites                    Results and Discussion                  Identification of the PfPP cDNA sequence          Various pairs of oligodeoxynucleotide primers were          designed on the basis of the PlasmoDBpredicted mRNA          sequence Gene chrphat and employed in reverse          transcriptionPCR RTPCR amplification using PfD          total mRNA as template Based on the prediction primers          ATGGCATTAGAAATAGATATAGATAATG primer A in Fig  the          start codon in bold and TTATTTCCGACAAAAAGAAATATATGG          were first tested but no product was obtained Since          there was no other ATG within a reasonable distance          upstream that was in the same reading frame we proceeded          on the assumption that the end of the mRNA might be          different Thus the second primer was replaced by a          series of nested primers based on the genomic sequence          each of which was paired with primer A in RTPCR The          combination of primer A and the primer          TTTTTTAATTTGCTGCTTTCTTTTTTTCC Fig  eventually          produced a RTPCR product that was cloned into pGEMT          vector and sequenced The cDNA sequence contained a          nucleotide long open reading frame corresponding to a          polypeptide  amino acid in length and ending with a          TAA stop codon          Comparison of the cDNA sequence with the genomic          sequence in Chromosome  at TIGR revealed that the          coding sequence is divided into five exons of which the          first two are the largest and contain most of the          catalytic core of the phosphatase Fig and  The          intron sequences are pronouncedly more ATrich than          exons and contained homopolymeric repeats a feature          which in our experience is common in           Plasmodium genes          BLAST analysis of the predicted primary structure of          the protein revealed its clear identity with the PP          class Fig  It is to be mentioned that among all the          SerThr phosphatases PP has been subjected to the most          extensive structurefunction analysis                     In fact it was one of the first phosphatases          for which the threedimensional structure was solved               A representative alignment in Fig demonstrates          the high sequence conservation between the human and           Plasmodium PP sequences The          catalytic core of all members of the PP and PP families          are very conserved and roughly corresponds to residues           of PfPP Fig  This region contains all the          signature motifs and conserved residues that have been          shown to be important for the fundamental steps of          catalysis including substrate binding metal ion          coordination and interaction with the phosphate group                 It is to be noted that at  amino acid          residues PfPP is the shortest PP known to date and          lacks a short prolinerich stretch at the Cterminal end          Fig                           Expression and catalytic properties of PfPP          In order to characterize the PfPP cDNA we subcloned          it into pETb such that the protein is expressed with          an Nterminal His            tag As shown in Fig  a protein          band of approximately  Mr was produced from the          pETbPfPP clone which is in agreement with the          predicted molecular weight of  of PfPP and roughly          another  added for the His            region of pETb Novagen Madison          WI The protein specifically reacted with a monoclonal          antiHis antibody and also with a polyclonal antibody          against fulllength human PP Transduction Laboratories          Lexington KY The recombinant protein was purified          through nickelchelation chromatography and tested for          phosphatase activity It dephosphorylated the small          substrate           p NPP as well as histone labelled          at Ser residues Interestingly it also showed decent          activity on a Tyrphosphorylated synthetic peptide The V                    max values mol Pi liberated  mg          enzyme min against these three substrates pNPP          phosphoserinehistone phosphotyrosine peptide were          respectively     and   An equivalent          protein fraction obtained from           E coli containing vector alone          without insert showed no activity against any of these          substrates It has been recently shown that rabbit PP          expressed in           E coli  also possessed Tyr          phosphatase activity In contrast native PP isolated          from rabbit muscle or expressed in Sf insect cells          contained only SerThr phosphatase activity but no Tyr          phosphatase activity     It was concluded that this          apparent difference might be due to subtle changes in          protein folding in eukaryotic versus prokaryotic cellular          environments It remains to be seen whether this is a          general feature of all PP          To obtain biochemical evidence for the identity of the          recombinant PfPP we tested the effect of specific          phosphatase inhibitors and selected mutations on the          phosphatase activity Mutation of Asn to Asp by          sitedirected mutagenesis destroyed the phosphatase          activity confirming the essential role of this residue          of PP in catalysis     PfPP was inhibited by NaF          inorganic orthophosphate and pyrophosphate at respective          IC            values of  mM  mM and  M          data not shown Similar values were recently obtained          for           Arabidopsis PP     PfPP was          also inhibited by tautomycin I I and OA with IC            values of    and  nM          respectively Fig  These values are comparable to          those obtained with various PP isoforms recombinantly          expressed in           E coli      The sensitivity          of PfPP to these natural toxins is consistent with the          fact that the loop sequence between the  and           regions plays a direct role in binding these toxins               and this sequence is entirely conserved in PfPP          Fig  Recently a few additional residues that are          closer to the Nterminus in the PP sequence have also          been shown to be important in the interaction with I              in PfPP numbers these residues are E E          and D E K Fig  In yeast PP Glcp the          double mutant EAEA and the triple mutant          DAEAKA showed IC            values for I that were          respectively  and  times the wild type enzyme values              As shown in Fig  a similar loss of inhibition          by I was also observed when the corresponding mutations          were introduced into PfPP although they did not affect          the catalytic activity specific activity data not          shown Together these results provide experimental          confirmation of the catalytic identity of PfPP                          Expression of native PfPP          As mentioned earlier inhibition studies using OA and          calyculin A suggested the existence of a PPlike          activity in           P falciparum extracts              However our attempts to purify the native PfPP enzyme          by chromatographic procedures resulted in only small          amounts of activity probably due to rapid inactivation          during fractionation To determine if PfPP is expressed          in           Plasmodium  we have therefore          taken an immunological approach First cellfree          extracts of different erythrocytic stages of           P falciparum were subjected to          Western blot using a monoclonal antibody that was raised          against nearly fulllength human PP and showed a broad          species specificity see Materials and Methods As shown          in Fig A a major band of the expected size of  k was          observed in all stages including gametes A peptide          antibody specific for human PP Materials and Methods          did not detect the band The gametogenesis was confirmed          by the appearance of Pfg an early gametespecific          protein     Having demonstrated that the monoclonal          antibody was specific for PP we used it in an attempt          to inhibit PfPP activity           in vitro  At optimal          concentrations the antibody almost completely inhibited           inhibition recombinant PfPP including its Tyr          phosphatase activity and also inhibited the phosphatase          activity of the           P falciparum extract by about           data not shown Under the same conditions the          humanspecific antibody had no effect Finally it has          been shown that affinity resins containing immobilized          microcystin specifically bind toxinsensitive          phosphatases such as PP and PPA     Thus we          passed soluble cytosolic Pf extract through          microcystinSepharose and the bound proteins were          analyzed on SDSPAGE followed by immunoblot using the          antiPP antibody The blot revealed that the  kDa          PfPP polypeptide indeed specifically bound to          microcystin Fig B correlating the antigenic          reactivity of PfPP with its affinity for the toxin          Preincubation of the extract with microcystin          specifically prevented binding of PfPP to the          column                          Generation of phenotypic PfPP mutants by PTGS          using RNAi          RNA interference RNAi mediated by short interfering          doublestranded RNA molecules siRNA or dsRNA is now          recognized as a major mechanism of posttranscriptional          gene silencing PTGS in essentially all eukaryotes              Recently the technique has been successfully applied          to cultured mammalian cells whereby introduction of          nucleotide long synthetic dsRNA molecules          corresponding to specific mRNA sequences effectively and          specifically degraded the cognate mRNAs and abrogated the          expression of the corresponding proteins      This          prompted us to test a similar approach to knockdown PfPP          function in the erythrocytic           P falciparum stages Our initial          attempts with standardized transfection procedures using          OligofectAMINE Life Technologies Bethesda MD with the          dsRNA did not produce an appreciable loss of PfPP We          then resorted to the electroporation procedure originally          developed for DNA transfection in           Plasmodium by Wellems and          coworkers     as detailed under Materials and          Methods A representative set of results shown in Fig          clearly demonstrates loss of PfPP by the RNAi          procedure while the control PPA was not significantly          affected Loss of PfPP resulted in concomitant          inhibition of parasite growth as evidenced by the drastic          reduction in Hhypoxanthine incorporation These results          suggest that PfPP plays an essential role in           Plasmodium replication The facts          that the parasite culture was asynchronous ie          contained all three major stages ring trophozoite and          schizont data not shown and that the effect of dsRNA          was severe suggest that PfPP is required for cell cycle          progression at all stages of the parasite This is          further supported by the expression of PP protein in all          the parasitic stages Fig  Taken together this is          consistent with the established role of PP in eukaryotic          DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression as discussed          below          PP is one of the major protein phosphatases found in          all eukaryotic cells The activity of the catalytic          subunit of PP is controlled by its interaction with a          large number of regulatory subunits many of which also          target it to specific subcellular compartments                The major ones include the glycogentargeting          subunits G           M  G           L      myofibrillartargeting          subunit M                 nuclear inhibitor of          PP NIPP     PP nuclear targeting subunit          PNUTS      mitosisregulating subunit Sds                ribosomal protein L    and small cytosolic          inhibitory proteins I I and DARRP Dopamine and          cAMPregulated phosphoprotein Mr                 The physiological role of many of these interactions has          been revealed in recent studies A temperaturesensitive          mutant of the yeast PP Glc for example exhibits a          block in the M phase of the cell division cycle and          elevated expression of Sds suppresses this defect              Structurefunction analysis of recombinant mammalian          PP has recently begun to map specific residues involved          in interaction with other molecules Interestingly all          these residues are conserved in PfPP and a few examples          are presented here Cocrystal structure of PP and a G           M peptide     as well as          mutagenesis studies    of the yeast PP ortholog          Glc have demonstrated a role of specific PP residues          in PPG           M interaction In the PfPP sequence          these residues are I L F L C and          F Fig  As mentioned the loop region          important in interaction with natural toxins     is          fully conserved in PfPP Fig  Two residues recently          shown to be important for interaction with DARPP              are also conserved in PfPP these are Met and          Cys Fig  We have provided experimental evidence          of an important role of a number of invariant residues of          PfPP in the interaction with I Fig and  Based on          such overwhelming conservation of functionally important          residues we propose that orthologs of many of these          PPinteracting proteins may also exist in           Plasmodium and function in similar          roles The use of recombinant PfPP and proteinprotein          interaction techniques should aid in characterizing these          physiological regulatory subunits of PfPP Our ability          to generate PPdeficient           P falciparum parasites will allow          us to study the mutant phenotype in further detail and          understand the role of this highly conserved phosphatase          in malarial biochemistry and pathophysiology These          studies are in progress          As mentioned earlier Li and Baker    described a          putative phosphatase DNA sequence in           Plasmodium  the mRNA of which was          detected in the sexual stages of the parasite The          predicted protein named PP was  amino acid long          and contained a unique Nterminal extension of about           amino acids The Cterminal  amino acids containing          the putative catalytic domain had  unique peptide          stretches that were called inserts When these inserts          were omitted from the alignment the rest of the sequence          showed significant similarity with PP phosphatases              Clearly further studies are needed to identify the          PP protein and characterize its potentially interesting          identity          While our manuscript was being written McRobert and          McConkey    achieved similar success in using the          RNAi strategy to ablate dihydroorotate dehydrogenase          DHODH of           P falciparum  Although the          protein level was not directly monitored the loss of          DHODH mRNA was confirmed by RTPCR This resulted in          inhibition of parasite growth consistent with the role          of DHODH in pyrimidine biosynthesis essential for          parasite DNA replication These authors introduced the          doublestranded RNA by electroporation also using          conditions very similar to ours Thus although the exact          mechanism of the RNA uptake remains to be elucidated the          electroporation procedure must have allowed the dsRNA to          traverse the various erythrocytic and parasitic membranes          to enter the parasitic cells          The success in ablating PfPP is particularly          gratifying to us on a number of accounts As mentioned          PP is a highly conserved enzyme and toxinsensitive          SerThr phosphatase activities are also found in          erythrocytes     Thus use of PP inhibitors such          as okadaic acid or tautomycin Fig  would affect the          parasite as well as the host making conclusions          difficult The dsRNA in contrast is known to be          extremely specific for its intended target such that a          single nucleotide mismatch prevents its action              This has allowed us to create specific phenotypic loss of          PfPP Moreover RNAi will permit the ablation of          essential gene products at any time point in infection          or on a desired parasitic stage following          synchronization Lastly traditional genetic manipulation          in eukaryotes including the           Apicomplexa is a relatively          difficult and elaborate procedure      Thus we          believe that the RNAi strategy will become a powerful and          convenient tool in           Plasmodium functional genomics          particularly in the studies of phylogenetically conserved          signalling molecules                            Conclusion                P falciparum contains a PP protein        phosphatase that is virtually identical to its orthologs in        other species in both sequence and biochemical properties        Based on the established physiological role of PP in other        organisms such as mammals and yeast PfPP may regulate a        variety of parasitic pathways including glycogen        metabolism glucose repression and cell cycle progression        Indeed the successful use of RNA interference to ablate        PfPP confirms its essential role on parasitic growth The        catalytic subunit of PfPP is expressed in all the        erythrocytic stages of the parasite and is specifically        inhibited by mammalian physiological inhibitors        inhibitor and inhibitor Thus an indepth study of        PfPP and its interacting subunits may shed light on the        regulation of the relevant pathways in this clinically        important family of parasites                    Materials and methods                  Materials          Histone and the catalytic subunit of PKA were

Okadaic acid OA and recombinant          I    were kind gifts from R Honkanen and S          Shenolikar Duke University respectively The          monoclonal antiPP antibody was raised against a           kDa fragment of human PP residue  and was          purchased from Transduction Laboratories Lexington KY          This antibody reacts with all mammalian and avian PP          tested but does not react with other PP classes The          other PP antibody a kind gift from R Honkanen was          specific for human PP and was raised in rabbit against          a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last  residues          of human PP PITPPRNSAKAKK Fig  The antiPfPPA          antibody was raised in rabbit against the peptide          MLIFKDTPDSRNSIKN corresponding to residue  of the

from Upstate Biotechnology Inc Lake          Placid NY                          Amplification cloning and mutagenesis of PfPP          cDNA          Total RNA was isolated from asynchronous
