theres a person she sobsFor two hours Lewinsky bares her soul to Walters and the world Beneath aflimsy undergarment of professed remorse she exposes a psyche built onblameshifting selfinterest and moral indifference                            Its not myfault Lewinsky delivers her canned message in the interviews openingseconds I waited a long time to be able to express to the country how verysorry I am for my part in this past years ordeal  I wouldnt dream ofasking Chelsea and Mrs Clinton to forgive me But I would ask them to knowthat I am very sorry for what happened and for what theyve been through Asthe interview progresses however Lewinsky defines her part in the fiasconarrowly leaving others to account for what happened When Walters askswhether she takes responsibility for the affair Lewinsky answers Notcomplete responsibility Later Lewinsky speculates that Clinton cameto her for a sense of normalcy Walters reasonably inquires Cant you getthat from your wife Lewinsky bats the question aside Thats something forhim to answer not me she says             Its just a disease Lewinsky calls theaffair a mistake but frames the mistake in terms of technical error andemotional imbalance rather than moral failure She refers constantly toselfesteem and antidepressant medication When asked why she has had affairswith married men she explains I didnt have enough feelings of selfworthWhat lesson does she draw from her mistakes I have a lot of healing to doshe concludes Blaming her excesses on a chemical defect allows her to feelgood about her seductive inclinations When asked whether her behavior withClinton was out of control she concedes I needed help I needed to be onsome sort of antidepressant But she rephrases the question in flatteringterms For someone like me whos a very passionate loving woman I think youoften get close to that line                            Its all aboutme Walters asks Lewinsky about the May  conversation in whichClinton told her they had to end their affair because it was not right in theeyes of God Lewinsky conveys no interest in this moral appraisal Insteadshe reflects on her own needs I was heartbroken she recalls It hurtsLater Walters asks about Clintons refusal to have intercourse with her Ifelt it was unfair to me  Lewinsky pleads that I would never knowwhat it was like to be that intimate with him As for the episode in whichLewinsky exploded in jealousy over Clintons meeting with journalist EleanorMondale Lewinsky explains I dont know that people can understand  howconfusing it would be for me to on the one hand have someone saying things toyouI promise this I promise that I care about you I dont want to hurtyou I want to take care of youand then the actions are something different Its pretty tough emotionally She delivers this speech without a trace ofirony             Its about loyalty Lewinsky emphasizesat the outset that shes very loyal She says she trusted her friends tokeep silent about her affair and feels violated and betrayed by Linda TrippWhy did she give Kenneth Starr the stained dress that was in her mothersapartment Because to do otherwise would have violated her immunity agreementshe explains and I needed to take care of myself and my family Toward theend of the interview Walters asks Have you learned anything from thisexperience Ive learned how important family is Lewinsky replies I havelearned the true meaning of friendship                            Its none ofyour business From the time I was  years old Lewinsky recallswith a smile one of my first phrases was You are not the boss ofme  And Ive been that way ever since When Walters suggests thatWhite House aides were right to keep Lewinsky away from Clinton Lewinskydefiantly retorts I dont think so I dont think that my relationship hurtthe job he was doing It didnt hurt the work I was doing It was betweenus  And I dont think it was their business             Its OK if you dont get caught Waltersasks Lewinsky about her phone sex with Clinton Its fun  the youngerwoman giggles Did you ever think about Hillary Clinton Walters inquires Idid says Lewinsky But I never thought shed find out In the interviewsfinal seconds Walters asks If you had it to do all over again would youhave the relationship with Bill Clinton Lewinsky reflects on what she haslearned There are some days that I regret that the relationship everstarted she says still grinning And there are some days that I just regretthat I ever confided in Linda Tripp            ABCs preinterview hype depicted Lewinsky as asmitten deluded romantic She thought Clinton was her soul mate went thisspin whereas he was actually a reckless ruthless narcissist What theinterview actually suggests however is that both perceptions are true Theman Lewinsky seduced was scheming shameless and incapable of acceptingresponsibility for his conduct And in her he met his match
