                    Background        Many authors       have compared the statistical        power of different methods for quantitative trait locus        QTL mapping These comparisons have shown that the        additional information supplied by the genetic distance        between identifiable DNA markers unconfounds the QTL effect        from the QTL location thus making two marker models more        powerful than single marker models of detection for review        see Doerge         et al             With the goal of detecting andor locating QTL there        are two common statistical approaches that can be taken        The first approach is based on ANOVA or simple linear        regression and performs statistical tests based solely on        single DNA marker information No genetic map is required        for single marker analysis and the calculations are based        on phenotypic means and variances within each of the        genotypic classes The second and more involved approach        is based on two DNA markers the estimated recombination        fraction between them or the estimated genetic distance        and either a maximum likelihood based calculation or a        regression model including multiple two or more markers        as independent variables The linear ordering of multiple        DNA markers based upon their estimated relationships          ie  recombination fraction or        genetic distance supplies the framework or genetic map        for composite interval mapping     and as such        unconfounds the QTL effect and the QTL location thus        providing a more precise means for detecting and locating        QTL with respect to the estimated genetic map for the        organism under investigation        Reba         et al    present a comprehensive        comparison of the statistical power for many of the        commonly used flanking marker or two marker methods        employed and conclude that two marker mapping provides a        relatively small gain  in power over single marker        methods when the two markers define an interval of width        less than  cM but a substantial increase greater than         in power for intervals upwards of  cM indicating        that the gain in power may come from the addition of the        second marker to the analysis or the addition of        information from that marker rather than the map        Using the findings of Reba         et al     and others as our        motivation we hypothesize that the power increase between        single marker and two marker regression methods is due to        additional genotypic information in the second marker In        order to assess this similar test statistics should be        compared A comparison of maximum likelihood interval        mapping to single marker ANOVA is complicated because of        the differences that may be observed due to differences        between regression and maximum likelihood     as well        as differences in marker information In order to avoid        this complication we consider two regression based        approaches that differ only in the number of markers        included in the initial model ie the statistical        methodology is the same the models are different First        a set of compound hypotheses are defined for use with a        single marker analysis and used to define an intersection        test We then state the equivalent hypotheses for a        regression based two marker model for a test of the        interval Last we compare via simulation the power of the        intersection and the two marker test under the stated        hypotheses for each model We do not consider the case of        multiple QTL in a single interval as this case was not        considered by Reba         et al     These two approaches        are then applied to a backcross population of         Drosophila with  informative        markers    to detect QTL associated with ovariole        number                    Results                  Simulations          An overview of the simulations performed is given in          Table and  For the purpose of evaluating the relative          difference in statistical power between the intersection          test and the two marker test the estimated statistical          power of the two marker test was subtracted from that of          the intersection test for each of the parameter          combinations investigated and a           t test    was performed to test          the null hypothesis that the mean difference in power was          zero          For the binomial phenotype with a backcross design          sample size of  the  parameter combinations          examined resulted in  showing no difference in          statistical power between the intersection test and the          two marker test            ie  the value of the difference          was exactly zero  favoring the intersection test and           favoring the two marker test The intersection test          was more powerful with a mean difference in power of           and the           t test of the null hypothesis that          the difference in power was zero was rejected            p   When           n was equal to  the           parameter combinations examined yielded  showing there          was no difference in statistical power  parameter          combinations indicated the intersection test as more          powerful and  indicated the two marker test as more          powerful The mean difference in power was  and the                    t test of the null hypothesis that          the difference in power was zero was rejected            p   The test of the null          hypothesis that the mean difference between the          intersection and two marker was zero was rejected for          both sets of simulations The estimated difference          between the two approaches was positive indicating that          the intersection test has slightly higher power than the          two marker test in these cases          We also investigated           F            experimental populations for a          binomial phenotype using a sample size of  From the           parameter combinations investigated  failed to          converge consistently for the two marker model due to          singularity in the design matrix The remaining           parameter combinations showed  as having no difference          in statistical power while the remaining  favored the          intersection test Results similar to those found in the          initial simulations indicate that the intersection test          performs as well as or better than the two marker test          Comparisons with smaller sample sizes n   were not          conducted because of convergence problems using the two          marker model          For a normally distributed phenotype  parameter          combinations for the backcross were examined From these           showed no difference in statistical power           scenarios favored the intersection test while           indicated the two marker test as more powerful The mean          difference in power was  and we failed to reject          the test of the null hypothesis that the difference was          zero           p            Upon investigation of the parameter combinations that          showed some difference in power specifically for the          scenario highlighted by Reba           et al    QTL in the middle of          the interval with a large distance between markers we          also find the two marker approach to be slightly more          powerful than the intersection test However when the          distance between the QTL and one marker is much smaller          than the distance between the QTL and the second marker          the intersection test is more powerful Although we can          point to these cases it is important to realize that for          most of the scenarios no difference in power was observed          see Figure                           DrosophilaAnalysis          Ovariole number is related to reproductive success in           Drosophila melanogaster and          positively correlated with maximum daily female fecundity               The  RILs recombinant inbred lines for          this study were scored for the trait ovariole number and          genotyped as described in Wayne           et al              For the  marker pairs considered  markers were          found to be significant using both the intersection test          and the two marker test and  were found to be          nonsignificant with both tests The intersection and two          marker tests were concordant in  of the  pairs of          markers Table  The estimated chance corrected          agreement Kappa coefficient was  with a           confidence interval of  McNemars test showed          no systematic difference in the two approaches            S             p            Overlapping regions on chromosome            were identified by the          intersection test the two marker test and the interval          mapping test Table  On chromosome             the two marker test identified          a region between           E and           D while the comparable          intersection test showed borderline significance for one          marker in that region            F  p   On chromosome             the two marker test identified          a region from           BC while intersection tests          identified a smaller region from           BE and the interval mapping          identified a region from           AC  On Chromosome            the two marker test identifies          two regions           AF and           FA while the intersection          test finds the entire region from           AA significant The interval          mapping agrees with the intersection test for interval           AA and finds it significant          while it agrees with the two marker test for the interval                    DF and does not find this          interval significant Chromosome            was not associated with the trait          for any test          The application of the intersection test to these data          can be further expanded to include an analysis with all           markers We conducted  single marker regression          tests at a Bonferroni adjusted  of     Markers           B E D A D A B          E and           A were significant using this          intersection test see Figure  The regions identified          are consistent with a regressionbased interval mapping          analysis                            Discussion        The findings of Reba         et al    show differences in the        statistical power of the two marker methods          ie  interval mapping over single        marker tests          eg  ANOVA         t test only when the markers are        more than cM apart suggesting that these differences may        be due to the addition of information in the second marker        Our simulation study supports this hypothesis        The application of an intersection test uses information        from both markers and tests the same null hypotheses as        the two marker test The use of the intersection test takes        advantage of the additional genotypic information provided        in the second marker        While compound hypotheses are common in statistical        theory and typically seen in the use of unionintersection        tests their use in the quantitative genetics arena and QTL        application is relatively novel Furthermore the        intersection test is simple to implement the expansion to        multiple markers is straightforward and uses all available        marker information In a framework map where markers are        unlinked the intersection test is simply the single marker        analysis with a Bonferroni correction for the significance        level In cases where markers are correlated the        application of the Bonferroni correction will be overly        conservative This correction guarantees that the nominal         is not exceeded but is well known to be overly        conservative in cases where tests are not independent In        this case the application of the intersection test will        require an alternative correction in order to achieve        maximum power        We demonstrate situations for a pair of adjacent markers        where the power of the intersection test is equal to or        greater than the power of the two marker test In the case        highlighted by Reba         et al     markers more than         cM apart and large effect size we also find that the two        marker test has higher power than the intersection test A        counter example is when one marker is much closer to the        QTL than the other marker in this case the intersection        test is more powerful Overall the power of the two        approaches is nearly identical and differences between them        small        In the         Drosophila reanalysis both methods        identify the same general regions However six marker        pairs were found to be significant using the two marker        tests that were not identified using the intersection test        Using the map and notation defined by Nuzhdin         et al    they were Chromosome          pairs         EF FD ED Chromosome          pairs         EA AE  and         EC  The         p values for the  marker pairs from        the intersection tests were small but did not exceed the        Bonferroni corrected significance level see Table  The        above markers that contribute to these marker pairs are        linked indicating that the Bonferroni correction may be        overly conservative        In contrast three marker pairs on Chromosome          were significant using the        intersection tests but were not significant using the two        marker tests         AD FE  and         AF Table  In these cases the        internal marker of the pair is giving signal while the        outer marker does not This provides an interesting point        of discussion We could say that marker         D appears to be associated with        ovariole number but we do not know if the QTL lies to the        left or right of this marker Just because marker         A does not appear to be        significantly associated with ovariole number we can not        infer that the region to the left of         D does not contain the gene of        interest        In some cases the two marker test results in a larger        region than the intersection test while in others the        reverse is true QTL mapping is usually a first attempt to        locate genes which the biologist uses to identify all        possible regions of interest eg is willing to accept        type I error We have discussed different ways to detect        underlying QTL and an approach for maximizing or minimizing        the potential region containing the QTL It is also        possible to estimate the QTL position directly Estimates        can be obtained using a variety of techniques and the        different possible approaches to estimation are reviewed in        Doerge         et al    and Kao     However        even when the position is estimated a confidence interval        will exist defining the size of the region to be included        for further study Different approaches will result in        regions of different sizes with more or fewer markers        included The differences in the size of the regions are        potentially important to a biologist who relies on QTL        mapping analyses to determine regions for further study        Most biologists accept that current QTL mapping methods are        best used for identifying broad regions which subsequently        can be dissected with more precise genetical techniques        The question is then what region should be advanced to        fine mapping experiments The investigator may choose to        take only the regions which are significant in both        intersection and multiple marker approaches or she may        choose to carry forward any marker that shows a positive        result according to at least one analysis We recommend        that experimentalists perform both a single marker analysis        with an intersection test and a multiple marker analysis        and use the information available in both analyses to guide        their decisions about what regions to carry forward for        further study                    Conclusion        We find that the intersection test has equal or greater        power compared to the two marker equivalent Our analyses        were conducted using the Bonferroni correction for the        intersection test When markers are linked as in many of        our simulations this correction is overly conservative If        the intersection test is used in conjunction with a more        appropriate correction the performance of the intersection        test would improve perhaps even surpassing the two marker        equivalent in more cases Thus our motivation and hope in        presenting this investigation of the statistical power of        intersection tests versus two marker tests is to make clear        the compound framework and resulting evidence under which        intersection tests are indeed equal to andor more powerful        than the complicated procedures based on two marker        models                    Materials                  Statistical Framework          As the framework for our comparison and in          conjunction with the previous simulations and conclusions          provided by the work of Reba           et al     we consider a          backcross experimental design originating from a cross of          two homozygous inbred lines differing in the trait of          interest and producing heterozygous lines that are          backcrossed to one of the initial homozygous parental          lines We examine both normal and binomial phenotypic          distributions In general we denote each marker as           M                       M                       k             where           k is the number of markers being          examined and allow each marker to have two alleles           M                       M                       M                     k             M                     k   The            k phenotypic means are          differentiated via subscripts eg                      M                       M           k            M                       M           k  or                      M                       M           k            M                       M           k   and the frequencies of these          classes are denoted as           p

     A simple linear regression backcross model is employed          for single marker QTL detection                    Y                       j                                                X

         j  is an indicator variable          that denotes the state of a particular marker             is the overall mean and             is the effect of an allelic          substitution at the marker Ideally if the marker and          QTL are completely linked the effect of an allelic          substitution is the effect of the QTL If           k markers are considered          independently           k linear regression models can be          considered            ie  one for each marker           M                       M                       M                       k             by denoting the allelic substitution associated          with marker           M                       i            as                                     i             for           i             k  For           k   markers we denote the          allelic substitution associated with marker           M            as                           where                                   M                       M             and                                   M                       M                                   M                       M              and the allelic substitution          associated with marker           M            as                           where                                   M                       M             and                                   M                       M                                   M                       M                       A compound hypothesis testing the effect of an allelic          substitution at either or both of these two independent          markers is                    Rejection of this compound null hypothesis indicates          an association between a QTL and either or both of the          markers           M            and           M             hence the term intersection test          From a statistical perspective the relative position of          the two markers is irrelevant However to compare this          to a two marker model there is an implicit assumption          that the markers considered form an interval or are          adjacent to one another This marks a departure from the          traditional single marker analysis where no consideration          to marker order is given To define an overall level           test the significance level  must be adjusted for the          individual tests to account for multiple testing There          are many ways to account for multiple testing Assuming          the markers are independent the Bonferroni correction          can be applied     The Bonferroni correction is          conservative for the intersection test and the lack of          independence between markers would tend to make it more          difficult for the intersection test to reject          More generally for           k markers the compound hypothesis          testing the effect of an allelic substitution at any of          the independent markers           M                       M                       k            is                              Rejection of this compound null hypothesis indicates          an association between a QTL and at least one of the          markers           M                       M                       k             To define an overall level  test using a          Bonferroni correction     each             is tested at an adjusted          significance level of  An association between a QTL and          a marker is then indicated when the individual single          marker test rejects the null at the adjusted  level          The practical result of the application of an          intersection test is the simplicity of calculation of          the single marker test statistic with a correction for          multiple testing                          Two Marker Regression Model and Test of the          Corresponding Interval          Extending the backcross notation defined previously          a multiple linear regression model based on two markers          can be employed for QTL detection purposes The model is          defined as                    Y                       j                                                X                      j                         X                      j                         X                      j                          j                       j             n           where           X                      j  and           X                      j  are the genotypic states of          the respective markers           M            and           M             along with their respective          allelic substitution effects                           and           X                      j  is the combined genotypic          states of markers           M            and           M            with allelic substitutions at both          markers           M            and           M            having effect              Interestingly to note when one is          selectively genotyping the information in             is maximized          In other words                    Based upon this two marker model with four parameters          the hypothesis employed to perform a level  test for          association between a trait and the marker loci           M            and           M            is the test of             where                    The null hypothesis for this test is that there is no          association between either marker            M            or           M             and the trait A similar set of          hypotheses follow for an           F            experimental design          This model parameterization differs from the least          squares interval mapping approach first introduced by          Knott and Haley     In the parameterization proposed          here only one test is performed for the pair of markers          In contrast the regression based interval mapping          approach     recalculates the value of the          independent variables for each putative position in the          interval Our two marker regression has a different          parameterization from Knott and Haley     We chose          the alternate parameterization in order to directly          compare the two marker model and the single marker model          In the Knott and Haley    parameterization flanking          markers are used to define the coefficients of the          regression as mean additive or dominance effects For           s steps along the interval between          two markers           M            and           M            values of           X are calculated according to the          conditional probability of a QTL in that location          The regression based interval mapping parameterization          thus provides a mechanism to test for additive and          dominance effects using tests of the regression          parameters In our parameterization the regression          coefficients are tests for detection Thus the two          parameterizations have different null hypotheses for the          tests of the regression coefficients and are not directly          comparable in terms of power We use the alternative          parameterization so that the interpretation of the tests          is comparable in the single marker and two marker          regression models and we can directly compare the power          of the two tests                          Simulations          Data were simulated for two marker backcross and           F            populations with binomial trait          distributions and two marker backcross populations with          normal trait distributions A total of  parameter          combinations were examined Table  For each          combination of parameters  data sets were simulated          Traits were simulated from a binomial distribution           Bin            n            p  where sample sizes           n   and

genotype          GT or the penetrance of the trait for the specific          genotypes           Q                       Q                       Q                       Q             and           Q

under the normally distributed phenotype was          allowed to vary Table  under seventy five parameter          combinations The effect size is the difference in the          penetrances for binary traits and between the means          for normally distributed traits For each phenotypic          trait distribution and each parameter combination Table          and  we analyzed via least squares  simulated          data sets using both the single marker regression model          and the two marker regression model          For the intersection test the null hypothesis was          rejected when the empirical pvalue for either single          marker regression test statistic was less than            Bonferroni adjustment For the comparable two marker          test            ie

was evaluated from the           simulated data sets as the proportion of times the          empirical permutation           p values were less than the          specified  level                          DrosophilaAnalysis          The population of           Drosophila melanogaster used in our          analysis was a set of  RILs recombinant in lines          derived from a cross of two isogenic lines as described          in Wayne           et al     for the trait          ovariole number There were  informative markers on           chromosomes Markers used were the cytological map          positions of the insertion sites of           roo transposable element markers          with the exception of the fourth chromosome where a          visible mutation was used as a marker

         markers on             There was a centromeric break          in the genetic map for chromosome             such that there were           adjacent pairs  markers on the left arm and
