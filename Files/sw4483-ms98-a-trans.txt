            um anyway were supposed talk about recycling basically what what your personal opinion is on it uh this is this is really for a speech research project theyre doing so um i dont know Florida is pretty good about recycling isnt it   well they just kicked it off down here in in Sarasota county um   oh they did   they had been doing it they started first in Sarasota City um you know which makes up a pretty small portion of the county actually and um theyve got these i dont know what if youre familiar with Sarasota county at all   umhum yeah not quite no   theyve got these on its its county wide program now and what theyve done is theyve broken everything down into garbage uh yard trash   umhum uhhuh   plastic cans cans and glass   okay   and then uh paper   okay   which in the paper its just um newspaper and corrugated cardboard is the only thing youre supposed to put in there no slicks um   yeah okay oh thats thats good let me ask you this do they require you to presort it   yeah   okay see thats something in Minneapolis theyre really strict on in terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really you know tightly but when i lived in Orlando its like you could put almost anything in there and theyd just sort it out for you  it was really pretty good if youre lazy like i am so   umhum yeah yeah yeah right well you know um i talked to this girl who um shes a an  an acquaintance of mine and and shes involved with uh       oh what is the name of that company its not Amway but its the other big vitamin company Shaklee   oh okay yeah   okay and um and and shes just Shaklee crazy you know because its her business and everything and um         you know and she asked we were talking one day and and she asked me a couple of questions you know and she and and what she said that that generally the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one they dont want it to change their lifestyle and and like you know especially make it anymore complicated or any extra work or anything which thats thats what recycling at home sorting does you know i mean its a little extra work and uh   yeah right uhhuh   it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what they do what they do here in Sarasota county is theyve got   it can yeah   okay you put your garbage in a garbage bag and you set it out by the curb if you have yard trash you put your yard trash in some kind of container   right   um or you can have bundles up to a certain weight and certain certain dimensions tie them up and put them by the curb well the plastic cans and glass they give you this little tub and its about a foot and a half deep and its about one by one and a half foot wide and long   yeah you got to tie them up and everything and right   this is a little container and they have another one the same size that ones red and then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods   uhhuh uhhuh   and so like you know you would have to rinse out your pop cans otherwise you got bees and ants and you know and and if youve got uh food containers or anything like that its a big problem so not only do you   exactly it is you know big hassle   yeah   yeah thats true i mean up here they give you one one of those containers and you put everything in it   umhum   so its like if if you use a lot of stuff you its like well you know lets say if youre a partying kind of guy and you drink you know like a couple of twelve packs maybe over the weekend   umhum   its gonna be hard pressed to pressed to put all your recyclables in that one place you know so its kind of a pain in the butt   this is true this is true   but um i dont know thats definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just you know have have those garbage people that make how every many make twenty twenty or thirty bucks an hour have them do a little bit of the sorting   umhum   you know and and maybe come up with a better system make it a little more convenient but i   yeah theyve got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here um if you wanna have a nice garbage can you know and its on wheels and its big   yeah oh you can actually rent those   yeah   okay thats interesting yeah up here the the city provides them kind of like   yeah well i think in i think in the city they do but out here in the county you have to rent them   oh okay so   and they just add it on to your water bill or something   so where exactly are you in terms of of like Sarasota are you north of Sarasota or   east of Sarasota umhum   east okay and Sarasota is on the west coast   yeah   okay like south of Tampa right   yeah   okay im   yeah about an hour about an hour south of Tampa   yeah thats right okay   um  yeah well i i listen to this talk radio station down here and its its really they they i dont if you ever listen to talk radio but   um occasionally   those guys they just kind of get into to stewing stewing stewing up trouble you know with the callers and things like that but they get into some really good conversations sometimes you know and some of it sometimes its serious and they have some good feedback and all that stuff and   yeah yeah   so im listening to that i kind of got an idea that i thought would be good was and this kind of fits into the uh the aid program the welfare program thats going on right now   uhhuh   and its like um
