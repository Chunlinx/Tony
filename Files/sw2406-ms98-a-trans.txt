        okay movies ive i havent seen too many lately i have kids and we went and saw The Rescuers Down Under over the the break do do you have kids you take to movies or   uhhuh no no kids   yeah its a Walt Walt Disney movie   and it didnt get as you know as good a reviews as like the Little Mermaid the last one and got all kinds of Academy Awards and things last year but this one was i thought was excellent the i cant both   was that the animated version   yeah its animated and i cant believe how good theyre getting with their animation now its just just the special effects you know and in this movie this theres this boy and he rescues this uh bald eagle and uh and its a huge eagle you know wing span of twenty feet or something like that and the boy actually rides on his back and he rides through the clouds you know and you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out and it you know theyre flying all over with it and i mean i know there they there must have used been computers or something for animation this day but it was just so real realistic and lifelike and good animation what a good show   even better than Roger Rabbit insofar as animation   well Roger was a composite one theres one theres a movie ive seen Roger Rabbit thats not a recent movie   yeah   but uh i enjoyed that show   yeah that was made in a few i dont know several years back i guess   yeah yeah   latest latest one ive saw which was a mistake to go see was Lionheart had Claude Van Damme   uhhuh   he was hes of course uh i guess hes trained in this uh martial arts of some sort but the plot was bland the acting was bland It was just mostly centered upon his abilities to   chop them up huh   yeah chop them up exactly and     this is supposed to be the the guy thats uh replaces Bruce Lee or whatever or or the next Chuck Norris   yeah   type guy   or hes singular i guess you know you know how they can make any of any single one of them in a movie to be a super   uhhuh superstar   superstar of any sort you know but Chuck Norris of course could be just about equal if not more   uhhuh umhum   and all of them i guess could be in that fashion or category   hum uhhuh uhhuh   it was about uh a French Foreign Legion fellow   keeps trying   who deserts to go help his brothers wife who got who became a widow because he was selling drugs         and he got killed   really uplifting huh   so he deserts and goes to New York and he starts out by fighting to make money and then he moves on to L A to where that where she is to just help him out   umhum   it was really i mean the Hollywood really must think theres some real dummies out there or something i dont know     yeah i havent heard i hadnt heard much about that movie i other than it was a chop them up movie but uh well i guess thats one i wont go see     well it was worth the buck i guess   oh you went to the dollar movie yeah yeah they show up at the dollar movie right after they get come out you know theyre usually not not that great or didnt do that great anyway let me see let me see another movie i watched uh i want to see is uh that new one uh   a lot of   that won all those Academy Awards this year Dances With Wolves i havent seen that have you seen that one yet   uhhuh yeah   what what what   i i absorbed all of that movie in one sitting uh i guess what made it so good was the cinematography cinematography   the the wide open you know spaces   yeah and the music and uh well it had an excellent story line Everything about it was good   umhum   um i thought an excellent one too was misery with Kathy Bates and James Caan im not a James Caan fan but that was a well directed and acted movie   is that right   id recommend it Its a little on the violent side   uhhuh   but then what movie isnt anymore   right right yeah our movies today it used to be X and you know and PGs used to be Rs and seems like the rating system you know is kind of switching that way a little bit   well i have no objections to it Its just uh and its a matter of your taste uh   yeah yeah oh yeah its just that yeah its just that the rating system seems you know instead of having X now they have what NC seventeen   yeah   they just changed it because X had a connotation with it you know so   and even on those type they dont show what you expect   right a lot of those are really violent type movies     right   really gory um   yeah that seems to be the norm of most movies but   um   what the hey this is America   let me see let me see one movie i saw i guess it was a while back Red October have you seen that one   yeah yes i have that was pretty good   yeah i read the book before so i knew the story line going in but they changed some things in the movie wasnt the same i thought the book was better than the movie but i thought the movie was really good as well   i always wait for the movie i dont have time to read the book   yeah i dont i read about one or two thick novels like that a year   uhhuh   you know thats about all the time i can i can spare but that was a good show i thought you know i read about how they did uh an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine you know that wasnt a real submarine you saw in the water it was it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the Hollywood magic it all those underwater scenes   yeah   i thought you know it looked to me like it was a real submarine   they did me to   that was in the water you know   thats the magic of Hollywood special effects i hear this movie F X part two coming out is uh pretty good   yeah is that right   did you ever see the original one   i didnt   it was uh you ought to rent the uh F X part one It doesnt say part one but it its F slash X   huh whats that about   a uh special effects man who somehow gets involved in this um oh im not sure i cant remember Its been a while since ive seen it But he he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody and he has to go underground and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done   hm   and uh   to to fool people and and things huh   right and using makeup and using the   all the tricks   all the props and whatever to get to where he needs to go   uhhuh that sounds like an interesting concept   but you need to rent the first one first   to understand whats going on the second   uh if if that is that the second one follows the first i dont know if they have the uh original actors on that first one to that one   uhhuh theyre supposed to be coming out with all these Desert Storm movies   oh i expected those i mean Hollywood i mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there i think   this summer too yeah   yeah well they had some in some of those you know they i guess they retitled some movies that were going to be about Lebanese and and you know and   uhhuh   and Americans and they decide oh make it Iraqis and Americans you know and they just change the title and uh and reshot a few parts you know where they yeah you know where they could i guess they figured we wouldnt cant tell the difference between an   actual names will not be used   yeah right           eventually im sure they will come out with the the the proper names   yeah right it was such a it i guess they theyll probably come out with a lot of movies you know it was it was such a rout though you know i dont know you know they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or   latest story   or about or about those two newsmen or whatever that got captured   uhhuh Kevin Costner i understand is supposed to be play Schwartzkopf supposedly     is that right   i dont know thats just one of the many rumors that floats around     yeah   or what you read   umhum well i think weve probably   pretty much used up the tape i guess   yeah yeah its been about five minutes its been nice talking with you   same and uh well   keep on watching those movies huh     talk to you on the next go around   okay byebye   adios
