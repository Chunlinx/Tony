                    Background        Since their discovery in  multiallelic short tandem        repeat polymorphisms STRPs also called microsatellites        or simple sequence length polymorphisms SSLPs have been        the polymorphisms of choice for linkage mapping and many        other genetic studies        Although there are hundreds of thousands of reasonably        informative STRPs in the human genome      only a        small fraction are optimal for genotyping and genome scans        Optimal properties of an STRP include high heterozygosity        strong and specific PCR amplification capability to be        amplified simultaneously with other STRPs multiplexed        sharp bands on gels easy and accurate scoring of allele        sizes relatively low mutation rate and appropriate        position along the genetic map        We have performed human genome polymorphism scans in our        lab since      Our first human Screening Set of        STRPs developed in  had an average STRP spacing of         cM no sex chromosome STRPs and consisted almost entirely        of dinucleotide repeat STRPs identified at Marshfield Each        subsequent Screening Set from our lab improved on the        previous version by adding STRPs by using more accurate        genetic maps to make STRP spacing more uniform and to        eliminate large gaps and especially by replacing        relatively low quality STRPs with superior ones Typing        better STRPs leads to higher data quality through fewer        missing genotypes and fewer incorrect allele calls Typing        optimal STRPs also leads to lower genotyping costs by        providing more information by reducing the need for        duplicate genotyping by permitting the use of shorter gels        with lower resolving power but shorter run times and by        increasing the efficiency of allele calling        We have replaced nearly all of the dinucleotide repeat        STRPs in our Screening Sets with tri and tetranucleotide        STRPs Although dinucleotide STRPs are abundant and meet        many of the criteria for optimal STRPs they are also in        our hands more difficult to score accurately because of        substantial strand slippage during PCR     We also find        that dinucleotide STRPs are more difficult to PCR multiplex        than tri or tetranucleotide STRPs        Similarly we have eliminated nearly all of the STRPs        with frequent   noninteger alleles Noninteger        alleles are defined as have length differences from the        most frequent alleles which are other than integer        multiples of the repeat length For example an allele of         bp PCR product length would be a noninteger allele        for a tetranucleotide STRP with frequent alleles of           and  bp Noninteger alleles are not typing        artifacts as they have been observed in many labs and have        been confirmed by sequencing of individual alleles           httpwwwcstlnistgovbiotechstrbase Noninteger        alleles probably exist somewhere in the human population        for all or nearly all STRPs but a significant fraction of        STRPs do not have frequent noninteger alleles        We have also excluded or repaired STRPs with weak or        null alleles In at least most cases weak and null alleles        appear to be due to substitution polymorphisms within the        primer annealing sites     They can be repaired by        sliding the offending PCR primer to a nearby position along        the chromosome        For most applications of genome polymorphism scans        higher STRP densities are preferable This is particularly        important for gene mapping by association While analysts        have predicted that very high polymorphism densities will        be required for association mapping in mixed or outbred        populations see for example reference     promising        results have been obtained using genome scans of         STRPs in isolated populations where levels of linkage        disequilibrium are particularly high       In this        manuscript we describe the development of two new  cM        human STRP Screening Sets Sets  and  which when        combined provide average STRP spacing of  cM                    Results                  Building new human Screening Sets          Over about the last decade we have produced at          Marshfield twelve separate but related  cM Screening          Sets of STRPs for the human genome see Table and          httpresearchmarshfieldclinicorggenetics For each          of these Sets the lowest quality STRPs in the previous          Set were replaced with superior ones Of the most recent          collections Sets    and  were major overhauls          with  of the STRPs replaced Table  Sets  and           were described in the literature      Beginning          particularly with Set  many of the dinucleotide STRPs          were replaced with tri and tetranucleotide STRPs from          the Cooperative Human Linkage Center CHLC     CHLC          STRPs still comprise  and  of our current Sets          Sets  and  respectively Starting in about           the availability of the human genomic draft sequence          greatly expanded the number of STRPs from which to          choose Sets  and  contain  and  respectively          newly derived STRPs from the genomic sequence          We began the construction of Sets  and  with          specific goals For Set  and the very similar Set           we intended to replace all or nearly all dinucleotide          repeat polymorphisms and to eliminate other problematic          STRPs such as those with frequent noninteger alleles          For Set  and the preceding Set  we aimed to          identify one or two high quality tri or tetranucleotide          STRPs at approximately the midpoint between each pair of          STRPs within Set  Set  is therefore the second in a          new series of  cM Screening Sets For both Sets we          needed to identify new high quality STRPs within          specific relatively small  mb chromosomal          segments          Altogether we screened  STRPs for possible          inclusion within the Screening Sets Of these  were          STRPs developed within the CHLC or at Utah     The          remaining  were developed from human genomic          sequences Most of these  were identified by          searching for tri or tetranucleotide STRs with   or           uninterrupted repeats within the sequence assembly          available from the University of California  Santa Cruz          web site December  version          httpgenomecseucscedu Others  were identified          by examining a collection of  gb of overlapping BAC          sequences    for the presence of variable tri and          tetranucleotide STRs We focused efforts on AAT and AGAT          repeats because these sequences are known to be abundant          and to yield useful polymorphisms               New PCR primers selected from the sequences flanking          the tandem repeats were tested by amplification with ten          individual DNA samples and one DNA pool using          incorporation of a nucleotide tagged with a fluorescent          dye see Methods PCR primers labelled with a          fluorescent dye at the  end were then synthesized for          those STRPs which displayed   alleles in the first          screen These were combined with existing CHLC and Utah          STRPs and were used to screen  individuals and one          pool All donors of DNA samples used in these first two          screens had Northern European ancestry STRPs which          passed these first two hurdles were then used in genome          scans within the Mammalian Genotyping Service see          Marshfield web site using hundreds of DNA samples from          various geographical locations          Only  of the  genomic STR sequences that were          screened were included within Sets  and  The great          majority of excluded STRPs were rejected because of          limited numbers of alleles low informativeness About           were rejected because of the presence of frequent          noninteger alleles We found that use of candidate          genomic sequences with larger numbers of uninterrupted          tandem repeats and use of overlapping BAC sequences with          alleles which differed by           two or more repeats led to higher          rates of STRP inclusion into the Screening Sets          Information on all of the STRPs that we found to be          polymorphic can be obtained from the comprehensive list          of indel polymorphisms on the Marshfield web site          We also improved the amplification efficiency of          Screening Set STRPs Most of the human STRPs developed in          the early and mid s were based on relatively crude          singlepass sequencing of genomic DNA subclones          Comparison of the PCR primer sequences for Set  STRPs          with the new public genomic sequences revealed that a          surprisingly high  of the STRPs had mismatches in at          least one of the primers an example is shown in Figure           Nearly all of the mismatches were near the middle or           ends of the primers New primers designed using the          public genomic sequences were then tested side by side          with old primers At C annealing temperature and no          PCR multiplexing few differences were observed between          the old and new primer pairs but under more stringent          conditions C annealing temperatures  STRPs were          found to amplify better with the new primer pairs two          examples are shown in Figure           STRPs alleles are usually identified and labelled as          the length of the PCR product as measured on denaturing          polyacrylamide gels Only in a handful of cases have the          full spectrum of STRP alleles been sequenced Therefore          STRP alleles are referenced to allele sizes for standard          DNA templates we use the parents of CEPH family           available from the NIGMS Human Genetic Cell Repository          Allele sizes will also of course often change if the          PCR primer sequences for a polymorphism are altered To          avoid null and weak alleles to prevent the formation of          doublet bands during PCR      and to achieve          optimal PCR product length we have modified original          primer sequences for a substantial fraction of our          Screening Set STRPs We have used several different          letters following the STRP name to indicate changes in          PCR primers see Marshfield web site As two examples          for STRPs on chromosome  in Set  GATAGN indicates          that one of the original primers for GATAG was          changed to correct a sequencing error without change in          allele sizes and GGAAAZ indicates that one of the          primers for GGAAA was shifted along the chromosome          resulting in different allele sizes Current PCR primer          sequences for all Screening Set STRPs are listed on the          Marshfield web site along with allele sizes for          individuals  and                           Genetic Map Positions          Initially new STRPs were selected and incorporated          into our Screening Sets based on physical distances          obtained from the December  UCSanta Cruz draft          sequence assembly However we soon found that the draft          assembly contained many errors see for example reference              and resulted therefore in many STRPs being in          the wrong map positions To correct these mistakes we          utilized the most recent June  sequence assembly in          addition to linkage analysis using three large Sets of          families In all cases except one ptel the linkage          results matched the June  assembly in terms of STRP          order we assumed the linkage results were correct for          ptel Our confidence in STRP order is therefore          high          With one exception on chromosome p see below          genetic map positions for the Screening Set STRPs were          taken from the most recent Marshfield map    or by          interpolation using the Marshfield map and the genetic          and physical map positions described in the previous          paragraph Although the new Iceland genetic map    is          higher resolution than the Marshfield map a large          fraction  of the Screening Set  and  STRPs were          not typed in the Iceland families We did however check          STRP order for all STRPs that were typed in the Iceland          families and found no disagreements with the Marshfield          map except for two close  mb apart adjacent STRPs          on chromosome p ATAC and ATCD where the linkage          results the Iceland map and the June  sequence          assembly all disagreed with the Marshfield map                          Characterization of Sets  and           Numbers of STRPs heterozygosity values and          sexaverage genetic map properties for Screening Sets            and  plus  combined broken down by chromosome          are displayed in Table  Of the  total X chromosome          STRPs in the combined Sets  GATAA GGATF and          GATAG are in the pter pseudoautosomal region and           SDF is in the qter pseudoautosomal region The  Y          chromosome STRPs are all malespecific Also two small          tightlyspaced clusters of STRPs are included in Set           six STRPs near the centromere of chromosome  and three          STRPs on the short arm of chromosome  for the purpose          of gauging linkage disequilibrium          Set  STRPs with overall average heterozygosity of           are more informative than Set  STRPs with overall          average heterozygosity of  At least part of this          difference may simply be a reflection of the populations          used to deduce these values see Methods As shown in          Table  X and especially Y chromosome STRPs had lower          average informativeness than autosomal STRPs          The average sexaverage STRP spacing of the combined          Sets was  cM The maximum gaps are   and           cM for Set  Set  and Sets  and  combined          respectively There were  gaps   cM in Set            such gaps in Set  and  gaps   cM in Sets  and           combined Set  STRPs were generally closer to          telomeres than Set  STRPs resulting in greater total          chromosomal coverage          A summary of repeat length in the Screening Set STRPs          is presented in Table  Only  dinucleotide STRPs remain          in Set  Fourteen pentanucleotide STRPs were also          included in the combined Sets          Breakdown of the Screening Set STRPs by repeat type is          shown in Table  STRPs with AGAT and AAT repeats          together accounted for  of the STRPs in the combined          Sets Note that because of permutation and the          complementary strand there are several names for each          repeat type As just one example AGAT repeats can also          be presented as GATA ATAG TAGA ATCT TATC CTAT and          TCTA repeats Following the suggestion of Jin et al             we have chosen the alphabetically minimal name          We found that AAT repeats in particular have a          relatively low level of noninteger alleles For example          within Set   of GGAA and  of AGAT STRPs had          frequent noninteger alleles compared to only  of          AAT STRPs Because of high rates of noninteger alleles          STRPs with purines on one strand and pyrimidines on the          other eg AAGG were avoided even though they are          reasonably abundant and often especially informative                       Association of Screening Set STRPs with interspersed          repeat elements IREs is shown in Table  STRPs were          considered to be associated with IREs if the IRE fell in          the  bp flanking the STR on either side total of           bp of flanking sequence Although total numbers for some          of the STR types are relatively small it appears that          each type of STR has its own particular signature of IRE          association For example AAAT STRs are very often           associated with Alu elements consistent with the          hypothesis that most of these repeats evolved from the          polyA tail of Alus     An unexpectedly large          fraction of AGAT STRs  were found to be associated          with LTRs The results in Table may generally provide          clues about the evolution of STRs                            Discussion        Development of human STRP Screening Sets has paralleled        advances in construction of genetic and physical maps        Except in regions with long inversion polymorphisms            it should soon be possible to specify STRP         order within Screening Sets with near        certainty However because of individual and even possibly        population differences in recombination rates              it may never be possible to specify genetic         distances between STRPs with high        precision        Screening Set  STRPs have been typed in the         members of the Human Diversity Panel     We hope to        also type the new Set  and  STRPs through this Panel in        the relatively near future It is beneficial to have a        global perspective on informativeness and allele        frequencies for each Screening Set STRP Although the        Screening Set STRPs were initially screened using European        DNA samples we have found that in almost all cases they        are highly or modestly informative in other human        populations Consistent with previous results              average heterozygosities for the Screening Set STRPs in        SubSaharan Africans are the highest     Isolated        European populations such as Sardinian villagers and Old        Order Amish in the US have only slightly diminished        heterozygosities Although some Screening Set STRPs have        reduced informativeness in East Asian populations such as        Han Chinese average heterozygosities in East Asians are        also only slightly diminished compared to Europeans So        far only Native American and some Oceanic populations have        average heterozygosities for Screening Set STRPs that are        substantially reduced With enough effort it probably        would be possible to develop Screening Set STRPs with        higher average heterozygosities for populations such as        Native Americans but the practicality of such an        undertaking is uncertain        Similarly it would also be helpful to carry out        extensive sequencing of at least the frequent alleles for        each Screening Set STRP This would eliminate the need to        approximate allele sizes However this would also be a        large and expensive project and may have to wait until        sequencing costs drop so that many human genomes from        around the world can be sequenced        Although nearly all Screening Set STRPs are at least        modestly polymorphic in all human populations examined to        date this does not guarantee that they will be free of        frequent noninteger alleles or weak or null alleles in        some populations For example we have observed apparent        null alleles for some STRPs in Chinese that were not        present in Europeans eg GATAA on chromosome  and        GGAAG on chromosome  We have also observed        noninteger alleles in SubSaharan Africans that have not        been seen at appreciable frequency in other populations eg        GATA on chromosome  and GATAA on chromosome                Despite having much higher mutation rates than diallelic        polymorphisms there is abundant evidence that highly        informative STRPs of the type found within Screening Sets        are generally powerful markers for detection of linkage        disequilibrium eg      It is unclear however        whether dinucleotide or tetranucleotide STRPs are superior        in this regard Experimental evidence seems to favour        higher average mutations rates for tetranucleotide STRPs            while theoretical results favour higher average        rates for dinucleotide STRPs     Analysis of STRPs        typed in CEPH reference families for construction of human        genetic maps revealed that the fraction of        dinucleotidedinucleotide STRP pairs   kb apart with        linkage disequilibrium at p   was  whereas        the fraction for dinucleotidetetranucleotide pairs was         and for dinucleotidetrinucleotide pairs was         Broman K Weber J unpublished results        Many of the Set  and  STRPs are superior to the        thirteen STRPs used routinely in forensic DNA testing in        the US        httpwwwcstlnistgovbiotechstrbasefbicorehtm        Several of the thirteen forensic STRPs have frequent        noninteger alleles Several are not especially        informative Five of the thirteen forensic STRPs are        currently included within Set  This occurred by chance        rather than design If genome polymorphism scans for either        research or clinical purposes become widespread then        overlap between our Screening Sets and forensic Sets will        have to be carefully considered        Although our newest Screening Sets are substantial        improvements over previous versions they are still not        perfect Some STRPs have lower informativeness than        desired and some large gaps in coverage remain The Set         STRPs are generally superior to Set  polymorphisms        because Set  is new There has not yet been a chance to        make many replacements        We will continue to make improvements in our human STRP        Screening Sets and to post upgrades on the Marshfield web        site But are there limits to the quality of STRP Sets The        answer is undoubtedly yes There are only approximately         modestly to highly informative tri and        tetranucleotide STRPs in the human gene pool             Within some  mb regions of the genome we have already        exhausted all likely tri and tetranucleotide STRP        candidates Only a small fraction  of the new STRPs we        screened from the genomic sequence were selected for the        new Sets It is quite conceivable that over the next        decade or two we will characterize all human STRPs that        have reasonable informativeness Resequencing different        human genomes will undoubtedly contribute much to this        effort        Quite a few investigators have speculated that diallelic        polymorphisms such as SNPs or diallelic indels will        supplant STRPs in human Screening Sets Our position        continues to be that this question will likely be        ultimately determined by typing costs     STRPs provide                much more information than diallelic        polymorphisms so diallelic typing costs would need to drop        well below those for STRPs This might happen but it        hasnt yet and its not clear that it ever will There may        also be advantages to including both high and low mutation        rate polymorphisms within Screening Sets ie STRPs and        diallelics     In any case we believe that our STRP        Screening Sets will continue to be highly valuable and        widely used for many years                    Conclusions        The development of Screening Sets  and  will improve        gene mapping in general and specifically genome scans        where a relatively high STRP density is required Complete        information on all of our Screening Sets is freely        available from the Marshfield web site        httpresearchmarshfieldclinicorggeneticsalong with        lists of over  candidate and confirmed human indel        polymorphisms both multi and diallelic We plan to        continue to improve our human STRP Screening Sets until we        have exhausted all available STRPs at specific chromosomal        sites                    Materials and Methods                  Identification of candidate polymorphisms          Two different approaches were used to search for new          polymorphisms One approach was to use overlapping BAC          genomic sequences to select polymorphisms that varied by          more than two repeats     The other approach was to          browse the genome for STRs using the December            version of the genomic sequence at University of          California  Santa Cruz httpgenomeucscedu                       Once a sequence containing the desired polymorphism          was selected usually  bp in length it was run          through the Repeat Masker program          httpftpgenomewashingtoneducgibinRepeatMaskerin          order to avoid selecting PCR primers within Alu L or          other repeats The Primer  program          httpwwwgenomewimiteducgibinprimerprimerwwwcgiwas          used to select PCR primers Candidate sequences which did          not permit the placement of at least one PCR primer          within unique sequence ie outside of a repeat identified          by Repeat Masker were not tested further In cases where          one PCR primer was

STRP sequences from Set           were Blasted against genomic sequences from the public          labs For nearly all STRPs we identified  to  BACs          that showed high homology Blast criteria were score          bits   expect E value  e and ratio of          matched bases to STRP sequence length  Two          different multiple alignment programs were then used to          align the single

          Screening of candidate polymorphisms          For initial screening of the PCR primers we          incorporated a dyelabelled nucleotide with a twostep          PCR protocol Briefly the first step contained  mM          TrisHCl pH   mM KCl  mM MgCl              gelatin  M each dNTP           M of the forward and reverse primers  units of          Taq polymerase Roche in a total  l reaction volume          The second reaction had the same components and volume as          in the first step except that the forward primer was          present at  M and RG dUTP Applied Biosystems at           M with no reverse primer About  l of step  PCR          product was used as a DNA template for step  PCR Each          PCR step initiated with a C soak for  min followed          by  and  cycles for steps  and  respectively          consisting of C for  sec C for  sec C for           sec and a final extension of  min at C An equal          volume of loading solution composed of EDTA  mM and          Orange G dye  mM Sigma dissolved in formamide was          added to the reaction following PCR and  l of the          product was fractionated on denaturing acrylamide gels           acrylamide  M urea  mM Tris  mM borate           mM EDTA pH           For use of fluorescentlabelled primers  ng of          template DNA is dried in the wells of  well          polypropylene plates PCR amplifications were carried out          in a  l volume containing  mM TrisHCl pH            mM KCl  mM MgCl              gelatin  M each dNTP           M of fluorescentlabelled forward and unlabeled          reverse primer and a  units of Taq polymerase PCR          amplification was carried out for  cycles with the same          times and temperatures as listed above                          Genetic map positions for new STRPs          Genetic distances for the new STRPs were obtained by          typing the STRPs in several projects with large numbers          of European families The CRIMAP program was used to          order the STRPs and to deduce genetic distances In order          to fit new STRPs into the Marshfield map              approximate genetic values were obtained by          extrapolations using the new sexaverage genetic          distances and the Marshfield map genetic distances for          two flanking older STRPs In rare instances when no          neighbouring STRPs with known Marshfield map distances          were available the genetic distances were extrapolated          from physical distances from the UCSanta Cruz sequence          assembly June  version For the Xchromosome          analysis female genetic distances were used in place of          sexaverage genetic distances          Heterozygosity values were determined by typing STRPs          in two different population groups For Cooperative Human          Linkage Center CHLC and Utah STRPs in Set           heterozygosity values were deduced by typing the STRPs          through several populations of different ethnic groups          African Asian and European whereas for newly          developed STRPs in Set  and all the STRPs within Set           newly developed CHLC and Utah STRPs a European          population was used Heterozygosity estimates of the Set           and many Set  STRPs are also available from          genotyping of the Human Diversity Panel see
