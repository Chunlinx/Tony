                                 Journalistic Integrity and Other Oxymorons                        Ill do you one better Lets pose as guidebook writers and get someoneelse to pick up the tab for our visit to Niagara Ill impersonate the LonelyPlanet writer and recommend seeing the Falls the authentic way bybarrel            Its true that listening to a guidebooks cheerleading gets tiresome But atravel guide full of panned restaurants is useless If a book doesnt like aplace they shouldnt list it The exception of course is in small towns orisolated locales eg Liberty Island where a forgettable restaurant or hotelmight be the only option Another factor that discourages negative reviews isthe risk of a libel suit            The real problem is that none of the guides sift through all the stuff andtell you whats right for whom Even in a general guidebook theres room forspecialization the best green spots the best museums and galleries etcFodors has suggested itineraries Access and Frommers have rating systemsbut it still seems that youve got to read the entire book to make sure yourenot missing something that youd enjoy and that can be wearisome no matter howwell theyre written            When I worked for Lets Go editors cobbled together a list of restaurantshostels and hotels and sent them complimentary service vouchers which theywould sign and return Researchers could then visit the establishmentsanonymously and present the voucher when the bill arrived This method doesprevent preferential treatment but I do think that a free lunch can compromiseyour review whether your employer or the restaurant paysfooting the bill isan integral part of the dining experience and its harder if only slightlyto rate the value of a meal someone else buys In general though Ive foundtravel writers to be honorable folk And even the unscrupulous are moreinterested in eating for free in restaurants they have no intention of listingthan in taking kickbacks from lowquality establishments in exchange forinclusion One way or another the interests of the readership are served            Its wrong to say that these guides dont take reader feedback into accountLonely Planet and Lets Go usually acknowledge the readers who wrote themhelpful letters in the back pages of the book This feature is strangely absentfrom my New York Lonely Planet but the most recent edition of LPs India bookhas four pages of readers names Zagats may be good for finding a culinarysure thing but youll have to stand on line with the rest of New York or inline with the rest of Chicago And I think its nave to use their ratings asan absolute measure of restaurant quality Locals have different interestsattitudes and palates than tourists and would be accordingly harsher on themerestaurants And before taking Fodors to task for praising Michael Jordanschops admit it Youve got to look pretty hard to find a bad steak inChicago            As for theme restaurants in general theyre merely indicative of the factthat a lot of people travel with their children The theme restaurant as apacifier is a stroke of genius The overdone dcor gives the short ofattention plenty to gawk at The food is bland enough for even the most finickyadolescent palate And celebrity sponsorship is a behavioral modificationtechnique rivaling Santa Claus Kids shape up quick if you can con them intothinking that Michael Jordan or Sly Stallone might show up at any minuteMediocre food at inflated prices is I imagine a small price to pay for therespite these restaurants provide for the harried parent and guidebook writersfeel dutybound to include them All the same Lonely Planet gets extra creditfor noting that the HarleyDavidson Caf is so commercial the menus availablefor sale at             Having spent so much time defending my former colleagues Im afraid Iveleft you little new to work with Id still like an explanation Why areFrommers New York titles multiplying when the Web should be pushing them intoextinction            Jodi I doubt that Ive done much to advance the science of travel guidewriting but Ive thoroughly enjoyed our discussion Rumor has it that WalterCronkite is opening his own theme restaurant on West th StreetWell toast your safe return to New York with a Sloe gin Thats the way itfizz complimentary I hope
