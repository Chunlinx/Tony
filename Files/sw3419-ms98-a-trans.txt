                uh Kate what kind of uh where do you like to eat out   well we uh we really like the Mexican food you know here in Texas and uh so we try and go around to different Mexican restaurants trying them out   yes   and so uh Tias is probably our favorite uh restaurant there and i think they have the one of the best services that uh that we really like it   do you have you tried Mother Mesquites   no wheres that at   thats at Skillman and LBJ there is uh its where Skillman uh curves into Forest Lane and its real good Mexican food a another real good one is uh   uhhuh umhum   Raphaels down on McKinney Avenue   oh   theyre both very good umhum   really oh that uh no we havent explored uh you know too many places um you know a lot of the big name brand i guess uh chains uh yeah but um oh weve tried places you know down uh by the Collin Creek Mall the uh you know Alvarez and um gosh we tried what was across the street   chains uhhuh   El Pasos El Chicos or something yeah something something like that uhhuh uhhuh yeah   oh El Chicos or El Phoenix one umhum umhum umhum well i like Tias better than i do El Chicos or El Phoenix   yeah yeah   uh much better uh Mother Mesquites is one of our favorites but then fajitas are one of my uh i like it better than just about anything and they make very good fajitas there in their own uh homemade flour tortillas that are just absolutely wonderful especially with butter and honey on them   oh yes yes oh uhhuh uhhuh oh i know i tell i tell you what they they are they just um theyre excellent uh excellent food i wish i could make them here at home   yes yes so do i  well what else do you like   just cant make those flour tortillas but well i love uh i love seafood and i notice they have like the you know The Louisiana Purchase um Razzoos has opened up down you know off of um um  oh close to    uhhuh yes now i havent eaten there have you eaten there   yes i have eaten there now the only problem i love the food its a lot of cajun food and a good seafood but uh the service has always been so strange every time ive been in there mostly its been at lunch time   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh but i hear at night though they have uh you know the outdoor um bar and um uh thats its really uh you know kind of lively so its its really good all their blackened grilled stuff   uhhuh oh i we like uh uh for the cajun the spicy we like Atchafalayas out on Beltline in Addison and its a good restaurant   uhhuh oh well that sounds great   and fish for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either Vincents there in Plano or uh  i believe its a Rusty Scupper over on uh uh Dallas Parkway in Addison which is absolutely wonderful   umhum umhum huh uhhuh   the service is great they have every kind of fish that that you could imagine youd want and the uh   umhum   the atmosphere is wonderful too if you want a really special night out and fish food thats a good place to go   uhhuh oh  well i uh i have children and and work and so we uh we tend to eat a lot of fast food stuff  uhhuh   fast food oh i can understand that i can remember when our children were small we lived in the Chicago area at the time and we had a lot of McDonalds when they were first coming out i cant look a McDonald in the face now   yeah i know i i know i im so sick of McDonalds we we used to eat there we used to eat there all the time and so now we we we branch out at this Wendys or some other fast food joint   i know yeah  yeah well Taco Buenos good  and cheap and cheap very cheap   oh and and cheap too so yeah but but the kids you know they theyve got those expensive tastes so uh they like Tias so they can sit down and all that good kind of stuff   yes yes yes sounds like my grandchildren   yeah i know they they theyre just spoiled rotten but uh but no i uh uh we love to eat out of course its just so much easier and simpler yeah so we uh we usually eat out generally two or three times a week       oh yes well its just my husband and i and its either TV dinners at home or we go out to eat and i would much rather go out to eat than TV dinners   yeah yeah oh oh me too me too so i know uh i i know that i uh you know i just work and im just tired when i get home and i i just dont feel like cooking   oh no no   and uh you know on the weekends theres always things to do and uh so we like to go out to lunch on Saturdays especially   i like breakfast out   uhhuh uhhuh   i like the IHOP there in Plano   yeah now i weve been there twice and and both times i just oh the food just didnt quite settle with me and i dont know what it was   oh really oh now thats surprising   umhum umhum   because normally theyre just theyre real good and i like because they theyre even if theyre crowded theyre fast service you know i i dont have to wait forever for a table   yes and i love umhum umhum yeah   and we also like Owens uh   oh family restaurant uhhuh   country sausage yeah yeah we think its good   now i havent been there before i went to one i think in Ohio or or or somewhere up there but ive never been to that one here i know its just down the street so now have you been to Applebees   umhum its good yes yes and we like Applebees   yes yes i i really like that too so that was uh   yeah it its fun i like your up there in Plano that uh Country Steak House   oh yeah ive been ive been there twice uhhuh yeah so   have you tried it we like it because its fairly reasonable and they have we go for the salad bar   salad bar yeah
