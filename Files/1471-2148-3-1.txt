                    Background        Rates of protein evolution vary greatly and may be        influenced by a variety of factors Recently it has been        demonstrated that the magnitude of the fitness effects        associated with deleterious mutations in proteincoding        genes ie proteins dispensability correlates with rates        of protein evolution      Essential proteins or those        that are less dispensable to an organism tend to evolve        slower than those that are more dispensable It has also        been suggested that proteins evolutionary rates are        determined by the proportion of aminoacids that are        critical to their function     According to this        intuitively plausible notion proteins with a greater        fraction of amino acid residues that play an essential role        in the proteins function are predicted to evolve slower        than those with a smaller fraction of such crucial        residues Consistent with this prediction a negative        correlation has been reported between protein evolutionary        rates which were determined from evolutionary distances        between orthologous proteins from yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the        nematode         Caenorhabditis elegans  and the        number of proteinprotein interactions ie physical        interactions determined primarily using the yeast        twohybrid system proteins are involved in     Yeast        proteins that have a large number of interacting partners        were found to have evolved slower on average than those        with fewer interacting partners and this was presumed to        be due to the fact that proteins with more interacting        partners have a greater fraction of residues directly        involved in function However these same data indicate        that less than  of the variance in evolutionary rates is        explained by the variance in the number of proteinprotein        interactions suggesting that the influence of the number        of interacting partners on protein evolutionary rates might        not be substantial We sought to further investigate this        phenomenon by examining the relationship between the number        of proteinprotein interacting partners and protein        evolutionary rates for the yeasts         S cerevisiae and         Schizosaccharomyces pombe as well as        for the proteobacteria         Helicobacter pylori and         Camplyobacter jejuni                     Results and Discussion                  Evolutionary rates and proteinprotein          interactions yeast          A total of  pairs of orthologous proteins one          from           S cerevisiae and one from           S pombe  were identified see          Methods and for  of these there was data on          proteinprotein interactions of the           S cerevisiae member in the MIPS          database     For these  orthologous pairs the          number of proteinprotein interactions detected for the           S cerevisiae protein was plotted          against the calculated substitution rates between          orthologs Figure a As with a previous survey that          compared conserved           S cerevisiae and           C elegans orthologs     there          is a negative correlation between the number of          proteinprotein interactions and the evolutionary rates          However although this correlation is statistically          significant Table  the slope of the linear trend line          y   fit to the data by least squares regression          as well as the small r value r   suggest that          the influence of the number of interacting partners on          rates of evolution is minor at best Specifically the r          value indicates that less than  of the variation in          substitution rates between orthologous proteins is          explained by the variation in the number of          proteinprotein interactions Furthermore when only the          most conserved   sequence identity and thus most          reliably identified pairs of orthologous proteins were          considered the slope of the linear trend line as well as          the r value decreased and the statistical significance          disappeared Figure band Table  To account for the          possibility that linear regression does not adequately          reflect the structure of the data and the observed low          correlation is due to a nonlinear relationship between          the number of interactions and evolutionary rate of a          protein we also calculated the rank correlation          coefficients for these quantities Under this approach          no statistically significant correlation was observed for          either of the two analysed data sets Table           It is tempting to speculate that the difference          between the results obtained here and those reported          previously    can be attributed to the difference in          the evolutionary relationships between the pairs of          species compared in the two studies The species compared          here           S cerevisiae and           S pombe  are much more closely          related than           S cerevisiae and           C elegans  and orthologous          proteins are likely to be more reliably inferred between          the closely related genomes However we also performed          comparisons for pairs of orthologous proteins identified          between the more distantly related           S cerevisiae and           C elegans    and no significant          relationship between evolutionary rates and          proteinprotein interactions was observed data not          shown                          Longterm evolutionary conservation and          proteinprotein interactions yeast          To examine the relationship between proteinprotein          interactions and evolutionary conservation of proteins          over longer periods of time the numbers of interactions          for           S cerevisiae proteins were          assessed against the taxonomic distribution of their          homologs which were detected using BLAST searches of the          Genbank nonredundant protein database with expect value             Five distinct levels of taxonomic distribution          categories each including taxa that are successively          more distant from           S cerevisiae  were considered            hits only to ascomycetes   hits to nonascomycete          fungi   hits to metazoa and plants   hits to          noncrowngroup eukaryotes   hits to archaea andor          bacteria The broader the taxonomic distribution of          homologs of a           S cerevisiae protein the more          evolutionarily conserved it is considered to be Each           S cerevisiae protein was assigned          a taxonomic distribution category and this value was          compared to the number of proteinprotein interactions          reported for the given protein Correlation between these          two features of           S cerevisiae proteins was not          statistically significant r   p   Thus          as with the comparison between evolutionary rates and the          number of interactions no substantial relationship          between longterm evolutionary conservation of           S cerevisiae proteins and the          number of interactions was found                          Evolutionary rates and proteinprotein          interactions bacteria          High throughput analysis of proteinprotein          interactions has also been conducted    on the          proteobacterium           H pylori the causative agent of          gastric ulcers for which complete genome sequences of          two strains are available      Thus it is possible          to assess the effect of proteinprotein interactions on          the rates of evolution over much shorter periods of time          within species compared to the analysis of the yeast          proteins described above Towards this end orthologs          between the two completely sequenced           H pylori strains were identified          and the substitution rates between pairs of orthologous          proteins were calculated see Methods The number of          proteinprotein interactions was plotted against the          amino acid substitution rates and no significant          relationship between the two was detected Figure aand          Table  The same conclusion was reached when the rank          correlation coefficient was determined Table  In this          case the lack of correlation between evolutionary rates          and the number of interacting partners might simply be          due to the small amount of evolutionary diversification          that has occurred since the two           H pylori strains separated from          their common ancestor To evaluate this possibility          orthologous protein pairs were identified between           H pylori and a more distantly          related bacterium           C jejuni     These two          species are close enough both belong to the epsilon          subdivision of proteobacteria to ensure accurate          identification of orthologs but distant enough for          substantial sequence divergence to have accumulated          between orthologs Nevertheless comparison between these          two bacteria showed no discernable correlation between          the number of proteinprotein interactions and the rates          of substitution between orthologs measured either          directly or using the rank correlation approach Figure          band Table                           Yeast proteins with the greatest number of          interactions appear to evolve slowly          The observations described above seem to indicate that          the number of interaction partners a given protein has          does not make an important contribution to the          evolutionary rate One could speculate however that          whatever minor correlation is seen Fig a a is not          spread evenly as a miniscule difference in the          evolutionary rates among all proteins but rather          reflects a substantial slowdown of evolution among a          small fraction of proteins that have the greatest number          of interactions To test this hypothesis we grouped          proteins from           S cerevisiae and           H pylori into separate bins with          each bin containing proteins whose number of interactions          fell within a given range Comparison of the evolutionary          rates for proteins in different bins showed that yeast          proteins in the bins with the greatest number of          interactions on average evolved slower than the bulk of          the proteins Fig a The difference was less than          twofold even for the top bin but was statistically          significant for each of the top three bins or their          combination Table  The proteins with a large number          of interactions placed in the top bins comprise only           of the yeast proteins In contrast for the bulk of the          proteins which have a small to moderate number of          interactions there did not seem to be any dependence at          all between the number of interactions and the          evolutionary rates Fig a           H pylori proteins with the          greatest number of interactions also appear to have          evolved slower on average between strains than the          majority of the proteins However the difference was not          significant and this effect was not seen in the          comparison of           H pylori and           C jejuni orthologs Table and Fig          bc                            Discussion and conclusions        The hypothesis that a proteins rate of evolution is        determined by the fraction of residues that are critical to        its function and this in turn is likely to be        proportional to the number of interactions a protein is        involved in seems to make perfectly good sense Indeed a        recent report is consistent with this idea in suggesting        that the number of proteinprotein interactions        significantly affects rates of evolution     However        upon investigation of this relationship at multiple levels        of evolutionary relatedness we found that there was only a        slight correlation at best between evolutionary rates and        the number of proteinprotein interactions In fact        examination of the actual data presented in support of the        previous claim of a connection between the number of        interactions and evolutionary rates    also shows a weak        correlation albeit greater than the one observed in this        study Thus differences in the number of interaction        partners seem to explain at best only a small part of the        great variation of the evolutionary rates of proteins        encoded in each genome            Why does the number of interaction partners apparently        have only a slight effect on the evolutionary rate The        first and most obvious possibility to consider would be        that the low quality of proteinprotein interaction data        might obscure the signal Indeed a recent comparison of        proteinprotein interaction data sets from highthroughput        studies suggested that more than half of all interactions        determined by large scale experiments are likely to be        false positives     However at least for the yeast        data we relied on manually curated proteinprotein        interaction data from the MIPS database which are expected        to have a substantially lower error rate Second one could        speculate that even if the majority of the analyzed        interactions actually do occur they are selectively        nearly neutral the number of such real but functionally        irrelevant interactions would not affect the rate of        evolution Third the possibility exists that even if many        of the observed interactions are functionally important        and by inference the respective binding sites are subject        to purifying selection the binding sites for different        partners tend to overlap such that the number of amino        residues in these sites increases only slowly with the        increase in the numbers of interactions        The latter two possibilities are not incompatible with        each other and with the other aspect of the observations        reported here We found that the small fraction of yeast        proteins that have the greatest number of interaction        partners do on average evolve slower than the bulk of the        proteins which are involved in a moderate or small number        of interactions This effect was less pronounced if        observed at all for         H pylori  but it has to be noticed        that the top bins of the         H pylori interaction data included        proteins with fewer interactions than the respective bins        in the yeast data compare Fig bcand a        Proteinprotein interactions form scalefree networks        which show the characteristic powerlaw distribution of the        node degrees simply put there is a small number of highly        connected proteins hubs whereas the majority have a        small number of partners the most abundant class are        proteins that are involved in just one interaction             Scalefree networks are highly tolerant to error        elimination of nodes at random but are vulnerable to        attack ie elimination of the hubs    and indeed it        has been found that the most highly connected proteins in        yeast interaction networks tend to be essential            This might explain the present findings namely that a        small number of yeast proteinprotein interaction hubs        evolve slowly due to strong purifying selection whereas        for the great majority of the proteins there is no        discernible connection between the number of interactions        and evolutionary rates                    Methods                  Comparison of evolutionary rates and          proteinprotein interactions
