                    Background        In         S cerevisiae a key event        accompanying exit from mitosis is the inactivation of        ClbCdc protein kinase achieved through degradation of        Clb and accumulation of the ClbCdc inhibitor Sic        reviewed in     AnaphasePromoting ComplexCyclosome        APCC ubiquitin ligase and its substrate specific        activator HctCdh are required for degradation of Clb        the major mitotic cyclin in the budding yeast reviewed in            Whereas         hct and         sic cells appear relatively normal                hct sic cells are inviable        presumably due to their inability to extinguish Cdc        activity in telophase            The complexity in the regulation of mitotic exit is        underscored by the existence of a set of genes essential        for this process referred to as the mitotic exit network        MEN They encode the GTPbinding protein Tem and its        putative guanine nucleotide releasing factor Lte the dual        specificity protein phosphatase Cdc protein kinases        Cdc Cdc and DbfDbf the Dbfbinding protein Mob        reviewed in     and the spindlepolebody component        Nud     Conditionallethal temperature sensitive ts        mutations in any of the MEN genes cause cells to arrest in        late mitosis with elevated mitotic Cdk activity when        shifted to the restrictive temperature Inactivation of        Cdc by overexpression of Sic suppresses multiple MEN        mutants and hyperactivation of Cdc by overexpression of        Clb exacerbates their phenotypes consistent with the idea        that a key function of the MEN proteins is to eradicate        Cdc activity during the transition from        anaphasetelophase to G               Recently important advances have been made in our        understanding of how the MEN is switched on during        anaphase Tem is thought to be kept inactive throughout        early mitosis by the twocomponent GTPaseactivating        protein complex BubBfa which colocalizes with Tem at        the spindle pole body      When the mitotic spindle        penetrates the motherdaughter neck the Tembound spindle        pole body is translocated into the daughter cell where a        cortical pool of Lte is thought to activate Tem             In addition to this spatial regulation the GTPase        activity of Bfa is thought to be inactivated through its        phosphorylation by Cdc     but it remains unknown how        this process is coordinated with the presumed juxtaposition        of Lte and Tem in the daughter cell Despite this rapid        progress in understanding the signals that regulate the        MEN the direct downstream targets of the MEN have yet to        be apprehended        To address how the MEN components downstream of Cdc        are organized and what their targets are we sought         tab telophase arrest        bypassed mutants that alleviate the essential        requirement for         CDC In theory         tab mutants could act downstream of        or parallel to         CDC and could be either        lossoffunction mutations in genes that inhibit exit from        mitosis or gainoffunction mutations in genes that promote        exit from mitosis To our surprise mutations in six        linkage groups were uncovered with three groups being        recessive          tabtab  and three groups being        dominant          TAB  We have shown in earlier        studies that         tab is a reductionoffunction        mutation in         NET aka         CFI       and that         TAB is a gainoffunction mutation        in         CDC     Net sequesters Cdc        in the nucleolus and inactivates it in preanaphase cells        During exit from mitosis a         TEMCDC dependent signal frees        Cdc from the nucleolus and allows it to promote        inactivation of ClbCdc       The fact that both        Net and Cdc are directly involved in exit from mitosis        validates the effectiveness of the tab screen and heightens        the potential value of the uncharacterized         tab mutants Here we present a        detailed description of the         tab mutant screen and describe a        third         TAB gene         TABMTR                     Results                  Cdc promotes activation of Clb proteolysis by a          posttranslational mechanism          Transcription has been postulated to play an important          role in triggering exit from mitosis     For          example Dbf a protein kinase that promotes exit from          mitosis is associated with the CCR transcription          regulatory complex     In addition the Swi          transcription factor activates           SIC expression during late          anaphase and both           sic and           swi are synthetically lethal with                    dbf      To address if          production of new proteins is essential for exit from          mitosis we examined the effects of the protein synthesis          inhibitor cycloheximide on Clb degradation a key aspect          of this process Mutant           cdc cells were uniformly          arrested in late anaphasetelophase by incubation at the          restrictive temperature C The cultures were then          supplemented with   or  gml cycloheximide          before being returned to C to reverse the           cdc arrest In the absence of          cycloheximide Sic accumulated and Clb disappeared as          cells exited mitosis Figure  lanes  In the          presence of cycloheximide Sic accumulation was          abolished but Clb degradation still occurred with          apparently normal kinetics Figure  lanes  and           Although this result does not exclude the likely          possibility that synthesis of new proteins eg Sic          normally facilitates the exit from mitosis it reveals          that a key aspect of mitotic exit  inactivation of Cdc          protein kinase via degradation of the mitotic cyclin Clb           can proceed beyond the Cdcdependent step without          synthesis of new proteins                          A screen for telophase arrest bypassed          tabmutants          To understand how the MEN mobilizes posttranslational          mechanisms to trigger mitotic exit we conducted a          genetic screen for telophase arrest bypassed            tab  mutants that bypassed the          essential requirement for           CDC Figure  Because the          essential requirement for           CLNs   and            in entry into S phase can be          bypassed by deletion of a gene            SIC  that inhibits entry into S          phase      we reasoned by analogy that our screen          might reveal key negative regulators of the          anaphasetelophase  G transition          Ninety independent cultures of           cdc pMETcdc URA were          first grown in inducing medium  methionine at          permissive temperature C to allow occurrence of          spontaneous mutations The cultures were subsequently          plated on repressing medium  methionine at a          temperature semirestrictive for the           cdc allele C to enrich for          mutations that supported the growth of           CDC deficient cells To identify          mutations that allowed complete bypass of           cdc representative colonies          from each plate were tested for their ability to grow on          FOAcontaining medium FOA selectively blocks the          growth of plasmidbearing           URA cells The parental strain          failed to grow due to its inability to proliferate          without the            METcdc URA  plasmid In          contrast twenty five mutants survived on FOA          Furthermore all of them had lost the plasmid as          determined by PCR analysis data not shown Fifteen of          these mutants were amenable to genetic manipulation and          harbored single mutations Fourteen mutants were assigned          to three recessive and three semidominantdominant          linkage groups Table  We referred to these mutants as                    tab mutants for their          telophasearrestbypass Tab  phenotype In addition          we serendipitously found that           srp but not           srp could bypass           cdc Table  data not          shown          Earlier studies identified           tab and           TAB as mutations in           NET and           CDC respectively               Net detains Cdc in the nucleolus and inactivates it          until a Temdependent signal sets Cdc free to promote          exit from mitosis       The fact that both Net          and Cdc are directly involved in exit from mitosis          prompted us to further analyze           tab mutants                          Does bypass of cdc require Sic accumulation and          Clb degradation          Either Sic accumulation or Clb degradation is          proposed to be sufficient to sustain mitotic exit              Although           cdc mutants are defective in          both processes ectopic activation of either one should          restore exit from mitosis and growth Thus to gain          insight into their molecular targets we asked if bypass          of           cdc by           tab mutations required           SIC or           HCT Whereas all           tab mutants tested were able to          bypass           cdc in the absence of           HCT and two            net           tab and           CDC           TAB  were able to bypass           cdc in the absence of either           SIC or           HCT four           tab mutants            tab tab TAB and           TAB  failed to bypass in the          absence of           SIC Table                           Efficient bypass of mitotic arrest by both          SICdependent and SICindependent tabmutants is          accompanied by ectopic Sic accumulation and Clb          degradation          We have previously shown that both           net           tab and           CDC           TAB efficiently bypassed the          mitotic arrest caused by Temdepletion               Furthermore bypass was accompanied by ectopic Sic          accumulation and Clb degradation Because both           net           tab and           CDC           TAB could bypass           cdc in the absence of           SIC we tested if the same bypass          efficiency could be achieved by           tab a           SIC dependent bypass mutant We          used a           temGALUPLTEM strain that          allowed for conditional depletion of Tem    to          impose a conditional late mitotic block and introduced          the           tab mutation into this          background Wild type or           tab derivatives of           temGALUPLTEM were grown in          galactose medium            TEM induced arrested in G with           factor and released into glucosecontaining medium to          repress           TEM expression time  As          expected the majority  of           TAB cells arrested with large          buds In the           tab strain however a          significant fraction  of cells had   cell bodies          at  hours after release indicating that they had          undergone at least one extra round of budding Figure          A Thirtysix percent represents a minimum estimate of           TEM bypass efficiency in           tab cultures since cells with           cell bodies could have arisen from bypass events          followed by successful cell separation          Having established that           tab indeed bypassed Tem          deficiency at a cellular level we tested whether Sic          accumulation and Clb degradation two hallmark events          that accompany exit from mitosis also occurred           temGALUPLTEM cells carrying                    TAB or           tab alleles were arrested in G          with  factor and released into glucose medium            TEM repressed time  After          cells had exited G  factor was added back to stop          cells from cycling beyond the next G phase As          Temdepleted           TAB cells exited G Clb          accumulated and remained at high levels whereas Sic was          degraded and remained at low levels Figure B left          panels In contrast as Temdepleted           tab cells progressed through          mitosis Clb was almost completely degraded and Sic          accumulated to high levels Figure B right panels          These data suggest that like           tab and           TAB tab efficiently bypassed                    tem by enabling Temindependent          degradation of Clb and accumulation of Sic We conclude          that the apparent           SIC dependence of bypass by           tab and other           tab mutants relates more to the          strength of the particular mutation rather than the          mechanism of bypass In support of this hypothesis we          recently observed that the           SIC independent bypass mutant          D is allelic to the           SIC dependent           tab mutant R Azzam          unpublished data                          tabbypasses multiple deletion mutants of          MEN          All MEN genes are required for exit from mitosis but          it has not yet been tested whether this is the sole          essential function of all MEN genes or if some MEN genes          play critical roles in other processes This question is          amplified by the observations that Cdc participates in          both chromosome segregation and cytokinesis                Park et al submitted Mob binds an essential protein          kinase involved in spindle pole body duplication              and Tem Cdc Dbf and Mob have all been implicated          in cytokinesis         reviewed in              The           tab mutants provide a unique          opportunity to address this issue Accordingly we tested                    if net           tab could bypass deletion          mutants of other MEN genes           net           tab bypassed           cdc tem dbf dbf          mob but not           cdc Figure A     In          addition it bypassed           cdc with negligible           fold lower efficiency Fig A suggesting that          although the sole essential function of           CDC TEM DBF and           MOB is to drive cells out of          mitosis           CDC has other critical cellular          functions                          Some but not all tabmutants exhibit additional          phenotypes including growth defects perturbations in the          nucleolus and elevated rates of chromosome loss          To further characterize the           tab mutants we tested whether they          display other phenotypes in an otherwise wild type          background           tab mutants grown to exponential          phase at C and shifted to C for  or  hours did          not arrest at a particular stage of the cell cycle data          not shown When           tab mutants were plated on YPD          plates and grown at C           TAB and           TAB grew normally Table           suggesting that bypass of           CDC does not necessarily cause          defective growth However           tab failed to form colonies and           net           tab             tab and           CDC           TAB grew slowly at C          suggesting that at least some           tab mutations reside in genes that          have multiple functions Indeed           NET additionally modulates          nucleolar structure and transcription               The release of Cdc from nucleolar Net promotes          mitotic exit                 net           tab cells display a panel of          nucleolar defects including reduction of nucleolar          silencing mislocalization of nucleolar antigens          alteration of rDNA morphology and reduction of rRNA          synthesis      To test whether perturbation of          nucleolar structure is consistently associated with          bypass of           cdc we immunolocalized the          nucleolar antigen Nop in all           tab mutants Nop localization was          also perturbed in           tab and           srp but was normal in           tab TAB TAB and           TAB cells Table               suggesting that a gross change in nucleolar structure is          not required for bypass          Because the putative Tem antagonists and mitotic          checkpoint proteins Bub and Bfa negatively regulate          exit from mitosis and cytokinesis in response to both DNA          damage and spindle misorientation      reviewed in              we asked whether bypass of           TEM dependent regulation can          cause chromosome instability All           tab mutants are in the W          background in which the           ade mutation makes colonies red          after adenine in the growth medium has been depleted A           URAmarked tester minichromosome          carrying the           SUP suppressor transfer RNA gene              was introduced into           net           tab and           CDC           TAB  the two           tab mutants with wellcharacterized          bypass mechanisms Cells that retain the minichromosome          should form white colonies due to suppression of           ade by           SUP whereas loss of this          chromosome should result in a red sector or sectors The          extent of chromosome loss expressed as  colonies that          were red or had red sectors was low in wildtype and           CDC           TAB cells   and high           in           net           tab cells Figure  In          comparison in a strain lacking the anaphaseinhibitor          Pds  of the colonies suffered chromosome loss          events Figure  Since           net           tab but not           CDC           TAB also perturbs nucleolar          functions               CDC           TAB is a more specific and          representative bypass mutant Thus           TEM regulation can be          shortcircuited without a major effect on chromosome          loss Consistent with this notion cells lacking Bub an          inhibitor of Tem showed a similarly moderate extent of          chromosome loss  Figure  We propose that          additional functions of Net ensure faithful transmission          of chromosomes                          Molecular cloning of TABgenes and implication of          nuclear transport in the regulation of mitotic          exit          We attempted to clone by complementation genes          corresponding to the recessive           tab mutations by exploiting the          fact that all of the recessive           tab mutants are ts for growth see          below By this approach           TAB was revealed to be           MTR a gene previously implicated          in nuclear transport       We were unable to          isolate plasmids that complemented           tab in all libraries tested          Both           MTR TAB  and           SRP belong to the nuclear          transport receptoradaptor family reviewed by              Mutant           srp and           mtr           tab cells accumulate the          ribosomal protein Rpbb in the nucleus     Thus to          evaluate a potential link between nuclear transport and          the           tab phenotype we evaluated the          localization of RplbGFP    in all           tab mutants Mutants expressing          RplbGFP were grown to earlylog phase at C shifted          to C to induce the ts mutant phenotype which also          reduces synthesis of ribosomal proteins including          Rplb and shifted back to C to induce new ribosomal          protein synthesis If the rate of mutant phenotype          reversal is slower than restoration of ribosome          synthesis then Rplb should accumulate in the nucleus          Whereas RplbGFP was distributed relatively evenly in          wildtype cells it accumulated in the nucleus in a          significant fraction of           srp and           net           tab cells at C and after C          C  C shift Figure      In          addition although           mtr           tab cells were relatively normal          at C  of them accumulated nuclear Rplb after          C C  C shift Figure  Thus          multiple           tab mutants accumulate Rplb in          the nucleus implying that nucleocytoplasmic trafficking          is involved in the regulation of mitotic exit Other           tab mutants such as           tab TAB CDC           TAB and           TAB  showed no defect in this          assay suggesting that bypass           of cdc can be achieved without          perturbing nucleocytoplasmic transport                            Discussion                  MEN A signalling network that can          posttranslationally trigger exit from mitosis          Both transcriptional and posttranslational controls          have been implicated in the operation of the Mitotic Exit          Network and the regulation of the anaphasetelophase           G transition        To address whether          the portion of the MEN that acts downstream           of CDC can trigger a key aspect          of the anaphasetelophase  G transition ie          inactivation of ClbCdc via proteolysis of Clb in the          absence of new gene expression we evaluated the turnover          of Clb in cells released from a           cdc arrest in the presence of          cycloheximide Interestingly Clb was rapidly and          efficiently degraded upon reversal of the           cdc block regardless of whether          cycloheximide was present Figure  although both          cytokinesis and cell separation require protein synthesis              This observation suggests that the exit from          mitosis in budding yeast may be controlled by mechanisms          fundamentally similar to those employed by animal cells          which proceed through mitosis with highly condensed          transcriptionally silent chromosomes Interestingly all          of the MEN genes have putative homologues in the           C elegans genome          httpgenomewwwstanfordeduSaccharomycesworm                          Isolation of tabmutants          A deliberate search for bypass mutants was a key          aspect of the screen reported here since numerous          genetic interactions have been observed among components          of the MEN consult    for a summary Formally          speaking it is not possible to order gene functions          based on suppressive interactions involving          reductionoffunction eg ts alleles For example the                    net allele suppressed ts          mutations in both its downstream target           CDC and its upstream regulators           CDC CDC and           DBF Figure B Since we sought          mutants that bypassed           cdc the           tab genes are predicted to function          either downstream of or parallel to           CDC but not upstream of           CDC           The tab screen yielded both dominant and recessive          mutants which mapped to six linkage groups The pattern          of alleles Table  does not satisfy a Poisson          distribution suggesting that the screen has not reached          saturation The recessive           tab mutants are likely to represent          reductionoffunction mutations in genes that inhibit          exit from mitosis and the dominant           TAB mutants are likely to result          from gainoffunction mutations in genes that promote          exit from mitosis This prediction is supported by our          prior characterization of the           tab and           TAB alleles of           NET and           CDC respectively see next          section The fact that we recovered recessive          semidominant and dominant mutants in additional           tab genes suggests that there are          likely to be multiple dosagesensitive positive and          negative regulatory controls that act downstream of or          parallel to           CDC                     tab mutants can be classified into          two groups those that bypass           cdc only in the presence of           SIC eg           tab  and those that can bypass          in the absence of           SIC eg           net           tab and           CDC           TAB  It remains unclear          whether mutants distribute into these classes based on          bypass mechanism or allelic potency but we favor the          latter possibility because some           tab alleles required           SIC to bypass           cdc whereas others did not R          Azzam unpublished data Importantly           tab mutants from both classes          appeared to bypass mitotic arrest in Temdepleted cells          by enabling degradation of Clb and accumulation of Sic           two hallmarks of mitotic exit Figure                                         A genetic pathway for anaphase  G          transition          Biochemical and cell biological experiments indicate          that Net acts as part of a complex named RENT that          tethers Cdc to the nucleolus and inhibits Cdc          phosphatase activity and that           CDC and           TEM are required for the release          of Cdc from Net at the end of mitosis                 Consistent with this notion both           net           tab which encodes a mutant          version of Net with presumably reduced affinity for          Cdc and           CDC           TAB which encodes a mutant          version of Cdc with reduced affinity for TabNet          bypass           cdc      Both           net           tab and           CDC           TAB impinge directly on mitotic          exit suggesting that other           TAB genes may encode physiological          regulators and effectors of the Mitotic Exit Network          The           net           tab mutation efficiently          bypassed           tem cdc dbfdbf and           mob consistent with the notion          that the sole essential function of all these genes is to          inhibit Net           net           tab failed to bypass           cdc because Cdc is the          downstream target of Net      Cdc also regulates          Net Shou et al manuscript in preparation but           net           tab bypassed           cdc with very low efficiency          presumably because           CDC has other essential functions                          The most parsimonious model that unifies all of these          observations is as follows Tem functions upstream of          Cdc which in turn activates the DbfMob protein          kinase complex        Together with Cdc          these proteins dislodge Cdc from nucleolar Net Cdc          subsequently dephosphorylates and thereby activates          proteins involved in Sic expression Swi and Cb          degradation HctCdh       thereby          eliminating mitotic Cdk activity and promoting exit from          mitosis The mechanisms by which Cdc and DbfMob          promote the disassembly of RENT remain unknown raising          the possibility that other Tab proteins serve as          intermediaries in this process One attractive hypothesis          based on our identification of           MTR as a           tab gene is that MEN proteins          regulate the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of a key          regulator of the release process                          Chromosome instability in tabmutants          The BubBfa GTPaseactivating protein GAP complex          inhibits the MEN and cytokinesis in response to DNA          damage and spindle misorientation      reviewed in                        bub and           CDC           TAB cells show similar          chromosome instability as wildtype cells In contrast           net           tab cells have a dramatic          chromosome instability phenotype with some colonies          showing multiple red sectors indicative of multiple          chromosomeloss events and many colonies completely red          on the surface Figure A Net is unlikely to directly          regulate transmission of the tester chromosome because          it is only localized to rDNA in the nucleolus                Thus the difference between           net           tab and           CDC           TAB presumably results from          molecular defects unique to the former mutant including          defective nucleolar structure and function or perhaps          defective nuclear transport      Figure  Further          study is required to reveal how the multifunctional Net          protein helps to ensure chromosome transmission          fidelity                          Multiple tabmutations influence nucleocytoplasmic          transport          Nuclear transportdefective mutations in           MTR and           SRP mtr           tab and           srp respectively bypassed           cdc Mtr assembles with and          functions as a nuclear import receptor for the          mRNAbinding protein Npl      Interestingly           srp also inhibits nuclear          import of multiple proteins including Npl               Remarkably reductionoffunction alleles of the          karyopherin           KAP were also recovered in a          screen for mutations that suppressed           cdc           ts A Tohe personal          communication           KAP is required for proper          localization of mRNA binding proteins Nab and Hrp to          the nucleus              The only phenotype known to be shared by           srp mtr and           kap mutants is accumulation of          the S ribosomal protein Rplb in the nucleus               SRP MTR and           KAP may also collaborate to          maintain the proper nucleocytoplasmic partitioning of           factor or factors that regulates mitotic exit An          alternative possibility is that they sequester an          inactive stockpile of  factor that upon mutation or          signalling by the MEN is released from these          transportins and enables exit from mitosis               Finally it is possible that the transportin mutants          enable bypass through an indirect perturbation of          nucleolar architecture Table  Given that some of the          MEN proteins reside in the cytoplasm whereas their target           the RENT complex  resides in the nucleolus it is          tempting to speculate that nuclear transport is a target          of MEN action Our failure to observe nuclear          accumulation of Rplb in           tab and           TABTAB mutants suggests that          these           tab genes bypassed           cdc by a distinct mechanism          Regardless of the exact mechanisms of bypass it is clear          from these analyses that the release of Cdc from Net          is more intricately connected to cell regulation than was          previously imagined                            Conclusions        Three main conclusions on how exit from mitosis is        regulated in the budding yeast can be derived First the        sole essential function of the Tem Cdc DbfDbf and        Mob but not Cdc proteins are to promote the release of        Cdc from the nucleolus as cells lacking these proteins        can grow upon simultaneous reduction         of NET activity Second high        chromosome loss rate was observed in         net         tab but not         CDC         TAB  suggesting that although         CDC independent mitotic exit does        not dramatically affect chromosome transmission additional        functions of Net do Third both         mtr         tab and         srp affect nuclear transport        suggesting that nuclear transport regulates mitotic        exit                    Materials and Methods                  Strains and plasmids          All yeast strains used in this study listed in Table           are isogenic to W Standard methods were employed          for the culturing and manipulation of yeast     All          plasmid constructions were based on the pRS vector series              To replace           CDC with           TRP polymerase chain reaction          PCR products containing           TRP flanked by base pair bp          homology to the  and  untranslated regions of the          targeted gene were used to transform diploid strain          RJD Correct integrants were verified by PCR using          primers that amplified a DNA fragment that spanned the          recombination junction Deletions of           CDC and           TEM were carried out similarly To          construct            pMETCDC URA  pWS and            pMETcdc URA  pWS the          corresponding genes from start codon to  bps          downstream of the stop codon were amplified by PCR from          genomic DNA of wild type RJD or           cdc RJD cells and cloned          into the SpeI and SacII sites of RDB a derivative of          pRS containing the           MET promoter inserted between the          HindIII and EcoRI sites                          Isolation of tabmutants          The scheme is outlined in Figure  Ninety independent          cultures of           cdc pMETcdc URA           WY were grown at C in synthetic minimal medium            glucose SD in the absence of methionine For each          culture    cells were plated on SD methionine           mM at C to simultaneously repress expression and          partially inactivate the           cdc allele One to two          colonies were picked from each plate and tested for          viability on SD fluoroorotic acid FOA plates              When more than one colony was picked from a single          plate care was taken to pick colonies of different size          or morphology Out of  colonies tested  survived on          FOA medium Tab  PCR analysis confirmed that all          twenty five colonies had lost the            pMETcdc URA  plasmid          indicating that they were true bypassers of           cdc                           Mutant characterization          To determine if Tab phenotypes were due to single          mutations           cdc tab strains were crossed to           cdc pMETcdc URA and          the resulting diploids were sporulated and dissected          Approximately  of the viable spores should bypass           cdc as indicated by FOA          resistance if the Tab phenotype was due to a single          mutation Out of twenty five mutants fifteen satisfied          this criterion and the other ten were discarded because          they either failed to sporulate or yielded few viable          spores after dissection or did not segregate as single          mutations The same crosses were also used to determine          if Tab was recessive or dominant for every           tab mutant haploid           cdc tab pMETcdcl          URA and diploid           cdccdc tab pMETcdc          URA  cells were pregrown on YPD  yeast          extract peptone   glucose at C for  days          spotted in fold serial dilutions onto SDFOA plates          and the number of FOA resistant colonies from the          diploid was divided by that from the haploid to obtain          ratio P The mutant was defined to be dominant if P           semidominant if P  and recessive if P                     To introduce           tab mutations into the wild type          background           cdc tab strains were crossed to           CDC TAB and           tab spores were verified by          crossing to           cdc pMETCDC URA and          demonstrating that half of the resulting           cdc segregants were FOA          resistant All           cdc tab mutants were also          crossed to strains harboring either           pMETCDC URA pRS          HIS or           pMETCDC URA pRS          LEU to introduce these plasmids The resulting          strains grew better than the original           cdc tab strains and harbored          selectable markers that facilitated subsequent          crosses          To test whether           net           tab can bypass           tem dbf dbf mob          cdc and           cdc we crossed           net

null          mutation          To test temperature sensitivity ts of           tab mutants cells were spotted or          streaked onto YPD plates and incubated at C Their          growth was scored after one to two days          Nop immunolocalization was performed as described          earlier              The chromosome loss assay was carried out using a          strain    backcrossed into the W background by F          Uhlmann When cells were pregrown in YPD liquid instead          of SDURA solid media before being tested on YPD plates          the percentage of colonies that were red or had red          sectors remained similar for wildtype           CDC           TAB             and           bub strains but was  for           net           tab  This number was lower than          the  value observed in Figure  but still          significantly higher than the wildtype value                                     Linkage analysis          To assign           tab mutants to linkage groups           cdc tab pMETCDC URA           strains were crossed against each other and the diploids          were sporulated and dissected If two           tab mutations belonged to the same          linkage group then all spores were expected to survive          on FOA Otherwise approximately one quarter of the          spores would fail to bypass           cdc The alleles of           TAB TAB TAB TAB and           TAB see Table  were assigned          this way The recessive           tab mutants exhibited a ts growth          phenotype that cosegregated with the Tab phenotype          Complementation tests were used to assign two of the ts          mutations as alleles of           tab  After           TAB was shown to be           MTR other           tab alleles were ascertained by          their linkage to the           MTR locus                          Molecular cloning of TABand TAB          To clone           TAB and           TAB tab and           tab mutant strains were          transformed with plasmid libraries harboring yeast          genomic DNA fragments and incubated at C for one day          before being shifted to C     Libraries          constructed by the laboratories of P Heiter ATCC          and R Young    rescued           tab and a  library          ATCC     rescued           tab Transformants enough to          cover multiple genome equivalents were screened and          plasmids retrieved from colonies that grew at C were          retransformed into the original mutant strain to verify          their complementation activity Candidate plasmids were          sequenced and the genomic regions containing the          complementing activity were identified           TAB resided on Chromosome XV           and           TAB on Chromosome X           To confirm that these genomic fragments          indeed carried the           TAB genes complementing fragments          were cloned into the integrating vector pRS LEU          and linearized to target integration into the           tab locus in a           cdcTRP tab pMETCDC          URA  strain The transformants lost their Tab          phenotype and when crossed to           cdcTRP pMETCDC          URA the diploid yielded no spores that could          bypass           cdc n   Since both          genomic fragments contained multiple open reading frames          ORFs each ORF was amplified by PCR from yeast genomic          DNA and cloned into the integrating plasmid pRS The          resulting plasmids were transformed into           cdcTRP tab pMETCDC          URA  to identify the ORF that reversed the Tab          phenotype This analysis revealed           TAB to be           MTR and           TAB to be           YJLW NET                           Gene replacement

primers that amplified a DNA fragment that spanned          the recombination junction To assay if           SIC  or           HCT was required for the Tab          phenotype of           tab mutants           SIC or           HCT was replaced by           his in           cdcTRP tab pMETCDC          URA  strains Each transformant was assayed for the          occurrence of correct integration and its ability to          survive on FOA                          Cell cycle synchronization          Cells were grown in  yeast extract  peptone YP          with  glucose YPD  galactose YPG or
