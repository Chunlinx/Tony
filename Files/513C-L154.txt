              August        Dear Classmates of       The time of our th reunion is rapidly approaching  well be      celebrating that event in Bloomington September    By now you      should have received registration materials for the Fall Alumni Dental      Conference If you have not please call the IU Alumni Association       right away      Our class along with  other reunion classes has been challenged to      support a program which will directly benefit IUSD students Remember the      student lounge which we enjoyed so much  where we played euchre with      some of our teachers Healy Boyd Buck Humphries Boesinger and others       where some ate their lunches and  some even studied      Well the student lounge today is much larger and in a different      location and it badly needs upgrading so that it can be a more      comfortable place for students to break the tension of their heavy      academic load much heavier than what we experienced      Together I think we can make a contribution to that upgrading of the      lounge which will be very meaningful for the students I have sent a      check for  and hope that you will consider a like gift or more      By the way it must have been  years ago or more when I was a member      of the faculty that the dean told me they were going to refurnish our old      student lounge and asked if I would like to have one of the old octagon      shaped oak tables They were pretty beat up and the tops well covered      with carvings of teeth initials etc He said that I might midnite      requisition one Well I did and sometime later removed it to my cottage      in Canada and used decopor a thick clear glazed resin on the top I      think it is preserved forever Anyway I treasure that table Someone      carved expertly  on it A well carved C F Pope appears on it as      does Bob Bergman  Also carved on the top are the Greek letters of      all three fraternities Its obvious from the beautiful carvings of teeth      on the surface that we had a good instruction in dental anatomy      Someone made it possible for us to have the benefit of that lounge      which Im sure you can all still picture in your minds By contributing      to the upgrading of todays student lounge we have the opportunity to      in a small way provide a part of the memories of IU that will last a      lifetime You may recall from my earlier letter regarding our th      reunion that a room in the Union Building has been reserved for our use      following the banquet on Friday A bartender will be available and we      will have a chance to enjoy reminiscing the equivalent of our four      academic years together and the happenings during the time that has      transpired since our graduation  years ago      Hope you will be present
