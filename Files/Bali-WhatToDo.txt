hypnotic tones of the gamelan orchestra or the alluring call of the disco beat at Kuta or Legian where the action begins at midnight and lasts until dawn In the rest of the resorts the nightlife is on a much smaller scaleBalis own celebrated culture of dance and drama flourishes on two levels for the visitors and for locals themselves Ask at hotels travel agencies and tourist information offices to find out what is scheduled during your stay Theyll probably point you towards some of the commercial performances put on in several villages mostly in the Ubud area Tickets including transport are sold at the tourist office in Ubud and by many of the tour operators Increasingly the culture is packaged and brought to you in shows staged at hotels Some of these are of a very high standard Dedicated dancers and musicians usually do give their best But inevitably the atmosphere is different when they are performing for untutored tourists eating dinner rather than for an expert village audienceand above all for their godsDrama and dance students will think that theyve gone to heaven when they see the unique temple ceremonies If you are invited be prepared to wait for a long time Starting times are highly elastic and then some events will last for many hours Many of the dances of Bali are also performed in western Lombok either for the Balinese community there or increasingly for the tourists at Senggigi hotels Lombok also has its own special dances which are rarely staged commercially Some are for men onlyone simulating battle preparations probably derives from the Islamic tradition The gandrung dance closely resembles Balis joged in that a girl picks a male partner from the audience Another group of dances is based on romantic legends from Sasak mythology dating back to before the advent of Islam Westernstyle nightlife is limited to Senggigi where some hotels run discos and local groups play in the barrestaurantsThe puppet shadow plays called wayang kulit leather puppet are not so often put on for touriststhe plots are too complex and the plays last too long up to two days for foreign consumption A temple ceremony may give you a chance to join the audience for a while You may look behind the screenits permittedto see the dalang or puppet master expertly controlling the beautiful figures speaking all of their lines in a vast range of appropriate voices while conducting the small orchestraDances of BaliLegong This is the visitors favorite dance performed by three young girls two principal dancers the legongs no more than  or  years old and an attendant Each is exquisitely dressed in glittering songket fabrics and wears a gilded and jeweled headdress embellished with fresh frangipani plumeria flowers The usual version legong kraton is the tale of a king and the princess he has abducted performed by the two principals who using various hand and facial gestures portray the attempted seduction Kecak Part of a much longer ritual trancedance which is called sanghyang this is mostly performed separately Up to  men in sarongs crouch in concentric circles around a flickering lamp and chant hypnotically while the story is acted out in the center of the circle Taken from the Ramayana the dance concerns Rama and Sita and the monkey armies of Hanuman and Sugriwa hence the kecaks popular title of Monkey Dance The dance as performed today was choreographed by the German artist Walter Spies who did so much to influence art in the Ubud region during the sPendet Six or more girls carrying trays of flower petals open the evening by scattering the petals over the stage as a symbol of welcome At the same time a man may light an incenseburning lamp At temple ceremonies the pendet is danced to welcome the godsJanger Twelve boys and twelve girls in groups of six form a square the girls kneeling and swaying together to the music like reeds in the wind The boys wearing false moustaches try to impress the girls as they strut and preen like fighting roostersJoged A whole family of dances shares this name performed to the music of an orchestra of bamboo xylophones and gongs But one properly called the jegog has become so popular that it alone is often considered to be joged A young woman dances alone at first and then taps members of the audience in turn to dance with her Try as they may to flirt or show off she easily slips away from their advances Few Westerners look anything but clumsy in comparisonBarong A mythical lionlike animal the barong is covered in long hair and little mirrors Animated by two men it fights against the evil Rangda queen of the witches Her long clawlike fingernails hold a white cloth to hide her terrible face bulging eyes fangs and flaming tongue while she advances on her victims Allies of the barong men wearing sarongs and each carrying a kris try to attack Rangda but she puts them under a spell In a trance they turn the knives on themselves Only the reappearance of the barong saves themIn daily performances for visitors each morning at Batubulan for instance the trances are inevitably simulated Late at night in a village however you would see the wildeyed men in a genuine frenzy or collapsing at the climax into unconsciousness until revived by priests who sprinkle them with holy waterOther Dances Other performances you might see include scenes from the Hindu epic drama the Ramayana staged as a ballet These may well be a showcase for fine dancing gorgeous costumes and the full range of the gamelan orchestra In the topeng the dancers are masked meaning that they can convey character and emotion through movement alone The stories are taken from Balinese history and mythology Kebyar is the name of a group of solo dances of which the best known are performed by a seated man using only the upper body Baris is a vehicle for groups of young male dancers to display their command of technique conveying a great range of emotionsFestivals and EventsMost festivals are fixed by calendars different from the Western version see page  so they change each year Look for the Indonesian Directorate of Tourisms annual Calendar of Events which is published in Bali and gives dates and locations of temple festivals Two celebrations stick to fixed dates The Walter Spies festival in February and the summer Arts Festival with superb performances which is held in Denpasar in late June and early JulyShoppingBali produces a wide range and large quantity of crafts in every medium Most of the decorative arts and crafts originally had a religious connection as temple embellishments offerings or ceremonial dress The land yielded plenty to eat without the need to work all day every day so people had time to create objects of beauty The tradition continues although production has been multiplied by the demand for souvenirs Some craft shops in the villages have workshops attached or you can watch the carvers painters or weavers in the adjoining compoundIn the past nothing was expected to last The climate and insects saw to that So hardly anything is very oldAntiques Made to Order shop signs give the game away Wood carvings Dozens of villages devote themselves to Balis biggest craft business Mas see page  is the bestknown with hundreds of carvers and countless shops Behind the scenesbut you may be invited for a visitfathers pass on their skills to their sons while the women do the polishing or painting The best carvings are superb sculptures but even the simplest cheapest article can make an appealing souvenir Among the massed garuda birds and masks youre bound to find something beautiful The sign Parasite Carvings might puzzle you A new idea imported from the West is to take the galls and other strange growths that occur on tree trunks and carve them into a witty or grotesque design using the natural shapeJewelry The village of Celuk see page  specialized in producing silver and gold jewelry for centuries so when tourism arrived its position on the DenpasarUbud road was ideal Dozens of tour buses stop at the big shops but there are many little workshops worth visiting too The smiths can produce any style from intricate filigree work to simple bracelets You dont have to go to Celuk though since every resort area has its share of shops Silver should bear the  stamp of sterling silver meaning its  pureClothes and Fabrics Bali is a huge bargain basement for a selection of beachwear casual clothing and at a higher price but still excellent value fashion designs For the biggest choice of shops go to Kuta and look for dresses shirts sarongs and coverups in traditional batik fabric Batik dyeing technique uses hot wax to draw or stamp a design on cloth before dipping it in the dye so that the waxed areas are left undyed The process can be repeated a number of times for greater complexity Java is the source of the batik for dresses and sarongs sold in fashion shops Balinese versions are usually much coarser Hawkers will swear that their dress lengths of cheap printed cotton are batik Its easy to tell that they are not Printed patterns dont penetrate fully to the other side while the real batik will show thin veins of color where the dye runs along tiny cracks in the wax printed versions may try to simulate this Real batik is always much more expensive Used batik sarongs are highly prized as their patterns are often no longer produced Used batik can be bought for very low fixed prices at textile shops like Alec on Jalan Legian in KutaLegianEndek or ikat fabrics using threads dyed in patterns before weaving come from Gianyar in Bali as well as other Indonesian islands In Bali only the weavers of Tenganan make grinsing or double ikat using patterndyed threads for both warp and weft The genuine fabric is justifiably expensivebeware of fakes You can find bold primitive examples of ikat cloth especially from islands such as Sumba Flores and Timor in good textile shopsPaintings If you want a unique work of art youll need to study the field Visit the major collections to judge the standard of the best paintings especially the Neka Museum and Museum Puri Lukisan in Ubud see page  as well as the Arts Centre in Denpasar see page  Dont just assume that a high price guarantees original workAnd More Look for the basketry from Bona leather wayang kulit puppets from Puaya near Sukawati and decorative umbrellas on roadside stalls east of KlungkungShops take advantage of the tourist traffic to sell the products of other islands tooembroidery and songket fabrics from Sumatra primitive art from Irian Jaya and silver from SulawesiLombok Craft skills in Lombok tend to be devoted to household objects that can have a somewhat austere functional beauty Look for the delicate tightlywoven basketware whether in mats boxes bowls and bags or the common Lombok souvenir of a model ricebarn Painted wood boxes to store spices tobacco or jewelry are attractive Simple red pottery comes from Penujak and black pots from Rungkang are bound in an intricately woven basketNecessities Some supermarkets and convenience stores have opened in Denpasar such as Tiara Dewata on Jalan Jenderal Sutoyo with books shoes cosmetics and even a playground for children and a swimming pool There is a similar big shopping center near the airport while smaller ones can be found in Kuta Nusa Dua Senggigi and Lombok In big towns modern grocery shops with big red K signs CircleK are open  hours a day and sell all kinds of necessitiesBali FORCHILDRENThe Balinese treasure their children and yours will get the same treatment Some resorts run childrens activity programs during the day show videos in the early evening and at night offer a babysitting service when you want to go off on your own In losmen and homestay accommodations the children of the owners family will probably want to make friends and the older girls may offer to act as babysittersChildren will of course revel in the hotel pools and the beaches the slides at the Waterbom park in Tuban and when the conditions are right they can learn to snorkel sail and windsurfbut think about their safety The wellplanned Taman Burung Bali Bird Park with over a hundred species of birds is always a hit with children
