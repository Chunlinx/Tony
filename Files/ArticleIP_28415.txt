adistinguished Israeli author and sometime political commentator wrote Mondayin the Israeli daily Yediot Aharanot  The main issue that got thiscampaign going was not the final status agreement with the Palestinians  butthe prime ministers problematic personality In the same paper Emuna Elonwrote that Israel could not trust Labor Party leader Ehud Barak Israel wantschange but Israel cannot settle for a nonleader like Barak a man who untiltwo months ago was said even by his supporters to be not taking off untilhe was suddenly reinforced by a battalion of expensive American advisers whotaught him to recite some slogans convincingly            Asopinion polls showed Benjamin Netanyahu likely to lose in Mondays nationalelections in Israel the liberal daily Haaretz urged a largeturnout by voters opposed to him so as to ensure his defeat It described hisstatements in the final days of the campaign as further proof of his lack ofresponsibility The conservative Jerusalem Post said a pall

interview Their commitment and leadership is something for whichPresident Clinton should be praised rather than the sneers he receives fromthe Right in this country            TheIndependentled Monday with the angle that Blair is isolated on the ground war issue Itquoted a senior Nato source as saying that not only the United States butalso Germany is still against committing ground troops because it could lead tounknown repercussions from Russia and cause governments to fall in ItalyGreece and the Czech Republic It quoted a British government source as sayingthere is no threat to the Bill and Tony relationship but that Britain wantsNATO to get a move on and face up to the decision In an editorial the Independent said that Blair a hawkwithout wings has been allowed to become isolated by

while the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy inBelgrade provoked widespread indignation NATO leaders instead of changingtheir stand have continued the barbaric raids on an even larger scale againstYugoslavia It said It is well known that the Kosovo issue is an internalaffair of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia involving complex ethnic andreligious contradictions  Events over the past  days have demonstratedthat the lunatic bombing of Yugoslavia by USled NATO has not solved theKosovo crisis Instead it has caused a larger exodus of refugees and seriouslydevastated stability and peace
