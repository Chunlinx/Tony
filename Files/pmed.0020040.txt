                    DESCRIPTION of CASE        A yearold white male with no significant past medical history is referred by his        workplace to a primary care physician for an elevated blood pressure BP He presents to        the clinic with no complaints His mother and grandmother both have diabetes and his        father has hypertension He has had a pound lb weight gain over the last year and has        become more sedentary        His BP is  mm Hg pulse is  beats per minute bpm weight is  lb and height        is   On examination he displays moderate central obesity but otherwise the        examination is normal His fasting cholesterol is  mgdl to convert milligrams per        deciliter of cholesterol total HDL or LDL to micromoles per liter divide by         lowdensity lipoprotein LDL is  mgdl highdensity lipoprotein HDL is  mgdl        triglycerides TG are  mgdl to convert mgdl of triglycerides to mmoll divide by         and fasting glucose is  mgdl to convert mgdl of glucose to mmoll divide by                          What Is the diagnosis          This patient meets the diagnostic criteria for the metabolic syndrome as defined by          the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines  Any          three or more of the criteria make this diagnosis see Table  Intensive lifestyle          modifications such as exercise and weight loss should be made to improve cholesterol          blood pressure and other cardiovascular disease CVD risk factors  It may be timely          to address the prevention of diabetes in patients with metabolic syndrome since these          patients are at high risk for development of type  diabetes Lifestyle changes delay the          onset or prevent the incidence of type  diabetes in patients with glucose intolerance a          key feature of metabolic syndrome  The patient is started on an exercise and weight          loss program sent for nutritional counseling and scheduled for a return clinic          appointment for three months later                          Two Years Later          The patient returns to the clinic two years later He presents with complaints of          increasing frequency of urination and episodes of blurry vision He has nocturia and has          lost  lb in the last week Otherwise his review of systems is unremarkable His blood          pressure is  mm Hg pulse  bpm and weight  lb His fundoscopic examination is          normal He continues to have moderate central obesity Current medications are a thiazide          diuretic  mg once daily QD started one year prior A nonfasting blood sugar is           mgdl                      Can a diagnosis be made            There are three criteria for the diagnosis of type  diabetes as defined by the            American Diabetes Association ADA of which any one is sufficient to make the            diagnosis see Box  This patient meets the criteria for type  diabetes He does not            need to have a fasting blood sugar done because a random glucose greater than  mgdl            with symptoms of diabetes meets the first criterion Failing to comply with lifestyle            modification his weight has increased  lb in two years and likely contributes to his            development of diabetes Of note his recent weight loss is presumably due to overt            hyperglycemia and glycosuria further underestimating his true weight increase            His additional investigations are as follows fasting glucose  mgdl hemoglobin            Ac HbA            c   and urine albumintocreatinine ratio  mgmmol            normal is  mgmmol in men and  mgmmol in women LDL is  mgdl HDL             mgdl and TG  mgdl His electrocardiogram is normal                                    What are the next steps in management at this time          Diabetes management should involve a multifaceted goaldirected approach which          includes dietary modifications diabetes education assessment of blood sugar readings          and pharmacotherapy The ADA recommends glycemic and other CVD risk factor goals see          Table  in addition to foot evaluation and screening for nephropathy and retinopathy          for all adults with diabetes  The patient is started on metformin  mg twice daily          BID with meals Therapy with metformin appears to decrease the risk of diabetesrelated          endpoints including a reduction in cardiovascular events independent of glycemic          control There is also less weight gain and fewer hypoglycemic attacks than with insulin          and sulphonylureas Therefore metformin may be an effective firstline pharmacotherapy          of choice in these patients  There are several oral hypoglycemic agents ie          sulfonylureas metformin acarbose and thiazolidinediones that are effective          monotherapy for reducing hyperglycemia          The patient is also started on lowdose aspirin indicated for primary prevention of          macrovascular disease in people with diabetes who have any risk factors for CVD  and          a cholesterollowering agent a statin for his increased LDL cholesterol  He is          given a glucose meter is scheduled to have diabetes education classes and diabetes          nutritional counseling for a calorie ADA diet and is instructed to record his          premeal blood sugars Smoking cessation is another important aspect of diabetes          management to address He returns in three months for followup and has an HbAc of           at which time no additional therapy is started                          Three Years Later          The patient is now  years old and returns for a followup appointment He states          that he has felt pins and needles in his feet and fingertips He has had difficulty          with maintaining erections but has a normal libido Blood sugars are  mgdl in the          mornings and  mgdl in the evenings and the patient reports no hypoglycemic          events He has diminished sensation to vibration over his right great toe and left toes          and heel with intact monofilament sensation The remainder of his examination is          unchanged His medications are metformin at  g BID a thiazide diuretic at  mg QD a          statin QD and an aspirin QD He is  lb BP is  mm Hg and pulse is  bpm          Recent laboratory tests produced the following results a HbAc of  a fasting          glucose of  mgdl and normal electrolytes creatinine and liver enzymes Fasting          lipids are LDL  mgdl HDL  mgdl and TG  mgdl                      What additional diagnostic tests would be helpful at this time and why            A spot urine albumintocreatinine ratio is  mgmmol This measurement technique            is preferred because it has lower rates of falsepositive and falsenegative results            than a spot urine microalbumin Persistent microalbuminuria should be confirmed on two            or three subsequent readings within a sixmonth period to rule out falsepositive            results The elevated ratio of microalbumin in the urine signifies early nephropathy            because microalbuminuria has been shown to progress to macroalbuminuria and eventual            nephropathy in type  and type  diabetes Any degree of albuminuria is a risk factor            for cardiovascular events in individuals with or without diabetes the risk increases            with the level of absolute microalbuminuria  Therefore screening for            microalbuminuria should be done annually in all people with type  and type  diabetes                        Annual screening for diabetic retinopathy should be performed in all people with            diabetes after an initial evaluation and reassessed more frequently if retinopathy is            diagnosed This patient remains free of retinopathy but a significant number of            patients with type  diabetes have retinopathy at the onset of diagnosis owing to the            insidious nature of type  diabetes and the failure to diagnose type  diabetes early            Tight glycemic control can slow the progression of diabetic retinopathy Figures              and help prevent development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy                                What additional pharmacotherapy should be started at this time            The patient has developed neuropathy and erectile dysfunction both of which are            complications of diabetes He continues to have suboptimal glycemic control therefore            additional therapy in the form of combinations is appropriate The patient is started            on a thiazolidinedione TZD QD With continued elevated systolic BP  mm Hg and            diastolic BP  mm Hg an angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor ACEI is            started An ACEI at this time is appropriate for BP control and has the additional            preventative effects of reducing progression to nephropathy and CVD events  In            addition continued strict BP control is as effective as tight glycemic control in            preventing macrovasular disease in diabetic patients and slowing the progression of            diabetic nephropathy and retinopathy  Erectile dysfunction is a complication            associated with diabetes and can be an early sign of neuropathy and vascular disease            therefore a phosphodiesterase enzyme inhibitor is an appropriate choice for patients            not on vasodilators or with a history of significant CVD The statin dose is increased            to achieve a goal LDL of  mgdl Diabetic neuropathy is a significant cause of            morbidity in diabetes and its progression correlates directly with glycemic control            Tighter glucose control and proper foot care are effective It is important to continue            emphasis on dietary exercise and lifestyle modifications in addition to            pharmacotherapy                                    Five Years Later          The patient returns to clinic today after spending the last three years overseas and          has not seen a physician in two years He complains of fatigue occasional blurry vision          awakening three to four times at night to urinate and diarrhea at least once a week He          says that he has been compliant with his diabetes medications but has gained  lb in the          last six months His medications include metformin at  g BID a TZD BID and an ACEI          QD His blood sugar is  mgdl fasting BP is  mm Hg pulse is  bpm and          weight is  lb There are no foot sores or ulcers but he has diminished sensation to          monofilament on the plantar surfaces of both feet The remainder of his examination is          unchanged including normal fundoscopy His HbAc is  LDL is  mgdl and spot          urine albumintocreatinine ratio is  mgmmol His creatinine and liver enzymes are          normal His premeal blood sugars average  mgdl                      What is the next most appropriate step in his medical management            He continues to have an elevated HbAc worsening neuropathy and weight gain which            prompt a more effective treatment strategy There are several options for            pharmacotherapy available to choose from at this point The patient could begin a third            oral agent after maximizing the doses of metformin and TZD or he could begin insulin            injections with or without additional oral agents Because of the significant cost            associated with three oral medications and his need for further glycemic control            insulin would be an appropriate choice at this time However he should be advised of            the side effect of additional weight gain when beginning insulin therapy                                      DISCUSSION        This case presentation illustrates an otherwise healthy appearing patient who is found        to have the metabolic syndrome and despite evidencebased management develops type         diabetes This patient likely represents the natural history of type  diabetes in most        patients Mild hypertension is often the only presenting sign of metabolic syndrome and        prediabetes allowing an opportunity for prevention of type  diabetes        There is an association between metabolic syndrome and the development of CVD and type         diabetes  This syndrome is characterized not only by the criteria given in Table         but also by a state of compensatory hyperinsulinemia  However a diagnosis of        metabolic syndrome alone does not imply diabetes as patients with metabolic syndrome can        have a fasting plasma glucose less than  mgdl It is the bodys ability to maintain        glucose utilization and suppress endogenous glucose production in the setting of this        compensatory hyperinsulinemia that separates metabolic syndrome from diabetes The effect        of this hyperinsulinemic state in metabolic syndrome is also believed to be involved in        excess proinflammatory and prothrombotic markers associated with the development of        diabetes and CVD  These patients develop diabetes when tissues of the body fail to        utilize glucose appropriately owing to increased resistance to insulin and concomitant        betacell dysfunction of the pancreas         Metformin is in the class of biguanides and works by decreasing hepatic glucose output        and increasing insulin action in tissues Metformin has been suggested to help prevent the        onset of diabetes but is less effective than diet and lifestyle changes  Other        medications shown to possibly delay or prevent the onset of type  diabetes are ACEI and        angiotensin II receptor blockers  Patients treated with diuretics can progress to        type  diabetes even though thiazide diuretics are proven effective in treating        hypertension         Intensive therapy in patients with type  diabetes results in a decreased risk of        microvascular complications therefore it is appropriate to use combinations of        medications in patients with suboptimal glycemia  The class of TZDs works to lower        plasma glucose levels by increasing insulin sensitivity in muscle and liver  TZDs        lower mean HbAc modestly when added to metformin as compared to metformin alone  Side        effects include weight gain and water retention and patients with a history of New York        Heart Association class III or IV heart failure should not use TZDs         The pathophysiology of type  diabetes involves in part a relative deficiency of        insulin Although a state of endogenous hyperinsulinemia occurs the degree of tissue        resistance causes a total decrease in effective endogenous insulin Progression of        disease is also attributed to worsening betacell dysfunction and decreased release of        insulin  Insulin is used in a variety of combinations and is individualized to patient        lifestyle A frequent starting dose consists of a long or intermediateacting insulin        such as NPH insulin divided into morning and evening doses or insulin glargine given QD        usually at bedtime The patient whose case is described here was started on NPH at bedtime        which decreases overnight hepatic glucose production such that the patient begins the        morning with nearnormal glycemia for daytime oral therapy There may be times when a        postmeal surge in glucose requires extra insulin in addition to the intermediateacting        NPH In such a case using a shortacting regular insulin before meals provides insulin        action that closely approximates normal insulin secretion Figure  The rapidacting        lispro and aspart insulins have an even shorter halflife and quicker onset of action than        regular insulin Common empirical initiation doses range from  units of insulin per        kilogram per  hours Patients should be advised of hypoglycemia and weight gain as the        main side effects of insulin therapy Insulin and insulinsensitizer combinations        significantly improve hyperglycemia however there is an increased incidence of heart        failure reported with this combination prompting close monitoring of patients for signs        and symptoms of heart failure         In summary diabetes prevention and management is an important goal in practice The        morbidity and mortality from diabetes is a significant burden to health care emphasizing        the need for effective prevention and control of diabetes in improving outcomes
