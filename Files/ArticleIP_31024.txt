DearPrudence                                                      Just a quick commenton the poor advice you gave to a woman inquiring about a  I married someonewho was briefly married before However I was a firsttime bride It is mycontention that if you accept an invitation to attend an expensive blacktieaffair that you should bring a gift of at least the value of your meal I wasoutraged and shocked that anyone would give a gift of less than that If theydid not attend a similar albeit somewhat less expensive gift would have beenacceptable I think it is incredibly poor taste rude and offensive for anyoneto bring a token giftespecially if one party has never been married Shameon you for promoting bad manners                                       RS                        Dear R            Prudie is guessing yousubscribe to Soldier of Fortune magazine because you are certainly amercenary Prudie also suspects that your husbands prior bride may havesnagged some fabulous presents thereby irritating you because youfeelcorrectlythat people will not spring for two terrific presents within ashort period of time What is actually in incredibly poor taste is to mentallymake a quid pro quothe quid being the meal the quo being the gift Presentsmy dear have to do with ones finances and ones feelingsnot the cost of ameal And how exactly by your lights are guests supposed to know thecost of the meal Do you by any chance suggest having it engraved under therpondez sil vous plat             Prudie alarmedly                                             DearPrudence                                                      My coworkerrecently announced her wedding and mentioned that everyone should be receivingtheir invitations soon I decided to give her an elaborate wedding shower andto include all the women and their spouses who work with us I coordinatedthis event from A to Z Everyone chipped in  per couple for a travelcertificate to be used for their honeymoon About  people attended and theevent went off without a hitch My friend was extremely grateful My questionis Am I still responsible for buying a wedding gift I wasnt sure if it wouldbe in poor taste for me to consider my efforts and contribution to the showerenough                                       Sincerely                                       Unsure                        Dear Un            Ah yes we are still inJune the month for brides Your query involves some interesting concepts Wemust assume that the woman for whom you organized the shower was a close friend otherwise why else go to all that trouble Given that your effortsinvolved a lot of time and perhaps paying for the party and afforded thecouple a wonderful celebratory evening along with  to apply to theirhoneymoon expenses Prudie feels you have given them a grand wedding gift Whydont you write a note telling the bridal couple that you had such funarranging their party and that you and all the guests at the shower will havefond thoughts of them while they are away honeymooning That way they will knowthat was the gift you wanted to give them            Prudie sentimentally                                             DearPrudie                                                      In reference to theletter from  who was worried about children catching the bouquet I wasmarried last summer and gave all the children under  a chance to catch asmall stuffed animal before I threw the bouquet to the older girls This workedout really well and I highly recommend it to anyone That way my maid ofhonor could catch the bouquet without my yearold cousin trippingher                                       CC                        Dear C            Sweet Smart And whatfun if a youngster misunderstands the custom just a little and imagines shewill grow up to marry Winnie the Pooh            Prudie delightedly                                             DearPrudence                                                      I am alienated from all my brothers and sistersexcept one for good reason We do not communicate No problem there But nowtheir childrenmy nieces and nephewsare beginning to make overtures to me emails letters invitations to graduations requests to visit to writerecommendation letters etc This even though I have tried to keep my addressesand phone numbers secret                Am I being unreasonable to extend my desireto remain incommunicado to the next generation Dont advise me to make up withmy siblings I am quite happy to be divorced from them                                       Thanks                                       Pat                        Dear Pat            Are you very rich orfamous Mention of your addresses and phone numbers along with all theseyoung people lurching in your direction would suggest there is an attractionbeyond the obvious You sound a bit misanthropic to be honest but assumingyou have supportable reasons for ringing off from many in your family Prudiesees no reason to cut off the next generation It is a possibility that thediscarded siblings have put their children up to warming up the situation butthat seems slight If you have no interest in children or these particularchildren decline the entreaties  but as gently as you can            Prudie delicately
