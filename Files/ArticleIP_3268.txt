                                 Sound of Mind            Professional musicmakingworks along the principle best defined by Chevy Chase when he openedSaturday Night Live s Weekend Update with the portentous phrase Goodevening Im Chevy Chase And youre not Whether they play rock or countryclassical music or jazz performers are engaged in a conversation with oneanother and with their predecessors The rest of us are listening in althoughthere have always been some who dont like feeling forced into silence PoetAdrienne Rich for example called Beethovens Ninth music of theentirely isolated soul yelling at Joy from the tunnel of the ego musicwithout the ghost of another person in it            Tod Machover a composerbased at MITs Media Lab thinks computers will bring the isolation of themusical soul to an end In this he is partly influenced by the Media Lab whichchampions the idea that a seamless global web of information will soon blur theline between reader and writer performer and listener But Machover also likesto quote late pianist Glenn Gould who said that the best of all possibleworlds is one in which art would be unnecessary  The audience would bethe artist and their life would be art            Machovers Brain Opera is a performancecuminteractive stunt Roughlyan hour long it was presented seven times a day over the course of severaldays at the Lincoln Center Festival in New York it closed Aug  In itMachover weds Goulds Whitmanesque vision to John Cages Zeninspired idea thatmusic is not sounds chosen by a composer but a quality of awareness about whatyoure hearing The vehicle for all this is the expensive complicated andmost unZenlike apparatus of computerized electronic music Brain Operasupplies members of its audience with a variety of strangelooking digitalinstruments and asks that they play around with them We not only get toexplore a cool new technology we get to collaborate with the composer We movetoward being the artist our lives the art In theory anyway                           B               rain Opera begins in the Julliard School lobby which hasbeen transformed into a thicket of plastics molded into shapes suggestive offruits or plants or maybe cells We mill around in the dark among themachines some of which emit fanfares drumrolls or gusts of melody so thatbetween the bumbling and waitingtotry and noise we feel much as we might ina video arcade The games though are more interesting            TheGesture Wall for instance puts a little zip of electricity through youwhich makes you intelligible to some sensors in front of you which means youcan play snippets of music and sound by gesticulating My fillings vibrateda little though that could have been caused by the ambient noise There arealso dirigibleshaped pods about the size of beach balls that depending on howhard you hit the nubby pads that stick out of them cause nearby speakers tospit out percussive clicks and bops Another device is called The SpeakingTree it engages you in conversation about music You can have any type ofdiscussion you want provided its the one Machover expected What is yourfavorite piece of music asks the Tree I dont know say you When youhear it what do you feel asks the Tree            Machover wanted the experience to feel like walking intosomebodys brain while a piece of music is being created because as the namesuggests Brain Opera is about the nature of mind It is based on thetheories of Marvin Minsky an artificial intelligence expert at MIT who holdsthat consciousness is built up of loosely connected separate processes What Ithink of as me says Minsky is actually a pattern that emerges as a lot ofcomponents of my brain go about their business of seeing or hearing or eatingor whatever it is they domuch the way a traffic pattern emerges out of theactions of a lot of drivers or an opera performance out of the actions ofmusicians singers a conductor and a stage manager Brain Opera bothpresents and enacts Minskys theories The music emerges in part out of ournoodling around with the gizmos right before we go in to hear it            After ahalf hour or so in the lobby were led into the recital hall where Machoverappears and explains that some  percent of the piece is in place before and percent will be created at this performance He and two colleagues taketheir seats Machovers is inside a more professional version of the GestureWall He ignites Brain Opera with a sequence of chopping hand motionsand vigorous leanings in his chair picture the Enterprise under attack thisbrings forth a sonic crash from the computer We hear a lot of musicalquotationsfrom Igor Stravinskys Rite of Spring to Leonard BernsteinsCandide to Bob Dylan and Duke Ellingtonthat bounce around a theme fromthe Ricercare of Bachs Musical Offering  Images that would work wellon album covers fly by on big screens the moon a baby the great red spot ofJupiter We hear a comment or two from the Speaking Trees I think it has todo with the electrons in the air music changes your mood very definitelyThe words of the libretto zip past on the screens Prerecorded voices sing itto New Age melodies A red square appears signifying apparently that peoplelogged on to the Brain Opera Web page who are participating in the pieceon virtual instruments are now being sampled and folded into the work                           I t is all quitelively and far from dull But by the end I feel a little glazed and tiredmuch as I might feel after too much time spent on the Web or reading somebodyshypertextual novel Theres the same sense of scope and technical masteryand absence at the core I missed the individual voice the unique andcompelling emotional timbre of the sort that characterizes less interactivemusicincluding Machovers own when hes not trying to bring the whole worldinto it Also performed at the festival for example were his works forhyperinstruments electronic versions of a cello viola and violin which heinvented himself Each of these compositions suggested the powerful currents ofone souls anguish jauntiness fragile serenity But Brain                Operais swamped by the sound of Whatever of Nothing in Particular            Giving up his musicalindividuality it turns out has not paid Machover back with a glimpse ofGoulds perfect world From the moment we are guided into the play arcade eachalone each face to face with technology designed and controlled by MIT we aremaneuvered along paths laid down for us We are no more collaborating than alab mouse collaborates with a medical researcher Brain Opera is anopera and we are not
