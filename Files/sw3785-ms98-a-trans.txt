                school teacher or do you have anything to do with anything in schools or   no i dont no   no huh   not that really much exposure in the in the recent past either how about yourself   no uh not a lot ive got a couple of friends that work uh as teachers or you know in in different school districts and different things but uh   umhum and do you have any children   i i have a daughter thats only eighteen months though so we havent got exposed too much to that but   uhhuh yeah   you can sure see where it seems like uh theres a lot of concern for everything going downhill and they blame a lot of it on education i i kind of wonder i dont know if you blame the system or if you blame the kids and the parents for not studying or making the kids study hard enough or exactly what   yeah yeah i think its probably a combination you know i think probably parents expect a lot more out of the school system than its realistic that that the school system can provide   umhum for them to get uhhuh   and in conjunction a lot of um school districts funds have been cut because of at least in California thats the case its probably the case elsewhere too   sure yeah well theyve been cut yeah i just it seems like more and more with uh more families having to resort to you know to two incomes and stuff theres not the time that they spend and so they like you say they expect the the schools to do more of it but hell theres only so many in hours a day   i dont even know if its just because um people are working you know both parents are working outside the home as much as it its a matter of   umhum   well its kind of a philosophical philosophical expectation about whos responsible for discipline you know its   oh you know i think thats a good point its really a good point   it you know you you could be working full time and um still be able to work with your child and provide some guidance at home and   uhhuh   in terms of homework as well as the the you know discipline for whats important in terms of values and i think thats probably something that not as many kids get i mean just i guess   uhhuh yeah   i say that because you see it reflected in the society at large there are a lot of kids out there who seem more troubled today than they used to be   umhum yeah i uh you know it seems like i remember on school nights you know i was never outside past eight you know maybe nine oclock at the very latest whether i was in doing homework or not you know i may not have been but yet there was that influence in the home to where i was at least you know getting prepared for the next day or whatever and and youre you know youre right in saying you dont see a lot of that theres out running around and uh doing a lot of different things that   umhum umhum maybe TVs a bigger um   yeah TV and Nintendo   competitor for their time     yeah thats probably true theres a lot more uh   and when we were kids   yeah thats true i know you know i didnt appreciate i i was you know fortunate to where i could i kind of breezed through high school without too much problem stuff and and didnt really learn how to study that much until i hit college   umhum   but boy i sure wish now that i had picked that up earlier because you know took me a couple of years in college before i really started getting the grades going and you know it affects your whole life especially when you hit college if you dont you know do as well as you can it can it can follow you for quite a while so   yeah thats a good point just learning the discipline to to to study   yeah to sit and study and i dont know its its you know i only have the the one daughter and shes quite young but it makes you a little nervous to know what they have to deal with you know in the future and get prepared for them but   umhum umhum well probably having gone through that experience youll be likely to want to speak speak with her uh teachers and really try to communicate with them to find out what it is that you can do to help her at home   umhum umhum do you have any children at all or   our daughters two so im in sort of in the same boat that you are   oh yeah same boat yeah have you uh have you ever considered private schools at all or   well you know were coming up on the time shes probably going to be ready for shes in a day care situation now because my husband and i both work full time but um   uhhuh uhhuh   i think shell probably be ready for preschool around three or three and a half and after that time we really do need to think about it because in San Francisco in our neighborhood theres actually a good public schools at the elementary grade theres not a really decent middle school or high school im not sure well be in the same area when shes that old but um   umhum umhum   i have to really do the research to find out whether or not the public schools stand up to the private schools and what the costs are and all that   yeah   its really the the expense is a real issue  when you think about   yeah thats true thats true yeah i i am i like a lot of the times you know i think the social aspect can be maybe as important and in a lot of ways as the education they get uh   umhum umhum   sometimes i wonder if they can get that same thing in a in a private high school or   well i dont know how it is in your community i know that um   or not   in some communities of San Francisco the public schools well actually its not so much in the city actually its outside more in the east Oakland or east bay   umhum   um the public schools are so poor that the private schools have just really grown as a response to the fact that the parents dont feel that theyre getting getting what they want in the public schools so theyre almost like public   umhum
