                            Evolutionary developmental biology is motivated by the premise that the differences we        see between species are caused by changes that have occurred in the genes that regulate        their developmental programs Beginning in the s general principles began to emerge        about the evolution of development in animals The identification of the         Hox genes in         Drosophila melanogaster and the subsequent discovery of their        conservation and similar expression in different Metazoans led to the revolutionary        realization that many of the mechanisms critical to basic animal development have been        conserved across more than  million years of evolution Many other developmental        pathways such as those specifying the heart and the central nervous system have since        been elucidated and promptly subjected to successful comparative analysis        These celebrated discoveries illustrate ways that very different organisms are at a        fundamental level similar to one another But not all developmental processes are so        conservative an outstanding example is sex determination The majority of animal species        produce two sexes and current phylogenies eg  suggest that sexual dimorphism was        likely a feature of the last common ancestor of the coelomate bilaterians a vast clade of        animals that excludes only sponges ctenophores cnidarians and acoel flatworms However        though critical for development and reproduction the mechanisms that specify sex        determination are among the leastconserved known Marked variation exists in both the        primary sex determination signal and in the downstream genetic pathways that interpret the        signal We are thus presented with our first conundrum sexual differentiation appears to        be an ancient and potentially homologous feature of animal biology yet its genetic        specification suggests multiple origins                    Bewildering Variety        The variety of primary sex determination cues was appreciated long before the advent of        molecular genetics  The two broadest categories are genetic sex determination GSD in        which the sex of offspring is set by a sex chromosome or an autosomal gene and        environmental sex determination ESD in which sex is determined by temperature as with        turtles local sex ratio as with some tropical fish or population density as with        mermithid nematodes Though little is known about the molecular mechanisms of ESD within        the GSD systems many different mechanisms have been uncovered Dual sex chromosome systems        in which either the female ZWZZ or the male XXXY is heterogametic are common as are        systems set by the ratio of the number of X chromosomes to sets of autosomes XA There        are also systems in which heterozygosity at a single locus is required for female        development known as complementary sex determination  as well as systems involving        sex determination via multiple genes with additive effects        Molecular genetic investigations of GSD in model systems such as         Drosophila          Caenorhabditis  and mice have revealed a clear lack of        conservation underscoring the diversity For example although the primary sex        determination signal in both         D melanogaster and         C elegans is the XA ratio the fruit fly pathway consists of a        cellautonomous cascade of regulated mRNA splicing while that of the nematode follows a         Hedgehog like intercellular signaling pathway  GSD in        mammals depends with some interesting exceptionssee  upon a Yspecific dominant gene                Sry  encoding a transcription factor In the face of such        impressive differences perhaps we should question our assumption of homology could it be        that sex determination in different taxa has arisen independently over and over again in        evolution Until  this seemed like a good bet        The discovery of the homology of the key sexdetermining genes         doublesex in         Drosophila and         mab in         C elegans provided the first evidence for a common evolutionary        basis of sex determination in animals  Soon related         doublesexmab DMfamily genes with roles in male sexual development        were discovered in vertebrates and even cnidarians  Here at last was a smoking gun        that could link the diverse metazoan sex determination systems Figure  But as        satisfying as the result was it immediately gave birth to another mystery if the enormous        diversity of sex determination systems are all derived from a common ancestor how could        they possibly have been modified so radically After all sexual differentiation and        reproduction are hardly unimportant developmental processes                    Focusing on Close Relatives        To understand how such diversity came to be we need to look at the differences between        closely related species This approach allows the discovery and interpretation of        smallscale sex determination changes before they are obscured by subsequent changes The        processes discovered in this way might then be reasonably extrapolated to explain the        seemingly unrelated systems of more deeply diverged taxa Work in dipterans  and        nematodes  has revealed three evolutionary phenomena that characterize shorterterm sex        determination evolution        The first of these is the often astounding rate of molecular evolution at the level of        nucleotide and aminoacid sequences Although some sexdetermining genes are well conserved        many show unprecedented substitution rates  An extreme example is the central        integrator of the XA ratio in         Caenorhabditis          xol  The         xol orthologues of the closely related nematodes         C elegans and         C briggsae are a mere  identical  even though genes        surrounding         xol are much better conserved Figure A Remarkably the  neighbor        of         xol  the immunoglobulin         dim  is only  kb away and is essentially identical between        species        A second phenomenon best exemplified by dipteran insects is the modification of        genetic control pathways through the gain or loss of key pathway components Figure B In                Drosophila  the first gene to respond to the XA ratio is         Sxl  whose transcription is regulated by both autosomal and Xlinked        factors very early in development  When X A   ie in female embryos         Sxl transcription occurs and produces Sxl protein Later in development        transcription from a second promoter occurs in both sexes but these transcripts cannot be        productively spliced without the earlier burst of         Sxl expression As a result only females sustain         Sxl expression and in turn only females can productively splice the mRNA        of         tra  its downstream target Productive splicing of         tra is required to produce the femalespecific form of         dsx  a founding member of the DM family mentioned above        In a series of groundbreaking papers Saccone and colleagues investigated the pathway in        the more distantly related heterogametic Mediterranean fruit fly         Ceratitis capitata  The first surprise was that although a        highly conserved         Sxl homologue exists in         Ceratitis  it does not undergo sexspecific regulation similar        to that of         Drosophila  which suggests that it does not play a key switch        role Saccone et al  Similar results have also been found for the housefly         Musca domestica  indicating that the role of         Sxl in sex determination may be restricted to         Drosophila and its closest relatives In contrast         tra and         dsx are key sex regulators in all dipterans examined thus far        A further surprise came when the         Ceratitis tra homologue was characterized  In the case of        this gene clear evidence for sexspecific regulation was found and as with         Drosophila  only females productively splice         tra mRNA However this splicing difference can be explained nicely by a        positive feedback similar to that seen in         Drosophila Sxl  in which Tra protein regulates its own        splicing In  Pane et al proposed that the dominant malespecifying M factor on the        Y chromosome inhibits this autoregulation  As a result males cannot make functional        Tra protein and the male form of Dsx is produced These experiments show not only how a        pathway can evolve but also importantly how XA and heterogametic GSD systems can be        interconverted by modifying the cue that regulates a conserved molecular switch gene the        splicing of         tra mRNA A detailed scenario for how this might occur has recently been        proposed         Finally recent studies of         Caenorhabditis nematodes have shed light on the genetic basis of        the convergent evolution of sex determination related to mating system adaptations An        important factor in this area are new phylogenies of the genus  which consistently        suggest the surprising possibility that the closely related hermaphroditic species         C elegans and         C briggsae acquired selffertilization independently from        distinct gonochoristic malefemale ancestors Figure C Although this scenario is        somewhat uncertain purely on parsimony grounds recent work on the genetic control of the        germline bisexuality that defines hermaphroditism has tipped the balance toward parallel        evolution        Working with         C elegans  Clifford et al  cloned         fog  a gene required for spermatogenesis in hermaphrodites but not in        males Upon doing so it became clear that         fog is part of a large family of Fbox genes and was produced by        several recent rounds of gene duplication The         C briggsae genome sequence suggested that while         C briggsae possesses a similarly large family of Fbox        proteins the duplication event giving rise to         fog was specific to the         C elegans lineage In this issue of         PLoS Biology  Nayak et al  extend this work by rigorously        demonstrating that         fog is indeed absent in         C briggsae  The authors also identify a short Cterminal        domain that makes FOG uniquely able to perform its germline sexdetermining function        This domain is probably derived from a frameshifting mutation in an ancestral gene        Working with         C briggsae  Stothard et al  Haag et al  and Hill        et al unpublished data have also found evidence of important speciesspecific regulation        of germline sex determination RNA interference and gene knockout approaches have shown        that while         C elegans requires the malepromoting genes         fem and         fem to produce sperm in hermaphrodites         C briggsae requires neither Given that both genes have        conserved roles in male somatic sex determination this suggests that         C briggsae evolved hermaphroditism in a way that bypasses these        genes        The longstanding mystery of sex determination and its diversity began by comparisons        between distantly related species Recent work on closer relatives has uncovered processes        that through a reasonable extrapolation enable the connection of these disparate dots into        a fascinating picture of developmental evolution Though the divergence is extreme it is        likely that a better understanding of the evolution of sex determination genes and pathways        holds lessons about the evolution of development in general The next major challenge will        be to integrate the comparative developmental data with the ecological and population        processes that are driving the evolution of sex determination Only then will we be able to        say that the picture is complete
