                    Background        The ability to measure the expression of thousands of        genes at once using microarrays has opened new areas of        research including global examination of the effects of        perturbations on cells or animals and the classification of        tumors by their pattern of gene expression Microarrays        using cDNAs     and oligonucleotides      have        both proven valuable        Commercially available oligonucleotide microarrays        provide a standardized tool that allows assay of thousands        of mRNAs at one time Affymetrix GeneChips contain pairs        of nucleotide sequences probe pairs synthesized on        silica wafers one of each pair exactly matches the        sequence of interest and the other contains a single        mismatching nucleotide in the center      A single        sequence is queried by a group of  to  probe pairs that        constitute a probe set RNA from the sample is converted to        doublestranded cDNA and then labeled by         in vitro transcription with        biotinylated nucleotides The biotinylated cRNA is        hybridized to the GeneChip  unhybridized material is        washed off and the signal is detected using        fluoresceinlabeled Streptavidin            The standard Affymetrix protocol    uses as starting        material  g of total RNA from which biotinylated cRNA        is synthesized This can limit the use of this system for        small samples from biopsies laser capture microdissection        or tissues from model organisms such as mice Mahadevappa        and Warrington    examined the effect of using less        biotinylated cRNA in the hybridization Hybridization        reactions that contained the recommended  g of cRNA        from human endometrium adenocarcinoma cells detected         of the  transcripts on the GeneChip  Reducing the        amount of cRNA in the hybridization to  g reduced the        fraction detected to  and further reducing the cRNA to         g allowed detection of only  of the sequences            Ohyama et al    tested a modified protocol for        synthesizing biotinylated cRNA from very small amounts of        starting material Total RNA from laser capture        microdissected human oral cancer tissues was converted into        cDNA and transcribed         in vitro  the resulting cRNA was        converted into cDNA and transcribed         in vitro a second time to generate        more cRNA this cRNA was again converted into cDNA and        biotinylated cRNA was synthesized by a third         in vitro transcription This        procedure produced  g of biotinylated cRNA from  g        of starting total RNA Hybridization with  g of        biotinylated cRNA generated by this amplification protocol        allowed detection of  of the  transcripts on the        HuGeneFL GeneChip      In contrast hybridization        with  g of biotinylated cRNA generated by the standard        protocol from total RNA extracted from similar tissues        resulted in detection of  of the transcripts being        detected            Rather than focusing upon the number of transcripts        detected the real test of a microarray protocol is the        extent to which it allows differences in expression levels        to be reliably detected The biological variability        inherent in most experimental models including both        genetic and environmental differences between animals or        even replicate cell cultures limits the detection of such        differences Additional variability in the treatment and        handling of the models and in the RNA extraction typically        occur outside the microarray laboratory and can be reduced        but not eliminated by careful experimental design There        is the potential for introducing additional technical        variability during the synthesis of biotinylated cRNA In        evaluating a new protocol or comparing existing protocols        measures such as the yield of cRNA or the fraction of probe        sets detected can be useful but the key measure is the        extent to which differences in gene expression can be        detected in a realistic experiment        We have systematically explored the use of smaller        amounts of starting material total RNA in a model        experiment that retains the individualtoindividual        biological variation of a real experiment This allowed us        to compare technical variability to the biological        variability in a typical experiment We started with total        RNA from individual rats exposed to two different        nutritional regimens and used serial dilutions of the RNA        to simulate experimental systems that provide smaller        quantities of total RNA We used the Rat Genome RGUA        GeneChip for all of the experiments Our first goal was to        determine a reasonable lower bound for total RNA that could        successfully be used in the standard protocol Second we        wanted to test a modified version of the Ohyama        amplification procedure    that we thought would be        faster simpler and less likely to skew results due to        truncation of the labeled cRNA We examined the variability        and the ability to detect significant changes between        animals fed the  different dietary regimens when different        amounts of starting material and different protocols were        used                    Results                  Yields and quality of cRNA          The standard protocol uses  g of total RNA to          produce biotinylated cRNA     In our experiment the          average yield of biotinylated cRNA was  g   g          mean  standard deviation when we started with  g of          RNA and used onehalf of the double stranded cDNA product          in the           in vitro transcription reaction          Starting with  g of total RNA we obtained an average          of  g   g standard deviation of biotinylated          cRNA after using all of the double stranded cDNA product          in the           in vitro transcription reaction          The  g pooled samples produced an average of  g of          biotinylated cRNA yields ranged from  g to  g          No difference in yield was observed between the samples          prepared with the ENZO and Epicentre T polymerases This          lack of difference led us to select the Epicentre          Ampliscribe T High Yield Kit for the extra           in vitro transcription step to          decrease expense          The standard Affymetrix protocol uses  g of          biotinylated cRNA to make a  l hybridization          cocktail of which  l is injected into the chip for          hybridization The yield of cRNA from both  g and  g          of starting RNA above were more than sufficient for          this Because yields of cRNA starting from  g total RNA          were too low we decided to use an additional          amplification step for RNA samples less than  g Our          modified protocol uses the initial           in vitro transcribed cRNA as          starting material for a second round of cDNA synthesis          and           in vitro transcription Methods          The cRNA yields from the  g samples with our protocol          averaged  g   g more than enough for the          standard hybridizations The cRNA yields from the  g          samples using the same protocol averaged  g with a          range from  to  g so some samples had too little to          prepare a hybridization mixture at the same          concentration Therefore the  g samples were          hybridized to GeneChips using  g to  g of cRNA to          assess results using these limited amounts          Aliquots of the biotinylated cRNA samples were          analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to check the          quality and length The cRNA for both the  g and  g          samples ranged from  to over  bases before          fragmentation The cRNA from the  g sample prepared          by the amplification protocol ranged from  to           bases a considerable decrease in maximum length The           g samples were too faint to judge their size range                          Changes in sensitivity as measured by detection of          probe sets          For a particular tissue or cell type the percent          present and the scaling factors should be similar among          all arrays in the same experiment in the absence of          variability introduced by preparation labeling and          handling of the individual samples Because we created          groups of samples diluted from the same individual RNA          preparations any group differences reflect differences          in labeling and handling of the samples We used the          percent of probe sets called present and the scaling          factor see Methods for an initial comparison among the          groups Table  The  g samples were essentially          equivalent to the  g samples by these measures Table           For the amplified samples  g and  g starting          material the percent present was decreased and the          scaling factor increased compared to the nonamplified          samples The percent present dropped to  in the           g group  of that detected in the  g group and          even further to  for the  g samples Two other          quality control measures noise and background were          similar across all  GeneChips data not shown          If the decrease in starting amount of RNA or the          differences in protocol had no effect on the outcome the          signals from all of the reduced RNA sample size groups          would be distributed similarly to the  g group SAS          was used to analyze the signals from each RNA sample size          group Probe sets were separated by detection call          absent present and marginal and analysis was performed          separately for each group only  of the probe sets were          called marginal these were omitted from Table           Signals for the  g samples are distributed similarly to          the  g samples Table  For the amplified samples          the range of signals is increased and the distribution is          shifted toward higher signal values The decrease in          percent of probe sets called present on the GeneChips          from the amplified samples has the effect of lowering          the average signal on the chip requiring a higher          scaling factor Table  This results in an inflation of          the signal values for all of the probe sets on these          arrays          To examine the effects of starting with smaller          amounts of RNA on the variability in detection of probe          sets we examined the number of probe sets that changed          from present to absent or from absent to present when          comparing the  g sample to the smaller RNA samples          from the same animal Table  The average number of          probe sets called present on the  g chip and absent on          the  g chip P            to A and called absent on the           g chip and present on the  g chip A            to P changes were similar The          bulk of these changes were for probe sets with lower          levels of expression Table  This distribution is          consistent with the greater variability seen in probe          sets with low signals see below there is no          significant loss of lowlevel transcripts in the  g          samples          Because the amplified samples from  g and  g          starting material have a decrease in the percent of          probe sets called present Table  the number of probe          sets called present in the  g samples and absent in          the amplified sample from the same animal must be greater          than the number called absent in the  g sample and          present in the amplified samples Table  Loss of          signal is expected in lowlevel transcripts for the          amplified samples because of the decrease in starting          material but probe sets present in the  g and absent          in the amplified samples are not confined to those probe          sets with low signals Fortythree percent of the probes          not detected in the amplified samples have a signal          greater than  in the  g sample and  have a          signal of at least  In comparison for the  g          samples only  of the probe sets present in the  g          sample and absent in the  g sample had signals greater          than  and none had signals over           The probe sets changing from absent in the  g          samples to present in the amplified samples Table           were mostly those with low signals in the  g samples          reflecting the greater noise found in probe sets with low          signals Figure                           Biological and technical variability          The Affymetrix MAS comparison analysis tool was used          to compare expression levels between pairs of GeneChips           This analysis directly compares two arrays at each          individual probe pair rather than merely comparing the          signal computed from all of the probe pairs for a probe          set     Comparisons among the  g samples from          different animals within each of the treatment groups          showed that the biological between animal plus random          technical variability is considerable Table             vs  There was an average of          over  apparent differences in expression level between          pairs of GeneChips within a single treatment group           of which were fold or greater The number of increases          and decreases were comparable suggesting random rather          than systematic changes Increases and decreases were          randomly distributed across probe sets with different          levels of expression This can be visualized as a scatter          plot comparing two different  g samples both from the          vitamindeficient group Figure a and b results are          similar for a pair of control samples There is          noticeable scatter from the expected diagonal and the          scatter is greatly exacerbated at low signal levels This          shows variability between animals within a single          treatment group plus the technical variability in          handling two samples even with the same protocol          Figure b is the same pair of GeneChips but is          restricted to probe sets that were called present in the          first sample Sample A xaxis Analysis of the signals          for all of the  g arrays shows that  of the probe          sets have signals below  and that  of these are          called absent Removing the probe sets called absent from          further analyses removes most of the variability seen in          this low signal range The data in Table were limited to          probe sets that were called present in the baseline          sample for each comparison to avoid the noise of low          signal absent and marginal calls cf Figure           GeneChips from the lower RNA sample size groups were          compared to the  g chip from the same animal these          comparisons represent technical variation only because          the RNAs were dilutions from the same RNA preparations          To compare variability introduced by the same labeling          protocol with different amounts of starting material in          Figure c and d we compared a  g sample to a  g          sample from the           same animal sample A xaxis in a          and b As can be seen the variation due to differences          in sample size plus the technical variability is less          than the betweenanimal variation shown in Figure a and          b The  g arrays have an average of  decreases and           increases when compared to the  g samples from the          same animals Table             vs  this reflects technical          variability of samples prepared by the same protocol from          different amounts of starting material Only  of these          changes had a magnitude of fold or greater for an          average of  changes per chip This variability was much          smaller than the biological variation seen between pairs          of arrays from different animals  g arrays Table           There were a balanced number of increases and decreases          The changes in the  g samples appear random different          probe sets change in different comparisons Only  probe          sets changed consistently in at least  of the           comparisons          To examine variability introduced by the amplification          protocol we compared a  g sample to a  g sample          from the same animal Figures a and b This comparison          includes both systematic and random variability          introduced by the amplification protocol used for the           g sample There was much more variability between the           g and  g samples than between  g and  g samples          or between  g samples compare Figures and  Only          probe sets that were called present in the  g sample          have been plotted in Figure b the variability is still          high This remaining variability extends over a wider          range of signals than for the comparisons in Figure           More of the probe sets decreased in signal than increased          in signal Many more of these changes are at least          fold The comparison of  g to  g data not          shown is very similar to the  g to  g          comparison          The number of changes observed from the comparison          analysis of the amplified samples to the  g samples is          significantly higher than for the  g samples and there          are many more decreases than increases Table             vs  and            vs  The number of decreases          exceeds  per chip for both amplified groups For the          amplified samples nearly  of the changes are fold          or greater Table  another indication of the increased          variability also seen in Figures a and b The changes          for the amplified samples were spread evenly across the          range of signals except there were fewer increases seen          in the lowlevel transcripts of the  g samples than          for the  g samples reflecting the loss of more          lowlevel transcripts in the  g samples Decreases in          the amplified samples were more consistent with  and           probe sets that decreased in at least  of the           samples for the  g and  g groups respectively          Of the  probe sets that consistently changed in the           g samples  decreased in at least  of the  g          samples This indicates that a group of probe sets is          being           systematically affected in both of          the amplified groups see below A percentage of these          decreases actually result in loss of detection of probe          sets  for the g and  for the  g          samples          To measure the level of variability within an          amplified group the  g arrays within a treatment          group were compared Table             vs  The number of changes          within the  g arrays was greater than within the           g arrays  per chip compared to  for the  g          Not only were there more changes a larger percentage of          the changes were fold or greater            vs  for the  g samples This          indicates that additional noise was introduced by the          amplification          The  g and  g samples from the same animal          were similar to each other Figures c and d Table           Only  of the differences between the  g and  g          groups were  fold compared to  that were   fold          when comparing the amplified samples to  g samples          The variation between the amplified groups  g and           g is greater than the variation between the          nonamplified groups  g and  g and decreases          outnumber increases because of the greater loss of signal          in the  g samples                          Amplification truncates the  ends of the          RNA          A likely cause for the consistent decreases of          particular probe sets in the amplified samples not          related to low signal level is the loss of the  end of          the transcript Synthesis of cDNA from the cRNA initially          prepared is expected to lead to some truncation of the           ends of the original mRNA due to the requirement for          priming during synthesis of the second strand Indeed          the cRNA prepared by amplification from the g samples          was noticeably shorter than that prepared by the standard          protocol as detected by agarose gel electrophoresis          above Another way to detect such potential shortening          of the probe sets is to compare the signals from the          Affymetrix control probe sets There are  probe sets          each for GAPDH and actin designated  Middle and           based on their relative distance from the  end of the          transcript The average  ratio for both  g and           g samples was  or below Table  representing good          samples httpwwwaffymetrixcom The  ratios of          the amplified samples all exceeded  and were as high as           with the average near  for GAPDH and  for actin          Table  These ratios indicate a differential loss of          the  ends of the transcripts for the amplified samples          see below          Examination of the Affymetrix comparison analyses for          the GAPDH and actin probe sets gives an even better          picture of the  loss None of the comparisons of the           g samples to the  g samples from the same animals          showed a significant change in signal for these probe          sets All  of the  g and  g samples had          significant decreases as compared to the  g sample          from the same animal the magnitude of which increases as          the distance of the probe sequence from the  end of the          transcript increases Table  The amplified samples          both show similar progressive loss of the more           sequences For example both amplified samples have an          average of  of the GAPDH  signal mean log            ratio  but only  as much          GAPDH  signal log            ratio          To determine if truncation of the  ends of the RNA          may be a significant problem for many of the sequences on          the GeneChip  the distance of the target sequence from          which probe sets were designed from the  end of the          transcripts was determined for as many probe sets as          possible by BLASTing the target sequence against the           nr database Figure  We then          compared the percent of probe sets that decreased in          signal at different  distances The differences between          the  g and  g samples were evenly distributed across          the  distances Figure  reinforcing the idea that          these are random differences In contrast the amplified          samples  g and   g show a marked increase in          the percent of probe sets that were decreased as the          target sequence is moved farther from the  end Figure                    Both sets of amplified samples were affected in the          same manner by this  truncation The decreases seen          when comparing the  g to the  g samples were not          associated with distance from the  end and were not          consistent for particular probe sets only  probe sets          decreased in at least  of the  samples This indicates          that the truncation is a result of the single cycle of          amplification rather than the amount of starting          material                          Ability to detect differences in expression between          treatment groups          The main goal in an experiment comparing two treatment          groups is to find genes whose expression differs          significantly To assess whether the lower starting          amounts of total RNA can be used successfully a          comparison of results from standard ttests was          performed Based upon the data in Figure  we filter out          those probe sets that are not detected in at least one of          the treatment groups to be compared before performing          statistical comparisons To be conservative we only          eliminated probe sets that are not called present on at          least half of the GeneChips in either of the treatment          groups rather than demand that a probe set be present in          all of the GeneChips in a set others can choose          different fractions and call this a detection filter          This does not eliminate probe sets that are either turned          on or off because these would be present in one of the          two treatment groups          Table gives the number of probe sets that met our          criteria for significance they passed the detection          filter and were significant at p   for the ttest          or at the appropriate level for the Wilcoxon rank sum          test nonparametric     both tests give generally          parallel results Even though both the  g and  g          comparisons are    comparisons there is a  drop in          the number of significant probe sets as compared to the           g samples Only part of this drop can be attributed          to the decrease in the percent of probe sets that met the          detection filter for these samples Table  the extra          noise introduced by the amplification as seen in the           g group cf Figure  Tables and  contributes          substantially since the ttest is sensitive to increases          in standard deviations of the two groups being          tested          Because of the loss of two of the  g arrays the          table also contains data for the subset of six that match          the six remaining  g arrays Note the sharp decline in          the number of probe sets meeting the p            significance criteria ttest when the number of samples          in the  g class is reduced from a    comparison to          a    comparison Table  this attests to the          additional power gained by using the additional array          The best lowest pvalue that can be achieved in the          Wilcoxon test with four samples for each treatment group          is  for three samples per group it is               The  g samples also produced a similar number of          significant probe sets for the Wilcoxon with a           pvalue as the  g samples with the same number of          arrays  for the  g samples and  for the          corresponding  g samples These numbers can be          compared to the  found in the complete set of  g          samples sample size of  with a pvalue of  for          the Wilcoxon          As expected probe sets with low expression level low          signal were less reproducible in comparisons between the          different sample groups as were probe sets with very low          foldchanges Reproducibility for the  g samples was          best for probe sets with a fold change   log            ratio   For the amplified          samples good reproducibility was achieved for probe sets          with fold changes   log            ratio   Calculated fold changes          for the concordant probe sets were reasonably stable          across the different groups                          Estimate of technical false positive rate          The  g and  g groups were from the same original          RNA extractions and were labeled by the same protocol          Because they were so comparable in all of our measures          these  groups were used to estimate the number of false          positives due to technical variability to be expected          using our standard ttests The three  g samples from          the normal diet animals were compared to the three  g          samples from the same animals using the ttest and the          three  g samples from the diet deficient animals were          similarly compared to the  g samples from the same          animals Since both of these comparisons are between          samples from the same set of similarly treated animals          one should expect no changes Therefore any probe sets          that were found to be significantly different between the           g and  g samples from the same animals would be          false positives For each comparison normal and          deficient  probe sets were found to be significantly          different between the  g and  g samples which is a          false positive rate of  of the probe sets that met          the detection filter Of these  only  of the normal          group and  of the deficient group had a foldchange          greater than  and only one in each group had a          foldchange that exceeded  Foldchanges larger than           were seen only in probe sets with average signals            Those probe sets with signals over  had smaller          fold changes most less than           In comparison for those probe sets that did not meet          the detection filter the false positive rate was          approximately  at a pvalue of  This set of false          positives was equally balanced between increases and          decreases  increases and  decreases in the two          treatment groups indicating random noise and

calculations for these probe sets                            Discussion        This experiment demonstrated that technical variability        is much smaller than biological variation when using the        standard protocol The number of differences between        samples from the same animal that resulted from using the        lower amount of starting material was much smaller than the        biological variation between animals treated the same and        labeled by the standard protocol The standard protocol        worked well with samples as small as  g producing        results very similar to those of the  g sample from the        same animal Although in this experiment starting with        less than  g of total RNA did not produce enough        biotinylated cRNA for hybridization under the normal        protocol a minor change using vacuum evaporation to        concentrate samples before cRNA synthesis and mixing the        minimum  l hybridization volume should allow use of         g samples with the standard protocol This extends the        range of samples that can readily be analyzed on Affymetrix        GeneChips using the standard protocol        We have demonstrated here that a single cycle of        amplification sufficed to produce cRNA from samples as low        as  g of total RNA The amplification protocol uses the        cRNA from the initial protocol as starting material for a        second round of cDNA synthesis and         in vitro transcription We        hypothesized that each round of cDNA synthesis would lead        to some truncation of the molecules due both to the        possibility of priming the second strand from an internal        site and to cleavage of the relatively labile RNA For this        reason we limited our amplification to a single round        rather than using two cycles as had previously been        reported     The hypothesized shortening was observed        the cRNA extended to about  nt compared with about         nt for the standard protocol This shortening was also        demonstrated by differential loss of signal from probe sets        further away from the  end of the RNA as shown with the        Affymetrix control probe sets Tables and  and by the        progressive loss in probe sets detected as a function of        their distance from the  end Figure  The        amplification systematically affected over  probe sets        in at least  of  samples for both the  g and  g        groups Indeed of the probe sets with consistent decreases        across the  g and  g samples about  have target        distances greater than  nucleotides from the  end of        the measured transcript with  in the  range        and  over  Because the effect of the loss of the         end is systematic it renders a group of probe sets        designed from sequences further from the  end        undetectable Therefore we recommend using the standard        protocol instead of using the amplification strategy for        samples down to  g of total RNA and our simplified        amplification protocol for smaller samples at least down        to  g This extends the range of samples that can be        usefully analyzed by oligonucleotide microarrays This        experiment used the Affymetrix RGUA GeneChip  which was        designed using version  of Uni Gene for the rat November         For newer arrays such as the new human U GeneChip         designed using better sequence information and improved        probe designs Affymetrix technical report Array Design for        the GeneChip Human Genome  Set we expect that the        problem with loss of the  end of the transcript will be        lessened but not eliminated because the targets are more        likely to be near the real  ends of the mRNAs The        truncation that results from amplifying samples means that        the same protocol should be used for all samples in a given        study        New protocols that increase the production of cDNA            using primers attached to the  end of the transcript        could increase cDNA yields from small amounts of RNA But        Iscove    states only a few hundred bases of extreme         sequence are amplified by their method This procedure        would be expected to greatly exacerbate the loss of signal        due to shortened transcripts        There was additional variation in the amplified samples        Table  that is probably due to the extra steps required        in the protocol This extra noise is partially responsible        for the decrease in the number of probe sets that differ at        a pvalue   This coupled with the decrease in the        percent of probe sets present reduces the ability to find        transcripts that differ significantly in expression when        using the amplification protocol The problem is        exacerbated for transcripts with small differences in        expression low fold changes Fold changes   were much        more likely to be identified in the amplified samples It        may be especially helpful to increase the number of arrays        used in these amplification experiments to get more power        to detect changes        Our experiment also provided a false positive estimate        of technical variability for the ttest with  found in        each treatment group when comparing the  g samples to        the  g samples  of the present probe sets These        false positives came disproportionately from the genes        expressed at lower levels Genes expressed at these low        levels often show high foldchanges because the denominator        is so low often near background this points out the        danger in emphasizing high foldchanges rather than        reproducible changes Therefore for genes expressed at        lower levels it might be reasonable to use a more        restrictive pvalue none of the false positives had a        pvalue less than  Restricting probe sets to those        minimally present our detection filter dramatically        decreases the number of false positives from an average of         down to  restricting analysis to genes called present        in a higher fraction of the arrays from one of the        comparison groups could further reduce false positives but        at the cost of missing some true positives The tradeoff        can be chosen by an investigator based upon the relative        cost of false positives and value of detecting differences        in genes expressed at low levels        The statistical power to detect differences was much        reduced when  samples per group were analyzed instead of         The  g samples and the matched  g samples were able        to detect  differences at p   as compared to         differences when using all of the  g samples This        decrease was expected but illustrates that a  decrease        in expense may result in a much greater loss of        information                    Conclusions        This experiment explored the effects of using less than        the standard  g of total RNA for an Affymetnx GeneChip        experiment and examined how biological and technical        variation affect the ability to detect biological        differences in a typical experiment comparing gene        expression in two conditions The overall conclusions are        that  small amounts of RNA can be used effectively in        the standard protocol  even very small amounts of RNA         g can be used with our simplified amplification        protocol to detect differential gene expression         biological variation is larger than technical variation         very lowlevel signals are prone to false positives and        to less reliable foldchanges false positives can be        reduced by filtering out probe sets not reliably detected        before statistical comparisons and  using  independent        biological samples is much better than using  samples in        allowing detection of consistent changes and reducing false        positives                    Methods                  Labeling test          Total RNA was extracted from the livers of  rats fed          a normal diet untreated and  fed a vitamindeficient          diet treated using the RNeasy kit Qiagen Inc          Valencia CA The RNA was resuspended and reextracted          using the same protocol to reduce DNA contamination For          the labeling test two pools were created one treated          and one untreated by mixing equal aliquots from each of          the  RNA samples The final concentration was adjusted          to  g l and each pool was divided into  aliquots          of  g each These pooled samples were used to determine          the average cRNA yield from  g of total RNA and to          compare the yields of the T polymerases from two          different           in vitro transcription kits          Biotinylated cRNA was prepared using the standard          Affymetrix protocol    except that the Epicentre          AmpliScribe T polymerase Epicentre Madison WI was          substituted for the ENZO T polymerase BioArray High          Yield RNA Transcript Labeling Kit ENZO Diagnostics          Inc Farmingdale NY for  of the treated and  of the          untreated pooled samples The yield of cRNA was estimated          from absorbance at  nm using an Amersham Pharmacia          Biotech Ultrospec  pro spectrophotometer This part          of the experiment was the only time RNAs from different          animals were pooled the cRNAs from these pooled samples          were not hybridized to arrays                          Labeling for microarrays          Aliquots of each of the original  samples of total          RNA one from each rat were treated as individual          samples for all hybridization experiments Each sample          was serially diluted to yield  l samples containing           g  g  g and  g total RNA  samples For          the  g and  g samples cRNA was prepared using the          standard Affymetrix protocol     We made slight          modifications for the  g samples to increase the          concentration by decreasing added water where that was          possible Because the cRNA yield from the  g pooled          sample test was low we decided to amplify the smaller          samples The  g and  g samples were amplified by          a modification of the protocol of Ohyama et al              using only a single round of amplification In short          doublestranded cDNA was synthesized from the total RNA          using the SuperScript II kit from Invitrogen and the          Affymetrix TdT            primer which contains a T          promoter attached to a polydT sequence          GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGGdT             The Epicentre AmpliScribe T          High Yield Transcription kit was used to produce          unlabeled cRNA by           in vitro transcription with          unbiotinylated NTPs This           in vitro transcription step was          followed by a second round of doublestranded cDNA          synthesis and finally by           in vitro transcription using the T          RNA polymerase with the Enzo BioArray High Yield RNA          Transcript Labeling Kit with biotinylated NTPs in the          usual manner Yields of cDNA and cRNA were measured using          an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec  pro          spectrophotometer in order to adjust concentrations for          subsequent steps Measurements of the amplified samples          were made after the second round of cDNA synthesis and           in vitro transcription to limit          the loss of sample After the final round of cRNA          synthesis aliquots of biotinylated cRNA from each sample          were electrophoresed on  agarose gels in TBE buffer to          check them for quality and length the buffer and gel          both contained a  ngml concentration of ethidium          bromide The Invitrogen  Kb Plus DNA ladder was used to          provide a relative measure of length          Since it was not feasible to label this many samples          at one time a balanced experimental design was used          processing groups of  g and  g samples for the same          animal together and always labeling an equal number of          normal and vitamindeficient samples at one time For the          amplification protocol  g and  g samples from          the same animal were processed together for each step          again with balanced numbers of normal and vitamin          deficient samples processed together                          Array hybridization          Each sample was hybridized to a separate Affymetrix          RGUA GeneChip  For most samples hybridization          cocktails of  l contained  g of fragmented cRNA           l of the cocktail were injected into the GeneChip          for hybridization One  g sample had a lower yield so          a  l hybridization cocktail containing  g of cRNA          was made to keep the concentration fixed For the  g          samples the cRNA yield was less than  g so   g          of cRNA was used for the hybridization cocktail Data          from two of the  g GeneChips  from each treatment          group and their hybridization cocktail were unusable due          to a bad lot of BSA used as a blocking factor during          hybridization The analyses for the  g group were          completed using the remaining  GeneChips  For some          comparisons with this group only the corresponding           GeneChips from the  g samples were used                          Scanning and analysis          Each GeneChip was scanned and analyzed using          Affymetrix Microarray Analysis Suite MAS version               Each sample was scaled to a target intensity of           using the all probe sets scaling option this          option scales the trimmed mean target intensity to the          specified value     The Affymetrix MAS expression          report provides statistics for each chip that can be used          for quality control purposes Included in this report are          noise background the percent of probe sets called          present the scaling factor calculated by the absolute          analysis algorithm and the ratio of  to  signal for          GAPDH and actin These measures were used to judge the          quality and similarity of data from the various RNA          sample size groups          MAS absolute and comparison expression analyses          were performed     The RGUA chip contains           probe sets series of probe pairs that query parts of the          same gene or EST     For each probe set absolute          analysis generates a signal value expression level a          detection call of absent present or marginal and a          pvalue associated with the detection call              Comparison analysis examines  GeneChips and indicates          for each probe set whether there is a significant          difference in the signal between the two arrays The          output is a change call of increase marginal increase          decrease marginal decrease or no change a pvalue          associated with the change call and the magnitude of the          difference as the signal log ratio the log            log base  ratio of the signal          from first chip to the signal on the second or baseline          chip Comparisons were made between the          vitamindeficient and normal diet animals in each sample          size group using the normal diet samples as the baseline          for each comparison All possible comparisons were made          this equaled  comparisons each    for the  g           g and  g groups and  comparisons for the  g          samples Comparisons were also made between each of the           g  g and  g samples and the  g sample from          the same animal to look for apparent differences in gene          expression that are really due to the differences in the          amount of starting material and sample processing For          these comparisons the  g sample was used as the          baseline          In addition comparisons were made between the  g          arrays within each treatment group to measure          variability both betweenanimal and technical This          analysis was done for the  g group as well The           g arrays were compared to the  g arrays from the          same animal to determine how well these two amplified          samples corresponded with one another          Data from each RNA sample size group were exported and          each probe set analyzed in the following ways           The number of GeneChips on which a probe set was          detected within each of the treatment groups normal vs          deficient diet was calculated Each present call was          assigned the value  and each marginal call assigned           Only probe sets that are present in at least          onehalf of the samples from one of the treatment groups          either normal or deficient diet were used for further          analysis we call this the detection filter Note that          we did not require the probe set to be present in both          treatment groups just in one For this experiment we          required a score of at least  for the  g  g and           g groups  GeneChips in each treatment group and           for the  g and corresponding sample subset of          the  g groups  GeneChips in each treatment          group           The sum of the calls from the comparison analyses          was calculated using  for increase  for marginal          increase  for no change  for marginal decrease          and  for decrease           The mean standard deviation and coefficient of          variation of the signal for each probe set within each          treatment group normal and deficient diet were          calculated           Students ttest for equal means with the          assumption of unequal variance    was calculated to          test for significant differences in signal expression          level between the normal and vitamin deficient groups          This test was applied separately to the signals and the          log            transformation of the signals           The Wilcoxon ranksum nonparametric test for equal          means between normal and deficient diet groups    was          performed           The log            ratio fold change of the mean          signals for normal           vs  deficient diet groups was          calculated          log            ratio  log            mean of signal for normal  mean          of signal for deficient          Changes within an RNA sample size group between normal          and deficient diet groups were assessed as significant if          the probe set passed the detection filter  above          and the pvalue was less than  for the ttest using          either the original signal or log transformed signal           above          Scatter plots comparing individual samples were          created using Microsoft Excel  SAS SAS Institute Inc          Cary NC was used for univariate analysis of the signals          for each RNA sample size group
