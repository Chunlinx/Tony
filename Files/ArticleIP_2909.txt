                                 Better Late Than Ever                         I look like a dog EdgarDegas remarked of a pastel selfportrait made when he was in his early s acentury ago Hunched forward in a coarse painters smock he peers forlornly atus his tired and damaged eyes rimmed with vermilion What appears at firstglance to be a genie rising from his soft brown cap turns out on closerinspection to be the sinuous arm and towel in white chalk of one of Degasown bathers a pastel within a pastel For Degas who had forswornselfportraiture for  years this double image has the weight of allegoryThe aging and celibate artist has purchased a score of creative years at theprice of physical collapse            Theportrait captures a fraught moment in Degas career when he had lost interestin the witty chronicle of modern life hed pursued with such brilliance for yearsthe parade of shopgirls and laundresses and jockeys and prostitutes thathad made him famous The last of the impressionist exhibitions in which Degashad played so central a role was held in  afterward he found himselfincreasingly isolated as well I am quickly sliding downhill he confided toan acquaintance at the time rolling I know not where wrapped up in lots ofbad pastels as if in so much packing paper            It turned out to be a long hill Degas lived until whenblind brittle and beleagueredhe died at  The surprising premise ofthe current exhibition at the Art Institute of Chicago is that much of Degasmost challenging and inventive work dates from the s and the first years ofthis century Printed in bold letters at the entrance of the show is astartling claim by Degas fellow painter Auguste Renoir If Degas had died at he would have been remembered as an excellent painter no more it is afterhis  th year that his work broadened out and that he really becomesDegas            While thefirst part of Renoirs assertion is preposterous as anyone can see who perusesthe dozen or so early works culled from the Art Institutes own spectacularcollection of over  pieces by Degas that serve as an appetizer for theexhibition the show makes a convincing case for the vitality of Degas latework Holed up in his squalid attic studio in Montmartre models complained ofthe dust but Degas believed that sweeping just moved the dust around Degasnarrowed his subject matter to a few recurrent motifswomen bathing havingtheir hair combed and dancingwhile at the same time experimenting with aremarkable range of techniques and media photography tracing paper luridcolor combinations Many of his forays beyond impressionism as the curatorspoint out anticipate some of the titans of  th century art            Amorbid undertow pervades the early rooms ofthe exhibitionapparent in the blank gaze for instance of Hlne Rouartin Her Fathers Study c  one of Degas last and finestportraits Draped over an empty chair the subjects expressive hands could beplaying the piano or summoning up the ghost of her recently deceased fatherwhose stacks of papers and Egyptian funerary art hem her in A frieze of fourdancers c  with graywhite bodies their faces daubed with green andorange look like theyve just stepped out of a graveor a badly colorizedfilm And indeed theres something almost cinematic in the similar poses ofthe dancers as they adjust their shoes like Eadweard Muybridges freeze framesof bodies in motion with which Degas was familiar            Those green and orange facespresage Degas growing interest in bright color in his later work Alwayscurious about technological innovation Degas may have been excited by the newcolors made available by the chemical industry at centurys end Alternativelythe bold hues might have resulted from Degas wretched eyesight those orangesmay not have looked so bright to him  which forced him to wear tintedglasses and keep his brownwalled studio reproduced in the Art Institutesbrown walls in a spectral gloom            In anycase little that has come before prepares the viewer for the visual shock ofthe outsized Combing the Hair c  The gestures of the twowomen an attendant combing the long coil of her mistresss hair have aritualized simplicity A single brushstroke enlarges the reclining womansstomach indicating her pregnancy The whole composition is rendered inpulsating shades of red It seems fitting that this remarkable painting wasowned for a time by Henri Matisse who experimented with similar monochromaticharmonies Those amniotic reds recur in the wrenched body of the nude figure inAfter the Bath Woman Drying Herself c  Degas based thecomposition so suggestive of pain and isolation on one of his ownphotographs a medium in which hed begun to experiment around             Degas was drawn to other methods besides photography forrecycling his images using tracing paper to multiply a drawing thenoverlaying the copies with different colors to produce a range of emotionalvariants A particularly bizarre transformation occurred when he made acharcoal copy of one of his women having her hair combed He rotated the image degrees overlaid it with vigorous layers of pastel and produced aperfectly convincing landscape Steep Coast c  The womanscascading hair becomes a cliff plummeting to the ocean below while her breastsand upraised knees are hills The riddling result judging from the Ahs andOh yeahs of the crowd is as satisfying as the hidden pictures from aHighlights magazine in the dentists office What the picture meansadubious equation of woman and nature the virgin landis a furtherenigma            Infocusing the show almost entirely on technique the organizers of DegasBeyond Impressionism have followed the lead of Degas himself who steadilyeliminated from his work any reference to contemporary life preferring anartificial world of studio props and pliable models There is somethingartificial even about this heart of mine he wrote in  The dancers havesewn it into a pink satin bag a slightly faded satin like their balletslippers One is lulled into thinking that these contorted bathers are mereexercises in the handling of pastel and not the work of in the poet PaulValrys words a supremely cruel authority on female contours and poses Afirestorm of feminist controversy already surrounds some of these worksoneside contends that these are refreshingly deidealized nudes the other sideresponds that the unusual poses and aggressive use of pastel are furtherdegradations of womenbut you wouldnt know it from the placid audio tour orfrom the printed exhibition guide that replaces the usual wall panels            More surprisingly there is not a singlemention of the most important public event for Degas during the s theDreyfus affair when Degas didnt just look like a dog but behaved like onecutting off Jewish friends of long standing and adamantly insisting along withPaul Czanne and Renoir on the guilt of the Jewish army officer falselyaccused of treason One must turn to the informative catalog by guest curatorRichard Kendall to learn something of this unsavory episode in Degas life afurther lesson that avantgarde art and retrograde politics often coexistDegas very retreat from contemporary life owes something to his disgust withFrench society as he found it            Next year the Art Institutewill try for an impressionist hat trick as they add a Renoir show to thesuccesses of last years Monet extravaganza and this years subtler and moredemanding Degas As boating parties replace ballerinas on the Tshirts andumbrellas for sale along Michigan Avenue the exhibition organizers shouldntshy away from social context and controversy They can afford to risk a bitmore grit in the presentation                           NBThe preceding images are not from
