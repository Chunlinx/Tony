        okay well what movie have you seen     i think the last one that we actually went to go see well theres two i took my kids to see  Dalmatians of course they wanted to see it they had the Disney book and they thought that was wonderful and they loved the dogs and   uhhuh uhhuh its one of my favorite even   so yes we went with some friends of ours and i was a little worried about my son hes about two and a half and   uhhuh   hes going through a stage right now where hes kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can hear them and cant see them   yeah yeah yeah   and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message you know that the the the puppies are missing and it shows the town and you can hear all the barking but you cant see the dogs  yeah   oh yeah a whole lot uhhuh kind of dark uhhuh   yeah so that kind of bothered him but after that he did fine   is it well how is he young   yeah hell be three in January   yeah okay that makes sense   yeah   well my kids very favorite and yours may be too young for it was Home Alone   i loved that movie   they uh well we do too but they just wanna rent that one that is their very favorite   probably gives them ideas of what they wanna do right   they think that is so cute i guess so so i guess so i guess so were not real big movie goers ourselves but we did try to go see about a month ago that um  Dead Again   yeah   that black and white one and i was not real impressed with it in fact we kept sitting there all through the theater going now what what did that mean wait wait run that back and we couldnt run it back   wasnt that good   umhum but we we just kept trying to figure it out until finally toward the end and we thought we were being very quiet this man turned around and said could you all please save that for later and im sorry  so were just not real big movie goers   oh no well i like to watch the movies but its gotten so expensive that we wait until they come out on video and we rent them   yeah well thats us too thats us too   and now we did go see Home Alone at the dollar movie and that was just hilarious i died   yeah i thought that was cute too   and we we did also we went to see What About Bob one night which is a funny funny movie with uh   well my husbands name is Bob and he wants to see that   its a funny movie   yeah he wanted to see that i thought the funny part in Home Alone was uh thats good for kids is kind of coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking   thats true   and i thought they could learn a lot of lessons from that the little guys so cute and hes terribly rich by now   i hope he stays cute  not spoiled you know you get to where   yeah me too oh thats right   the money goes to their heads or goes to something you know they grow up too fast so   thats right   but uh theres a lot i wanna see you know what i try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good so that when they come out on video you know id like to see Green Card i want to see Awakenings  uh id like to see Silence of the Lambs   thats right uhhuh Awakening is supposed to be wonderful yeah Awakening is supposed to be wonderful my mom saw that and she said that was an excellent movie   yeah and see ive had somebody tell me that Regarding Henry you know the Harrison Ford movie is supposed to be really good id like to see that   yes yes i think thats supposed to be good and i uh we have some doctors at church who said that Doctor was just wonderful umhum   ive heard thats good yeah so i think theres a bunch of good movies coming out my kids wanna see Rescuers Down Under   uhhuh   so im going to have my VCR went on the blitz about two weeks ago so im getting it fixed right now because they have their little movies their little you know Disney movies they watch all the time and stuff and   oh dear uhhuh well on uh back to your movie you saw that ten thousand uh  Dalmatians um uh did you all ever think about purchasing that one when it comes out   yeah do you know i look at those like Cinderella came out was for sale and i dont buy them i now i will copy them and rent them and keep them at home but i just have a problem paying twenty five dollars for a movie that i can go down and rent for a dollar   umhum uhhuh uhhuh well i understand that too i understand that too now they had   you know and they dont last that long   umhum they had Home Alone offered for like i think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars and i thought well now thats thats close enough to being several you know you could rent it more than once more than four times and watch that   oh thats pretty decent yeah yeah that that makes it worth it uh but a lot of the Disney movies its just too expensive and i can rent them or i can make a copy you know my daughters in love with the Little Mermaid and i have a copy thats just about worn out shes four   well i understand i understand i understand oh yeah of course uhhuh yeah   so she just thinks the great in fact she told me Mom if we have a little girl and she has red hair were naming her Aerial now im not pregnant mind you but this is shes planning ahead for me yeah  so   oh sweet  but thats in her plans  well its hard its hard to find a movie any more these days that you can take your kids   yes   and even the ones that we rent at home the trouble with some of them i know we rented Adventures in Babysitting thinking that would be so cute and its a precious movie but the language in it is just for no reason   oh i saw   has to stick in   now see i remember thinking its a wonderful movie but its been so long since i watched it i dont remember the language it was bad well thats true   uhhuh well you watch it differently when your kids are in the room you know and i was just sitting there going oh my goodness and im going to have to stop and explain and they go i know Mommy i know   oh and see my kids werent in the room youre right i watched it without them   uhhuh yeah its its real different because you see things from a different different angle   huh huh   uh we rented this summer before we went on vacation we rented Chevy Chase and that Family Vacation   yes   and those are just absolutely hilarious but you just really cant watch a lot of that we had to fast forward through a whole lot of it for them to see it   yes yes  some of it just isnt a
