                well have you ever been a victim of any particular any type of crime   uh thats interesting  because ive talked about this subject before and it it didnt come up to either one of us to act uh       no no nothing that i would consider major probably the most that anything of mine has ever been violated is uh you know like you know how people throw their change like into uh the glove box or the ash tray of their car and one time we had you know some kids go up and down the street and anybody whose car was open they kind of trashed that stuff out but they didnt do any vandalism and yeah it bugged me but you know when i think of crime and and things that could happen   uhhuh   i i guess that was minor   sounds like youve been very fortunate i havent had too many terrible things happen to me but my tee tops did get stolen one time off my car   i have ah thats a very popular pass time up here do you have a Vette   out of right uh no its a TransAm   a TransAm uh in fact there was a ring i know that you stop right up here and uh the police department would call TI security when they knew they were in town basically and say you know tell all your folks with Vets and whatever else to be look on the lookout for them but thats expensive you know   its very expensive and insurance companies dont like it either   yeah they dont want to write you   yeah well i i did put an alarm on the car after that   uh   and uh i kept that for a while until the alarm malfunctioned and started going off in the middle of the night for no reason and   oh thats not good   it upset the neighbors in the apartment complex so i disabled it   well okay now i uh i mean ive had other members of my family touched um i have had a cousin of mine that was murdered uh things like that uh for no apparent reason you know its that was lost in the country trying to find her folks new house up in Kansas and   uhhuh right   stopped to use the phone and a teenage kid whose parents had lots of money   yeah   uh killed her so nothing was ever done to him but so you know yeah i im not sure theres many lives that arent affected by it somewhere   uhhuh   uh i dont know what the answers should be per se   yeah you stop and think about what you can do to uh to prevent or reduce crime and in fact tonight uh alone i i got a phone call from one of the security uh uh systems home security systems that uh install uh   yeah   uh systems in your home to uh   yeah   monitor and uh i guess detect uh its that that type of break ins   uhhuh   they uh have a certain fee that they charge each month and an installation fee and theyre real hot hot about uh trying to get uh trying to sell these systems to everybody   yeah i um i would like a home alarms that perimeter alarm system ive been very impressed with the one that the Amway Corporation uh puts together because its its as extensive as you want it to be you can you can kind of coordinate to your own home you know however many uh types of devices you need and its a wireless system so its not one they can disable   do you know what the do you know the name brand is for that   the name Amguard   okay thats the their own personal alarm brand okay   yeah they make it uhhuh and   there are several systems like that theres one that uh uh employees sale sold once upon a time called Schlage   oh oh   thats also modular and wireless and you can add as many sensors as you need to   yeah about my husband hes like one of these like i want to have guns and guns kind of scare me uh not so much for me you know i feel like im responsible id learn how to use it and yes i could shoot someone if you know they were trying to take my kids or take my life or you know im basically a nonviolent person but i could do that but it scares me because of so many accidents that have occurred with children in the home that find the guns and   well theres some some   uh you know accidentally shoot a brother or shoot a sister or shoot themselves and im not real sold on that yet   right but theres also a lot of people who are end up being victimized by their own weapons   by their own   a burglar comes in and uh finds a gun and ends up using it against the owners of the house so   yeah well are you for uh capital punishment   oh certainly yeah depending on the crime i think i discussed that at at another time   well thats interesting that you say that because i am too my my sadness with it occurs that it doesnt seem to be consistent you know i i have a hard time putting one persons death for the same crime that you send the other to jail for   right   you know it does to me need to be consistent but uh i i   well its such a waste of taxpayers money too to put them in prison for life   for life   uh especially if theres no chance of parole   thats true   so   thats true   uh   of course my husbands of the mind that you ought to take them all out in the back alley and shoot them     sometimes thats the best solution i guess   i dont know i guess i have a little bit more compassion i do think they ought to have their day in court   uhhuh   only because there have been ones sent away that didnt do it but i know thats few and far between   yeah   i uh i dont know the answer you know i have always thought that maybe the answer to the dope problem that you know generates so much of the crime is you know always you know shoot the dealers and somebody made the you know take away the supply but somebody made a comment to me a couple of months ago thats kind of had me thinking he said   uhhuh   he said somebody else will come up with the supply he said what you have to do is you know shoot or make it hard on the users because if the demand is gone they wont have anybody to supply to well that makes a little bit of sense   well it makes some sense but uh the the users end up being addicts and they uh they commit crimes for for a living to make the the cash to buy their drugs with so   sure sure   uh and they have no respect or for for any other people anyway   thats true but where was it uh oh several years ago and i want to say like Malaysia something with an M Madagascar or somewhere  a small country uh you know its its a crime punishable by by death to them to be carrying anything and i think some British ci tizens had gone in like uh a lady and her son and they had some marijuana on them and they hung them   oh that was in Malaysia and they they were two two guys from Australia   was that Malaysia okay i knew it was something like that and i thought jeez that seemed so severe for marijuana but then i thought or is that just because um   and   i have become accustom ed to other things in hearing other things you know if i knew two of my friends got hung for carrying a little bit of marijuana it might make me think twice before i ever did it if i was of the mind to you know   right   so i dont know what the answers are but i i do feel like i do feel like when theyre blatant criminals and theyve got records that it seems like the system protects them more than it helps the others   uhhuh well were not the only country that has a a drug problem   no were not   a lot of a lot of countries do especially smaller third world nations and their governments uh strictly enforce uh   death   policies against uh drug use and uh uh dealing and things like that so yeah the death penalty uh exists and it is put in force   yeah yeah i dont know i know that you know i remember growing up and uh you know wed leave the house open if we were in the house yeah if we went somewhere i grew up in a large i grew up in San Diego   uhhuh   you know if we went somewhere sure wed lock the doors if it was just down the street we wouldnt or if we were in the house we wouldnt but now you know i come home i lock the door if we open the door i lock the screen door you know i want it locked when im in it every time i go somewhere and i i just almost hate that feeling   right well you make a habit out of it and its a tolerable situation   yeah   uh i also grew up in in a rural area and my a lot of my relatives are on dairy farms they would leave the house unattended unlocked  just figuring that if anybody really wanted to break in they would anyway and there wasnt much of value to take any way so   well thats one way to look at it isnt it whered you grow up   uh up in uh Wisconsin   oh okay um excuse me   but ive been fortunate i guess in that the only things that have happened to me are the tee tops and hubcaps off cars well   yeah thats pretty minor when i think that some people give their lives  so   sure uhhuh   so i dont know the answers though i i i do wish we had a system that was a bit more fair   yeah and Plano is pretty good about it too theyve got excellent uh police force here uh i havent seen any any evidence of uh any uh mischievous deeds going on in my neighborhood   oh well thats good   the suburbs its not near as bad in the suburbs as it is in the city Dallas is pretty bad   right im sure thats true im sure thats true i do know that our neighbor across the street our development is probably only eight years old   uhhuh   maybe not that long weve lived here six years probably seven years old and uh the house across the street you know she walked in one night on somebody and of course he left she was fortunate   yeah   but things like that make it real to me and aware that it really is going on   right   you know thats it not a fairy tale world here   thats right yeah i know people that have been victimized too a lot more seriously   yeah   its uh its not pleasant to think about that and uh you have to live with that forever so   thats true well   yeah i enjoyed talking to you about the subject uh   and i appreciate you calling its Gary right   yes   thank you very much huh you too bye bye   okay have a good evening sure bye
