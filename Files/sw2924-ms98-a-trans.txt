                so what do you think of our trial system   huh i dont really know what to think about it but i do know that theyre not you know theyll give somebody twenty five years and theyll serve what eight months   yeah   have you noticed that   yeah i have noticed that that that that kind of stuff does seem to happen quite a bit um   uhhuh   yeah i dont i dont i dont even know what to do about that sort of thing   and uh but i think trial by jury is its a lot better than leaving it up to one person   yeah i think trial by jury is very good i actually they said i think the tape said something about changing uh changing it such that or leaving sentencing up to the judge only i think thats actually good idea   so it leaving it up to the judge   well just just sentencing not the trial itself   oh okay   um because i think that that that that judges are probably more informed as to what is   yeah well right because   how serious the nature of the crime is and stuff like that and      the general public doesnt know that if if if theyre sentenced to life that they wont serve life of course the judge will know when hell be up for parole and all that so yeah   right right so hell be able to give them the maximum sentence in some cases there   okay i must not have understood the whole thing because i didnt hear them say that but yeah   oh yeah they they they give that as as an example of something that   uhhuh   that might happen   but i think if the entire trial was left to one person  ive got a four year old that you can hear but um   oh yes   i dont know you people too many people can take vendettas out on people   right right   and everything   or just you know there are two people who say well he just looks guilty um   right but thats true   thats actually thats a wonderful way to get off jury duty you know someone says to you you know when they ask you if you uh if you want to be on you know when youre called called for duty say oh yeah i want to be on jury duty because i can spot a guilty person a mile a way   yeah   they quickly let you off jury duty i hear um   right because they they know that youre biased   oh yeah that that that that thats thats the way it works there um anyway i think that probably for for having it what about you know about being unanimous i mean thats sort of a strange case because i wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someones guilty and one person doesnt one person thinks that that theyre not guilty and they cant decide for hours unless they convince that one person you know   does it have to be unanimous   i believe it does have to be unanimous actually   well then they consider it a hung jury i guess i think and then they uh have a retrial or do they   yeah i think they either have a retrial eventually or or they call it a mistrial or something i havent been to law school so   uhhuh no me neither   so i dont know much about that i just know that um i wonder because sometimes i think about it actually i think well what if i were that one person and i was completely convinced that that that that this person wasnt guilty you know   well you dont have to be really convinced that hes guilty its just if they cant prove hes guilty because   right uh but i mean what if eleven other people are saying one thing you know and youre youre the one person saying the other thing   yeah   i would hate to be that person because you would be uh   you know would you give in   you know bombarded by all the other eleven jurors   yeah saying   to you know just say hes guilty so we can get out of here and go home   yeah   yeah   yeah i wonder about those things you know or even if its you know i i guess if they were to say well it doesnt have to be unanimous whats the cut off number seven five you know six six you know how do you decide   umhum   is it you know how do you decide what number of people have to say that   i know its too bad one of us dont have some knowledge on this huh       but but um i dont i just hope if i ever go to court that they all unanimous on not guilty  well youve seen like these TV movies  Kyle im talking hush  but uh     yeah   well how theyll you know the through the whole movie you think this persons i dont know but one thing that i thought was pretty weird is how somebody cant be trialed tried tried uh excuse me twice for the same crime   yeah ive never quite understood that um   well i just think its its weird because ive saw well of course soap operas im an soap opera fanatic this one guy had uh framed himself to make it where which he really did kill the person but then he   okay   set it up where it looked like somebody was trying to frame him and he was on trial for it and then you know it came out that he was being framed so then he was found not guilty and then just directly after the trial they found out he really was guilty and he couldnt be tried again   right and they cant do anything about it   yeah because   yeah i often wonder about that i wonder if if maybe you know i i i dont i dont i dont know the law on that but if they have new evidence can they can they try retry or can they you know bring you back   no i dont think they can you know i saw it on LA Law too   oh actually thats true ive seen the same thing on LA Law as well   yeah about that woman   yeah well so i wonder and then i wonder why that you know there there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that you you know something like   yes but yes   something like well you cant be tried for the same trial because that would bias the the the the jury or something or you know   right and im sure that you know its the lawyers   yeah   uh after the uh defendant defending the defendants lawyer and the prosecuting attorney im sure the prosecuting attorney could make a real good case if he you know knew all the details of the defendants you know case   in in of the defense in advance       yeah well well theres also the issue of for instance you cant um you cant uh very often you cant um when someone is is on trial for something you cant bring up prior convictions   right like if theyre on trial uh trial for rape you cant have any you cant bring up the sexual assaults and stuff or whatever   which right thats completely beyond me i mean thats just   yeah i know if its related they should be able to   i wonder yeah yeah i mean if this man is is accused of raping someone then i think that something like sex you know the fact that he sexually sexually assaulted someone is a crucial bit of evidence   yeah right yeah   that adds to the fact and i i i   but theyre not allowed to do that   i i often i never understand you know having again having im sure there are some deep seated reasons you know to i mean often times i wonder about rules like this and im sure that that that there are some reasons   well that one does seem that one does seem out of it though   for good   because its it well youre allowed to show their character do you know what i mean and if it shows that their characters you know   right   capable of lesser  assaults like that and stuff   then right then then   right that that lead led to that   then they should be closed yeah i mean thats what i think but i dont um but i dont quite understand   tell you what we need to do is go into law and then well be able to or vote do you vote  yeah do you vote   do i vote oh yeah i vote yes   okay we youll help out a little bit   yeah   putting the right people in the office thats a lot to do with it too a lot uh a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the um general public wants so theyll be revoted and all that   oh yeah well thats thats that thats very true but then again often often times they dont as well often times they dont uh they just go you know theyre youve got people like who are uh   right right   who are you know lame lame ducks and they sort of dont care about anything and just want to go ahead and   right they sit on the fence so well oh i talked about this the other day they wont say yes and they wont say no to just certain issues just because they dont know what the public wants or the publics split on it   thats true thats true i often i mean that that like you say thats another discussion but i have had that discussion before as well where you werent i i wonder about the politics politics of it all so   yeah right because most of it is politics even in the courts   yeah well even in the courts you well well theyre all appointed   right   i mean thats even another another issue you know should should should judges be appointed you know and or or um often times i look at friends we had uh a serial killer around here who killed eleven women   uhhuh now was that the um green some guy that was attacking women jogging   choking oh and and choking them yeah uh his name is Arthur Shotcross   no well did they have a T V movie about him   im not sure if they had one yet but im sure they will um because he was he was on some sort of news special though he was he was uh he killed because he was just on trial like maybe a year ago   well well how was he killing the women   um he was strangling some of them   were they jogging on a   oh no usually they were prostitutes actually   oh okay   because he was he was actually this is a very sad case the man was let out he was in prison for um sexually assaulting two children   oh see thats what i mean then they let them out and then theyre able to do it again   right he he they let him out and then and then he wasnt he wasnt allowed back in the town where he had done this so he came to our he came to Rochester instead and they they they realized later he hed killed about between eleven and twelve women at least   i think my sister is married to a guy from Rochester   and oh really way up north here huh   yeah yeah way up north well uh im originally from Kentucky   oh okay still way up north sort of um   so yeah i im i was up north too but uh thats one of the reasons i think judges should be the ones to sentence people because they do know you know if you sentence them to three life times then they probably wont get out on parole     yeah wont get out exactly yeah this this this man was sentenced to i think like three life times but he was you know it was just horrible because um his his his trial was you know was it was it was televised and this and that and what they were pleading was um they were pleading insanity   uhhuh   i mean its clear to me the man is insane and should just be locked up for life   well of course but they just need to do something with him he needs to be annihilated   right i mean i dont know what you do with them at that point if youre that crazy but what what struck me is you know they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours and by the end i realized that maybe it would have been better if they had it wouldnt have been a jury of his peers but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead to sort look at it you know i mean i dont think its feasible but it would be an interesting thought if youre   yeah well its supposed to be a jury of your peers they couldnt have a a bunch of psychotics up there   no or right right exactly but give them a bunch of psychotics but at least have a have a have a bunch of psychiatrists you know just sort of look at him and decide i mean there was the issue of   uhhuh did they have a trial by jury for him   whats that yeah they did   huh well   they had a regular trial by jury for him and and
