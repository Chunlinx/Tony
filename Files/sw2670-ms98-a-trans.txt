                so tell me about Silence of the Lambs is it great   i liked it i really did actually i saw it twice my roommate exroommate and i were real into psychological things we we think people with mind problems are really interesting so       i mean you know real psychotic people so we were dying to see it so we went and saw it and i had to see it the second time to get it all because i kept my eyes closed through so much of the first part   right is it really that scary   well its its not that its that scary its that its so graphic because uh how well are you going to see it i dont want to tell you how it ends   i i i uh i plan on probably renting it at some point in my life   okay  so some time later much later huh     yeah ive got small children i dont get out to many movies     okay well its uh what is so weird about it is that it its a real its based on real people   umhum   and i read the story in People magazine about where they got the characters in the movie and theyre a combination of a lot of different serial killers in real life and so a lot of things that happen in the movie the only thing really scary about it is that it could happen to you it really does happen in real life you know normally normally in movies you can look at it and say well its a movie   and that doesnt really happen its only pretend   right right but in this youre going i i would have done that i can see where that would happen     oh   and its it gets really scary but its its a real interesting movie very thought provoking there are so many things to discuss when the movies over if youre one of those people that likes to discuss things and and think about why it happened   uhhuh   i i still talk about it with  well call each other every now and then and go remember when in the movie this happened well i was just reading today and and things just keep relating back to it i thought it was fascinating   wow maybe i should go see it in a theatre and plan to go out to dinner afterwards so we could sit and talk about it   i dont know if you want to go to dinner       maybe just go out for a soda or something       i dont think you want to eat it it is real good though its its uh i liked it i liked Dances with Wolves too though that was a real good movie   oh yeah thats one of the best films ive seen in a long time   yeah i didnt think id like it i dont normally like the uh the old West type movies things like that the they dont normally interest me but that one i really really liked because it it i didnt know so much about the Indians and all that that happened in that part of the war   umhum   i had never heard anything really about that before and this was a whole new idea to me anyway i thought it was real good   what whats your heritage   um im about a quarter Italian and my grandmother on my mothers side is a little bit of everything   oh   typical American little bit of Indian little bit of this little bit of that and thats about it   yeah ive ive got quite a bit of Indian blood in me so   what do you   some of it was um things that i had heard well both of i had two great grandparents that were full blood   oh really   and but they were on opposite sides   which which one were they Sioux Indians or what were they   no one was uh Blackfoot and one was Cherokee   oh neat   and um so i knew a lot about just um oh the kind of respect they had for the earth   right   that it was real it wasnt something id just read in books it was something i was taught   right   and um and so you know like the the scene with the buffalo   uhhuh   oh i cried that was horrible   that was awesome oh i did too i did too   i i just i mean it you know it that because i know it happened over and over and over again   yeah   and i mean its just like were raping our land now but   umhum   um you know it was i i just thought that was one of the movies best movies ive seen in so long because it made me laugh i mean i was you know parts of it i was just almost in the aisles laughing over it and   it makes you realize how really ignorant some white people are people who have no ethnic background no heritage anything other than just typical Americans a little bit of everything and they dont really know   umhum   they dont know anything about the Indian people they dont know anything about the Europeans that came over   umhum   you know it it really made it seem like we are so in the dark on so many things   umhum yeah i think that it yeah tried to make people realize that um we cant close our mind to another culture simply because its not ours   right exactly   and uh and it was so there was so much the Indians did teach us and there was so much more they could have taught us had we only listened   uhhuh and i still really other than just basic ignorance of prejudice i dont understand why we didnt why them why did we not listen to them ive never   they had something we wanted  we wanted   yeah well yeah but isnt isnt it sad to think that that much that greed can do that much to you or to a person i mean they we wanted the land and we didnt want them to have it so just screw everything theyre going to think and teach us and tell us and and we could just like wipe out an entire people like that   yeah   thats thats sad   well i i think of the uh you know the the gang wars and the racial wars that we have now in so many of our cities and in our high schools   right   that are basically the same thing acted out by a younger generation over   uhhuh   uh you know theyre fighting over things that are to them are important enough to possibly die for   right   and yet they just dont matter   right   and you know i mean it comes down to that the land or the the territory or the you know the bathroom or whatever is there for everyone   right right   and it can be enjoyed by all if shared   right   i mean but but thats what we did to the Indians we said you know were afraid of you you dont you dont look like we do you dont talk like we do so were going to move you out   right   and and we offered reservations as you know consolation prize and they were a joke   right       right that is thats a good way to look at it a consolation prize thats about all it was   yeah yeah they   thats really sad that things like that can still happen today after all this time   yeah   you would think wed a learned something by now   yeah but he who has the biggest stick is still going to win   yeah thats true he with the most toys       i guess   thats right       hey all that counts in Monopoly is who has Boardwalk and Pork Park Place   thats right whos got more hotel       i really did like Silence of the Lambs though that was really an interesting movie i i liked Dances with Wolves but it was a more an emotional like you get real involved and you cried and you feel real sorry for the people you know and all this but in Silence of the Lambs it was kind of that Fatal Attraction did you see that   umhum yeah   it was kind of that feeling through the whole thing on the edge of your seat wanting to tell the people what to do next       you know youre like no dont go in there dont give him your name  you you just you start acting it out for them   yeah i definitely ought to get in on a rental then because people would look at me in the theatre going what is this woman doing   no believe it or not the whole theatre got involved i mean yes in fact im trying to i cant remember which scene it was but at one point everyone in the theatre clapped     really   they were so happy it was it was and i thought i was just there and i heard other people crying when i was crying   man   there were certain parts in there that were real sad and you hear people when you know the the actors are doing things that you know are about to reap some bad thing and everyone in the theatre will go  and you know everybody does it its like the whole theatre you get this big  sound and       it was i i think everybody felt that way through it it was very real involved and all the girls were crying when they walked out and all the guys were just kind of staring straight ahead like that didnt bother me and you know it did   goodness     i   yeah this is going to roll right off my side   right i remember the first time i saw it was with my boyfriend and he was joking with me about how i wasnt going to watch half of it i was going to close my eyes and there were quite a few scenes where i did but this one scene i knew something bad was coming i could tell so i ducked my head and about that time i heard the audience go  and my boyfriend jumped       he literally jumped and he swears he didnt do it and i felt him jump   oh thats great   and it really was to this day i tell him he was scared and he says no no you you just didnt watch it you should have watched it it wasnt that bad       im like yeah right thats why you jumped           im going to have a hard time waiting for it to come out on video now   yeah really it is a great movie you got to see it   yeah   its so fascinating to think that there are people that are so so smart theyre such geniuses that theyve cross that line and theyre theyre psychotic and its amazing   umhum yeah its very scary   it really is i mean to think that it could be anybody we know i mean you could be walking right next to one of them and not even know it because they look perfectly normal i mean this man was a doctor   umhum umhum   and he had patients in fact they were the people he killed you know and you think right now your doctor could be wacko he could be some psychotic killer and no one would ever know   yeah   its just strange but that that was what was that was what made the movie because its so real       i like movies that are based on on things that are real   yeah yeah i do too oh yeah oh what was it um the ones about um Von Bulows   oh what was that   um oh the something about Portuguese
