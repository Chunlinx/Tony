        uh hello Steve   hello   uh you were going to talk about child care   yeah uh we well me and my wife we got a five year old and we have   umhum   uh kind of like child rearing he we have problems with him every now and then but other than that its its pretty hes a pretty good kid   umhum umhum   and we uh really dont really have any problem with finding day care for him because im in the service and we just take him to the day care on base   i see how much how much do they charge   they charge about forty five dollars a week   uhhuh that seems relatively low by commercial standards isnt it usually about sixty to a hundred a week   um yeah its its pretty pretty expensive on the outside   right um so youve youve been youve been pleased with the service   oh yeah they do a lot of you know lot of stuff in in their day care and stuff   uhhuh uh how long have you been taking your son there   oh about a year now   uhhuh before that did he go somewhere else or   well before that my wife was kind of stay at home mom now she went back to school so   i see you say you went back to school   no the wife went back to school   oh i see uhhuh   so hes been there for almost a year now   uhhuh um gee i think   where where does she go to school   she goes to UT uh Arlington   uhhuh okay yeah i had a student who went there at one time but i think were getting off the topic so   yeah uh   so um  lets see i mean i i was uh reading i read a lot of articles on child care back when it was when there was a debate in Congress over funding of uh child care centers and what should be done   yeah   and i came out uh very much in favor of a tax credit approach where parents would be given a tax credit and they would select whatever services they wanted for their child rather than to have the government subsidize certain providers   yeah   and uh that was i i thought it was important well i mean it is important uh that that people have the opportunity to select the service that they would choose because a lot of kids are in you know in centers well well not really centers but theyre being cared for by neighbors and uh   umhum   uh thats the sort of they they prefer it that way the parents do because they know the people who are caring for their kids and they dont have to take them very far plus about a third of the kids are in church run centers and there was a big church state controversy over whether the government could fund those are not i think they ultimately decided to but they placed a lot of restrictions on it so it wasnt clear that the church child care centers would want to go to the trouble   um yeah   so uh anyway  i continue to be an advocate of the um of the tax credit approach now myself im not married so i dont have any kids and its not a problem but uh       still i know a lot of people that do and uh you know i mean you you you really wouldnt wouldnt um uh well im on gee im on the benefits committee at the university here and uh child care is a topic of conversation we the university started up a center this year but its about two miles away from campus and im not sure its going to be real convenient for people to take their kids over there   yeah well well when i was stationed in Lubbock Texas uh they had a child care center right on base uh right at the school i mean   uhhuh uhhuh   and that helped out my wife because she just went part time there and you know take a couple of classes a week but   uhhuh right uhhuh   and uh i think its a good deal deal but um like you were saying its about two miles from the school and thats   yeah its just a lot of time   its not going to be very good i think they should talk about putting one right on the campus itself   yeah well they say they claim that its a better environment for kids than to be in with all the students   well they kind of have this i think in a different building you know on right on the uh edge of the campus and everything where they really didnt get in   uhhuh yeah yeah i am sure that a lot of it had to do with how cheap it was to acquire the building if they wouldve built a new building then it wouldve im im sure it would have cost a lot more than if they uh if they put it down where they did where real estates probably cheaper   in oh yeah um i think they used one of the existing buildings they already had   umhum   so you know it it worked out pretty good   so so so what do you think about the about the child about the tax credit versus the subsidy approach which seems seems most appealing to you   uh well i havent really thought about it like that   because well you know we pay   yeah i think well the   excuse me we pay for any you know the child care but we dont pay as much as they do off base   thats right yeah   uh i think the government should subsidize some of it you know to give the parents you know some break on on the money portion of it   well i mean they they yeah the issue the issue is whether they can take it off of their taxes or whether the government decides which centers are qualified the other problem
