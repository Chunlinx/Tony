EvennonTina news is being turned against Brown The publication of two new booksabout former editor William Shawn has inspired another round of pompous elegiesfor the grand old New Yorker             Who would have thought itthe queen of spin is losing aspin war You live by buzz you die by buzz says an ex New Yorkereditor with malicious glee Its not that anything has actually changedat The New Yorker in recent weeks but there is a perception that Brownand the magazine are stumbling And as Brown knows as well as anyoneperception matters            Brownafter all is print medias greatest showman The daughter of a film producerand a publicist she packages her magazines like movies and promotes them likea flack Her formula She overpays star writers gives them top billing andrelies on striking covers to attract readers As the yearold editor of theTatler  Brown transformed a stodgy British society magazine into asassy nasty attentiongetting one Browns critics say she revived VanityFair simply by publishing slobbering celebrity stories Thats not fair toher Everyone published slobbering celebrity stories in the s Brownsgenius was to combine them with superb investigative political and featurewriting then wrap it all in a salacious cover that you just had toopen            She brought that gift for spectacle to TheNew Yorker in  Her recreation of the magazine is a familiar tale Sheinherited from Mr Shawnby way of Robert Gottlieba tired unread weeklyRequisite example of dreariness the multipart series on grains In no timeflat she turned it into the most talked about magazine in America Shesupplemented the already prodigiously talented staff with her own snazzy hiresHer magazine pandered to celebrities and petted moguls but it also ran thebestwritten bestedited features in the industry Topicality reigned In theold days you couldnt tell what year an issue of The New Yorker waspublished now you could tell what day it was published The magazine whichhad been selfeffacing to the point of reclusiveness suddenly was brilliantlypackaged and promoted The chattering classes began chattering about it andhavent stopped since            What isthe price of Browns methods A civil slowmoving magazine became a chaoticilltempered one Brown is capricious She charms the editors writers andadvertisers she needs but frosts underlings Her buzz production is endlessThere are three fulltime PR staffers at The New Yorker  as well asseveral fulltime event planners The magazine relies on parties conferencesand stuntsRoseanne as guest editorto generate heat Its not that Brownsuninterested in beautiful or ambitious writingshe publishes plenty of itbutshe cares most about attentiongetting            The old New Yorker was whimsical often fatally soWriters were expected to indulge their own peculiar interest and damn publicopinion Browns New Yorker seems polltested If you are writing aboutwhats hot then you are writing about what everyone is writing aboutBrowns magazine is predictable and getting more so the longer she is there Ofcourse it devoted Talk of the Town to Sinatra when he died Of course itwrote a suckup about Michael Jordan during the NBA playoffs a suckup aboutRobert Redford for the release of The Horse Whisperer  a suckup aboutWarren Beatty for Bulworth  Click for another reason Brown favorscelebrity A magazine that was once entirely and bizarrely different fromother magazinesoften to its detrimentis now much the same as them Clickfor another important way in which sameness has affected The NewYorker             Despiteher current woes no one really expects Brown to leave The New Yorker Newhouse cant afford not to renew her contract To dump Brown now amid allthe bad financial news would be an acknowledgment that he picked wrong in            Nor is Brown likely to quit She was reportedlyoffered a job producing a weeknight version of  Minutes  but there areno signs that shes interested She has too much pride to surrender in themiddle of the battle As an old friend of hers puts it She would only quit ifshe could quit in triumph with everyone acknowledging that it is the bestmagazine in the world and that she is the best editor and with the magazine inthe black            In theblackthat is the real key to understanding whats going on at Brownsmagazine The New Yorker that Newhouse bought in  was profitableBut having shelled out  million for the magazine Newhouse was notsatisfied with the measly  million a year it was earning He set out toimpose the Cond Nast model on The New Yorker  expand circulation andraise ad rates            The move to Cond Nastify the magazine worked sort ofThe New Yorker began offering  Brown did her job producing buzz tofuel circulation The number of subscribers soared from about  in themids to around  The magazine hiked ad rates accordingly pricingquirky advertisers out of the magazine in favor of big national ones Adrevenue increased but not enough to cover enormous new costs Recruiting newsubscribers by direct mail printing more magazines and mailing more magazinesare tremendously expensive operations            Brown andNewhouses New Yorker is squeezed between newsweeklies and glossymonthlies The market for generalinterest weekly magazines has long sincedried up Look and the Saturday Evening Post are dead Brown hastried to remake The New Yorker as an upscale newsweekly but its paying readers cant match the  million that Time offers itsadvertisers The magazine cant compete with monthlies either VanityFair and its advertisements have a full  days to be seen by readersThe New Yorker has a seven day window            The New Yorker has fought back with specialissuesmassive tomes about race or Hollywood or the future In  its sixdouble issues and three other special issues accounted for  percent of themagazines advertising pages according to Advertising Age  The doubleissues save The New Yorker postage and printing costs and theiradvertisements have  days to reach readers            But the magazine is stilllosing money and Brown seems trapped She has staked her career onprofitability The New Yorker could probably make money as a bimonthlyor monthly ideas that have reportedly been floated within Cond Nast ButBrown and Newhouse probably would not accept that tarnish on their reputationsThey dont want to be the cretins who killed Americas last great weekly Themagazine could also break even by raising subscription prices and shrinking thenumber of subscribers That too would look terrible on Browns CV            Brown hasalways had an outsized ambition and now she is imprisoned by it She andNewhouse have traded a small weird profitable magazine for a big flashyunprofitable one And now they dont seem to know what to do with it                           Click toread why Brown likes celebrity stories If you missed the sidebar about TheNew Yorker s moral
