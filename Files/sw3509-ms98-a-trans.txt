                so how do you feel about capital punishment   well i im not really certain how i uh i im not certain that it does does a lot of good i mean that it ends up ends up effectively uh uh uh avoiding a lot of the crimes that that have capital punishment   right you dont think   penalties yet on the other hand uh i dont know i mean theres things that seems like its its its the right thing to do now you know i mean somebody as serial serial serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns you know fifty fifty children in a school yard you kind of i dont know what about yourself   i uh um i have a the same dilemma i think um its its you know it seems right sometimes and then other times you dont know um   uhhuh i mean people like i  its been shown i mean like the Arab societies and stuff end up uh having  effective effective effective punishments and and theyre theyre extremely severe um i you know i think to a certain degree the reason that it it doesnt serve as a deterrent uh may be because you you you you never know if its gonna be applied applied right unlike unlike uh like in in Arab societies if you got get caught stealing they chop off your hand and and you walk around the rest of your life  with one hand and then everybody knows exactly what what for right   right   um   right   and you know and here with our court system and and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can you can kind of always count on the fact you know or or theres a good chance youre gonna get off and so   umhum and also it doesnt seem like it does them any harm i mean sure their life is taken but theyd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway so i think sometimes theyd prefer just to   uhhuh   get it over with so its more of the easy way out than   yeah some people   making them pay for the consequences for the   yeah   you know what theyve done   except that you know i mean the the average cost  to  society to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is is extremely high i mean something i i was amazed at a uh per year its something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year   yeah   to keep people in jail uh you know i mean thats sort of a uh sort of a crass perspective i mean on the usage of capital punishment but on the other hand uh um   umhum   you know i dont i dont know if if its a crime thats thats that serious that theyre really never gonna be out of jail um   right but then again also you cant bring back lives that have been taken anyway so um its it doesnt it seems by that by i dont know doesnt ever really pay um   oh i know i mean you cant it doesnt taking taking one more life doesnt doesnt doesnt get replace you know get things back the way they were right yeah i dont know i i dont know i really dont know uh im in Texas   yeah right it doesnt bring back every what state are you in oh really in Dallas   where where no im in Austin   oh really   and where are you where are you calling from   um right now im in Utah but im from Plano Texas   oh i see uhhuh   so um   yeah so you   um what are the laws like in Texas its   it is Texas is has has is one of the one of the states well i guess theres more and more states that are that are going back to capital punishment um Texas has had it for a while its one of the quicker it once it was uh it was reallowed i think it was outlawed for a while by the by the supreme court i mean or or the interpretation of the constitution and it seems like everybody stopped and then and then once they sort of reallowed it Texas was one of the first to uh to actually uh implement it again   oh really   they do it by uh by lethal do it by lethal injection so you know   uhhuh   im originally from Kansas and in Kansas also uh they they almost immediately put back capital punishment and uh there they do it by hanging   wow   still right they have i still remember the the the movie uh In Cold Blood i dont know if youve ever i i im sure youre familiar with it but have you seen the movie   i havent no   yeah the way   and they do it that way   yeah well they they show it  not not i mean the the movie was made in like nineteen sixty two or something like that and so its uh its not particularly graphic but on the other hand its   huh   its fairly impressive to watch them you know walk into the room with gallows its a kind of a barn like structure   wow yeah i think that theyre i think that capital punishment is is is um in tact in Utah also im not really familiar with   is that right are you there in school yeah uhhuh yeah   yeah i am so but i think that they do  well well long time ago i can i remember my dad was telling me this i think that um they do it by like a bunch of men have guns and one of them has the real gun in it so they dont know who killed   uhhuh has has a yeah has has a real bullet and the rest of them have blanks   right   yeah   i think   yeah i i certainly wouldnt want to be the executioner i know that  ive always said that if i if i had to kill and clean and  my own my own meat i think id become a vegetarian   yeah i know i know     as as long as youre sort of safely removed from it it seems seems not so not so bad i guess but
