            so are are you a news person   uh i really am i enjoy i enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as i can although you know im a fulltime student and i work fulltime too so or not fulltime but i work quite a bit and so  so i mostly depend on the radio   yes   you know on the way to work i like i like to listen to National Public Radio uh All Things Considered   yes great show   yeah and i like to listen to that and catch you know you i dont get i dont get a lot of uh sometimes i dont get the current events you know because that show kind of has feature stories that might not  directly deal with uh you know some important issue on the day but   yeah so so the real the real current news and the hard news   yeah   is is not a theres not really enough of it there   right thats right yeah   yeah ive had ive had that frustration too and i end up switching stations from time to time   yeah yeah do you like you like NPRs uh programming   uh in general you know um i watch   yeah uhhuh   a lot of CNN uh and CSPAN   umhum umhum   um well i i  subscribe to three newspapers   umhum   um you know i sort of cant get enough of this   yeah   and and i when i travel elsewhere im often amazed at the local papers how little they have   how how how oh yeah oh yeah   of of world world events and national events well in in Dallas what are the what is the newspaper situation   well  we dont we we have a a big newspaper situation uh because we used to have two newspapers up until uh last Sunday and a uh major um a one of our major papers just closed down they closed shop and said well we cant put any more papers out and were done   hm was was that the the better paper or  compared to the the other   yeah i thought so it was a it was a more effective paper as far as i was concerned it it had uh  uh it got to the news you know and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy   umhum   uh which i like i dont i dont like to you know i like to save the editorial information or the  the politically uh weighted information you know for the for a different section i like just to get to the you know find out whats happening   yes   pretty quick uh and i feel that the other newspaper uh uh the Times the Dallas Morning News is the one thats still here the Times Herald is the one that closed up   umhum   and uh the the Morning News was was is is okay but you know you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as im concerned you know  many times it doesnt  doesnt reflect my own opinion and   umhum but if you if you were to look at the front page of todays Morning News Morning Times rather uh would would you would you see  things about whats going on in Europe   umhum no no thats the problem uh you you know you see you see Troy Aikmans knee surgery on the front page you know     oh whoever Troy Aikman is   yeah yeah a a quarterback for the Broncos or for the for the Cowboys uh you know you know you know what i mean that theres uh  local news that   okay yeah   uh that really a lot of times doesnt doesnt change change my life one way or the other  so uh   yeah i guess its current events but not the kind of current events that changes the world   right right yeah not something youll youll uh be interested in ten years from now by any means   yeah   you know how how about you uh i guess in Washington D C you guys have several papers that are pretty   yes um i i rather like the Washington Post   pretty effective dont you yeah   but i also get the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal   uhhuh   uh and you know each of them covers different things in in different different different in different ways and so its   right right   uh you know if i only looked at one of them i would have a different perspective clearly would have a different perspective on the world   right yeah uh i i i have a question uh does does does the Wall Street Journal uh i ive kind of gathered lately that uh maybe their information is not just only related to business is that is that a correct assumption   that that that is certainly true um   uhhuh   they will they will have articles like a few days ago they had a a nice article on Einstein you know theory of relativity   oh oh   you know that started on the front page and ran ran in into the full almost full page inside   uhhuh   now these are feature kind of articles all all the all the um   wow   you know the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities   right   but but theres some very good other articles   umhum   uh youll find in the in the Journal   umhum do you find that youre uh  uh disappointed or pleased with uh uh the performance of like network coverage of news   um  i wish it were in more depth um that doesnt mean to say longer just more facts would be nice   umhum umhum umhum   um CNN has has you know was was pretty good during the war   oh yeah definitely   um and they were you know sort of had a unique vantage point for for doing that reporting   umhum   but you know its not its its uh never quite
