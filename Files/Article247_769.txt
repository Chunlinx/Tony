                                 Stiff Warning                           USAToday and the Los Angeles Times lead with Janet Renos finding that thereis no reason to continue looking into Al Gores  election fundraising TheNew York Times which has hawked the story on its front and editorial pages harder than anybodyelse offleads the denouement Earlier in the week when the AOLNetscape dealwas in the works the Times went with something else but leads with ittoday now that theres a fork in it The Washington Post leads with word from GOP sources that asingle charge of perjury against President Clinton might win a House floorvote but additional charges such as obstruction of justice would not Thepaper also says that the idea of a resolution censuring Clinton is gainingcongressional momentum            If the Gore decision seems familiar thats because Reno made it oncebefore but then reopened the investigation based on new evidence of Goresattendance at some meetings where ultimately illegal approaches to fundraisingmay have been discussed Both the LAT and NYT explain that thegist of Renos finding yesterday was that there was no compelling evidence fromGores remarks at these meetings that he was contemplating flouting theelection finance laws Some Republicans expressed strong emotion about Renosdecision We need to take these matters out of the hands of the AttorneyGeneral Sen Orrin Hatch is quoted saying in the LAT  while RepDan Burton is in the NYT saying Once again the attorney general hasfailed to follow the law For the past two years the attorney general has madeit clear she is committed to protecting the president The papers agree thatRenos decision clears the deck for a much more troublefree Gore run at theWhite House in             The NYT lead describes the AOLNetscape tandem as a corporate odd couple referringto the formers pitch to the technologically challenged and the lattersstatus as the epitome of leading edge siliconsciousness Yet the story spellsout the companies common vision of a notdistant world in which the Internetis accessed primarily by high tech but easytouse and low cost appliances thatwould be as ubiquitous as cell phones are today However the Times saysmany Netscape programmers may be reluctant to work for AOL because of itsmiddlebrow why not middlebrowser reputation setting up a big run onNetscape by headhunters            Both USAT and LAT run reefers to stories inside aboutincreasing Viagra concerns also noted inside by the WP  Both papersreport that the FDA is adding stricter health warnings to Viagra labels Inaddition to the current warning against taking the medication if a patient isalready taking any heart drug containing nitrates the labels will now also saythat Viagra could be risky for men with heart problems or very high or lowblood pressure The LAT explains that this is based on a close look atthe  cases of American men whove diedmostly from heart attacksafterpopping the pills The point is that when sex itself is risky because ofunderlying cardiological problems then impotence remedies should be avoidedAlso both papers report that investigators are trying to determine if Viagrais implicated in a Maryland airplane crash last Saturday which would be afirst A bottle of Viagra prescribed for the dead pilot was found in thewreckage Its known that in about  percent of users the drug disturbs colorvision which could make reading cockpit instruments and runway lightsproblematic            The Wall Street Journal Tax Report says more and morenotsowealthy people are getting hit with the alternative minimum tax whichwas designed to keep the wealthy from dodging federal tax entirely through theartful use of deductions credits and the like The paper cites the example ofone veteran Washington tax adviser who was amazed to receive an IRS letterinforming him that he owed  in AMT This report would be a lot morecompelling if the Journal had told the reader what the mans income wasBut absent this information its a little hard to get worked up about thisissue Todays Papers doubts that there are many veteran Washington taxadvisers who arent well off            The LAT front and the NYT oped page put forward a total ofthree pieces on the ethics of last Sundays  Minutes Kevorkian broadcastThe Times antiDr K oped calls the broadcast a snuff film andwonders in light of the shows big rating and attendant advertising revenuesShouldnt the profit motive end where life and death become mere commoditiesfor public consumption Frank Rich in his Kevorkian column is worried too but decides that the show wasjustified by its prompting of honest debate on a topic now more shrouded thanoral sex And he quotes the shows Don Hewitt and Mike Wallace appealing to thesame principle Messrs Hewitt and Wallace make the same case in theLAT  It wasnt sweeps numbers they were after they claim but importantnews None of this coverage mentions a simple way CBS could have been much moreconvincing on this point donate all ad revenues produced by the show tocharity How about to a hospice
