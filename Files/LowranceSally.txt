                     Hey Jessica this is Sally         I thought Id talk to you for a few minutes or eight maybe starting about my grandparents         You never got to meet my grandparents neither did your dad actually         But I had four of the most awesome grandparents in the world         I called my mothers parents Nana and Didad         Didad never took a music lesson in his whole life but he played in a band         Thats where Tommy got his musical talent         Nana was one of the sweetest most incredibly sweet and giving people in the whole world         Little tiny lady she wasnt even five feet tall         She was one of  children which is just amazing in todays world to think of a house that full of children         My dads parents were Memaw and Pop Pop         Right now I want to talk to you about Memaw thats memaw cap the first m and its all one word         Pop Pop by the way was incredibly awesome too         He took us out to Holiday Inn breakfast for pancakes every single Sunday that we were ever around him         He didnt take up golf until after he retired         He was such a fun person         But Memaw is the one that used to tell stories         Memaw was one of  children         Her dad lived on well Im sorry the whole family lived on a farm her dad worked on a farm         He didnt own it he just was one of the workers         So you can imagine that they didnt have a lot of money         Memaw said she was only spanked one time in her whole life and thats when her pet pig died         Well her pet pig died because she snuck it in the house took it upstairs and gave it a bath and it died of pneumonia         The only other time that Memaw said that she got into trouble was when it was her job to bring the cows in at night         And this one particular night she just wasnt into it         You know she just didnt feel like going up on that hill to bring those cows down         But she had to so the obedient little person that she was she did it anyway         Well the cows wouldnt cooperate they just would not hurry down that hill back into the barn         She got mad at them so she tied their tails together so they would stay together and come down the hill         Well with their tails tied together coming down the hill along came a tree and they straddled the tree one went to the right one went to the left         Course the tails were tied together they got hung up the knot wouldnt come undone but one of the tails did         I dont know if its true or not but that was one of the stories she told us         The other story that she told us one time when we asked her about her upbringing brought us all to tears because like I told you her father worked on a farm they didnt have a lot of money and yet they had  children         Thats a lot of children to feed when you dont have a lot of money         So her father had to walk her down the street she can remember holding his hand and walking down this dirt road with a little suitcase and in it was everything that she owned         And he took her to a neighbors and she became their foster child         I think that they actually had to do this with some of the other children also         So from then on in Memaw was being raised by this couple and was happy and had a good time there and a good life but about a year later this couple was killed in a car wreck         Memaw was born in  so I guess this foster family was tooling around in a Model T or something but they were killed in a car wreck         So then they had to find another place for Memaw to live         Now this farm was in WV and I dont know how they found this next family but there was a family in Baltimore MD that wanted to adopt her         So off she went to Baltimore MD         And it was a wonderful wonderful man who met her at the train station took her to his home         She said she had never seen anything this big in her house Im sorry in her life as his house         She walked in the front door and there was this great big tile floor the foyer had a huge ceiling and a spiral stairsc staircase         So she climbed the spiral staircase with him to her bedroom and just couldnt believe it         They had dolls all over the room for her and a great big bed that was all hers and she really did have a wonderful life         This gentleman put her through nursing school Memaw became a nurse was working in the hospital and was taking care of this one patient in particular a woman who had just given birth to twins and had complications         So in the weeks and months that she was ministering to this lady a young girl actually she was also getting to meet the family and it was and was becoming involved with them         The lady died         The ladys brother was my grandfather who she later married and they raised these two children like their own in addition to the other five children that they had         Memaw had to quit driving once she had children of her own because they cried every time she took drove drove the car         So she never drove again         She died when she was  as did Nana and both of my grandfathers died of heart problems when they were each  thats kind of amazing         So thats one little story for you         Now I can tell you about the story I can tell you the story about how I met your dad         I was playing tennis at Charlotte Indoor Tennis Club with my girlfriend Sandra Nyy thats nyy         Sandra now lives in Singapore         Well Sandra and I were getting ready for a tournament and we were practicing with Glenn Pennington a lady and Julie Calman I think         And there was other people out there I didnt know anybody except for Sandra and Glenn         Well there was this one guy out there who was really cute that had twinkly blue eyes and he was playing on the court next to us         And I was in one of my little phases where I really didnt want to have anything to do with men because Id just had a really horrible experience and it just I didnt have room for it in my life right then but I did think he was cute and I asked her who he was         And she told me         Well we played tennis the next week         The first time we played was Thursday then we played again the next Monday and low and behold there he was again although he wasnt on the court right next to me but I noticed him and I noticed he kept looking over at our court but I wasnt going to make eye contact because that was flirtatious and I was way too shy to be flirtatious         So we finished playing and I watched him walk behind our court and onto the common area and speak to someone         And I still wouldnt make eye contact with him         But I still asked her who he was         Well about a week later I get a phone call at work from Glenn Pennington who asked me if I would like to play tennis that Friday night mixed doubles with she and her husband against me and this guy named Hugh Lowrance and I said Who is Hugh Lowrance         She said         Dont you remember         Thats the guy at the tennis club that you asked me about         I said Well have you called him         And she said No I havent called him yet         But I think she told him that she hadnt called me yet either so I dont really know who she called first         Anyway I said Sure I would love to and he said Yep thatd be great         So I show up at the tennis court Friday night before six oclock so that I wont be late         Didnt want to be too fashionable you know         Well Friday was casual day at the law firm where I worked so I had on my nice little linen shorts and my nice little shoes and a cute little top         Well the parking lot where I worked was two and a half blocks away so we would oftentimes wear our tennis shoes in because thats a long hike in heels or whatever and I had walked in in tennis shoes my tennis shoes that I was going to play in that night and promptly left them under my desk downtown         So here I stand at the tennis court with this man looking ohsocute dressed all in white with a little white vest who Ive never met and were talking like two little magpies and I said We have a problem         He said Yeah I see the door to the club is locked         I said Well we have a bigger problem than that         He said Whats that         I said I dont have any shoes         He said What do you mean you dont have any shoes         I said Well I left them under my desk at work         He said Thats no problem         Well go get it         Where do you work         I said Downtown         He said We have a problem         See he hates to go downtown         So he put me in his car and we went to the nearest Omega Sports and bought me some shoes         And the girl that waited on me I was able to tell her This is a blind date         Ive made a hell of an impression already I know as I said tongue in cheek         And she said Oh my gosh         Well hes cute so she made sure I had hangers in the dressing room and I tried on a pair of shoes and they fit put on my tennis clothes and we were back at the court in  minutes         That was impressive         But we had a neat opportunity to talk in the car and we talked and laughed cause we were both kind a nervous and kind of silly and we go out to play tennis and were still being silly and talking and laughing and playing against our good friends Glenn and Fred who we never shouldve lost a game to as we proceeded to lose the first set because your dad couldnt keep the ball on the court basically         Ha ha but I know hell say the same thing         Anyway we decided we werent going to lose the match so we settled down and we played and won and had a good time and I thought Well cool         I bet we go out to eat now         It is Friday night its about eight thirty or nine         But nope your dad goes beelines it right for his car gets in the car and leaves and doesnt even ask for my number         Well it wasnt that unusual that a guy didnt ask for my number but I knew wed had a really good time         So I was kind of um surprised         But my little antennas perked up and I said Girlfriend girlfriend you can put that in quotes because thats what I was thinking         So I decided to make him tell me that he had a girlfriend         Actually I was just looking for another excuse to call him         So I picked up the phone about two weeks later and called him and told him that Jazz Charlotte was going on nope it was called Jazz Fest and that the company I worked for had a shuttle bus which it did and people signed up for it and you got to go to Jazz Fest and it was a lot a fun and and I said I dont know your status         I dont know if youre dating anybody at the time but if youre not and youd like to go I would love for you to be my guest         And he said Well you know I would really love to go I really mean that but I am dating somebody right now and I cant         I said Well thats all right but I had a great time playing tennis and maybe Ill see you over at the club sometime         And he said Cool         And I hung up the phone thinking Darn I wish could meet somebody just like him that didnt have a girlfriend         But about six weeks later I get this phone call from someone asking for Chrissy Everett identifying himself as Jimmy Connors and it was guess who         And he said there was a party an anniversary party for some people that he worked with and did I want to go and he was sorry that he didnt get to go to Jazz Fest with me but he had been dating somebody and it was somebody that he used to be engaged to and then wasnt engaged to and they had reconciled but he knew it wasnt going work out but yet they were still dating when I played tennis with him but theyre not dating anymore         And I said Well cool         So we went to the party and we had a great time and weve pretty much been together ever since         And I bet Ive talked for eight minutes but I hope you enjoyed my stories         Talk to you soon         Bye
