        huh okay   i dont know how much i know about this subject   well i dont know if i know anything or not but ive ive got some opinions on it see those type of people that that have the most opinions ones at dont know anything   yeah okay go ahead yeah      well uh ive had teenagers and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers and i dont know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective uh i think this me generation has gone far too far and the young people are overly impressed and i think it wouldnt hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a more far more disadvantaged viewpoint   thats true   uh i personally know nothing about the Peace Corps though   um me either i i went to college and then started working and then got married and     but they have i read somewhere and im im out on a limb here some type of college uh volunteer work for teachers that they are straight out of college and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the uh lower income brackets of the United States have you ever heard about that one   no i havent i know that uh my sister i have a twin sister and when she graduated she went to teach in a small town down in south Texas and i know that like if you have college notes if you teach in a lower income bracket where they dont pay as much and they cancel part of your you know your college note or whatever   oh really   umhum if its like you know really a you know a lower paying job you know where in a small town you dont obviously you dont need as much as far as to you know to live   and this is money that shes borrowed to for her college education   yeah she only taught there one year but i   but she got credits for it      umhum   thats very interesting   and um i think it would be i know that also one of my cousins who uh he is in like the therapy type thing and and he was um some group paid part of his college income but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at uh uh i mean its a nursing home or something like that so you know if if i think that thats a good way for people to you know maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping   hum   people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want   yeah i think that is an excellent program i really do i like that and its its beneficial to the small towns too because they really really   yeah   have have a disadvantage that we dont understand because were in the Metroplex   as far as getting yeah getting doctors and all that kind of stuff yeah   right you know if if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist we could find one it wouldnt be convenient   yeah   but we could find one we wouldnt have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that   umhum yeah   so i i can see the advantage to that one the Peace Corps itself is really uh uh dying out isnt it   i really dont know that much about it you know i i i think of the Peace Corps you know more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when but yeah and dont they go into other countries and stuff   its still in existence i want to believe they go into other countries and teach them how to do things like farm   umhum   uh dig their own wells set up their schools   things that make them yeah make them more selfsupporting yeah   yes they its not a program to teach them to use the American money its a program to teach them to be more selfreliant   right yeah   and yes youre right i think its a sixties program i think it was one of Kennedys hot points that he that was his big deal   but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what its like if you dont have all the money and cant have what you want when you want it   right right um i think i i i ive singled out my grandchildren and but actually theyre theyre pretty good   umhum   along those lines as compared to what i have seen from other peoples children and grandchildren mine arent really that bad but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good   yeah   but theres a   i dont i dont know that you could require everyone to to do that for yeah to do it for a whole year or two years or something like that i dont know that that would work if if somebodys   mandatory just like like the draft no every time you have   was didnt really want to be there and didnt have yeah i mean thered be loopholes just like there is in anything else   they could buy their way out right you know they theyd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat but im wondering if theres another issue here and maybe this is why this has died out can you go into and this wasnt the question but its it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults can they go in there and can anyone go into well out of the Kurdish community is a little bit of extreme at this time but say i think Bangladesh would have been a good example or some some really desperate situation and teach them to farm and teach them and doesnt do any good   yeah   i dont know that it does i i i dont know that um   yeah   if you step back from the current issue and look at it more intellectually there are forever over as long as we know there are races of people that are dropping out you know were losing certain races of people there are people now   umhum   that are obsolete point and fact just just like endangered species of animals so there are quote tribes of people that are endangered or obsolete   umhum   and im just wondering if youre fighting a natural process there of being winnowed out theres a German word for it thats elegant but i never can remember what it was uh but but theyre theyre being winnowed because theyre where they are theyre not adapted to their environment essentially   right yeah   um and uh one of the quick examples is the aborigines   yeah umhum   uh when we were in Australia uh sad little things uh i felt sorry for them because their society isnt there anymore and their belief system and all all their structured of theirs all the structures of their society are gone essentially   yeah   and theyre just kind of more like a side show than anything else and thats sad but i dont think theres any way you could go uh the Peace Corps could go in and rescue those people and i that dont think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either   yeah really yeah   so i im wondering if the Peace Corps is really an effective tool   well and here with the Peace Corps were talking about all these people that arent even in our own country when theres enough people here that i think probably need help and could be helped   good point weve got enough without leave without a passport theres plenty   yeah   yes i think we ought to worry about our own species   and maybe rather than just require somebody to join like the Peace Corps for a year maybe like um during college you know maybe have some kind of course where theyd be required to do some kind of community service type work and help people in that area or people in the United States   i wonder now in and ive been out of school too long to answer this but i wonder if there arent some sociology courses   there probably are you know for but im sure thats probably like people that do that are social are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff but i think that it wouldnt really be half bad for everybody not to do something you know and realize that its everybodys responsibility to um help these people you know and not im not saying just give them money but i mean because they have to be taught to be yeah  i mean i know thats what my fatherinlaw was talking about you know when you give these people   thats the last thing you want to do   money or what was it they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give um more money to these people i mean and thats not really the answer i mean because if theyre alcoholics theyll just go out and spend it on you know booze or something like that but   yeah thats exactly it theyre not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it now come on lets be realistic thats just not realistic   yeah or you know to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves i mean   right   i guess were getting kind of off the subject here but yeah i mean its   no were not i dont think i think thats more realistic than going making them go in the Peace Corps   true yeah   i think thats a lot more realistic uh i i think that we should be spending more time and and again i dont think the the Peace Corps is is as successful now simply because its not it doesnt fit the circumstance anymore   yeah   uh weve got plenty in fact weve got far too many youre in uh what  Flower Mound   Flower Mound yeah so were a little farther you know farther removed from like Dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing   i was thats exactly what i was going to ask you have you ever have have you been downtown recently
