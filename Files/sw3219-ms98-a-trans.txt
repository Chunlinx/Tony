        okay why dont you start so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon     im already on my job so youre you reached me at my job   oh you are oh wonderful well how do you dress for work   my my dress for work uh most of the time is uh rather comfortable and casual   umhum   uh usually uh slacks and a soft colored shirt the um thing that that distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is i wear a clerical collar   uhhuh   and a suit and uh all of that sort of thing but when i dont need to dress up for a a meeting or a service of some sort i dont   umhum so you in a church there   yes   uhhuh well im working this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool and theyve told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds and they have a lot of uh they they have Bible lessons and they have all the things during the morning but they still have snack time and play time so  im gonna be dressing just in casual slacks and Tshirts probably not blue jeans but little bit short of that just just tennis shoes and play clothes   well around there you can probably wear uh Tshirts and other things but around here at this time of the year we are into sweaters and uh coats   yeah im envious  well its a beautiful day here and its in the sixties but we still have a lot of hot afternoons its supposed to be eighty five today so youll still see people its a its kind of an in between change theyre theyre in their play clothes i mean theyre in their summer clothes during the afternoons because you just cant stand the sweaters but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly   today today we we wear coats and as the day uh warms up we may go to light jackets but i dont think theres an escape from light jackets     do you i understand   the wind will take away a lot of body heat   well so are the people around you um uh dressing similar to you   very similar   umhum so you dont have a you dont have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do   no im not stuck with that kind of a uh situation   well thats good thats good   as i say unless it happens to be now yesterday i had to dress up and and um be more formal because i had a a formal meeting at noon time   umhum   but then i can go home later in the day and and be a little more casual   well thats wonderful   and then if i have a a a meeting of people that i know i can be very casual in the evening   well my husband has to take the bus into Dallas and doesnt return all day so he has to dress and hes just really hates that they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit and even when his job is not gonna be with people all day long he said its just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress   yeah thats around here in a lot of places thats the way it is i mean there there are expected expected uh dress codes   umhum umhum   and the people need to follow that i think uh years ago i used to be far more uh committed to the idea of of a dress code but ive   umhum   relaxed a lot more as ive gotten older and become more comfortable with myself   well i think thats i think thats great i think thats good   its taken a long time to break away from from that  but now that ive broken away from it im im glad i have   i understand well another interesting thing on the our our end here is how even even in my forties how much younger i dress than my mother would have in her forties and i will uh run around to the store and things in slacks and tennis shoes  and she   you mean you dont need to wear little old house dresses anymore   right and pearls and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school so uh she tells me i dress young but thats okay keeps me young     thats a good idea thats a good idea   well theres not a lot more i can think of to discuss on clothing   no theyre you know  what   so i i guess this is what you call a natural end   yeah what kind what kind of shoes do they wear down there   well we wear uh course um like i said if  if my husbands going downtown hes got the whole uh you know the dress mens dress shoes   umhum   but for as out here just anything that the moms we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and and uh tights and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids   we we can wear pretty much that although um tennis shoes are kind of out in in almost every every situation   yeah im sure they are there yeah im sure they are   unless you wanna look like a gook   thats right im sure thats true its a lot different than working in a kids preschool thats right well you all have a nice day there   a lot different you too and thank you for calling umhum bye   thank you very much byebye
