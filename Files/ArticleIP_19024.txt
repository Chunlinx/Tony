                                            I am a bit confusedby your answer to                 who was seeking advice about a gentlemanpreceding a lady into a public place When exiting a building it is very easyfor a gent to both precede the lady and hold the door for her because outsidedoors swing out However when entering a building the outward swinging doormakes both holding and preceding an awkward maneuverat least in myexperience Is there a technique to gracefully precede a lady and hold the doorfor her that I am unaware of Thanks                                       Awkward in St Paul Minn                        Dear Awk            Prudie is having troublefollowing the movement of all these doors Prudie is not even sure there is auniversal protocol for the way doors swing To be perfectly candid Prudie doesnot really care finding this bit of politesse rather inconsequential Just dowhat feels comfortable            Prudie permissively                                             DearPrudence                                          As a counselor I take issue with your responseto                 I find your evaluation that she is wonderfully cleareyed abouther situation way off base While shifting to a position of no sex may well bea good starting point and help restore some needed selfesteem if shecontinues to think that the problem is with the men she is attracted to thenshe will never get to the root of things                                       Sooner or later shesgoing to have to investigate the whys within herself for her attraction tothem What will eventually arise is a confrontation of her own availability forintimacy which she never has to examine as long as these men areunavailable They are not the problem just symptoms                                       Sincerely                                        J David ForbesMD                                       Standardsville Va                        Dear Dr J            Prudie thanks you

Although weve lived in a new apartment forover four months now my parentsinlaw have failed to visit even for a quicklooksee despite a welcome mat that is always unfurled for them Severalweeks ago we were informed that they were going to eat dinner at a restaurantACROSS THE STREET from our apartment When we invited them to come over for aquick postdinner visit they begged off                                       Quite often myparentsinlaw invite us to their abode and expect us to make the trip Inlight of their unwillingness to extend themselves is it appropriate to juststop going                                       Thanks                                       HRUMPH                        Dear HRUM            There is some little missing piece here Yourrelationship is apparently good enough for the beloveds parents to invite youboth to their house but they are unwilling to come to yoursand a new placetheyve never seen yet            Prudie is wrinkling herforehead wondering whats the deal You or your spouse their offspring mightflat out ask what is their aversion to being visitors You might even add thatyou are developing hurt feelings about this If the answer is evasive or anonstarter  such as Well were just happier having you come over herePrudie hopes you will respond with the following We have decided that weregoing to alternate visits Seems like its your turn to pay us a call If theystill wont cross your threshold you have a problem that likely will bethe forerunner to estrangement Prudie thinks youll survive            Prudie wonderingly                                             DearPrudie                                                      Love your column andthe advice never tried the white wine remedy for hmmm  perhaps an instanceof throwing good after bad But the one antidote I will swear by is clubsoda Twice in the last  months friends have spilled a glass of red wine onmy light tan carpet and both times I accessed an unopened bottle of club sodaany brand will do and several towels Voil Wine gone no stainGuaranteed to work If I could bottle it myself and sell it Id be amillionaire but since its already on the market the advice is free                                       Lorri A                        Dear Lor            But of course  Whydidnt Prudie think of that Club soda is the wonder cure for stains butperhaps most effectively at the time of the calamity Our last friend with thePersian rug was alas trying for a remedy days after the spill If you dodecide to bottle club soda as Lorris Super Stain Remover Prudie will notbreathe
