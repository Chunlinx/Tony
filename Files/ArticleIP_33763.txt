that JohnGielgud and the Smithsonian are fighting with one another since they are inmany ways so alike Both are old both are revered and as a result peopletend to focus on the highbrow exploits of both while discreetly ignoring thelowbrow The Smithsonian may be exalted as the repository of American cultureand get high marks for whenever it hosts say a monthlong exhibit on thehardships of the pilgrims But lets face it a disproportionate number ofvisitors just want to see Archie Bunkers chair Similarly when Sir JohnGielguds obituary is written the Shakespearean plays and films will
