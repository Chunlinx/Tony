and focus on thegameending goal by American defender Brandi Chastaina shootout womano awomano with one winner one loser everybody holding their breath            Difference feminists draw the opposite lessons They reject the rampantindividualism of loutish male basketball and baseball players as the NewYork Times  George Vecsey puts it and they celebrate the US womenssquad as a collectivist countermodel US Takes One for the TeamCollectiveSelflessness Culminates in Title at Womens World Cup beams the WashingtonPost s frontpage headline Newsweek  picking up the selflessnesstheme praises US players who accepted diminished roles and offered to doanything Im asked for this team Contrary to the Gatorade ad the magazinereports with admiration that Hamm sees herself as a solid cog in a remarkablypowerful machine and refuses to acknowledge that shes a player with uniquegifts            Somedifference feminists suggest women are born this way Vecsey for examplecalls them innately good teammates Others attribute their selflessness toenvironmental programming According to Newsweek s account of the USteams preparation Roommates were switched at every stop on the World Cuproad to prevent cliques from forming As the tourney progressed the imagingtapes designed to be watched in private were shown in groups The resultingcollective consciousness is captured in Nike ads that depict the players doingeverything together In one ad a player goes out on a date and her teammatestag along In another a male dentist who has given one of the players twofillings stares in amazement as one teammate after another rises zombieliketo declare Then I will have two fillings            Equality feminists find this celebration of selflessness creepy but its notjust being foisted on women by male writers World Cup Chairwoman Donna deVarona lauds the American players humility Time columnist MargaretCarlson praises their unassuming ways One player Kristine Lilly says theteam is like a

exploitation of their physiquesis selfobjectifying and retro            Prosex difference feminists find their heroine under attack less from the leftthan from a scandalized news media elite Sunday

Purists prefer to praiseMichelle Akers the less flashy midfield workhorse who has pronounced herselfa bit uncomfortable with Brandis deal            Chastains defenders offer several counterspins First theres the prochoicedefense which says every womans choice should be respected whether itsrunning marathons or posing for Gear  Then theres the sexy to bestrong defense which praises the US women for adding muscle tone to ouridea of feminine beauty Then theres the have it all defense As USAToday s Jill Lieber puts it the teams message is that you canhave it all  That if youre also driven determined aggressive tough andcommitted you can captivate Tom Brokaw David Letterman and the nation withyour brawn and your brain your femininity and sexuality your athletic skillsand your babeness             Someequality feminists also take Chastains side Their superficial spin is thatmale players whip off their shirts all the time and women should be able to dothe same Their subtler spin wellexpressed by Gerhart is that Chastain hasbrought instant attention to a piece of clothing that is humble andpracticalnot a traditional bra of shine and lace and cleavage but a sturdycompression garment The sports bra is the cloth symbol of Title IXs successThe crudest egalitarian spin is that Chastain is using her sex appeal to getattention but that this is OK because shes using the attention to make moneyjust as men do As a Newsweek essayist puts it the team is having somefunnot to mention making some profitwith Americas sexual obsession                           Career and

Vecsey puts it women eschew the cynical foulsand flagrant flops of the men Equality feminists draw a different lesson TheWorld Cup showed that women can bodyslam curse and cheat just like men

narrow the shooters anglebefore the kick Far from chastising Scurry male sportswriters arecongratulating her on her savvy Yes she said later she knew she wasbreaking the rules concludes Bill Plaschke of the Los Angeles Times But because the referees didnt call it it apparently falls under the headingof gamesmanship Everybody does it she said Its only cheating if you getcaught Sports equality
