                    Background        Many eukaryotic genes are interrupted by stretches of        noncoding DNA called introns or intervening sequences        Transcription of these genes is followed by RNAsplicing        that results in intron removal for review see            The majority of eukaryotic spliceosomal introns interrupt        premRNA in the nucleus and are removed by a        ribonucleoprotein complex termed the spliceosome Two        theories have been proposed to explain the present        spliceosomal intron distribution ie their presence in        eukaryotes and their absence in Bacteria and Archaea The        first intronsearly posits that introns were present in        most if not all proteincoding genes in the last        universal common ancestor LUCA and have subsequently been        lost in the archaeal and bacterial domains due to strong        selection for compact genomes Eukaryotes have maintained        their introns because they confer the capacity to create        evolutionary novelty through exon shuffling     The        intronsearly theory predicts that at least some of the        extant eukaryotic introns are direct descendants of the        primordial sequences in the LUCA        The        alternate view intronslate suggests that the last        common ancestor was intronfree and that spliceosomal        introns have originated in eukaryotes from recent invasions        by autocatalytic RNAs eg group II introns or        transposable elements        The intronslate view        is compatible with the nowestablished role of exon        shuffling in creating eukaryotic genes     It is the        ancient origin of introns that is primarily called into        question        In this study we analyzed the putative spliceosomal        introns in Euascomycetes Ascomycota small subunit SSU        and large subunit LSU ribosomal rRNA genes     to        understand how spliceosomal introns of a recent origin        ie intronslate spread to novel genic sites        Statistical methods were used to study the exon sequences        flanking  different spliceosomal intron insertion sites        in Euascomycetes rRNA and show that the introns interrupt        the G  intron  G hereafter the intron position is shown        with  protosplice site that preexisted in the coding        region A protosplice site is a short sequence motif that        has a high affinity for splicing factors and is a preferred        site of intron insertion The protosplice site eg MAG         R in premRNA genes     need not be perfectly        conserved in organisms but is rather a set of nucleotides        that with some statistical uncertainty shows a nonrandom        sequence pattern at sites flanking introns It is also        conceivable that protosplice sites may differ between        lineages reflecting for example differences in how the        spliceosome recognizes introns eg exon definition        hypothesis             Our analysis using information theory    shows that        the significant information is found in exons flanking rRNA        spliceosomal introns We also confirm that introns are not        randomly distributed in the primary and secondary structure        of the SSU and LSU rRNA and that the group I introns are        generally found in the highly conserved ie functionally        important regions of these genes whereas the spliceosomal        introns tend to occur in regions of the rRNA that are not        as well conserved or are not directly involved in protein        synthesis                    Results                  Analysis of Euascomycetes rRNA Spliceosomal          Introns          With our data set of  two diatomspecific introns          were excluded from this analysis different spliceosomal          intron sites in the SSU and LSU rRNAs of Euascomycetes          alignment available at          httpwwwrnaicmbutexaseduANALYSISFUNGINTfor

chisquare          analysis the null hypothesis specified that nucleotide          usage in  nt of exon sequence upstream and downstream          of the different intron insertion sites was random and          dependent on the nucleotide composition of Euascomycetes          SSU and LSU rRNA sequences in general Previously we          found evidence for the protosplice site AG  G in          Euascomycetes rRNA with the greatest support for the G          nucleotides p       The addition of           new Euascomycetes SSU and LSU rRNA insertion sites in the          new analysis supports this finding see Fig  but shows          strongest evidence for the protosplice site to encode G           G p   three degrees of freedom with the Gs          occurring at frequencies of  and  in the          Euascomycetes rRNAs          To address the possibility that we were counting as          independent events cases where introns may have had a          single origin but then spread into neighboring sites          through intron sliding eg     we reran the          chisquare analysis after removal of all introns that          were within  nt of each other This substantially          reduced our data set to  introns at the following          sites SSU                         LSU                                    but addressed independence of intron          insertion events This data set showed significant          support for the AG  G protosplice site with the A G          and G occurring at frequencies of  chisquare            p    chisquare   p            and  chisquare   p            respectively The AG  G and G  G protosplice sites          occurred in  and  of these sequences respectively          The increase in signal of the AG  G protosplice site          with removal of neighboring potentially slid introns is          consistent with the idea that intron sliding may over          time obscure the targets originally used for insertion          It should be noted however that this procedure was done          by retaining the most  intron in each set of          neighboring insertions and this may not represent the          original intron Determining the role of intron sliding          in creating new lineages of insertions will require a          fully resolved Euascomycetes phylogeny not yet          available that can be used to map intron gains losses          and potential slides The present data for the             spliceosomal introns for example when mapped on the          Euascomycetes tree published in Bhattacharya et al             shows these introns to be distributed in at least           divergent clades within the Lecanoromycetes These          introns may be related through the sliding of an          ancestral intron but without the presence of one of these          insertions in a nonEuascomycetes fungus or a robust          phylogeny of this lineage it will not be possible to          unambiguously identify the original site of          insertion          Next we used the Sequence Logo method developed by          Stephens and Schneider    and the expression of Hertz          and Stormo    to determine the information content in          the Euascomycetes rRNA introns and exon flanking          sequence The logo of a subset of  of the original           spliceosomal introns for which we had complete  nt of          upstream and  nt of downstream exon sequence is shown          in Fig  This analysis shows that many of the          informative sites encode purines in particular Gs and          that the region contains a total of  bits In          general the information content is highest at the site          of intron insertion and the regions within a close          proximity about  nt and decreases as one moves away          from this site with the exception of a significant UG          peak at  and Crichness around  Fig  In          comparison the mean value  iterations for the          total bits of information in a  nt random sequence          data set was  bits The  quantile for this          distribution was  bits indicating that the          Euascomycetes rRNA exons encode significant information          p   Logo analysis of the reduced set of           nonneighboring spliceosomal introns was consistent with          this analysis but showed a stronger signal at the          protosplice site A   bits G   bits G            bits The finding of significant information in the          flanking exons suggests that some regulatory regions          ie exonic splicing enhancers ESEs     may          exist in these sequences                          Sliding Window Analysis of Euascomycetes          Spliceosomal Intron Insertion Sites          Intrigued by the finding of Grichness in the upstream          exon region flanking introns see  to  in Fig           we determined the association of Grich regions in           fungal SSU rRNAs and  fungal LSU rRNAs with all          reported spliceosomal introns in these genes The          Gfrequencies were calculated at each rRNA site and are          plotted as the green circles in Fig  The SSU  nt          GenBank U and LSU  nt U rRNAs from          S cerevisiae were used as the reference sequence for          these alignments The raw Gfrequencies were smoothed          blue curve in Fig  using the loess local regression          method     and smoothing windows of size  nt or           nt prior to analyzing the intronGfrequency          association The positions of rRNA spliceosomal intron          positions are shown as red lines in Fig  From this          analysis we can observe that regions of intron insertion          strongly associate with high Gfrequencies in both the          SSU and LSU rRNA The association is stronger in the           nt ie  nt exon sequence  intron insertion site            nt exon sequence window of weighted averages          suggesting that this window size includes most of the          exon signal However the association is still apparent          in the  nt window in particular for the SSU rRNA          Our analyses show that the average Gfrequency at the           intron sites using the fitted curve in the SSU rRNA is           whereas the average Gfrequency at the  intron          sites using the fitted curve in the LSU rRNA is  To          test the significance of this result with the  intron          sites and the Gcontents in the LSU rRNA we randomly          selected  sites from the  nt of rRNA and computed          the average of their Gfrequencies We repeated this          process  times and plotted the distribution of          these average Gfrequencies results not shown The          observed average Gfrequency at the LSU intron sites was          significantly greater than that in the simulated data p            Similarly we carried out the simulationbased          test for the SSU rRNA intron sites In these           replications no average from the randomly generated          sites was greater than  Thus the pvalue is less          than  reinforcing the remarkable association of          SSU rRNA introns and Grich regions apparent in Fig           Taken together our results suggest that Euascomycetes          rRNA spliceosomal introns are fixed at the G  G or AG           G protosplice site that is found in Grich regions                          Intron Positions on rRNA Conservation          Diagrams          To understand the association of introns with highly          conserved regions in the rRNAs we mapped the intron          positions on SSU and LSU rRNA conservation diagrams of          the three phylogenetic domains of life and the two          eukaryotic organelles DomO and the nuclearencoded          rRNA genes in the three phylogenetic domains Dom This          analysis shows a significant association of group I          intron sites with rRNA sites that are  conserved          within both DomO and Dom LSU rRNA analyses see Table           Only in the Dom analysis for SSU rRNA was the          association weakly nonsignificant p   The          observed association of highly conserved rRNA and group I          intron sites is therefore unlikely to have occurred by          chance alone For rRNA spliceosomal introns however the          association of conserved rRNA and introns sites is less          clear Within the DomO analysis of SSU rRNA          spliceosomal intron positions vary significantly from the          null model but in the direction of fewer than expected          introns at the most highly conserved sites whereas          within the Dom analysis of LSU rRNA no significant          difference is found p   The DomO LSU rRNA and          Dom SSU rRNA analyses both show an enrichment of          spliceosomal introns at the highly conserved genic sites          primarily in sites conserved between  Taken          together our analyses suggest that group I introns are          fixed primarily in the most highly conserved rRNA sites          when analyzed in the DomO or Dom data sets whereas          spliceosomal introns are not strongly associated with          highly conserved rRNA sites          To address more directly the relationship between          Euascomycetes spliceosomal introns and rRNA conservation          patterns we positioned these introns on a conservation          diagram generated from  fungal SSU rRNA sequences          see Fig  This analysis showed that  of  fungal          SSU rRNA spliceosomal introns follow sites that are          conserved in more than  of the fungal sequences           nt in this class one intron follows a site that is           conserved  nt in this class two introns          follow sites that  conserved  nt in this          class and two introns follow sites that           conserved  nt in this class More importantly          inspection of the  nt alignment of SSU rRNAs and           nt of LSU rRNAs of all fungi of fungi containing          spliceosomal introns and of fungi lacking spliceosomal          introns shows that most of the introns are inserted          between nucleotides that are  conserved whether          they encode G  G or not in taxa containing introns and          sister groups lacking introns Table  This result          provides strong support for the hypothesis that          Euascomycetes spliceosomal introns are fixed in a          protosplice site that predates intron insertion Beyond          this pattern of conservation the Grich regions in the          neighborhood of introns are also often highly conserved          among all fungi see Fig  Most of these Gs are in          sites that are  conserved in all fungal SSU rRNAs          suggesting that their existence also predates intron          insertion          However several exceptions to this general pattern          merit closer inspection The upstream nucleotide at the          SSU rRNA  site  in the           S cerevisiae gene for example          occurs at a frequency of  U in taxa lacking introns          but at a frequency of  U in taxa containing introns          On the surface this suggests that the site may have          undergone selective pressure postintron insertion          towards a high frequency of Us Analysis of the SSU rRNA          alignment shows however that the  taxa containing the           intron share a U at this site with virtually all          other introncontaining fungi that lack this particular          insertion This suggests that the high U frequency in the          introncontaining fungi is a synapomorphy for the          monophyletic introncontaining Euascomycetes and is not          an outcome of the  intron insertion A similar result          is found when the protosplice site is checked in all          taxa containing introns with those lacking any particular          intron                          Intron Positions on the rRNA Primary          Structure          The positions of spliceosomal group I group II and          archaeal introns were included on a line representing the          primary structures of E coli SSU and LSU rRNA Fig A          The intron distributions were then studied to determine          if they differ significantly from the null hypothesis of          a brokenstick distribution      This resource          division model which has been used extensively to test          hypotheses about patterns of species abundance eg              specifies a distribution that arises when a          stick of unit length is divided into n number of events          with these events scattered with a uniform probability          distribution The events break the stick into n            intervals which can then be studied to determine if they          depart from uniformity in the probability density along          the stick Departure will tend to make the longest          intervals longer and the shortest intervals shorter              In our analyses the rRNA genes were the sticks and          the intron insertion sites were the events The metric          used to compare the null ie brokenstick and          observed distribution was the standard deviation SD          from the mean interval length ie lower SDs mean the          more uniform are the lengths of the intervals eg              Computer simulations were used to determine the          level of significance at which the observed distributions          could be distinguished from those produced by the          brokenstick model          A cursory analysis of the data suggests that the          intron distribution in both SSU and LSU rRNAs is          significantly clustered in particular the LSU rRNA and          the statistical analysis bears this out The observed          standard deviations for all the analyses ie all the          introns together or the spliceosomal and group I introns          individually are significantly different from the          expectations of the broken stick model The departure          from the null model is particularly striking for the LSU          rRNA suggesting that the introns in this gene are more          strongly clustered than in the SSU rRNA see Fig          AB                            Discussion                  The protosplice site bounding rRNA introns          Our analysis of  nt of exon sequence flanking          spliceosomal introns in Euascomycetes rRNA shows          significant support for a G  G or AG  G protosplice          site Fig  The protosplice site predates intron          insertion because it is highly conserved in the          Euascomycetes rRNAs in both introncontaining and          intronless taxa see Fig  Table  This finding is          not anomalous because analysis of exon sequences          surrounding the total set of introns in           S cerevisiae premRNA genes shows          a preference for AAAG at the  splice site     The          final G in this motif has been established as          significantly conserved in yeast     The sequence at          the proximal  exon region is required for interactions          with the spliceosomal small nuclear ribonucleoprotein          particle U     Our data are therefore consistent          with present understanding of yeast premRNA splicing          Furthermore taking at least  as the minimum for a          consensus nucleotide in the protosplice site Long et          al    have shown that this region in six model          eukaryotes often encode the AG  G or G  G motif In          humans for example the nucleotides in the AG  G motif          are found in abundances of   and           respectively The finding of a similar motif in rRNA          genes for which there is neither a requirement to          incorporate amino acid phase distribution nor to invoke          exonshuffling provides support for the idea that a          protosplice site for intron insertion not only exists in          Euascomycetes rRNA but also may exist in premRNA genes          The introns appear to be inserted into some of the most          conserved regions of Euascomycetes SSU rRNA as evident          in the fungal conservation diagram Fig  and the          analysis of fungal nucleotide frequencies at the  and           nt flanking introns Table  However the          spliceosomal introns do not map to the most conserved          positions in the Dom or DomO rRNA datasets Table                    Furthermore exon sequences outside of the          protosplice site may be required for splice site          recognition by the spliceosome         Our          rRNA analyses suggest that Grich regions in the          neighborhood often upstream of the intron insertion          sites may be potential ESEs The exon context may          therefore play a fundamental role in controlling intron          splicing and thus sites of intron fixation This idea          has growing support in the literature eg                Combined with this observation is the finding that          rRNA spliceosomal introns map primarily to regions in the          interface surface of the SSU and LSU ribosome              These sites presumably facilitate intron splicing during          ribosome biogenesis          We find that in contrast to the spliceosomal introns          in rRNA group I intron insertion sites show a stronger          positive association with highly conserved rRNA regions          Fig  Table  including those that bind tRNA              and are more clustered than are spliceosomal introns in          the rRNA primary structure Fig  This suggests that          group I intron fixation may be even more highly          constrained by the exon context than are spliceosomal          introns A possible explanation for this observation is          that group I introns are more dependent on specific          upstream and downstream exon sequences to build the P          and P domains    to facilitate proper folding prior          to excision eg     This could limit the number          of rRNA sites at which group I introns can be fixed in          comparison to spliceosomal introns which have less          specific exon sequence requirements for splicing                            Conclusions        Our findings provide concrete insights into rRNA intron        fixation and are more compatible with the view that both        the spliceosomal and group I intron distributions reflect        fundamental features of presentday genes and genomes and        that introns may not be relics of an ancient intronrich        period of cells An intriguing view on intron origin was        recently published using the tools of population genetics        In this view the richness of introns in multicellular        organisms may primarily reflect the smaller population        sizes of these taxa relative to protists which generally        contain few introns The large population sizes of        unicellular eukaryotes may prevent widespread intron spread        due to secondary mutations that lead to their loss from        populations     Interestingly the lichenized        Euascomycetes which are particularly rich in both        spliceosomal and group I introns in their nuclear rRNA are        typically extremely slowgrowing taxa many of which have        small population sizes eg                        Methods                  PCR Methods and the Intron Data          The spliceosomal introns described in Bhattacharya et          al     plus  new positions that have become          available in GenBank were used in this study as well as           new sites that we

lacustris  AF We          did not study the  and  spliceosomal introns in          the SSU rRNA gene of the distantly related stramenopile            Cymatosira belgica X This          diatom is the sole known organism outside of the fungi to          contain rDNA spliceosomal introns In addition the          fungal    SSU rRNA and   and           LSU rRNA introns were not included in the information          analysis because of missing data or ambiguous sequences          see below The SSU  site            Physconia detersa  AJ for          example only included  nt of the  and  region in          the GenBank accession     All fungal and diatom          intron sites were however mapped on the conservation          diagrams to understand their distribution see          below          We have made on the basis of detailed analysis of          rRNA flanking regions a number of corrections in the          positions of the introns within the SSU rRNA eg           is now at  and  is now at  Copies of the          manuscript figures and tables and additional materials          related to this work are available from the Gutell          Laboratorys CRW Site at

that are updated daily fungal          nucleotide frequency values and the SSU and LSU rRNA          sequence alignments used in Table                           Information Analysis of the rRNA Introns          An information analysis was done of the  nt upstream          and downstream of the different rRNA spliceosomal intron          sites to determine the total amount of exonic information          in bits that is available to the spliceosome for          splicing We used the webbased logo program of Gorodkin          et al             httpwwwcbsdtudkgorodkinapplslogohtmlto derive          the sequence logos and the information content of          individual sites was calculated according to the          expression of Hertz and Stormo     Type  logos were          drawn in which the height of the nucleotides in the          sequence column represented their frequency in proportion          to their expected frequency The expected nucleotide          probabilities were estimated from the observed nucleotide          frequencies over all sites for  Euascomycetes rRNA          sequences A   C   G   T                The nucleotides were turned upsidedown when the observed          frequency was less than expected     A total of           spliceosomal intron sites for which  nt of both          upstream and downstream exon sequence are available were          included in this analysis          To put the information content in perspective we also          did simulations in which  random sequence data sets of          length  nt for flanking exons and  total number          of introns analyzed random data sets of length  nt          for conserved intron regions were generated at the          nucleotide frequencies of Euascomycetes rRNA and the          information content of these was calculated A total of           iterations were done with each data set to create          null distributions of random information content The          observed information values were then compared to the          null distributions to infer their probabilities                          Analysis of GContent in Euascomycetes SSU          rRNAs          Because it is difficult to see the pattern of          Gcontent along the sequence based on the raw data we          fit a smooth curve to the frequencies of G using the          method of local regression loess     This smooth          curve captures the Gcontent pattern along the nucleotide          sites Loess is a nonparametric curve fitting technique          that fits the data in a local fashion That is for the          fit at site x the fit is made using the Gfrequencies at          the points in a neighbourhood of x weighted by their          distance from x A tricubic weighting function          proportional to   distancemax distance is          used for calculating the weights For both the LSUrRNA          and SSUrRNA sequence alignment data sets we used a          neighborhood of  nt and  nt in fitting the loess          curve Thus the value of the curve at each site is          computed as a weighted average of the Gfrequency at the          site itself the Gfrequencies at the  upstream sites          and the Gfrequencies at the  downstream sites                          Positions of Introns Relative to Conserved rRNA          Regions          To assess the patterns of sequence conservation in          exon sequences flanking all rRNA spliceosomal and group I          introns we mapped intron positions on structure          conservation diagrams Group I introns in different          subclasses eg IC IE      which occupied the          same rRNA site were counted as separate intron          insertions This accounted for our observation that          certain rRNA sites eg SSU   LSU            see CRW Site for details are hot spots for insertion          with multiple evolutionarily divergent introns being          fixed at the same site in different species or in          different genomes ie nuclear vs organellar The          actual number of independent hits at rRNA sites is          however likely to be much greater than our estimate but          this can only be proven with rigorous phylogenetic          analysis of group I introns at different insertion sites          to show that in some cases introns in the same subclass          at the same site in different species have a high          probability of independent origin eg      The          first set of conservation diagrams used in our analysis          was based on the comparison of  and  different SSU          and LSU rRNA sequences respectively from the three          phylogenetic domains and the two organelles DomO that          were superimposed on the secondary structures of the           Escherichia coli rRNAs The second          set of diagrams was a summary of  and  different          SSU and LSU rRNA sequences respectively from the three          phylogenetic domains Dom also mapped on the           E coli rRNAs These diagrams are          available at the CRW Site Multiway contingency table          analysis was done to determine whether sites that were             and  conserved in the          diagrams were independent of intron insertion sites the          null hypothesis Intron sites were taken as the          nucleotide immediately preceding the intron insertion We          also calculated nucleotide frequencies for each SSU and          LSU rRNA site using the           S cerevisiae genes for numbering          Frequencies were calculated for alignments of all          available fungal rRNAs  SSU and  LSU sequences          and of only fungi containing spliceosomal introns  SSU          and  LSU sequences or of fungi lacking spliceosomal          introns  sequences for SSU  for LSU These          frequencies were used to determine the level of          conservation of nucleotides encoding the protosplice          site in introncontaining and intronless fungal          species                          rRNA Intron Distribution          The positions of all known spliceosomal group I          group II and tRNAlike archaeal    introns were          marked on the primary structures of           E coli SSU and LSU rRNA These          data which also accounted for multiple group I intron          hits at the same rRNA site were then studied to          determine whether they differ significantly from the null          expectation of a random distribution ie the broken          stick distribution We used the program PowerNiche V          P Drozd V Novotny unpublished data to generate          sticks of length  nt SSU rRNA or  nt LSU rRNA          which were randomly broken by           n   events for all introns          including group II and archaeal or           n   for only group I or           n   for only spliceosomal          introns in SSU rRNA For the LSU rRNA the stick was          broken into           n   events for all introns or           n   for only group I or           n   for only spliceosomal          introns The paucity of rRNA group II introns  and           introns in the SSU and LSU rRNA respectively and          archaeal introns  and  introns in the SSU and LSU          rRNA respectively did not allow their individual          analysis A mean number of intervals and a SD were          calculated for each brokenstick The SDs of           simulations were compared to the SD of the observed data          to test whether the observed pattern was likely to have          been produced under the assumptions of the brokenstick          model                            Authors Contributions        DS generated the new intron sequences JH did the        statistical
