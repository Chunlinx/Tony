                    Introduction        For many years scientists believed that point mutations        in genes are the genetic switches for somatic and inherited        diseases such as cystic fibrosis phenylketonuria and        cancer For this to be the case diseaseassociated amino        acid substitutions should occur in functionally important        regions of the protein products of genes While it has been        shown in specific cases that diseaseassociated amino acid        substitutions affect protein function until now few        studies have examined this across many genes Here we        provide direct evidence that diseaseassociated point        mutations occur in functionally important regions of the        genome and are not distributed equally across the coding        regions of genes This work supports recent efforts to        collect disease associated mutational data in databases and        suggests that many of the mutations represented in those        databases are the likely underlying molecular cause of        disease        Recently there have been a number of commercial and        public projects aimed at collecting and understanding human        genomic variation     The goal of these projects is to        provide an understanding of how genotype is associated with        disease how it affects our response to drugs and how it        affects the protein products of genes Examples of these        projects include the SNP Consortium the Human Genome        Mutation Database     many gene specific databases              for example and both public and private genome        sequencing efforts     Much of the data that is being        collected are mutations annotated with their observed        phenotype Automated annotation methods based on structural        and evolutionary parameters can lead to insight into the        molecular basis of disease        With more than  identified variations and with        over  of them annotated with a phenotype we are        facing the problem of having many uncharacterized        mutations Algorithms are needed for automatically        annotating these gene variations to gain insight into how        they affect the genes regulation andor function of its        protein products Using many collection technologies        uncharacterized SNP data is being placed in public        databases such as the Human Genome Mutation Database over         entries    and the National Cancer Institutes        CGAPGAI Cancer Genome Anatomy Project Genetic Annotation        Initiative     The CGAPGAI group has identified         SNPs by examining publicly available EST Expressed        Sequence Tag chromatograms        Software for analyzing unannotated SNPs in known disease        associated genes will be especially useful when previously        unobserved mutations are discovered Every human has        genotypic differences from the standard genome        approximately every thousand base pairs       Given        knowledge of how a genotype differs from the standard it        is important to be able to predict which of the variations        are likely to be the cause of disease or other phenotypic        differences Evolutionary information about regulatory and        coding regions of genes can be used to highlight certain        mutations or groups of mutations that are attributable to a        phenotype              Early tools using phylogenetic and structural        information have shown promise in predicting the functional        consequences of a mutation     These reports predict        that anywhere between  of nonsynonymous SNPs alter        the function of a genes protein product In the report by        Chasman and Adams evolutionary information was predicted        to be a useful component in determining whether a mutation        is deleterious      Disease causing mutations are        also likely structurally perturbing at the protein level            Ng and Henikoff have introduced SIFT a method for        predicting functional SNPs from a database of unannotated        polymorphisms             The relationship between diseaseassociated mutation        positions and evolutionary conservation has been reported        in specific cases An analysis of the breast and ovarian        cancer susceptibility gene BRCA showed that        diseaseassociated mutations tend to occur in highly        conserved regions     An analysis of homologous        sequences in the androgen receptor has shown similar        results     Keratin  KRT is associated with        Meesmann Corneal Epithelial Dystrophy MCD Reported        mutations often occur in the highly conserved        alphahelixinitiation motif of rod domain A or in the        alphahelixtermination motif of rod domain B            Structure based analysis methods have also been used to        analyze Osteogenesis imperfecta associated COLA mutations        and diseaseassociated P mutations Mooney and Klein        unpublished     Miller and Kumar have reported that        diseaseassociated mutations are conserved in seven model        genes            To determine the degree to which mutation positions        differ evolutionarily from other positions we have built        alignments of homologous genes for  diseaseassociated        genes These multiple alignments have then been used to        assess the difference in evolutionary conservation for        positions that are both diseaseassociated and not        associated The results show that in general positions        with diseaseassociated mutations are conserved more than        the average position in the alignment This suggests the        most conserved mutations are likely to be the causative        agents of disease and our data set identifies these        mutations                    Results and Discussion        Our method compares the negative entropy of        diseaseassociated columns within an alignment to other        columns in that alignment The goal of this work is to        build these alignments map the mutations to them and show        that diseaseassociated positions are in general        conserved The analysis was performed on the built        alignments and the results are shown in Table         To collect the mutation data  genes were used for        the analysis They were chosen because they had a reported        cDNA sequence diseaseassociated mutations and homologs in        SWISSPROT These genes are listed in Table  Each        alignment consists of all the homologs in SWISSPROT as        determined by a BLAST search with an evalue threshold of        e For each alignment the negative entropy for each        column was calculated        The conservation ratio parameter is defined as the        average negative entropy of analyzable positions with        reported mutations divided by the average negative entropy        of every analyzable position in the gene sequence Analysis        was performed on  genes and  mutations and of those        we found that  had conservation ratios less than one        From those  genes had more than ten analyzable        mutations and of those  had conservation ratios less        than one        Use of evolutionary information is a promising approach        to automated characterization of mutations These results        show that although conservation alone is not a perfect        predictive measure there is useful information contained        in sequence alignments containing homologous genes        Approaches using conservation in a multiple alignment        should work better when associated with other methods such        as structural analysis population analysis and        experimental data Knowledge of how the sequence pool        clusters into families may increase the sensitivity of the        method        Our measured parameter the conservation ratio is a        quantity that measures the usefulness of a multiple        alignment for characterizing mutations in a gene sequence        Knowledge of more mutations in a gene does not necessarily        lower the conservation ratio We expect that knowledge of        more mutations in a gene will increase the statistical        significance of the conservation ratio This is the likely        underlying cause of the result showing that genes with         or mutations increases are more likely to have a        conservation ratio less than one        The alignments and BLAST searches are integrated on the        website httpcancerstanfordedumutpaper                    Conclusions        In conclusion there are estimated to be         nonsynonymous differences between an individual and the        draft genome         Determination of which        positions are likely to be disease associated is a        challenging and important problem The finding that        diseaseassociated mutations occur in positions of        functional importance supports recent efforts for the        building of methods to predict which positions are likely        to be disease associated        These methods        are likely to incorporate protein structure the amino acid        identity of the mutation and phylogenetic information In        an interesting twist this observation also suggests that        this data may be useable as a functional genomics tool for        understanding the function of the protein products of genes        on a molecular level Such a method would use the inherent        functional information contained in a phenotypically        annotated polymorphism to infer functional importance        within a gene                    Methods        Nonsynonymous mutations were acquired from the Human        Genome Mutation Database        httparchiveuwcmacukuwcmmghgmdhtml  genes        were chosen with known diseaseassociation each having        SWISSPROT homologs a cDNA sequence and mutations in the        coding region For each of those genes all known        nonsynonymous mutations were then downloaded with the cDNA        sequence for that gene        Each cDNA sequence was then translated and placed in a        FASTA formatted file For each of the resultant files a        BLAST    search was performed against the SwissProt        database All sequences from the returned hits were then        stored in FASTA format files For each of the genes that        returned BLAST results with evalue scores smaller than        e ClustalW    was used to build a sequence        alignment        For each amino acid in the position of interest the        negative entropy was determined using the following formula                           Where the P         i are the probabilities of finding a        particular amino acid at that position For this analysis        gapped positions  were considered independent amino        acids        For each known mutation the negative entropy of the        column it occupies was tabulated The average negative        entropy for each mutation within a gene was compared to the        average entropy of all columns satisfying the criteria for        analysis Mutations outside of the coding region or        mutations encoding termination codons were discarded        The list of genes was then sorted by average negative        entropy of the mutations We then calculated the        conservation entropy CE using        CE  average NE of mutation positionsaverage NE of all        positions in the gene sequence
