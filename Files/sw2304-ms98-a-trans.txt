got what some people call the best beef in the world   uhhuh yes uh   so its uh Bishu like every Sunday you go out and you buy all these parts of the cow and then you just cook them over a grill thats like in our house its already built in theres this whole special place in the back so that you can make a barbecue   ive had ive had that meal in New York uh where they bring you a plank sort of with all this wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued and its marvelous uh i have   yeah yeah and then   i have to find a place around here that has that   well they have one in uh they have an Argentinean place down in Georgetown   okay ill keep that in mind yeah you serve that yourself or the for a family   so um uh excuse me   you ever serve that yourself when you have company   oh no well see what happens is im only twenty two but like when like when im down at home and like somebody says okay when are when are we having this you know and ill and ill cook it   uhhuh yeah oh that   you know like you have to prepare the fire and then put the sausages on and then you know you put all these different meats which take different times   do you buy them um separately at you know an American grocery store now or do you have to or you dont you dont go buy it from a a wholesaler   no but uh what happens is in Argentina they have like all these little places like the fruit stand and you know the dairy and products and whatever and so   little butcher shops yeah yeah ive ive lived in Mexico so i know   and so they got they got the meat place and so you just go there and you cant find chicken there you got to go to another place to find the chicken   yeah yeah yeah you have to you have poultry place what do you what other what dishes do you serve with it   well basically its what we call empanadas which is which is like right right meat turnovers   yeah i the turnover the stuffed turnovers oh i love those uhhuh   and uh then we also put sausages on a bun and then thats thats to start out with and then what you have is also like you know like three different kinds of salad   yeah uhhuh   and uh thats about it   do you remember when you were in Washington Sam the Argentine baker   uh no   it used to be in Georgetown years ago he moved i guess he he retired and went back to Argentina i guess in nineteen the early seventies   oh okay   yes so that must thats before your time your parents might remember if they were here then   yeah no we we were only there for two years   okay i mean he was wonderful i we used to get the most marvelous empenadas and other Argentine things   so yeah and uh what what i also eat now since im in college  i have an Italian roommate and   yeah im Italian   are you and since being Argentinean we also have a lot of pasta   uhhuh yeah well because therere many Italians in Argentina   and you know like yeah and my mom you know like makes like what we call niokes and and all this stuff that its just you know everything like lasagna and everything   umhum uhhuh yeah my grandparents my grandfather came to the United States through Argentina this was around the turn of the century   oh okay yeah thats   actually actually a little bit later like nineteen uh nineteen thirteen nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen   at at one point one third of the population of Argentina was Italian like pure Italians     yeah well ill tell you its interesting because when we cook here im of Italian descent my husband is Chinese   okay   so we and we both love European Continental cooking French cooking so we cook uh our meals are well we dont do we dont usually mix i mean thats well sometimes well if were entertaining well do a Chinese recipe   okay right right   and um there are really easy recipe that is you know with Chinese you always have several dishes     yeah   and nowadays with microwaves you can steam many of the things in a microwave i dont know if you have one   yeah yeah   and if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it   okay okay   and chop some scallions and a little ginger   okay   and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done and its a wonderful   is it   um flavorful piece of fish yeah   because i was uh you know its like when when you go buy fish you know like well like i buy like the fish that you can do in the microwave you know the breaded fish and you know ive seen you know the filet   umhum umhum yeah buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish market uh the fish counter   what kind of fish   um uh any white fish sole is good um um flounder sole or flounder is real good   okay so we put soy sauce and sesame   and even grouper little bit of soy sauce and sesame sesame seed oil   okay   and not too much soy sauce uh some chopped up scallions um you know slivers of scallions   okay   and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes and if the fish flakes its done dont overcook it though   okay because i got i got um one of those little uh microwaves the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water   yeah well till you just check it you know during and another quick dish if you like um if do you know what hoi sin sauce is its that sweet Chinese sauce   yeah no i dont   well if you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin H O I S I N   wait wait wait H wait ah   H O I   H O I   S I N or S E N either way theyll spell it hoi sin sauce its a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown   S I N okay   and if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork   okay   and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper   okay   and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce   okay   that you can serve over rice   how how much uh how much uh how much pork do you buy for two people   um well for two people um American uh if its American style id buy a half a pound if you know we if youre just serving that but if youre serving another dish with it say the rice dish   right   um well with guys pretty healthy appetite id probably go a third of a pound and then you know you could   yeah i could i could probably go half a pound   and you can always you can always heat it up again and save you know   so but theres theres just since im from Argentina i just love meat and we just   yeah you can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables   okay okay   just stir that in and youve got a very colorful side another dish   and how much does it cost   um the hoi sin sauce oh a dollar twenty nine a can a can would serve would serve you for you know for quite a few um meals   yeah oh okay yeah okay i thought it maybe it was like you know like five fifty or something
