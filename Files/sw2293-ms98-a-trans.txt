                okay   well um discussing air pollution today i guess   umhum   um uh well  give me your first impressions   uh i dont know theres a lot of air pollution   yeah   um i think industries and companies provide a lot of it   umhum   and with uh i guess with the oil burning over in Kuwait and stuff that would have a lot of air pollution in it   uh puts a whole yeah gets a whole new picture to what  real air pollution can be but uh that stuff going on over there what what uh what part of Pennsylvania are you in   um im north of Pittsburgh so   okay okay okay so its its its amazing too you know you with that with the oil wells burning over there thats thats the exact same stuff thats coming out of cars every day just in uh just in a little different grade i guess   yeah   but uh in Dallas weve got weve just uh brought in a whole new set of uh requirements on inspections and things like that for cars because uh people just dont use mass transit and stuff in Dallas everybody loves their car and you see an awful lot of uh one person vehicles on the road on during rush hours that seems to be our biggest problem down here um you know theres uh theres a lot of industry around but uh its not its any pollution that industrys dumping around here is not going into the air its typically water  type situation   yeah um we have a couple we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff and i know theres a lot of air pollution going in there and like they they get fined whenever they do the air pollution but   umhum   the fine is nothing you know its like nothing to them   yeah its its yeah like like two hours of output or something like that yeah thats true thats true   yeah yeah umhum   yeah i uh i grew up in South Dakota so i was never  i was never exposed to anything of of the of the sort um   uhhuh   there were always the EPA people and what not were always telling us that uh farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that but we just we just never saw the results uh   umhum   there was there was dust in the air during uh planting seasons and what not but uh that that was all we ever saw and then five years ago i i moved to Dallas and i suddenly start to understand what uh burning eyes uh and all that stuff is about that id always heard about it uh its it gets its real depressing um in the morning sometime uh just you you can tell if its a good day or a bad day by uh how far out from downtown uh you you can be on the road and still not see it   oh my God   and uh yeah you know i mean its not uh i dont think Dallas is considered uh a a real bad place for for air pollution but you you can tell you can tell the differences in the days when its when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a a foggy misty color   uhhuh   and uh it its a little its a little disappointing sometimes that you start to realize what youre breathing   uh yeah but i i dont know what they can do to really prevent it you know like how can what can they do about the oil burning over in Kuwait what you know i mean they fine the the industries but you know that doesnt seem to stop them there i dont know what else they can do   right right its its that there really isnt a whole lot its its one of those uh its one of those things that if they do a little bit and uh and every you know every every little bit does help i i do believe that um but i also believe that uh the earth is is a kind of a selfregulating system and uh it will clean itself up eventually it the whole idea is not to not to push the limit too hard i guess let let the you know let the natural natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible   umhum yeah i i yeah i just dont understand you know what else anyone can do about it i dont think its something that people really think about either   umhum   you know its i mean i it it should probably be a big issue you know because its its doing a lot of damage but i its something you know i dont think many people really think about it because its nothing they i dont think we really have too much control over it   right and its one of those things its its its so hard to measure uh what what what the damage is its its kind of like uh   umhum   oh i guess its kind of like kind of like cigarette smoking you know it it it it could go on for years and years until they they start start to see some results and people can actually actually say yeah its its its doing its doing some damage and and somethings got to be done   umhum   um theres you know theres a lot of things like that it it it you can uh you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks but until it breaks you dont really know that there  you were doing anything to it   yeah exactly   but uh   well i really dont know too much else about it   yeah well thats it you know i i i think we both agree its its one of those deals that uh i just think theres a lot of other problems right now and uh weve done a lot to take care of it   umhum yeah   and uh   yeah we have tried i mean you know and um i i know where you know where a couple of the mills that have i know i know they put things on their stacks you know to filter the smoke and do all kinds of things but i mean every now and then it breaks you know and and you just got smoke going out into the air for a day or two till you can get it fixed and stuff   oh sure sure   so you know its something we we have tried to help but yeah   oh theres no doubt about i dont know if you if you ever happened to see uh some of the like Twenty Twenty and what not about uh Romania and East Germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their uh systems had been running for twenty and thirty years   um umhum   and uh you know they absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted thats thats the kind of things that uh you dont see in this country and thats thats why i think that you know its its i dont know if you can ever do enough but uh i think its all relative to the to the time and place and i think right now its its its pretty much under control   yeah okay well umhum its been nice talking to you okay byebye   all righty well you bet bye
