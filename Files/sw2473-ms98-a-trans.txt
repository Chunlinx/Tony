          so uh Deanna where do you like to fish   well we usually go fishing at Toledo Bend   umhum   and um my parents theyre the fishermen and my brother uh i i usually dont do too much fishing i usually take my raft and float along behind the boat and get a suntan   umhum oh great great   but they love to crappie fish my brother likes to bass fish so um   uhhuh what what do you what do you use for bait for crappie and bass   for crappie they use shiners   umhum   and um bass my brother usually puts a jig or something like that on there for it or a top water bait you know sometimes usually artificial bait for bass   umhum umhum   and then um we sometimes get crickets and they they fish for bream and   ive never used crickets before do you use them live   yeah you havent   what you put put the hooks through their little back and they just jump around under the water   umhum   and and and and what are crickets good for   bream   brim umhum umhum   uhhuh and um also they have these uh wasp the the um larvae is that what its called wasp wasp larvae   umhum oh yeah yeah   and uh oh anytime we can find those my parents just scoop up on those because they are so good for fishing   umhum umhum   and um they use those a lot but usually its either shiners or     oh just a minute i got to see who that is   okay       so anyway uh uh do you ever  fish for catfish   no we usually dont do i mean they catch catfish i keep saying they because i never fish but um they catch catfish you on accident sometimes   oh okay   and then whenever we do trot lines and stuff they usually get catfish   are they are they big ones   um uh usually not too big probably maybe two or three pounds you know ive seen some huge catfish   umhum yeah yeah i think you have to go deep for those dont you though dont they kind of just kind of scavenge along the bottom of of wherever they are   the bottom yeah umhum   yeah uh what what kind of a boat do yall have   well we used to just have a little aluminum boat but uh my dad has sold it so hes hunting a boat now i think hes looking into Bass Tracker   umhum umhum   he found him one last weekend that he really liked but we havent gotten it yet so   oh yeah yeah well we dont have a boat we usually fish off the shore or off the dock and my ive got a son thats a senior in high school and he just loves he loves fishing i i dont have the patience that he does   well oh i agree   uh you know its its sitting there on the dock and you go a hour and nothings happened he says no dad i know theyre down there lets not go i know theyre down there and theyre and theyre gonna bite anytime and uh     thats right   were talking about fishing today daddy   uh uh he got into a place where uh we were in there where there was a bunch of sand bass schooling and my goodness   oh   he was throwing this was one day last summer and he every as often as he could throw that hook out there hed get one but we dont deplete the fish population because we pull them up and look at them admire them and take them off and throw them back although he went somewhere with some friends last week and fished for catfish and got them and i think its the first time that hes ever that hes actually prepared and ate what they caught he and some friends of his the first time theyve ever done anything but throw them back   oh   but uh we we you know we we started with just rudimentary things like worms and night crawlers and uh and uh uh gone to uh minnows and can catch just a lot of sandies or even catfish with minnows uh and we take we fish at Lake Texoma   oh   and and then and then just kind of stop there on the way by and get the uh and and get the and get minnows and uh its its pretty lot of fun except i say you got to have a lot of patience because some days it doesnt seem like anythings down there at all   yeah   and then other other days uh uh you you can pull them in with some degree of regularity it seems as the summer comes when it gets warm and you have calm days without a lot of wind they seem to be uh far more prevalent   well i just do not have the patience for it but i mean we usually um keep our fish that are right size you know that are a good eating size because my parents love to eat fish but   no yeah oh sure   um the little ones we throw back or my dad will bring them home and put them in my fish tank   yeah throw throw them back and let them get bigger so you can come get them next year yeah yeah   yeah and catch them next time yeah   but you know at at Texoma its such a big lake and we dont have a boat but were on the dock and people come in theres a lot of sandy islands out in the middle of Texoma   uhhuh   and they go out and fish around there and people come in with these ice chests just full of of you know twelve fourteen sixteen eighteen inch long fish   oh great   its the darndest thing ive ever seen and i dont know we were probably going to have to get us a boat one of these days soon and go out and see go out and see whats really out there   they are so expensive   oh yeah i know they are i used to have one that we used to ski ski behind   oh i love to ski   and and before our our children came along my wife and i used to ski all the time then when the and we kept it on it was an eighteen footer it was kind of big to haul over the road so we kept it at a lake tied up   yeah umhum   and then when your children are very little you cant go out and do things like that and it got so the insurance and the and the uh and the tie up fee uh was   yeah   gigantic compared to what use we were getting out of it so i went and sold it and never bought again and its too bad now that the kids are teenagers they want theyd love to get out there and learn to ski and do the boating and fishing again so well probably do something like that   oh yeah   do you do you camp at the lake a lot   yeah we um we usually do probably usually in the springtime or in the fall in the summer   but not in the summer   yeah the summer times a little too hot   oh okay   um we usually go pitch a tent and we stay out there for the weekend or um for the week matter of fact i think were going to go again in in May   umhum   the middle of May were uh planning a trip down to Toledo Bend and sometimes we rent a trailer and then   oh umhum where where is Toledo Bend   um its between the Texas and Louisiana border   oh okay its uh its on that s ide its on the east east side whats whats the nearest big city   um  daddy whats the nearest big city to Toledo Bend this lakes huge i mean   its huge yeah and i was i is it out like near Tyler or Texarkana or Parish   he says its exactly half way between Shreveport and Dallas   oh okay exactly half way between Shreveport and Dallas um how how long does it take you to get there from Shreveport   its um it usually takes us we  it takes about an hour or an hour and a half for us to get there daddy yeah and then my brother will meet us half way since he works you you know he lives in Dallas he usually meets us half way and   oh do you work in Shreveport or go to school or what   i go to school i go to LSU   oh what are you majoring in   communications   oh my goodness i have been on the LSU campus once i took a recruiting trip for TI there about uh uh eight or nine years ago   oh   and i was oh i was ever so impressed with the campus in fact it was a two day trip and between appointments i got a chance to walk around and see it   uhhuh   and uh what a what a fabulous darn school it was i was just really really impressed with it   well gosh thanks   and and i know its getting off the subject a little bit but i i do you follow a lot of the sports at LSU     yeah i sure do i try to i mean um   okay well were were were very strong uh womens womens basketball team fans   oh   so we we follow your basketball team your your womens basketball team a lot and   well great yeah i i also try to follow Tech Louisiana Tech the   yeah your oh of course they are one of the best uh they didnt do as well this year but we saw them we went down to Austin last year and saw them beat the Longhorns in the regionals   yeah they are oh   and and uh man they were  i guess they went to the final four last year and and didnt make it through but we were just uh uh just really impressed with them what what year are you in at LSU   uhhuh i am almost a junior  after this semester in May ill be a junior   uhhuh and what do you plan on doing when you get out   uh i want to be a cruise director   oh gee what a deal on like on Love Boat huh     yeah kind of i guess   hey thats a neat thing   um id like to do that for a few years and then whenever i get settled down i would like to go back and teach college id like to be a professor   uhhuh are you you then plan on maybe getting an advanced degree somewhere   yeah im gonna um go ahead and go straight in and get my Masters degree   oh at LSU you gonna stay there   no im gonna go to uh im gonna send check into the University of Colorado   oh   because they have a um special program a Masters one years Masters program where i can get my Masters in one year   umhum   so um   what would it take about thirty hours or something like that thirty two thirty six   i think its thirty six yeah   okay so that would be two long semesters and a summer maybe huh   umhum it i mean its going to take a lot of hard work but um you need   yeah okay oh sure sure well i think i think uh uh the best thing to do is i i got two Masters degrees but they both came years after my Bachelors degree   uhhuh   and if i had it to do all over again i would do what youre planning to do like continue   umhum   you need to get it while youre still hot     thats what everybody has said because once you get out and make that money its so hard to get back into it   it it is it is very hard to go back and and actually the academic part isnt bad when your when you resume because it seems that things come easier because youre more mature and youve got all your life experiences and i thought the academic part would be harder but it really isnt uh because uh it because uh uh i dont know i think the maturity factor uh uh overcomes the fact that youve had a gap   yeah   but nevertheless its its so much its so hard to get back to it and its its so much easier while youve got your academic juices flowing   well what were what are your degrees in   i have uh my first ones in my Bachelors in Chemistry and my Masters in Physics and in uh in Management uh uh uh quality management ive been in ive been in quality management with TI and engineering management and and uh   oh goodness
