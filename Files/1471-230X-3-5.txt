                    Background        Acute graft versus host disease AGVHD is a        significant cause of morbidity and mortality following        allogeneic bone marrow transplantation BMT It frequently        involves skin intestinal tract and liver The incidence        of AGVHD after allogeneic BMT ranges from  to  with        skin as the most commonly affected organ often accompanied        by intestinal and  or liver involvement               Intestinal AGVHD may manifest as abdominal cramps ileus        profuse diarrhea and sometimes bleeding However these        symptoms are not specific and include broad differential        diagnoses such as chemotherapy effect radiation therapy        effect infections and side effects of other drugs                Furthermore the histomorphological features of        these conditions overlap significantly with AGVHD Due to        this interpretation of colonic biopsies for intestinal        AGVHD may be a major diagnostic challenge especially for        those not conversant with these findings     Only a        few studies have statistically evaluated the diagnostic        significance of some histopathological features            AGVHD is treated with immunosuppression which may worsen        an underlying infective condition Thus it is extremely        important to diagnose these conditions correctly for proper        management        In addition to other histopathological features        described in association with AGVHD significance of        apoptosis crypt abscess and crypt loss has been        emphasized          However the distribution        pattern of apoptosis in colonic mucosa in AGVHD has not        been methodically evaluated Similarly the term crypt        abscesses has been used previously in AGVHD although it        appears to be a misnomer as discussed later This may lead        to confusion with crypt abscess of inflammatory bowel        disease Crypt abscess and cryptitis associated with        inflammatory bowel diseases not been evaluated in        intestinal AGVHD previously were specifically studied to        confirm the misnomer status        We retrospectively analyzed various histomorphological        features in  colon biopsies from BMT patients with        cutaneous AGVHD and diarrhea These were compared with         colon biopsies from negative control groups The goal of        this study was to systematically evaluate the diagnostic        reliability of various histomorphological features with        reference to intestinal AGVHD                    Methods                  Group Definitions                      Group A            Consisted of  patients  males and  females             to  years of age mean  years with diarrhea            and biopsy proven cutaneous AGVHD In this group            intestinal AGVHD was strongly favored in the absence            of other etiologies such as CMV colitis and NSAIDs                      CMV colitis cases were excluded            morphologically based on the presence of CMV cytopathic            effect or CMV immunohistochemistry The cases with            suspicious features such as ill defined cytopathic            changes and ischemic features were also automatically            excluded without performing CMV immunohistochemistry to            avoid possibility of inclusion of cases with CMV These             colon biopsies were performed  to  day postBMT            median  days prior to the commencement of treatment            for AGVHD and within  days of AGVHD positive skin            biopsy for investigating their diarrhea            The underlying indications for BMT in these  cases            in group A are shown in Table  The distribution of            cases with reference to the grading of cutaneous AGVHD            included  cases with grade I  with grade II             with grade III and  with grade IV Published clinical            and histological criteria were used to define cutaneous            and intestinal AGVHD         Grading of            AGVHD was not attempted in colon biopsies                                Group B            negative control I Included  patients  males            and  females  to  years of age mean  years            without immunodeficiency BMT or any other            transplantation They had nonspecific GI symptoms like            diarrhoea and abdominal cramps without inflammatory            bowel disease The histopathology was negative for any            diagnostic pathology with nonspecific changes or normal            colonic mucosa                                Group C            negative control II Included  kidney transplant            patients  males and  females  to  years of            age mean  years with nonspecific GI symptoms            like diarrhea and guaiac positive stool The sections            of colon biopsies were histopathologically negative for            diagnostic pathology These patients in group C were            under maintainance immunosupressive therapy with            cyclosporine or tacrolimus prednisone and            mycophenalate mofetil This group was included to study            if any of the histomorphological features evaluted in            this study have significant relationship with            transplantation in general including effect of            immunosupressive therapy            Subclinical AGVHD in the absence of cutaneous            AGVHD or gastrointestinal symptoms is known                 Because of this reason a fourth hypothetical control            group of biopsies from BMT patient without AGVHD            though desired was considered impractical as various            criteria under scrutiny in this study will be deciding            if those biopsies would have to be considered negative            for AGVHD Other negative control group desired would            be colonic biopsies from the cases undergoing all the            therapy components of BMT including cytoreductive            therapy but without BMT However such a group would            also be impractical during any clinical study due to            obvious ethical limitations Autologous BMT case            without cyclosporine induced GVHD or viral infection            would have been ideal control      However due            to limited number of cases in this group we could not            include such a group            Histomorphological features secondary to the effects            of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs                and intestinal infections especially cytomegalovirus            CMV        are known to overlap with            AGVHD Due to this based on clinical details the            cases with such associations were excluded from this            study                                    General information          Polyethylene glycol solution GoLytely  Braintree          Laboratories Braintree MA was used for endoscopic          preparation in all the groups Due to known subtle          differences between left and right side of the colon the          proportion of different sites in each group was matched          for statistical correction All colon biopsies were fixed          in Bouins fixative and processed routinely Multiple          levels of paraffinembedded tissue sections stained with          HE were examined in blinded fashion without knowing          the category                          Histopathological Analysis          Various histological features important for the          differential diagnosis of AGVHD were selected after          review of literature       All HE stained          sections were evaluated qualitatively or          semiquantitatively for histomorphological features shown          in table           The mucosal thicknesses Table  A from the surface          epithelium to the internal limit of muscularis mucosa in          three places were measured in the area of least thickness          and mean was calculated Thickness   microns was          considered within normal limits     Cryptitis and          crypt abscess were defined respectively as infiltration          of crypt epithelium with neutrophils and presence of          neutrophils in crypt lumen Table  F Five or fewer          intraepithelial lymphocytes per  epithelial cells in          surface and crypt lining were considered to be within          normal limits Table  G and H     We classified           extravascular neutrophils per  inflammatory cells          in the lamina propria LP as mild increase and more than          five as marked increase Table  L Macrophages with          mucin as faintly basophilic foamy cytoplasm in HE          stained sections were identified as muciphages Five or          more muciphages in LP per  crypts were considered          significant Table  P Presence of five or more          endothelial lined blood spaces larger than  microns for          every  crypts was regarded as increased microvessel          network Table  Q Apoptosis defined as single cell          death was indentified in HE stained sections as          apoptotic cells with scattered karyorrhectic basophilic          globular intracytoplasmic debris of apoptotic bodies          Figure  Apoptotic cells were counted in  high power          field HPF at   magnification with a field diameter          of  mm Mitotic figures were counted per  crypts          Table                           Statistical Analysis          Each group was evaluated for the frequency of various          histomorphological features shown in table  The          findings in group A were compared with groups B and C          using Fishers exact test Table  Number of apoptotic          cells and mitotic figures in group A were compared with          those in groups B and C using Wilcoxan Rank Sum Test          Table           In order to compensate for the multiple testing and          thus to avoid imparting spurious significance we used a          stringent significance level of  for each test This          was based on the Bonferroni correction factor for          multiple testing to achieve an overall significance level          of      Histomorphological features with          statistically significant differences were separated for          further analysis Table                             Results        The comparative frequency of various histomorphological        features observed

                  Discussion        Some of the histological features of AGVHD in colonic        biopsies have been studied and reported previously               But they have not been evaluated together as        collective features with methodical statistical analysis        Crypt cell apoptosis has been described as a significant        finding in intestinal AGVHD Usually this is focal in        nature and results in membrane bound debris of apoptotic        bodies in the crypts This phenomenon has been labeled        variously as exploding crypt cells             karyolytic body       apoptotic body             granular necrosis    and popcorn lesions            Figure  Though this lesion is not specific for AGVHD        it is a cardinal feature as demonstrated by experimental        production of intestinal AGVHD in the Rhesus monkey             It is a valuable diagnostic feature in the absence        of infections especially CMV           Other        critical differential diagnoses include effects of        radiationchemotherapy     and effects of other drugs        such as NSAIDs            A higher number of apoptotic bodies were observed in        AGVHD than in negative controls Table  The        distribution pattern of apoptosis in colon biopsies with        AGVHD has not been evaluated previously with statistical        analysis In this study a statistically significant        difference was noted when the distribution of apoptotic        bodies in crypts and around the crypts was compared with        those in surface epithelium and adjacent to the surface        epithelium        The frequency of apoptotic bodies in surface epithelium        and adjacent LP in all the three groups were comparable and        did not show statistically significant difference Table         K          and K           The presence of apoptosis in        surface epithelium or in adjacent LP is nonspecific In the        absence of apoptosis in the crypts presence of apoptosis        along the surface epithelium does not have any diagnostic        significance for AGVHD The cause of apoptosis along the        surface epithelium is physiological turnover with loss from        the surface epithelium and the replacement by proliferation        of cells in the crypts Variety of nonspecific factors may        accelerate this with increased number of apoptotic cells        along the surface epithelium        As compared to the negative controls group B  and        group C  crypt apoptosis was frequent in AGVHD         with statistically significant difference Table K           With proper clinical history the        diagnosis of AGVHD can be suggested if apoptosis is        observed in and around the crypts Association of cryptal        apoptosis with other features Table  should increase the        diagnostic accuracy These associations included reactive        changes in the surface epithelium increased muciphages        reduced mucosal thickness focal fibrosis in LP irregular        distribution of crypts crypt dilatation and crypt size        variation Table  However some of these features may be        secondary to cytoreductive therapy and other components of        BMT In general the effects of cytoreductive therapy are        not observed after  days     Under proper clinical        situation their association with apoptosis in crypts and        pericryptal apoptosis in LP is consistent with AGVHD in        BMT Further evaluation of these features in relation to        individual components of BMT protocols may be conducted as        animal experiments with proper controls As mentioned under        materials and methods such evaluation would be impractical        as clinical study due to obvious ethical limitations in        organizing proper controls        Patients with cutaneous and hepatic AGVHD frequently        have apoptosis in their colon biopsies without any        intestinal symptoms     This may represent subclinical        intestinal AGVHD if the apoptosis is observed in relation        to the crypts     If other findings Table  are        present in the absence of crypt apoptosis it may represent        evidence of past AGVHD or due to other etiologic factors        such as chronic infections and inflammatory bowel        disease        As noted in this study classical cryptitis with        infiltration of cryptlining by neutrophils and crypt        abscesses with neutrophils within crypt lumens observed in        inflammatory bowel disease were not features of intestinal        AGVHD Table  F Cryptitis has been described in        association with AGVHD but these studies do not define        the term       Although reference had been made to        crypt abscesses in these reports it is evident that the        researchers were looking at the apoptotic debris in gland        lumina and suggested crypt abscesslike changes            In our study only one case  from group A with AGVHD        showed occasional crypt abscess Table  and this may        represent a coincidental inflammatory bowel disease  like        damage     Mild cryptitis with a few crypt abscesses        was also observed in one patient  in group C with        kidney transplantation Table  Thus classical cryptitis        and crypt abscesses with infiltration of crypt lining and        crypt lumen with neutrophils observed in inflammatory bowel        disease is not a feature of AGVHD        A change that was called focal periglandular infiltrate        by Bombi et al     was observed by us in three         cases of AGVHD involving only one or two crypts Table         N Sale and colleagues described a comparable feature with        focal increase in density of lymphocytes plasma cells        and occasional eosinophils in the LP     This finding        was suggested as a marker for apoptosis favoring the        clinical diagnosis of AGVHD     They have suggested        that the presence of focal periglandular infiltrate        warrants a careful search for cryptal apoptosis We did not        observe this finding in negative control groups B and        C        The clusters of enterochromaffin cells in AGVHD have        been reported previously      They have been        described in association with apoptosis suggesting their        presence as the result of selective sparing of        enterochromaffin elements during the process of AGVHD We        did not observe them in HE stained sections Table         R                    Conclusions        Apoptosis in crypt lining and pericryptal apoptosis        adjacent to crypts in LP especially when associated with        the features such as crypt abnormalities and reactive        changes in mucosa LP and surface epithelium favor the        diagnosis of AGVHD Cryptitis and crypt abscesses are not        feature of AGVHD and should be differentiated from        popcorn lesions which show apoptotic cells instead of        neutrophils along the crypt lining and in the crypt        lumen                    List of abbreviations        AGVHD Acute graftversushost disease BMT bone
