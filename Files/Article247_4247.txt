                                 Hollywoods OpeningNight Neurosis                        If you want to be oh a heretic and actually go out to the movies thisFriday night instead of staying at home watching Its a Wonderful Lifegood luck finding a newI mean brandspanking newmovie to watch Therewont be any Either there will be movies that have been in the theaters atleast a week and who wants to watch those on a Friday night or movies thatopened today this list includes Man on the Moon Any Given Sunday  andSnow Falling on Cedars  But unlike every other Friday in movie historythere will be no Hollywood films opening on Dec  The four that mighthave The Talented Mr Ripley Galaxy Quest  Titus  andAngelas Ashes will instead be opening on Christmas which in the caseof Ripley and Titus makes for a very odd combination            The studios have explained that they arent releasing their movies onChristmas Eve because it is one of the slowestif not theslowestmoviegoing day of the year and theyd rather wait and let their filmsdebut with a splash on Christmas This sounds plausible until you think aboutwhat the decision to release the films a day late actually means Since moviesalways end their runs on Thursdays or occasionally Tuesdays regardless ofwhen those runs start it means that these movies will have one fewer day inwhich to make money Thats not a day the studios will be able to get back atsome point Whenever their runs end Ripley  et al will have runs thatare one day shorter than they otherwise would have been            Now the cost of showing those films for that extra day is negligible enoughthat even if only a few people show up youll make some money And it isnt asif the theaters are going to be closed on Christmas Eve Theyre going to beshowing something  In fact theyll be showing Any Given Sundayand Man on the Moon  among other movies So why would the studios make adecision to keep their films out of theaters            The answer has everything to do with the astonishing importance that filmsopening weekends have taken on in the mind of Hollywood If you open GalaxyQuest on Friday and it turns in numbers that are disappointing relative tothe opening weekends of other comparable films then you end up looking like aloser even though you could quite sensibly argue that this particular Fridaythrough Sunday is not like every other Friday through Sunday And Hollywood nowoperates under the conviction that if your films look like losers to theinsiders after their opening weekends they will become losers in the mind ofthe public If you open on Saturday though then your perscreen average willlook better your twoday performance has a good chance of being impressiveand you cant get dragged down by the inevitably weak Friday            This makes no sense from a business perspective since its analogous tosaying that Ford shouldnt sell its cars on days when it knows sales will beslow since that will hurt monthtomonth comparisons But the openingweekendwhich to be fair has always been disproportionately important inshaping the way studios handle filmsis now of such importance that throwingaway the money that could have been made on Friday in order to make the weekendlook better somehow seems logical            The interesting part of all this is that there isnt really much evidencethat viewers really do pay attention to those The No  film in Americablurbs in the ads let alone the No  comedy about androids in Americablurbs Its become a clich that all anyone pays attention to anymore areboxoffice grosses But it seems likely that this is a clich that is true ofthe chattering classes but not true at all of the people who actually go tomovies After last weekend the studios releasing The Green Mile andToy Story  mixed it up because Toy Story  claimed the topposition in weekend gross by a slim margin even though it was The GreenMile s opening weekend The people behind The Green Mile essentiallysaid They had their turn They should give us a break which was odd in twoways First it seemed to assume that boxoffice position was some subjectivejudgment And second it assumed that finishing first would really make adifference to The Green Mile s eventual performance If only the guys atPixar had said OK you finished first Do you really feel better now
