                                 The ChemicalWeapons Treaty            On April  aninternational treaty banning chemical weapons will take effect So far theUnited States isnt committed to taking part Thanks mainly to the efforts ofSen Jesse Helms RNC chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee theSenate has delayed ratification of the treaty and may ultimately vote it downHelms claims that despite the bans best intentions it will actually encouragechemicalweapons attacks Proponents of the treaty including the Clintonadministration worry that Helms delaying tactics will shut the United Statesout of critical decisions about chemical arms control Whats really atstake            Images from the Gulf Warof US troops and TV correspondents donning gas masks spurred the Bushadministration to complete negotiations of the Chemical Weapons ConventionCWC in  The treaty requires the member states to destroy allstockpiles of chemical weapons within  years It also bans productionpossession and use of all nerve and mustard gases Production of otherchemicals such as chlorine and certain pesticides which have commercial aswell as military applications will continue but a UN agency will monitorproduction to prevent their military use            This distinction between military and commercial productionis itself controversial Several chemicals exempted from the ban have onlyesoteric civilian applications but obvious military uses For instancephosgene and hydrogen cyanide gases ubiquitously used in World War I willcontinue to be readily accessible to terrorists and armies            In large part the CWCsimply reiterates previous international agreements  After World War I countries signed the Geneva Protocol  prohibiting the use ofchemical weapons in battle And under a  bilateral agreement the SovietUnion and the United States Russia and the United States are estimated tocontrol twothirds of the worlds chemical weapons between them committedthemselves to the destruction of most of their arsenals by the year  Thiswill occur regardless of the CWCs fate The United States spent  millionlast year to help the Russians get rid of their ton stockpile and plansto spend  billion over the next  years destroying its own  tonsHowever neither of these agreements goes as far as the CWC which bans allfuture production of weapons            Despite the enormous number of chemicalweapons most do not pose an imminent threat The majority in the American andRussian stockpiles date back to the s and are contained in rusty shells nolonger useable in battle Nor has Russia or the United States ever shown muchinterest in modernizing them But curbing RussianAmerican arms is not theCWCs principal aim Instead the United States hopes the treaty willultimately force potential groundwar opponents to abandon their chemicalweapons and prevent the recurrence of chemical attacks against civilianpopulations like the Iraqi assaults against the Kurds in the late s            However many of thecountries that the United States would like to check have yet to sign up Onehundred and sixty countries have agreed to the CWC but this includes only of the  believed to possess chemical weapons The list ofnonparticipants is ominous including most of the United States currentadversaries North Korea Libya Iraq and Syria Of the  that have actuallyratified the treaty so far only India and Ethiopia are suspected of owningchemical weapons Iran has signed but not ratified the treaty Both Chinathe thirdlargest stockpiler and Russia the largest appear to be waitingfor the Senate to ratify the treaty before doing so themselves Even then somecritics doubt that Russia which is currently reluctant to participate infurther armscontrol efforts will move to ratification            Critics of the CWC say that chemical weapons are anessential deterrent against such attacks by these nonparticipatingnations Countries like Iraq and Iran have been reluctant to use their chemicalweapons the critics argue because they have feared the United States wouldretaliate with its own chemical attack Proponents of this argument point tothe chemical arms race during the s and s which they say prevented arepeat of World War Istyle gas attacks in World War II            The treatys proponentsrespond that the US military would be unlikely to retaliate with chemicalweapons in any case and is already moving to destroy its stockpiles ThePentagon considers these weapons too unreliable for use in battlethe windcould blow the chemicals back on your own troops And with the exception ofnapalm and Agent Orange used in Vietnam the United States is not known to haveused chemical weapons in battle since World War I To allay concerns about anyloss in deterrence the Clinton administration has said that the United Stateswill respond to any use of chemical weapons with an overwhelming anddevastating attack According to the Washington Post  administrationsources say this is a coded way of threatening a nuclear response             Because a ban can be easily circumventedchemical weapons can be produced from everyday products without elaboratefacilities the treaty installs a sweeping verification program originally proposed during the Reagan administration by Vice President GeorgeBush Conservatives say its a further intrusion on American sovereignty TheCWC allows any member country to inspect any sitepublic or privateitsuspects of producing illicit chemicals in another member country This meansagents of foreign governments could legally search American businessesSnooping foreign agents critics fear will exploit their visits for industrialespionage stealing company secrets for firms in their homelands            Some legal scholarssuch as Robert Bork claim these search powers are unconstitutionally broadRandom CWC inspections Bork says violate the Fourth Amendment which requiresa warrant to search private facilities However the treaty requires allinspections to accord with the constitution of the country where the inspectiontakes place Thus if a US court rules a search is unconstitutional theinspectors will be forced to obtain warrants Also the routine randominspections used by US government agencies such as the Occupational Safetyand Health Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency are almostexactly like those planned under the CWC and these have been foundconstitutional            Domestic manufacturers of chemicals are pushing hardfor the treaty Though the CWC limits the chemicals they can legally produceit also imposes stiff penalties against countries that fail to ratify the banto encourage nonparticipants to sign up Signatory countries will be prohibitedfrom buying chemicalsthose with only residual military use that are notbannedfrom nonsignatory countries According to the Chemical ManufacturersAssociation failure to ratify the ban will cost US producers  millioneach year in lost sales to such countries as Germany Japan and India            Proponents say the treatywill suffer a fatal loss of credibility if the United States opts not to joinAside from the large US budgetary commitment to the treatysenforcementsome  million a yearUS officials have played a key role inconcocting the treaty and stewarding it to its conclusion Failure to ratifythe treaty by April  squanders US influence  Only representativesfrom the member states can sit on the committee that finalizes the treatyslogistics and the United Nations wont hire verification inspectors fromnonmember countries            Theseproponents concede that in the short run the agreement will do little toreduce the threat of a chemical attack But the analogy they say is thenuclear NonProliferation Treaty that took  years to obtain  membersandonly after the United States used sanctions to force the hand of reluctantgovernments
