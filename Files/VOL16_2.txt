onlyone translation of the rd Psalm until the otherday when I happened on the New English Bible and saw that my head was richly bathed in oilBathed in oil  Odd  I remembered anointed  Isanointing bathing  I couldnt find such a definition inthe thesaurus  I looked up the Hebrew word dishanta Found no bathed  It bothered me this image of aman having his head bathed in oil in a very Frenchbarber shop where men have their heads massaged inoil to prevent baldness instead of the image of themaking of a king like David who was the anointed ofGod  Why did this translator feel he had to changeanoint his head to bathe his head  Perhaps thetranslation comes from some very important commentatorbut it hardly creates a sublime image andsurely does not achieve the quiver mentioned in JohnBroughs translation of the Sanskrit poemOf what use is the poets poemOf what use is the bowmans dartUnless anothers senses reelWhen it sticks quivering in the heart                        Nor does the psalm sing as Henry Ward Beecherput it in Life Thoughts like a nightingaleofsmall homely feather singing shyly out of obscurityfillingthe air of the whole world with melodiousjoy greater than the heart can conceive            What were the translators of the New EnglishBible thinking  The editors tell us The translatorshave endeavored to avoid anachronisms and expressionsreminiscent of foreign idioms  They have tried tokeep their language as close to current usage as possiblewhile avoiding words and phrases likely soon tobecome obsolete a most ambitious and delicate programto attempt for the entire Bible  And how does itapply to the rd Psalm  Isnt the metaphoric shepherdan anachronism to a television generation  Andwhat of anoint his head  No one does that anymorenoteven in England where there are still occasionalcoronation ceremonies  Are waters of peacevalley dark as death thy staff and thy crook currentusage  I miss the translators search for the quiverand the nightingale            That started my own search  What had othertranslators done with this sunny little psalm thathas dried many tears and supplied the mould intowhich many hearts have poured their peaceful faithMaclaren in A Cohen The Psalms              In From One Language to Another  Jan deWaard and Eugene A Nida decry the clinging to oldfashionedlanguage even though the meaning has radicallychanged and as a deplorable example points tothe retaining of The Lord is my shepherd I shall notwant even though want no longer means to lack butrather desire and continues with Thus many personsunderstand this traditional rendering to mean TheLord is my shepherd whom I shall not want  Can youbelieve it  Can it be that these experts are wanting injudgment            Perhaps it is because I am just one of the ordinaryreaders with no special knowledge of the ancient EastNew English Bible  that I want more than anythingelse a quiver in my heart when I read the rdPsalm and confess to being rather shocked to find thatthe Lord is no longer my shepherd  Writes the translator The Psalms   I abolished the Lord butfelt unwilling to call God Yahweh  I know no one whoactually prays in English to that name  I know manywho pray to the name my Lord and some who arewilling to pray to their Father to the Almighty tothe Eternal One  Gods ineffable name as told to Mosesis unutterable Exodus  so why make an issue of itWhy not choose the one that is closest to the nightingaleThe King James Version chose The Lord is myshepherd and it sings  That liquid L sounded withthat almost awefull ord LLLAWERD followedby the soft sh in shepherd and its rd alliterationwith the rd in lord entwine this twosome in my soulIsnt that what the Lord is my shepherd is allaboutentwining my soul            Is it a better translation for me because each wordis perhaps a trifle closer to the original Hebrew or tothe original Ugaritic stem  When I read the psalmwhat I want is that quiver in my heart  Do I get itwhen I shall not want four simple onesyllablewords swaying in iambic rhythm with the shall slidingirresistibly into the breathy w of want calling upthe memory of Gods breathing the breath of

whaddayaknow can be the only response            Recognizing that the King James translation isThe noblest monument to English prose Oxford AnnotatedBible  many translators in prefaces totheir new modern versions have written apologeticsexplaining why they felt they had to retranslate andhow they proposed doing it            In The Psalms  the translator writes in his prefaceI have tried not to substitute without necessitynew English phrases for what was old and welllovedbut unity and modernization of language as well as thetrue meaning of Hebrew have often made changes inevitableIs He will bring me into meadows of younggrass really any closer to the Hebrew than He makethme to lie down in green pastures  Is not He makethme to lie down in green pastures old and welllovedDoes the modern reader really lack the great eruditionnecessary to be able to understand a few oldEnglish words and formsWhat about My countrytis of thee  and is it indeed true that in the ratherawkward phraseology of the translator the languageis not altered with doing without thou and thee  Notaltered  For my quiver I prefer doing with thou andthee  The loving yet formal thee and thou and theclosing eth

oldfashioned pastoralsimplicity when its sense and the readers senses arejarred out of the authentic Bibletime setting and areforced into a frame of the language we use todaySeen any shepherds on

                  Recent communications by Henn XIV CraggXV and Powers XV on the origins of Gook haveled me to research the matter  While I agree withCragg that the word is extraordinarily

More than halfacentury ago a book written bythe Canadian scholar Richard Albert Wilson stimulated Bernard Shaw to write whatwas probably his major sally into alphabet reform            Wilson was head of the English department at theUniversity of Saskatchewan and during the thirties hegave a course on the origin and development of languageFollowing good professorial custom he workedhis lecture notes into a book which was published inLondon in  by Dent under the title The Birth ofLanguage  with a subtitle Its Place in World Evolutionand Its Structure in Relation to Space and Time   Iwas in Wilsons class during the autumn of             Wilson sent a copy of the book to Shaw as aninstalment of interest on an old debt  Shaw read itand responded enthusiastically I urged as strongly asI could the reprinting of Professor Wilsons treatise in amodestly priced edition baited for the British bookmarket with a preface by myself an overrated attractioncommercially but one which still imposes on Londonpublishers  In  Dent reissued the book as aGuild paperback at one shilling  This edition of baited with a page preface by Shaw and asoupedup title The Miraculous Birth of Language sold out rather quickly            In  Dent issued a hardcover edition of thepaperback and that autumn I a soldier in the CanadianArmy saw it displayed in a number of Londonbookshops  A bookseller in Charing Cross Road toldme that he was amazed that such a dry book sold sowell especially in wartime  I reported this in a letterto Dr Wilson it seemed to amuse him and he sent mea small fruitcake that Christmas  The new edition waswidely reviewed in Britain  JBS Haldane the eminentbiologist who was then in his heyday as a Marxistintellectual was provoked by the word miraculous inthe title to flex his dialectic muscles at it in a lengthyreview in The Rationalist Press Annual for  as Iremember he dismissed it as a nefarious supernaturalistplot  In  the Guild paperback was reissuedand in  the Philosophical Library New York providedan American edition with the Shaw effusionand under the Miraculous title            The preface begins with this characteristicallyShavian sentence This book by Professor Wilson isone in which I should like everyone to be examinedbefore certified as educated or eligible for the franchiseor for any scientific religious legal or civil employmentOver the years that has assured me that I wassplendidly qualifiedWilson gave me a Bfor myreligious employment after my ordination in  tothe ministry in the United Church of Canada  In thepreface Shaw said that Wilson was not known to himwhen he received the book  He commented I learnedthat it Wilsons professorial chair was at Saskatoon aplace of which I had never heard and that his universitywas that of Saskatchewan which was connected inmy imagination with ochred and feathered Indiansrather than with a university apparently half a centuryahead of Cambridge in science and of Oxford in commonsense  In  Shaw had written that high civilizationis not compatible with the romance of thepioneer communities of Canada  After other introductorypleasantries Shaw confessed I had an axe ofmy own to grind and I thought that Professor Wilsonsbook might help me to grind it  And grind it he didvigorously and garrulously  The rest of the preface is aharangue on alphabet reform and has little to do withWilsons theories  At times I have wondered howmuch of Wilson he had read            The new edition was widely reviewed  The TimesLiterary Supplement said bluntly Mr Shaws prefaceought not to blind the reader to the excellence of ProfessorWilsons treatise  And a reviewer in The FortnightlyReview said this of the preface It soundsclear like all that Mr Shaw writes yet it is less limpidthan the flow of Professor Wilsons exposition            After Shaws death in  we were treated to thefarce that resulted from the provision in his will thatthe income from the residue of his estate be used fortwentyone years on the design and dissemination of anew alphabet for the English language  That part ofthe will was declared invalid by a judge and the interestedparties not wishing an extensive romp in thecourts agreed to a compromise whereby the sum of was set aside for the development of the newalphabet Shaw called for and for the publication in itof Androcles and the Lion   Not utterly irrelevant hereare these words on page  of Shaws Everybodys PoliticalWhats What  published in  we allowprivate citizens to make fantastic unjust bigotedor even spitefully wicked disposals of their possessionsafter their deaths by will and give these wills the forceof law            Shaw called for a new alphabet for the socalledReceived Pronunciationthe mode of speech we callOxford or BBC English  At one time Shaw waschairman of the committee of the BBC that wasresponsible for spokenEnglish standards  That wouldhave put most of the Englishspeaking world out in thephonetic cold and would muck up written EnglishSpeakers of General American would have made noeffort to go along with it  We every r soundingCanadians would have been permanently confined tothe linguistic bush  No r rolling Scot after generationsof Georrge would condescend to Gawge  Shawwould not have liked the way Professor Wilsonspokeordinary CanadianEnglish the eastern Ontariokind with every r sounded  Wilson was sensitiveto the growing edges of language and he rejoiced inthe ambiguities of it because they are signs of life anddevelopment  Shaw on the hand had a strangelystatic understanding of language he was downrightparochial and more than a little snobbish about spokenEnglish and how an alphabet should standardize it            In the new edition of the book Wilson put thislittle note following the Shaw preface I am gratefullyindebted to Mr Bernard Shaw for the interest he hastaken in the book and especially for his most generousaction in taking the time from his crowded life to writeso magnanimous and stimulating a Preface to it withoutwhich this present cheap edition would not havebeen published  As I read that I can hear the gentleirony in Wilsons voice and I can see the twinkle in hiseyesand I can imagine his rubbing his hands a littleover that final bit            Then I ask myself this question Who used whomto grind whose axe anyway            Wilsons book after sales of more than  inits various editions went out of print in  the yearof his death  In  The Canadian Journal of Linguisticscelebrated its silver anniversary with a substantialissue consisting of the whole of Wilsons original editionof The Birth of Language  with a valuable introductionby Professor JK Chambersand without theShaw preface  Chambers of the Department of LinguisticStudies at the University of Toronto in the articleon Wilson he contributed to second edition of The Canadian Encyclopedia  offers this significantcomment Virtually unaware of the developing scienceof linguistics Wilson espoused a more modernview than was then current giving central importanceto mentalism and language universals  Wilson mayyet come to be recognized as a pioneer in what perhapscan be called philosophical linguistics  His bookis again in print                              In his treatise on words and expressions derivedfrom firearms XV Richard Lederer was often correctin his selection of words but was often wrong as totheir meanings and derivations  His knowledge of theterminology is probably not firsthand            In the discussion of flash in the pan  the termsrifle and musket are used as if they were synonyms  Arifle is a longbarreled firearm with spiral grooves riflingcut into the bore to impart a spin to the projectileMusket refers to a military weapon  Althoughthere were rifled muskets in the th century mostwere of large caliber  or  and were smoothboreThey were intended to be fired quickly theywere not intended to be very accurate  The rifle wasmore accurate but took longer to load and was morecostly to make            Lederer writes the flash of the primer in the panof the rifle failed to ignite the explosion of the chargeThe pan is the part of the gunlock that contains asmall quantity of fine gunpowder ignited by sparksproduced by the flint shearing small bits of metal fromthe frizzen   A small hole bored in the barrel allows thecharge to be ignited  It is the charge that is ignitednot the explosion also black powder does not explodeit burns            The derivation and meaning of go off half cockedis far off the mark  The hammer or cock  of the gunlockusually can be in one of three positions downfully forward and down at half cock partly back toallow a flintlock to be carried with the pan closed orthe percussion cap to be placed on the nipple of apercussion arm or at full cock   In the half cock positionthe trigger is not partially backlocked whateverthat means  To oversimplify the process whenthe lock is moved to full cock the trigger a simplelever moves another lever the sear  out of the notch ina semicircular internal lock part to which the hammeris connected  If the gun goes off from the halfcockposition the lock is defective  Lederer understoodthe expression go off half cocked to mean futile gesturebecause the flintlock is unlikely to spark  Theexpression however derives from the percussion lockIf the main spring of the lock is sufficiently strong theblow received by the percussion cap can set it off andthe firearm discharges unexpectedly  Going off at halfcock is dangerous not futile                           Skinflint is not an American expression describinga parsimonious gun toter saving money by skinninghis flint with his knife to avoid buying a newone  Flints are knapped and not with a knife tosharpen them  I have never heard the term skinningused for the process  References can be found for theterm long before there was an American frontier andit sounds as if someone made up this one            Although hanging fire is defined as being the oppositeof pointblank  the two are unrelated in the fieldof firearms a hangfire is a delay in the ignition of thepowder charge in a firearmnot a benign delay but aserious potentially deadly situation                           Heavens to Betsy had better remain source unknownThe Brown Bess muskets were of British issuethough many were used by American troops during theRevolutionary War  Americans produced their ownmuskets as well but they were not the weapon of thefrontier  That was the Kentucky or Pennsylvania riflea lighter smallerbored more accurate weapon thanthe Brown Bess            Hell will be cold enough to freeze the balls off abrass monkey before the difference in the coefficientsof expansion or contraction of brass and iron causescannonballs in a muzzleloading battery on a battleshipto topple  The reference to battleship is ananachronism  As for the square brass monkey withcircular depressions for stacking cannonballs it wouldhave to contract a great deal more than the iron ballsto cause them to tumble  The coefficient of expansionrelates the change in volume area or length to achange in temperature of one degree Celsius  The cubicalcoefficient for cast iron is roughly  forbrass it is on the order of   If we take a threeinchcannonball on a very hot day compute its diameteron a very cold day assuming a drop of  Cand compare this to the contraction of brass for thesame drop in temperature while it is true that thecannonballs will have shrunken twice as much as thebrass monkey  the difference for ten balls would be lessthan a sixteenth of an inch the pile would not toppleeven if their diameters were twice as large  Howeveras cannonballs would career over the deck because ofthe motion of the ship they were kept in crates or onracks and the nicelooking pyramids were probablyjust for show as at monuments                           Son of a gun probably is not nautical and themidship gun used in the explanation doesnt makesense  Also women were not usually found on navalvessels except in harbor  The image conveyed by theauthor of prostitutes being carried as supercargoaboard fighting ships is false  Farmer  Henley Slangand its Analogues  defines the term as a soldiers bastardalthough the nautical connotation occurs in areference to The Sailors Wordbook  which refers towomen who sailed with their husbands not to loosewomen  FH also defines gun as a thief  This meaningof gun brings the phrase parallel with son of abitch bitchwhore a derivation that seems morelikely            In the discussion of stick to ones guns  Ledererstates that many a soldier was actually chained to hisgun to ensure bravery  I would like to know wherethat one came from  Artillerymen were and are veryproud of their role in warfare  A gun crew was askilled unit of usually more than ten men who spent agreat deal of time practising loading aiming and firingtheir piece  Each man had a specific duty that hadto be carried out efficiently not only for effectivenessbut also for safety  A man chained to the gun to ensurebravery  would be of little use especially afterthe recoil that followed firing            The explanation for spike ones guns is barely adequateThe spike was a metal rod driven through thetouchhole also called the vent into the bore of thegun  The spike was bent either by driving it againstthe lower side of the bore or by pounding the partinside the cannon with the rammer so that the rodcould not be removed easily            I think Mr Lederer should have muzzled himselfand committed battery upon those who gave him hisinformation  Neither muzzle not battery is used with aconnotation related to armaments  However theAmerican Heritage Dictionary includes in the derivationof muzzle the GalloRoman musellum unattestedSo too with Gunning for the English LanguageMuch of it should be qualified withunattested a term etymologically related to the brassmonkeys

innocuousin continental Portuguese have transmuted intodangerous slang  Newly arrived I taxied to my officeand found what seemed to be a queue by the elevatorsTo be certain it was indeed an elevator queue I askedthe gentleman in front of me se o senhor estava nabicha  Bicha in Portugal means a queue in Brazil itis very crude slang for a homosexual man  I had askedthe gentleman roughly Are you into homosexualityHe looked away  The error was a bottomless source ofmerriment to my Brazilian colleagues                              Backwords and Newances            Having lost my twentyyearold Timex down ahotel drain I found myself shopping for awatch a few months ago  The problem was that somany of the models I looked at had digital readoutswithout any soul  I wanted the timepiece I was usedto a normal watch as I told the saleswoman youknow with hands and            You mean an analog watch she said crisply andled me to a nearby display  There I found a watch withhands that suited me made my purchase and leftbut a question was still ticking within analog watch Presumably the analog refers to measuring time by ananalog with hands and a circular face rather than bythe more scientificlooking digital system  There isprecedent after all in analog computers which computeby some analog such as discrete electrical voltagesfor numerical values  Or maybe analog computer usedto be simply computer we live in an age of technologicalcomplexity I concluded as I bicycled home thatday from work            The next week my nephew asked for an acousticguitar for his birthday  I wont bother going into theconversation that ensued suffice it to say that acousticguitars are simply the nonelectric type and derivetheir sound from the acoustics of the instrument itselfIn the same way manual typewriters depend on thefull force of the fingers to create words rather than onelectric or electronic assistance  But where do theseterms come from  The point is that these qualifierswere added only in retrospect when the emergence ofa new prototype made some distinction necessaryThey arent quite neologisms to account for new technologylike cryogenics or LED   Rather they comefrom new technology looking back on old technologyandIve decided to call them backwordsBackwords differ from back formations  the latter arewords often verbs formed on existing words oftennouns by severing an ending  For example diagnosiswas borrowed from a Greek word which incidentallydid not mean the same thing two hundredyears afterwards the verb diagnose a back formation wascoined            Apart from documenting linguistic treacheryhowever the collecting of backwords provides capsuleviews of mans progress in a variety of fields  Monosound equipment brings back the days when the phonographrested in the den instead of in the home entertainmentcenter when quadraphonic might have beena malapropism for something in The Phantom of theOpera   Other backwords involve longer journeys intime straight razors were the only razors around untilthe emergence of safety razors which have in turnceded precedence to the injectorblade and finally thetwinblade  The term live performance gained currencysome time after Edisons inventions  Similarlythe phrase recorded live  while it suggests the overtonesof a concert rather than a studio performancemay still sound odd to an untrained ear this may betermed sound mixing in a double sense  The phraselive audience  if dwelt upon overmuch suggests aghoulish alternative  Fountain pen dirt road manualtransmission steam engine handwoven fabric conventionalweapons general practitioner natural childbirthcloth diaper these are backwords dating anywherefrom the era of the jalopy to the nuclear ageThey can I suppose be summed up in that slightlysuspect word progress   Still I must in all fairness notethat I write with a Bic and drive an automaticshiftwith perfect equanimity  The frame of mind for huntingbackwords need not be disgruntlement            In the gustatory realm backwords are commonFreshsqueezed orange juice and handdipped icecream simply make the point that most juice and icecream no longer come that way  Ditto for freerangechicken and draft beer   And then there are whatsound like redundancies French champagne is a hotlycontested instance  The notice that a nation other thanFrance could produce an effervescent wine and thenhave the audacity to label it champagne was the basisfor a lawsuit rather than an etymological inquiry  On amore prosaic level the terms plain yogurt potatoknish and cheese blintz would have been consideredtautological some years ago  Nowadays when blintzesmay be filled with anything from pured walnuts tospinach and yogurt comes in eighteen different varietiesplain has acquired its own distinction  The CocaColacompany tried to capitalize on this distinctionafter the financial disaster of New Coke buyers nostalgicfor the old product could purchase Classic Coke insupermarkets  Great original flavor  is the boast ofmore than one food company trying to distance aproduct from its own later derivatives            It is a puzzle why certain objects acquire backwordswhile others retain their names and it is thenewcomers that are given qualifying labels  Thesedays video cameras are all the rage but as far as Iknow no one has thought up a backword for the snapshottakingtype  still camera does fill the bill but itremains for the most part a technical term  Whenautomated tellers came in some years ago no onethought to rename the human operators  Much furtherback automobiles were first known as horseless carriagesno one called the carriages they replacedanimaldriven vehicles though someone might callthem that today or tomorrow  The governing principleseems to be inurement when the new has sufficientlytaken hold it becomes a standard  At the sametime the old acquires the status of a curiosity deservingof its own label            Perhaps the best example of this paradigm is thetouchtone phone which has so edged out the oldermodels that two backwords were formed for the oldtype rotary phone and dial phone On the other hand cellular phones are still new enough to havetheir own novelty label  They are really radio phonesas opposed to a shortrange instrument called a cordlessphone that is at present a miracle of convenienceand voicedistortion  Given time and improved technologyall nonradio phones may be branded as wirephones             Often the new meaning may be imposed on theold word without any change in the word itself  Todistinguish them from backwords they may be termednewances  Dishwasher appliance not restaurantsupernumerary tape magnetic not sticky and carautomotive not horsedrawn are three ready instancesof this shift but there are countless others  Inthe field of computing alone are such newances asprogram chip terminal printer and so on softwareis listed in the MerriamWebster Second Edition as soft wares and defined as dry goods  In the realmof newances are also a series of verbs call  from shoutingto telephoning see  from in the flesh to virtualimage fly  from avian to human and drive  appliedslightly differently to each new vehicle developed  Andwhile xerography has provided both noun and verbnewances for the word copy  Horaces ut pictura poesisreminds one that picture  too has newances coexistingwith its ageold meanings            Finally there are the objects that while still possessingone basic nomenclature show marked potentialfor confusion and hence for backwords  A bicycleis no longer just a bike it may now be a tenspeedbike a mountain bike now tagged as an ATB  or allterrainbike or a stationary bike also known as anexercise bike   The backword in the offing alreadyused by many is road bike  though it usually means atenspeed which is now used as a noun  As for otherareas with potential have color televisions becomestandard enough to qualify all

aspects            As with other etymological quests the search forbackwords and newances may become a consuminghobby  All one needs is a sense of history that exceedsones lifetime  Woodburning stove

custommade cabinets  It occurred to methat custommade anything is approaching the realmof the anomalous another item for the collection  Theone risk in collecting backwords is that it does tend tomake one feel like an antiquity possibly deserving of abackword oneself  Right now I cant think of such alabel  Given time however history may provide mewith one            The technical term often so

little almostperceptible jerk that so offended the criticaljudgment of the Biarritz bullfight experts                        The various moments here are related only sequentiallyDespite the intense interaction that existsbetween a bullfighter and bull there is an avoidanceof interactive conjunctions such as when whileand as             It is this very avoidance of interactive conjunctionsthroughout the novel that creates the hard style  Suchconjunctions when placed in the beginning or middleof a sentence form clauses that hang suspendedawaiting definition from their relationship with whatfollows  Sentences which use such clauses are softermore pliant  Not a boxers jabcoming at you fromclose range with its full effect felt at oncebut adismount from a high bar  Virginia Woolf for oneoften used suspension to create a world of subtle interactionThere were few mornings when Mary did notlook up as she bent to lace her boots and as shefollowed the yellow rod from curtain to breakfasttableshe usually breathed some sigh of thankfulnessthat her life provided her with such momentsof pure enjoymentNight and DayHarcourt Brace Jovanovich                         There is a moment of pure enjoyment depicted bythe narrator in The Sun Also Rises which uses thissame interactive syntax  Riding on top of a bus in theSpanish countryside squeezed in among people whoselanguage Basque he doesnt speak he turns his attentionto the land around him  It is much like terrain hehas described before only now for the first time hedoes not break down the description into a mere seriesof selfcontained tightly held moments  As much asthe words themselves the syntax shows him to be relaxinginto the momentAs soon as we started out on the road outsidetown it was cool  It felt nice riding high up andclose under the trees  The bus went quite fast andmade a good breeze and as we went out along theroad with the dust powdering the trees and downthe hill we had a fine view back through thetrees of the town rising up from the bluff abovethe river                        But for the most part interaction between clauses isreserved for moments of consternation  The narratordoes not let down his guard he must be thrown off itWhy I felt that impulse to devil him I do notknowWhen I got up to go I found I had taken off myshoesWhile we were waiting I saw a cockroach on theparquet floor that must have been at least threeinches longAs all the time I was kneeling with my forehead onthe wood in front of me and was thinking of myselfas praying I was a little ashamedHe offered the wineskin to Bill and to me andwhen I tipped it up to drink he imitated the soundof a klaxon motorhorn so well and so suddenlythat I spilled some of the wine and everybodylaughedAs I started to get on my feet he hit me twiceShe kissed me and while she kissed me I could feelshe was thinking of something elseWhen I woke it was the sound of the rocket explodingthat announced the release of the bulls fromthe corrals at the edge of town                        So select is the narrator in his use of such suspensionsthat the simple variation of the placement of aclause in two otherwise almost identical statements canbe momentous  Look at the two phrases We metCohn as we came out of church and As we came outof the door I saw Cohn  Both times the narrator iswith the woman who had had a brief affair with hisfriend Cohn and then dumped him  But the first timethe narrator is not sure how the woman feels about hisfriend hanging around whereas the second time hehas just been told by her that Cohns presencedepresses me so  The first time then he can plainlystate We met Cohn but the second time theencounter is troublesome he is caught in the middlebetween two friends  The mere suspension of themeaning of the sentence expresses the quandary  Theencounter itself is not expanded or even commentedon            According to Wyndham Lewis the voice of JacobBarnes contradicts his own character because it makesa man of action sound passiveThis infantile dullwitted dreamy stutter compelswhoever uses it to conform to the infantiledullwitted type  He passes over into the categoryof those to whom things are done from that ofthose who executeMen Without Art Black Sparrow Press                         But the hard style of the narrator far from beingan expression of passivity is in fact a symptom of aman who is trying to avoid having things done tohimsomeone afraid to let go of himself afraid tomerge  The castrating war wound from which he suffersbarely mentioned in the novel is merely the outwardshow of this inner disability to which we arereferred again and again  The narrator tells us that hehas trouble falling asleep he cannot give himself up todarkness  For one sixmonth period he never slept withthe light off  It is awfully easy he says to be hardboiledabout everything in the daytime but at night itis a different thing            Nor can he fall in love he cannot give himself upto another  She had been looking into my eyes all thetime  Her eyes had different depths sometimes theyseemed perfectly flat  Now you could see all the wayinto them  You do not need to ask what depth level hiseyes were at as he was observing her  Throughout thenovel he convinces us that he is drawn to a woman butnot to love itself In a way he says of it its anenjoyable feeling  The woman however knows betterNo she says I think its hell on earth  And thenarrator cant dispute this because what the womanfeels when she is in love would be for a hardboiledman a living hell Love you  she replies to his entreatyI simply turn all to jelly when you touch me            Giving himself over to hatred is no easier  Afterhis friend runs off with this same woman his strongeststatement is I certainly did hate him  Had he said Ihated him he would have been giving himself over tothat emotion throwing himself off balance but thework certainly acts like a cane to prevent it  Try sayingI certainly do love you without eyes that areperfectly flat  He cannot even give himself over tojealousy  To be jealous of a person is to be open toanothers influence to have ones sense of self continuouslychallenged by another  The narrator is not jealousof the friend he certainly did hate but onlyjealous of what happened to him  By dismissing theperpetrator he confronts only the act            Style according to Georges Louis is the manhimself and part of what makes The Sun Also RisesHemingways masterpiece is how much of himself hemanaged to get into it  He was never again to write asautobiographical a character as Jacob Barnes neveragain to use a voice as tightly controlled  Yet the characterit seems never left him  Even in his final momentthe hard style was there            To take ones own life is to take control of onesdestiny but inevitably a moment must be faced afterthe deed in which what is experienced is loss of controlThe

examples of Slurvianare highly suspect  Formally and then appliedwhere formerly and than are intended are merelymisuses  No lazy mouth hereif asked to put it intowriting the speaker would probably write the wrongwords in the same context            The citations of granite taking it for graniteand intensive for all intensive purposes are embeddedin clichs  I maintain that those two choices aremerely misunderstood expressions derived from tryingto make sense out of auditory confusion rather thanbeing the result of slouchy verbal vapors  The speakerprobably thinks taking it for granite is correct justifyingit as meaning as solid and stable as a slab ofgranite  Similar faulty justification could be made forintensive purposes  In fact such expressions may beperpetuated by others who hear the wrong version ofthe clich take it for granite and for all intensivepurposes use it as the genuine expression                           Mayan as in Whats yours is yours and whatsMayan is Mayan is another of Mr Lederers moredubious examples  He maintains Mayan is a rare formof Slurvian created by adding an extra syllable  Imaintain it is not Slurvian at all  It is regional dialectHow do we judge all as in I need to get some all formy car  All is Alabama dialect is it also Slurvian  Iwould judge that it isnt no more so than Earl  as in Ineed to get some Earl for my car as stated in theNinth Ward of New Orleans  I have heard milk pronouncedmeowk by one of my Georgia relatives butI would hesitate to label meowk as an example ofdoublesyllable Slurvian  That pronunciation canprobably be traced to familialregional roots not tolazy mouth disease  In fact I should doubt that a lazymouth would bother to add an extra syllableWouldnt the Slurvian tongue take the most slothfulroute avoiding waggle where waggle is avoidable            Before we Slurvophobian sleuths begin our huntsome rules of the game need to be defined  I suggestthat each Slurvian term should have one or more of thefollowing characteristics to distinguish it from someother form of mis pronunciation              Consonants andor vowels are left out  Examplestaken from Mr Lederers list are lining

three examples fit the Slurvianrule of swallow and squash  Sam Witch andSam Itch are pure Slurvian  The lips took away theduty of the tongue by substituting an m for an n But what about Sam Ridge  The tongue hoisteditself up and bothered to put in an unnecessary r Wouldnt Sam Ridge then be just plain mispronunciationSand Ridge on the other hand               Combinations of sounds requiring two or more consecutivetongue movements are distorted into onecompromised sound  What are you doing becomesWatch a dune  How much easier for the tongue tosplat itself against the palate and make a ch

referred to BrewersDictionary of Phrase  Fable  my research would havebeen easier  But by reviewing items I had gathered andafter examining annotated Bibles especially the DartmouthBible I arrived at the same derivation asBrewers            Years ago while sightseeing in Rome I went tothe church Pietro e Vinculo to see Michelangelossculpture of Moses  Although I had seen pictures of thesculpture I was startled to notice for the first timeanimal or devil horns visible beneath the curly hair ofMoses  And I became melancholy as I puzzled overMichelangelos reasons for what I supposed was aninsult to the deliverer of the Hebrews and the LawGiver of the Western World  I groaned at the thoughtof Michelangelos succumbing to sixteenthcenturyantiSemitism  Even though I work in publishing itdid not occur to me that a mistranslation or a typographicalerror could make its way into the Bible  Authorsand publishers employ editors and proofreadersto give readers publications free of error  In spite of allefforts errors get by at least in first printings  I shouldhave realized that early translations of the Bible fromAramaic and Hebrew into Greek and Latin then intoall the languages of the world would be at least asvulnerable as modernday publications            In cycles of four years in the Bavarian village ofOberammergau a Biblical passion play attracts thousandsof people  The next show is in  I believe  Inthe pageant Moses is costumed to display horns  Pleasof Jewish organizations asking for the elimination ofthe horns have not been heeded  It took a while but Ithink I learned the source of those horns which I nowsee in many Renaissance paintings of Moses varyingfrom cute little devils horns to those that look likehorns of an antler            Exodus  describes Moses descending fromMount Sinai after talking to Jahveh or Yahweh JehovahUnderstandably after talking to the Almightyone cannot expect to be the same again  So whenMoses came down from the mountain the skin of hisface shone King James Version  St Jerome translatingfrom the Hebrew and referring to the Greek whilepreparing the Latin Vulgate evidently mistranslatedthe Hebrew qaran to shine for qeren horn and wenton record with cornuta  horned Quod cornuta essetfacies sua   Brewers Dictionary of Phrase  Fable callsthe translation a blunder explaining that the Hebrewfor this shining may be translated either as sentforth beams or as sent forth horns   The Vulgate tookthe latter and Michelangelo followed earlier paintersin depicting Moses with horns            Adding further to the wonder of it all is this translationin Brewer  from the Vulgate His Mosesbrightness was as the light he had horns rays of lightcoming out of his hand not his head  That wasabout  years ago  Now the horns are traditional                              In December  VERBATIM published a letter Iwrote containing some mock sociological laws I hadcollected of the Murphys Law type  That resulted in aliterary adventure worth reporting for since then thearticle has taken on a remarkable life of its own            In January  James J Kilpatrick wrote a columnin which he republished much of the letter anddescribed the observations as profound laws among the truths we live by  The column was syndicatednationally with both VERBATIM and me mentionedprominently  I became a Nationally Quoted AuthorityIn The Field  A few months later the articlewas reprinted as the backpage humor article in thehouse magazine of a giant international corporationformoney  I was now Internationally Publishedand Professional authorially

a Legend            I figure that with a little luck I can be a Lion ofLiterature in just a few more years  Then Ill give upmy job and conduct motivational seminars                              A Taxonomy of Epigrams            What is an epigram  A dwarfish whole itsbody brevity and wit its soul  So saidColeridge in an epigram of his own  Nietzsche calledthem thoughts out of season and Tagore his straybirds  They may be little nothings but they are alsofull of pith and vinegar if youll pardon the lisp  Ithink therefore I am said Descartes to which onemight add I think therefore I epigr am  Epigrammingis a form of word play or thought play whichevolved from epitaphs on tombstones  Because of thematerial on which it was inscribed the message had tobe brief and literally to the point  O rare Ben Jonsonreads the poets inscription on his tomb at WestminsterAbbey  What would you like to put on yours  Endingsare a good place to start            As Roger Wescott has shown in a  articleepigrams also evolved from proverbs and adages  Thedifference is that these earlier forms were inclined totake themselves seriously while epigrams or aphorismsare more frequently reflexive and satirical  Eventhough some epigrams are rhymed they are not to beconfused with poetry or even blank verse  Poems relyon narrative imagery to evoke feelings while epigramsfocus on contradictions to provoke thought  The explosivetension of the epigram serves to focus consciousnesswhile the opennness of poetic imagery serves todilate consciousness            In my own case writing epigrams may be a congenitaldefect since it was my fathers preferred stylein several of his books  I started writing them in myteens and in  I launched a magazine calledThoughts For All Seasons The Magazine of Epigrams TFAS   The first issue of Thoughts came out in  abicentennial year  The second issue celebrated GeorgeOrwells   The current issue marks the bicentennialof the Bill of Rights and the French Revolution  Itis also Pitirim Sorokins centennial  Our quincentennialissue will appear in  and the general themewill be the discovery and rediscovery of America            Sorokin has been called the worlds greatest sociologistbut he was also a master satirist  We live in asatirical age after all and epigrams are the perfectvehicle for social satire  Consistent with Sorokins cyclicaltheory of social change our time bears an uncannyresemblance to the first century AD when aRoman named Martial was penning his epigramsConceal a flaw and the world will imagine theworst  You ask what a nice girl will do  She wontgive an inch but she wont say no  Youll get nolaurel crown for outrunning a burro  You puff thepoets of other days the living you deplore spare methe accolade your praise is not worth dying for            Although epigrams are usually sorted into contentcategories I am going to attempt a semantic andstructural taxonomy  Although my classification systemdoes not apply to all the epigrams I have seen orpublished it does seem to include most of them  As weshall see many epigrams fall into more than one categorybut the categories themselves are conceptuallydistinct              SEMANTICS            a  Satirical Definitions            The most systematic example of this form may befound in The Devils Dictionary  by Ambrose BierceThe following examples however are all TFAS originalsadult a fossil childanorexic a vegetarian who doesnt eat vegetablescondoms where the rich folks liveconsistency a form of ritualismdeviance something in the eye of the beholderfate an unconscious choicegrantsmanship a form of panhandling in which theparticipants are very well dressedmarriage friendship put to the testnuclear family an explosive deviceobstetrics a system of religious belief based on theassumption that pregnancy is a disease and thatnatural birth must be prevented at all costsoptimist someone who waxes his skis in preparationfor the Nuclear WinterZen the highest form of unconsciousness                        b  Comparisons            This type of epigram involves an association betweenthings which have no apparent connection  For exampleScatology and eschatology are often hard to distinguishsince they both deal with end productsOlympics triumph of the human spirit or tyrannyof the performance principleTell me what you remember of your life beforebirth and I will tell you what to expect in yourlife after deathIn the primitive world there was human sacrificeNow we have elective surgeryIt is natural to be concerned about what televisiondoes to children  But does anyone care what itdoes to the actors                        c  Counterpoint            Epigrammatists frequently take old saws and standthem on their heads or give them a new twist whichchanges the meaning  Ambrose Bierce defined an adageas boned wisdom for weak teeth the challengeto the epigrammatist is to put some teeth into itBlessed are the meek for they shall be given safeseats behind the pillarsOf course we should love our enemies  They teachus to be resolute relentless and resourcefulThese are my three RsPower corrupts not only those who wield it butalso those who are subservient to itChildren who are seen and not heard grow up tobe dumbBetter to give than to receive because you get atax writeoff for itA penny saved is an indication of

seeking employment in a circusIf I have not seen far it is because I stood on theshoulders of midgetsIts OK to search for the truth just makedamned sure you dont find it                          STRUCTURE            a  Repetition            One of the characteristics of both proverbs and aphorismsis repetition of syllabic structure  If the onset of aphrase is repeated we have alliterationHome is where the hooks areIf chivalry is here can chauvinism be far behindIt takes two to tango but any limp loner canlimboAs the prig is bent so is the prude inclinedThe deprived soon became the depraved                        When the nucleus of a phrase is repeated we haveassonanceBe fruit flies and multiplyThe evil eye is the seeing eye which has been denied                        When the coda is repeated we have what Wescottcalls reliteration            Some say the world is evil but I say it is oval            And when both assonance and reliteration occur wehave rhymeNeither a borrower nor a lender be plays holyhell with the economyPerhaps its boredom that causes whoredomInstead of a Reign of Terror we now have a reignof error                        b  Substitution            Substitution of sounds syntax or meaning also occursin many epigrams  When two words have identicalspellings but different meanings we have a homonymAn autoerotic is someone who fondles strange carsTeenage pregnancy ends in child laborTo retire with a modicum of dignity a little jack isnecessaryWhere theres a will theres a hopeful relative                        When two words sound the same but are spelled differentlywe have a homophone  Obviously homophonesusually need to be written in order to make sense butlets experiment with the following anywayHebrew a Jewish tea favored by menPatience is for patientsFemale socialization is a case of guise and dollsI was browsing through Bartletts yesterday and Ifound PereAll good carnivores begin meals by first mutteringLet us preyI regret that I have but one asterisk for my country                        Other substitutions do not qualify as either homonymsor homophones but they are interesting nonethelessEither a letter or an entire word or phrase may besubstituted as followsMay the farce be with youA barfing dog never bitesEvery cloud has a silly lining forthcomingBeware of Greeks bearing TurksCondoms are a girls best friend forthcomingA wise man and his Moonie are soon partedDiscretion is the better part of pallorProLife vs ProChoice Fetalists vs FatalistsI almost became a bornagain Christian but I wasswept away by the titheDo not ask God for anything simply thank Her forwhat She gives us                        c  Transposition and Contraction            Finally the words of a wellknown saying may betransposed or the entire phrase may be contracted tocreate new meaningsSure time wounds all heels but the good guys gettheir lumps as wellHe who laughs lasts                        In Wescotts view the age of miniaturization hasgiven epigrams a new lease on life  Look around youthey are everywhere  I understand that graffiti havebeen eliminated from the New York subway systembut we find them in abundance on Tshirts bumperstickers and bathroom walls as well as in a variety ofwork settings  They are personal statements even ifthey are not original and they are a way of talkingback to the Establishment that great generalizedother which intimidates and bores us at the same timeDown with jargon  Long live the lapidary art ofepigramming  Writing after all is one of the bestforms of exercise good for body and soul  But I wouldalso like to think that there may be a few Martialsamong the contributors to Thoughts For All Seasons and that their quips will continue to delight or offendlong after they are gone                              More than  dogs to flood Ryon Park during competitionHeadline in the Lompoc California Record   Submitted by
