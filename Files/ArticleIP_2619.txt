                                 Casino Hollywood            Heres a short course in theeconomics of the movie industry Never have so many invested so much for solittle At a time when American corporations in general are enjoyinghistorically large profit margins and doubledigit annual growth ratesHollywood confronts stagnant sales declining viewership and astonishingly lowprofit margins The usual suspectsinflated salaries inattention to costsand competition from other mediacan be blamed for some of the industryswoes But in large part Hollywoods troubles are an object lesson in whathappens when shortterm gambling replaces longterm planning            Considerthe recent announcement that MetroGoldwynMayers current ownersbillionaireKirk Kerkorian and Australian media magnate Kerry Stokeswill offer percent of the company to the public later this year The IPO is expected toraise close to  million Although any number of Wall Street execs counseledMGM against going public this soon Goldman Sachs actually refused tounderwrite the IPO because it thought the deal was too hasty the studio wantsto reap the benefits of the bull market it also wants the cash as quickly aspossible In inimitable Hollywood fashion the IPO is scheduled to coincidewith the release date of Tomorrow Never Dies  the studios new JamesBond film because MGM figures that the free publicity will boost the stockprice            The painful truth is that the studio is probably rightabout the impact of the Bond film on the IPO because the residual glamour ofthe movies is the only reason one could justify investing in MGM Thecompany is marketing itself as the only pure play movie investment sinceother public companies that make movies are also involved in nonfilmbusinesses Unfortunately its not clear that the pure play aspect of thecompany is a plus Its especially dubious when one considers that MGM hasreleased just one film Hoodlum  since Kerkorian and Stokes bought thecompany in October  Eleven months is a long time to go without cash flowwhen youve got hundreds of millions of dollars a year in overhead costsTomorrow Never Dies had better be a big hit            Thisreliance on the success of one or two films is unique to MGM and to thisyearthe studio should have a full slate again in but it does epitomizethe industrys new dependence on blockbusters This year nine summer picturescost close to  million each three more behemoths will open by ChristmasThe only real successes among the summer releases were Men in Black Air Force One  and The Lost World  But the size of thosesuccesses is worth keeping in mind In domestic receipts alone Sony shouldclear  million on Men in Black and close to  million on AirForce One  while Universal took home around  million for The LostWorld  Toss in foreign sales video and merchandising and the profits areenough to fund an entire studios output for six months            The equation here is simple enough and helpsexplain why the million thriller has become a thing of the past If you canearn a percent return on your investment its better to invest  millionthan  million And even if you miss three out of every five times you stillmay bring home enough from the two hits to stay profitable In addition thelack of accountability that dominates Hollywood encourages the managerialpursuit of selfinterest A studio executive who wants to safeguard hislifestyle has to be more interested in the size of the studios productionbudget than in the bottom line In other words he lives better losing money on million in sales than he would making money on  million            Conventional wisdom has it that this embrace of the blockbuster represents theultimate triumph of commerce over art dooming American movies to mediocrityAs director Rob Reiner put it The studios arent in the business of puttingon shows but turning out product And you cant make films as product Butthere are a couple of rather gaping holes in this thesis The first is that ifmovies are all about making money now theyre doing a very bad job of it Oneanalyst recently estimated that the return on capital in the industry is around percent The second is that the glory days of classic Hollywood cinema wereprecisely the days when the studios were most run like factories churning out aproduct The vertical integration of the studio system mimicked the verticalintegration of the auto and steel industries as did the hierarchical chain ofcommand MGM directors writers and actors made the films they were told tomake or else they were suspended And the movie industry was more popularandmore profitablethan it has been since            In addition almost all the philistinism for whichHollywood is attacked todaythe reliance on big stars the tendency to mimicrather than to innovate the reliance on sequelswas characteristic ofHollywoods heyday as well MGM was known for having more stars than heavenWhen Gone With the Wind was in production other studios rushed to findother antebellum epics And as far as sequels go the Batman series doesntcompare with MGMs Andy Hardy series or Abbott and Costello who starred inseven hits during  and             Whatsreally different is not the quality of the films but the control that thestudios exercise over them Before  studios owned  percent of firstrunurban theaters which meant that they were in charge of productiondistribution and exhibition At the same time the studios used theiroligopolistic power to force independent theater owners to screen B films ifthey also wanted to screen A films That ensured a reliable flow of profitsfrom movies that cost very little to make But a series of antitrust decisionsafter World War II ended these practices and forced the studios to divestthemselves of their theater holdings while also encouraging the development ofindependent production companies That in turn made most creative people inHollywood independent contractors And the studios became more involved infinancing and distribution than in production            None of these on their own were necessarilybad developments The independentproducer system fostered competition whichtheoretically should have increased efficiency Creative people were freer tofollow their hearts The studios started to look something like publishinghouses You could argue in fact that the renaissance American moviesexperienced in the early s was only possible because of these newarrangements But in the long run the disappearance of steady revenue fromlowercost productions and the lack of any permanent relationship between thestudios and the people making the movies made highpriced gambling alogicalif disastrouschoice Because every film is a oneshot everyoneinvolved has a stake in it being as big a shot as possible This is hardly arecipe for sustained growth In the simplest terms no one is doing longtermplanning because everyones trying to make the next deal            Still its worthremembering that as late as  the studios were still reaping huge profitsIts only in the last  years in fact that weve seen a meteoric rise in thecosts of both production and marketing In one sense this is the fullflowering of the death of the studio system and the triumph of purelyspeculative capitalism In another sense its part of whats been called thewinnertakeall society where those on top command more and more resourcesand those in the middle tend to disappear But what it isnt is a rational wayto run an industry Its not commerce that rules in Hollywood Its justexcess
