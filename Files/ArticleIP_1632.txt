questionedwhether Einstein truly discovered the idea or whether the honor goes toGttingen mathematician David Hilbert who submitted a paper on the subjectfive days before Einstein turned in his work Though Einsteins paper waspublished first Hilbert maintained that he was the first to have solved somekey field equations Einstein furious charged Hilbert with plagiarismEinstein was right Hilberts proofs found this July at the Max Planck Institute inBerlin reveal that crucial steps were missing at the time of his submissionwhich were filled in only after Einsteins paper came out In an article inScience  the research team that scrutinized the drafts concludes thatHilbert revised his paper in response to Einsteins work Its the second bigblow to Hilberts legacy His audacious attempt to ground all mathematics in afinite number of axioms was upended by Gdels incompleteness theorem in                           MineKampf                        A Britishmining concern has discovered that
