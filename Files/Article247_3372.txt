                                 The Poverty of Theory                        The question How much of Bells vision of a postindustrial society hascome to pass is freighted in all sorts of subtle ways Looking over your ownsummary of his  projections of what US society in the year  wouldlook like one would say that they were by and large pretty prescient ButBell himself disclaimed the role of futurologist I am writing he said anas if a fiction a logical construction of what could be againstwhich the future social reality can be compared in order to see what intervenedto change society in the direction it did take And what was his originalmotivation in constructing this asif scenario He wanted to understand howanother sociological theorist went wrong in predicting social change KarlMarx            Though he is often wrongly lumped with the neocons today Bell is in hisbones an Old Left intellectual He joined the youth of the Socialist Party in at the age of  and his first book published in  tried to explainwhy no Marxian socialist movement took root in the United States Thedistressing thing for intellectuals of a Marxian bent is the failure of Marxsscenario for the collapse of capitalism as presented in Volume I ofCapital  to come true What was the fatal flaw in Marxs scheme forexplaining structural changes in society as a consequence of increasingconflict between two classes the capitalists and the proletariat whoseidentities were determined by the industrial mode of production            The answer it is generally thought has something to do with the emergenceof a third classthe managers technocrats white collars symbolicanalysts or whatever you want to call themthat is neither capitalist norproletarian Bell who actually made it through Volume III of Capital discovered that Marx himself foresaw this possibility as he observed the growthof an investmentbanking system in the late th century But Marxthought that the whitecollar workers would eventually become proletarianizedbecause of the alienating division of office labor and the depreciation oftheir value through free public education He was wrong            How did Bell propose to save Marx By decoupling as he puts it the twodimensions of technology and social relations which Marx had conceptuallyunified According to Bell changes in the one do not determine changes in theother for example the United States is capitalist and the Soviet Union wascollectivist but both were industrial So in Bells sociology they aretreated as independent variables            I think that is why I find Bell so much less interesting a theorist thanMarx Marxs theory of social change was based on a simple and seeminglypowerful premise The material mode of production determines everything else insociety History has falsified that premise Bell wants to salvage the theoryby introducing distinctions and complications He insists that we talk about atechnoeconomic system  a political order  a culturalsphere  with an axial principle running through them allthecodificacation of theoretical knowledge            I find it very hard to see how Bells forecasts about the future prescientas they may be flow from this rather inert theory obtained by weakening thatof Marx I understand what it means for a prediction of Bells to be wronglike his prediction that inflation would become a permanent feature of thepostindustrial economy But I wouldnt know how to go about falsifying histheory of social change It has too many degrees of freedom as it were Itseems to fail Karl Poppers criterion for being scientific            And I seem David to have completely evaded your very reasonable questionWhat part of Bells postindustrial society has come to pass Please steer meback to the real world
