        so do you do any   well its kind of i do when i dont uh i go i go in spurts unfortunately i cant get as as regular and dedicated as as i probably should   yeah yeah well its its hard to get uh its hard to maintain a a real level of uh i dont know what youd call it i guess motivation at least for me it is i mean   where where you where you are youd probably have to you know the weather probably doesnt cooperate with you you so you would have to belong to a gym or something and   yeah i actually i lift weights pretty regular now and ive done it for the last oh i dont know ten twelve years so it works pretty well for me but still its like you say the motivation is not always there especially in the cold weather   yeah yeah   and im not real used to the cold up here anyway just because im from Florida really   oh gosh  that was a shock i bet   so yeah a bit a bit so uh but i dont know its its good to get it you get that good feeling you know when you get done and and youre glad you did it i guess but um   well growing up i was always um fairly athletic and always um you know i didnt really have to think about an exercise routine because i was always doing something that more or less required exercise   right sure   but um ive been in a job lately where ive been working some really long hours and some nights and weekends and   uhhuh that makes it rough because then   it makes you you lose every bit of  muscle tone you ever thought about having and then to try to work your way back from that is  is why i cant really get   sure yeah thats   ill start up and ill do pretty religiously and then ill have to work till midnight one night or something and then  you know   right and that just screws up your whole schedule   oops are you there oh i dont know what that was   yeah oh wow youre sounding a lot clearer now   i think theres some wrong with the phone or something i think sometimes when they connect it up it it doesnt work right or or somethings not exactly right   oh yeah thats pretty weird um but yeah i i dont know i i do a lot of stuff or i at least i have in the past done a lot of weird a lot of different activities um and moving down here is is in a way kind of or moving up here is pretty bad because i cant do as much as i used to because the weather just doesnt permit it you know so   yeah sure i mean like if your favorite thing is swimming  youd have to join a you know a some club that has a pool and then you have to fight the crowds and that sort of thing   exactly and and it is you know i mean exactly  its just a hassle at time   everybody i know that belongs to a health club here in Dallas the better ones are always crowded at the times when youd be more sure you know more likely to use it like right after work or   sure everybody gets off of work   you know during lunch hours or you know right before work and that sort of thing so people end up exercising at really odd hours and i cant exercise you know late at night because it keeps me awake   right umhum sure oh yeah   i mean you know once you you know ive got i bought myself a one of these little um they call it a cross trainer or something like that its got um   kind of like a Soloflex or something   yeah its got uh and its got a stair climber and its got the the kind of bench and you can do the leg lifting things and the the bench press thing and its got a butterfly thing and   umhum oh thats good   you know its got a lot of different stuff on it and i mainly got it because you know like i say since ive gotten so out of shape and everything i forget and ill do something   yeah     not thinking about that i dont have the muscle to do it anymore and i injured my rotator cuff on one arm really badly and the doctor was kind of like well you know youre gonna have to   uh right uh oh learn to take it easy   get some yeah get some build up some muscle tone in in your upper arms or its gonna always be a problem and it might have to be operated on and you know all this kind of stuff so   right   you know i i got this machine to try to because i i one thing i did kind of keep up doing was i like to walk   uhhuh   and i like to ride my bicycle so when the weathers okay you know i can do that but um you know having to   sure   do something for the shoulder or the arm or something i i had to get a machine to do that and so i have it in my house because i know if i had to get home from work change clothes and go somewhere to a club i just wouldnt do it   right uhhuh right yeah it itd be too much of a hassle   and when when youre working really hard and you come in the door you dont wanna turn around and go back out again  i mean i have enough trouble you know just doing i do a lot of volunteer work and     yeah oh you do   and some stuff like that it its all i can do just to force myself to turn around and go back out and do that kind of stuff   uhhuh   so you know   yeah it when im living in Florida im im an intern up here at Honeywell and when i live in Florida its its a lot easy you know its it everythings nice out and my parents live down there now and my dads been getting into roller blading lately he roller blades all around the i dont know if thats popular where youre at   it
