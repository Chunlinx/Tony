                                 The Sidewalk Nursery            I am impressed by thevariety of activities in addition to walking that I observe taking place onthe sidewalks in my neighborhood These activities seem to have increased a lotin say the last  years            I supposeI first became aware of this with the appearance of the Walkman I saw more andmore people walking around or jogging with earphones on They were listeningto something apparentlyprobably music More recently I have been struck bythe smoking There were always people smoking on the sidewalk but now thereare clusters of people around the entrance to every office building standingtalking to each other and smoking cigarettes Then came the cellphonespeople walking around holding these little gadgets to an earapparently talking to someone Finally to this has been added theproliferation of sidewalk drinking I dont mean drinking in the sense oftaking in alcoholic beverages These people are drinking coffee soft drinksor bottled water Water water everywhere being carried if not beingdrunk            The smoking is easy to explain Increasingly offices evenwhole office buildings ban smoking So those who feel a great need to smoke godown to the sidewalk What is harder for me to explain is the great number ofwomen in these smoking groups Do women have more of a need to smoke or less ofa need to be in their offices or are there just more women than men working inthese buildings Studies show that addiction to smoking is inversely related toincome low income people are more likely to smoke than high income peopleProbably the women working in those buildings have lower incomes on theaverage than the men            But how toexplain the listening to music on the sidewalk the talking on the telephonethe drinking of water Of course technology has a lot to do with it Even inthe case of water the technology is important If there werent lightweightunbreakable plastic bottles there wouldnt be so much water drinking            But these technological innovations would nothave spread so far if they did not meet a demand There must have been a strongdesire to listen to music while walking or jogging on the sidewalk Yet thereason for this desire is not clear The people I see with their headphones ondont seem to be very happy about what they are hearing Instead of listeningto music they could be looking at the other people on the sidewalk or mullingover private thoughts            What arethose people talking about on their cell phones I have a cell phone that Itake with me in my car when I remember in case I need roadside help I haveused it only a few times to see if it was working I have never walked alongon the sidewalk with it held to my ear Maybe all these peoplemostly men butI have seen a few women at it alsoare calling their brokers to find out howrich they are or more recently how poor they are I suppose the cell phone ispart of the information revolution that holds great promise for us but no onehas ever demonstrated any addition to productivity resulting from theavailability of cell phones            Ihave been told that the use of water bottles has somethingto do with the cult of physical fitness Physical fitness requires the intakeof lots of fluids But those fluids could be taken at home from the kitchenfaucet Anyway many of the people I observe do not look as if they weredevoted to physical fitness And still they hold on to their bottle            Bottle Bottle Maybe thatsthe clue These are people who do not want to give up their bottletheirnursing bottle They want to remain in or return to their infancy when thenursing bottle was the cure for all discomfort and anxiety The water bottle isa surrogate for the nursing bottle which was a surrogate for Mommy            The cellphone fits into the same story It is the way of keeping contact with someoneanyone who will reassure you that you are not alone You may think you arechecking on your portfolio but deep down you are checking on your existence Irarely see people using cell phones on the sidewalk when they are in thecompany of other people It is being alone that they cannot stand And for manypeople being alone really means being without Mommy We are raising ageneration that had radio transmitters in its nurseries keeping Mommyconstantly informed of every movement of the baby in his crib We will soon bewalking around with transmitters in our lapels or pocketbooks constantlyconnected via satellite with Mommy And for those whose mothers are no longeravailable there will be constant contact with the Bureau of Mommy Surrogates inthe Department of Health and Human Services            And what kind of music are those pedestriansand joggers listening to on their Walkmans Music with a clear and steady beatmuch like the lullabies that comforted them as infants            So itall fits The Walkman the cell phone the water bottle are efforts to regainthe warmth and comfort of infancy and find relief from the loneliness ofadulthood This need is surely not new I remember the epigraph of James TFarrells book Studs Lonigan  which I read more than  years ago            Alone andafraid            In a world I nevermade            Modern technologytheWalkman the cell phone and the plastic bottlehas given us new ways to tryto deal with this old feeling There are probably worse ways
