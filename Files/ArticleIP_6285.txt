                                 White and Dark            Conversion narrativestalesof evil reactionary or addicted people who reformshare one complicatingtrait Their protagonists tend to be more compelling in the throes of theirparticular depravity than after they come to their senses In rare cases thatirony is underlined as in Drugstore Cowboy  in which the titlecharacter Matt Dillon stops using drugs and seems suddenly smaller and morevulnerableand easy prey for the freaks he had previously dominated Butmainstream cinema which insists on heroes who are both square and hip has atough time exploring the paradox that virtue is a great charisma killer Itscertainly unexplored in American History X  in which Edward Norton playsa racist homicidal skinhead whos never more mythically transfixing than inthe seconds before he stomps on the neck of a prone AfricanAmerican car thiefWhen he returns from prison to his Venice Beach Calif home with his hairgrown back and his bloodlust replaced by an air of wary contemplation both heand the movie shrink to the proportions of a TV set            Some ofAmerican History X is sharp redmeat melodrama with sensational actingand scenes of violence at once thrillingly kinetic and revolting But the filmhas the soul of a guidance counselor and whenever it seems poised to go whereno commercial American picture has gone beforeto a place where our responsesare gummed up where we can grasp simultaneously the horror and the allure ofthe white supremacist movementit snaps back into easy moralizingdemonization and naive notions of how people change Its a frustrating pieceof workmuch too vivid to laugh off too psychologically elided to takeseriously            What it has is Norton who is a stunning pictorial objectIn the opening blackandwhite sequence his Derek Vinyard gets interrupted inthe throes of animalistic sex with his girlfriend Stacey Fairuza Balk by hisyounger brother Danny Edward Furlong who tells him that two black men arestealing the familys van Clad only in boxers and boots and with a huge thickswastika tattooed over his heart he snatches a revolver and charges into thestreet The camera hugs his long torso and ropy muscles starkly white againstthe black of the sky he seems stripped down to pure hatred            Norton isan amazing actor a hotdog whose delight in transformation is infectiousHere he curls his body into a sneer and hes probably the only white man inmovies whos wiry enough to trounce a bunch of black guys on a basketball courtand not leave the audience snickering in incredulity Better yet Norton givesDerek a mind as keen as it is caustic Confronting his mothers liberal Jewishdate Elliott Gould at the dinner table he drives home the point that RodneyKing was a multiple felon high on PCP who could easily have run over a childbefore the Los Angeles cops stopped him on the highway You say black peopleneed affirmative action to overcome historical injustice Lincoln freedthe slaves  years ago he inveighs How long does it take to get their acttogether Compare Norton to Tom Cruise in the early scenes of Born on theFourth of July  in which the actor telegraphs like crazy that hischaracters jingoistic declarations are bull Norton rants convincingly like aman whose rage has taken on a runaway life of its own            He is meant of course to be a lost soulDereks father was a fireman killed by a black drug dealer while battling ablaze in a crack den Now the young man has found a substitute dad in CameronStacy Keach a glowering fount of white supremacist hate literature who useshis protg to enlist and incite other youths American History                Xreaches a pinnacle of ghastliness when Cameron sends Derek and his fellowskinheads into a Koreanpurchased supermarket the new owner of which hasallegedly replaced real Americans with cheap illegal immigrant labor Theassaultan orgy in which fixtures are smashed workers pummeled and aHispanic cashier pinned to a conveyer belt and doused with milk She lookswhiteis terrifying not just because its sadistic but also because itssadism is suffused with righteousness            Sequencesof Derek as a skinhead are flashbacks and shot in febrile blackandwhite Thepresent is in less arresting color with a framing device thatsgroaninducingly earnest The day before his brother is due to be released fromprison the nowskinheaded Danny responds to a highschool assignment to writean essay about a civil rights leader with a paper on Hitlers MeinKampf  The scholarly patrician black principal Avery Brooks threatensthe boy with expulsion unless he delivers a substitute essay the following dayan analysis of his brothers crime and its impact on both their family andsociety A paper Assigned by a fairminded black principal with twodoctorates Can we skew the case any more please Brooks the bulwark ofliberal humanism at the furthest reaches of the galaxy on the stultifying TVseries Star Trek Deep Space Nine  is too comfortable droppinghightoned pronouncements such as Your rhetoric and your propaganda arentgoing to save you And when Derek gets out of prison we see that theprincipal has reached him toothat hes ready to exchange a dark white fatherfor a white dark father            For the movies writer David McKenna and director TonyKaye the universe consists of white supremacists and liberals with no one ofnote in between and the protagonists prison metamorphosis from one pole tothe other is the natural consequence of falling afoul of some big Nazi whiteguys and getting tight with a garrulous congenial black inmate Guy Torryduring laundry detail I wish it were more complicated and that the Mr NiceGuy who gets out of prison had more to say than How did I buy into this shitI was pissed off The struggle for his kid brothers soul turns out to be nostruggle at all And in light of his conversion Dereks former supremacistchums obligingly turn into hissing vampires snarling at his expressions oftolerance as if theyve just been flashed the crucifix and sprayed with holywater Kaye clinches the case by showing Derek in the shower having a vision ofhimself and his brother as innocent children on the beach staring inwonderment at seagulls            A Brit whomade his fortune with glossy commercials Kaye was apparently unsatisfied withthe cut of the picture he turned in and at last report was holed up in theChateau Marmont issuing proclamations of the films inadequacy I dont knowwhat he originally had in mindor whose idea the garish inconclusive endingwasbut American History X isnt that bad Kaye has a punchy way withmontage and the script has at least one card up its sleeve the climacticrevelation that Dereks revered fireman dad William Russ was himself a racistwho urged his son at the dinner table not to get too cozy with niggers or theirliterature Its a testament to Nortons utter immersion in the role that hecan even halfway connect the dots between this fundamentally sweet brainy kidand the magnetic white trash monster wholl haunt our minds long after themovies liberal pieties fade into static            Life Is Beautiful written and directed by andstarring Italian Roberto Benigni he starred in Down by Law   haswon international acclaim for wedding sentimental Chaplinesque slapstick to astory that finishes up in a concentration camp with Jews being gassed androasted In principle Im all for flouting hobgoblinish rules of consistencyand I think that farcea violent genre that feeds on desperationis oftenwasted on trivial conflicts Dario Fos play Accidental Death of anAnarchist proved that the Grouchoesque clown could be an anarchic avengerdriving fascists to apoplexy and Lina Wertmullers Seven Beauties however gross and hamhanded at least suggested that a concentrationcamp could function as a legitimate setting for a blackcomic parable about aparasites struggle to survive at all costs            But Benignis movie made mewant to throw up He has cast himself as a prankish Jew who wins the heart of apretty maiden Nicoletta Braschi fathers a cute skinny boy and gets cartedoff by the Nazis to a death camp The conceit is that Benigni tries to keep theyearold from realizing whats going on by pretending that the whole thing isa game and that if the boy gets through it without crying or complaining hewins a tank In an essay in the New York Times  Edward Rothstein refersto the enchantment of fascism being undone by other spells some recallingthe innocence of childhoodand indeed Benignis routines are sometimeschildishly liberating conjuring up Fo Harpo Marx and Danny Kaye in hisdoubletalk mode It halfworks right up to the point where people startgetting gassed and then Benignis moisteyed heroism and tenacious faith inhis own irresistibility start to seem like a monstrous ego tripa clownsmegalomania            Jerry Lewisspeaking ofmegalomaniatried something similar in the s with a film about a clown wholeads a group of laughing tots into the death chamber The picture reportedlyended with a shot of black smoke coming out of the stackbut well never knowbecause The Day the Clown Cried was judged too obscene to be releasedand Lewis went back to parading doomed kids across the TV screen in telethonswhile Americans goggled at his stamina and senators nominated him for theNobel Peace Prize I wish Life Is Beautiful had fallen into the sameblack hole Its subject isnt the power of enchantment but the power ofBenigni to celebrate Jerry Lewislike his own beautiful martyrdom ImagineHarpo Marx giving the hot foot to a pompous official who takes out a machinegun and blows him away Thats how cheap Benignis hash of farce and tragedyis Its a gas all right
