        let me ask you do you think the Soviet Union is a still a threat to the United States     do you know i dont know what to think i i the person i am i want to believe that its an honest effort i want to believe that that they really are trying to change that that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society and i i want to believe its all okay   uhhuh   but then theres that side of me that says  yeah but theyve put on faces before   right   and never to this extent though you know so so its like there is a struggle within me going do do i be open minded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality you know i i trust people ill do that   uhhuh   or do i keep on going well well wait and see   well i think theres a a struggle within the Soviet Union um i think  the people are are just fed up and i think its showing in all the republics trying to gain their independence and i think uh  thats making Gorbachev and others realize that hey maybe this Communist thing isnt working   yeah that its not just American uh or western society telling you it its it doesnt work   right   you know  theyve always said you know the the Soviet people were united we believe this and maybe theyre seeing that no no hey we dont believe this you know   thats right i think   but its still you know i guess i keep that one part of me thats like well i dont know i want to trust them and i its like i cant and maybe its because you know weve had our own propaganda over the years i dont know   well that that could be you know what i we always we think of the KGB and we think such bad things you know but i wouldnt doubt if the Soviet people think CIA and they think such bad things you know   and they probably do the same things   exactly exactly they do   you think the CIA doesnt spy im sure they do   oh yeah they do you know   now the difference is we dont i dont i dont think we take people and kill them just because they dont believe what we believe you know i think to that extent we dont go as far but im sure they lie you know   oh yeah oh absolutely thats part of that propaganda thing and i think if we can get away from that or if we can keep that out of our minds  ah excuse me ive got a cold today   so thats all right i hope you get better   thank you um i think if we can get that propaganda thing because im sure both countries are seeing seeing it you know thinking KGB and CIA and all that but uh   yeah   just on an economic point of view if the Soviet Union doesnt do something fast theyre they aint gonna be able to feed their people this this winter you know but   yeah yeah thats true   but on the other hand im kind of getting fed up with uh our own country and presidency ah always  concerning themselves with other nations problems when we have so many at home yet   and im not against them being concerned but i feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own   right   you know i mean you know any any country that wants to be democratic im all for helping them you know because i i understand that you know youre looking at United States as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government   right   but at the same time  i agree i dont think we can do it and and just you know turn our backs or or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here   thats right you know weve got uh weve got quite a few domestic problems that uh that i feel we ought to be concentrating more on i think the problem is and on the international scope maybe the president feels that uh you know for long term relations with all these countries its important and well well always well always have the United States and you know we need to solve these international problems but um ive think i heard in the news about last week sometime that uh the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on them on a domestic issue because the American publics kind of getting fed up with it   yeah we we we believe in what hes doing abroad but but like you said theres issues here too   right   and  but i i am encouraged by whats happening in the Soviet Union im encouraged by whats happened in you know the the iron curtain countries you know in in that block and   right   and i think its moved in the right direction i now i think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight you know its not going to it didnt happen here overnight and it didnt happen here without a struggle   yep no thats right thats right   you know and i i think sometimes we forget that but i i id i have to say yes im you know im encouraged by the way its going uh   well i think uh   uh   i think in the long
