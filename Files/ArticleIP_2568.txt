                                 Golden Days            I do not propose to enterthe dialogue between Dinesh DSouza and EJ Dionne about who causedthe golden age America is now said to be enjoying The subject baffles me Idont see the chain of causation by which the specific acts of specificpoliticians are supposed to have led to the results noted today If I dontknow what caused the babys death I cant begin to think about whether the aupair Reagan Clinton did it            I wouldlike to offer some musings on another kind of golden condition I refer tothe golden days of private individuals Between the golden days of individualsand those of nations the connection is I believe quite loose In sayingthat I mean to exclude the Holocaust the Great Depression and total war aswell as people who are exceptionally vulnerable But within the usual range ofvariation of the national condition the difference between a golden nationalage and a notsogolden national age is for most people unimportant when itcomes to achieving a personal golden day            If I had to describe the salient characteristic of apersonal golden day in one word I would say peace That is the ultimateblessing in the key JudeoChristian benediction May the Lord bless you andkeep you may He lift up the light of his countenance upon you and give youpeace I understand peace in this context to mean not the absence ofinternational violence or not only that but a persons peace with himselfwith his idea of how he should behave It includes loving and being loved andaccepting and appreciating the universe and what man has created in it            I cannotgive a general prescription for achieving golden days but I can give twoexamples from my own experience to suggest what some of the ingredients in sucha prescription might be            About two months ago I was sitting on thebench at my usual bus stop at Connecticut Avenue and K Street when a policemanescorted a girl or young woman I couldnt tell which across the street andseated her next to me She was obviously blind carrying a long white cane andkeeping her eyes screwed shut She could hear the buses coming up to the stopbut didnt know which buses they were so I began telling her their numbers Itturned out that she was waiting for the bus that I was waiting for the No Since she was so anxious about the coming of our bus I asked her whether shehad an appointment She said that she was going to a class at George WashingtonUniversity and the professor had warned the students not to come in late            I thought of putting her ina taxi or taking her to her class in a taxi It would not have cost much ButI was afraid that she would think I was trying to kidnap or molest herTheres a comment on our golden age            At lastour bus came and I helped her up the steps She indicated that I should sitnext to her and tell her when we came to her stop At the stop I helped herdown the steps and the driver kept the door open for me to get back on thebus But it was clear that once she was on the sidewalk she had no idea ofwhere to go I motioned to the bus driver to close the doors took her by thehand and led her along G Street to the university building she sought Alongthe way she told me that she had just graduated from Smith College and wasdoing postgraduate work in international relations When I left her at herbuilding she thanked me but I said that it was I who had to thank her becauseshe had given me the great feeling of being needed            That little incident made my day and several days tofollow golden I had done a deed of lovingkindness Lovingkindness isdifferent from charity charity can be done with money but lovingkindnessrequires personal involvement Lovingkindness yields a greater reward to thegiver Sow according to your charity but reap according to yourlovingkindness Hosea  Writing taxdeductible checks to charitableinstitutions does not make my day golden the way holding that young girls handdid            On myother example of a golden day I was out for a walk in the sunshine and astranger on the street complimented me on an article of mine that had beenpublished in the morning paper Returning home a little tired but pleased thatI had been able to do the walk I lay down and turned on the radio which justhappened to be playing Mozarts Flute and Harp Concerto  I was elatedand knew that there were a few people whom I could tell of this feeling withconfidence that they would understand and share my joy That was a golden daybrought about by the beauty of nature and of art the feeling of achievementand of physical wellbeing relative to my age and the connection with afewone may be enoughsympathetic people            Golden days do not necessarily result fromextraordinary events They can result from ordinary events happening to peoplewho are receptive appreciative attuned to what is happening around them Apersons psychological and emotional stance not external events is whatmainly determines his possibility of enjoying a golden day            In my own case I think thatthree years ago I would not have experienced the golden days I have describedhere I would have been too shy or buttoned down to take that young girlshand and I would have been too absorbed with trivia to appreciate the thingsthat made me so happy a few weeks ago I suppose it is aging that has changedmy attitude To resume my economists hat scarcity confers value and therealization that ones days are few increases ones appreciation of theirvalue But one doesnt have to be old to appreciate that Even for the youngthe remaining days are few
