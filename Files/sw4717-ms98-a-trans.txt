        as far as news and uh keeping up with it i get a subscription to Time Newsweek and US News and World Report and i also stay in touch with CNN whenever theres something interesting happening in the world     uhhuh do you do you actually read all those magazines every week   oh God i get  a lot more than that those are just the news magazines that i get i barely have time i usually tear through um US News and World Report thats my least favorite i think i like Newsweek the most   uhhuh well i uh i  i keep up with whats going on by listening to the radio in the car and reading a newspaper daily newspaper and i i pretty much hardly ever uh see news on television   yeah i ive if youre near Boston uh i i remember hearing in the car we can pick up WBZ pretty good   yeah   out here in Rochester we i also get the morning paper here um we were Gannett town so we have a morning and a afternoon paper both owned by Gannett   right   i tend to read the morning paper just because its more breaking news i also listen to short wave depending upon what the world conditions are like   oh so you can pick up Radio Moscow or that sort of thing huh   oh yeah Radio Moscow it its gotten a lot stranger in the last several years its theyve added commercials and they have bad jingles and everything     so its pretty much like U S radio huh   well thats what theyre trying to emulate i think most people still head for the B B C World Service which uh i i like that for international news but sometimes it gets you know usually if something major happens now i head for CNN   yeah that um the B B C World Service is broadcast on the F M band in near the Boston area   oh yeah they have its its distributed through American Public Radio i guess and   by our public radio station   yeah they have a feed of that yeah you can also a lot of various CSPAN has an audio service   still   which transmits the BBC World Service twenty four hours a day you know i in the only problem with that i have with getting the news from a lot of these places is probably the worst lately has become the newspaper because i i just despise fluff journalism   umhum   you know i mean Iraq is bombed but no youre not going to see that today because heres Janey age five on the front page blowing bubbles you know   right or heres uh one presidential candidate candidate saying rude things about the other ones girlfriend or something yeah   yeah i it it you know the worst of them all is USA Today which is  i call it useless today the McPaper   right   its great   well they they um they have a pretty small vocabulary dont they they   oh yeah  its about the six grade its basically a newspaper for those that watch TV   yeah thats true its pretty tough to find objective objective straight forward news i mean the the BBCs got their own slant their basically you know theyre theyre i think theyre addressing their U S service to to Brits living here   but in yeah that thats pretty they have some pretty obscure international news i mean like coming up next a five minute report on Nepal you know   yeah they do they do good stuff on Nepal and South Africa you can get good stuff on and you know India and but its not necessarily close to stuff im looking for they tend to make fun of the U S a lot i think   oh yeah its they they have A Letter From America i think its Alastair Cooke         who um whos been doing that program forever who comments on what life in America is like and uh most British seem more amused than anything else   well  maybe theyre right what the heck       so yeah i i tend to we have cable here and that tends to be pretty good for news but i also have a satellite dish so i you can watch some pretty strange news things the feeds on there especially during uh the Iraqi war where you could hear the anchor people you know screaming four letter words poor Bernie Shaw   yeah do they um do do you use any electronic type news services like a you know computer network news services anything like that   um i i have a uh you know i i found out about the service on Comp Dcom Telecom so we have access to you know theres theres um Clara News and you can also get on CompuBucks and uh read the news wires on there which you know i appreciate that one if i want to search for a particular topic you know that i know     you subscribe to Clara Net service then   yeah well either that or you can go on Clara News and use it or im sorry uh CompuServe and use their executive news service if you want to follow you know certain key words and i use to do that when we were interested in following the cable industry you know you wouldnt see this stuff in the local paper   right yeah yeah we dont get the where i where i work i dont we dont get the Clara Net stuff
