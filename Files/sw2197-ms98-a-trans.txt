                okay were rolling i uh what what would you what would has your experience lead you to advise uh if my child were thinking of going to the Air Force Academy what would you say   id encourage it   umhum   its a good general education education education for a a bachelors degree   umhum umhum   and obviously and obviously its where they dont have a any post graduate program there but you get a an excellent wide uh basis of topics you know you get a good broad education out of it you dont they dont graduate the best engineers or the best English majors but   umhum umhum   maybe a graduate pretty good overall students out of there   umhum umhum umhum how do you feel about it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college how does that uh   um   how do you feel that is for someone at at that phase in their life   well the for some people its good because they maybe they need a little discipline need a little reining in at that that stage in their life uh other people it uh its   umhum   uh suffocating you know you kind of choke on it um   umhum umhum umhum umhum   it it depends on the person on the individual but uh the one factor i think   umhum   more than anything else in this day and age thats got to be a big factor in your decisions just the the cost of how much youre gonna pay   uhhuh   no matter where you go to school   uhhuh   and if youve been in for twelve years im sure youve youve got a your share of student loans that uh youre       probably going to be paying off or have been or   well i sort of one of the reasons its taken so long is ive been working uh you know its sort of half student half working and source of income and stuff so im actually managing to do this with zero debt   uhhuh oh thats good   uh i couldnt you you couldnt do it otherwise   oh yeah i mean i know people that graduated or that i went to high school with that went to civilian colleges and they theyve got twenty thirty thousand dollar debts i mean you could have uh   yeah i think if theres any major piece of advice id give is to find a way of getting an education that doesnt incur that kind of debt   yeah   its not i mean i remember seeing an article one time about you know if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in a a in an investment fund theyd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the  job theyd get after college so its its really kind of crazy   exactly its its staggering when you think that just here in central New York is uh Hamilton College is just a few miles south of you know maybe about twenty miles to the south from where i am and uh   umhum   theyre looking for twenty two thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now   really   a year   huh   at just a small i mean they they they are select it is a select college   yes yes i know i was actually i think i was thinking of trying to get a job there i heard of it   oh yeah but youre talking incredible tuitions now i dont know how many people actually pay the whole shot very few i would imagine but uh   umhum yeah   i get i i just couldnt imagine i mean its more money than i make in a year so  you know it you know me being one person with a above the median     yeah   income for New York state you know im a second im a second lieutenant in the Air Force now and uh   umhum umhum   i even even as a somebody making twice what i was making how could you put half of that into   umhum   to your childs education and then just when they make made make it to the college years its   yeah yeah   my God i cant imagine   well my my real feeling about about the purpose of undergraduate education is its really the time yes you do get an education you do learn some things but you eventually forget most of it   yes   but what you dont forget is the growing up its really the period when people become adults i mean people who dont go to college become adults in other ways but really its the entry into adulthood i think and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to   id   be fostered in as you become you know as you gain new social skills as you become you know more of a functioning member of society and maybe the Air Force Academy is appropriate as you said for someone who you know a more you know who needs to learn selfdiscipline and so forth would be appropriate for them   or or its also a good environment it may be good for someone who already has selfdiscipline who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own   yeah and want to develop that   and that yeah the same its the same it can benefit different people different ways but uh   umhum umhum umhum umhum   you know i i agree with that because i see people that i know a again from high school that i still keep in touch with that didnt go to college and   umhum umhum   they do the same old things they did in high school   the same patterns of behavior you mean yeah yeah   and same patterns of behavior same uh same socializing same exact crowd that they hang with and its like its like frozen time you know   exactly its kind i find it kind of sad i really do   it is it really is that they havent found anything anything better that um or their experiences havent been broadened at all that you know its a   umhum   its a tremendous thing when you sit in a in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions and you hear all these different sides of the story   yeah right   that you never thought of and uh thats another big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for different point differing points of view you know or different opinions   umhum umhum yeah in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems   yeah exactly       yeah   yeah the the one thing i think thats no good for anyone is these monster institutions these institutions of thirty thirty thousand students   oh i   and i see some freshmen wandering around in there and theyre theyre just like you know someone from the country lost in the big city i mean they   yeah   they i dont see them getting i mean when i was undergraduate i went to a relatively small school for my first two years and then i transferred to a very large school   uhhuh   and that worked out pretty well i went from a you know a second rate institution to a higher rate institution   umhum   but the first couple of years it doesnt matter to me what the quality of the education was i needed to make friends i needed to sort of learn the ropes you know there were things like that that mattered a lot more and i needed basic really simple education that you can get   right   pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years   well your educations a lot what you make of it too so   yeah yeah exactly and if youre alienated i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having such psychological problems that you think this isnt sinking in   yeah well i ive seen more graduates from MIT and that being     uhhuh   i work in a in a laboratory an Air Force laboratory and so weve got a lot of uh MIT graduates that are in there and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that i think ive ever run into even even more so   yeah yeah   uh like military academy grads are a strange lot too i i mean i have to admit confess to that   yeah its sort of a a rare select environment   yeah and they they have their own quirks and tolerances and         you know certain things that dont bother us at all that would drive other people nuts and then certain things that ways things we do the way we do it that drive other people nuts that   yeah right right sure   but these MIT grads are off in their absolute own world it its a i i have more respect i have a lot of respect for MIT masters and doctorate uh   yeah its a top rated institution and now i   degrees but but their undergrads are like i im amazed at at thats a lot of them even graduated   umhum umhum   but uh i dont know   well i i had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school not realizing that the reputation for MIT is because of the of the doctorate research   right right   and the professors who go there and youre not going to see the professors you know youre going to see some TA you know uh   nope the   so they put they they want you know they want the best and they dont think they think what the best is is reputation for for research and thats a one standard but its not relevant to what they need   yeah no its interesting that you mention that i didnt think about that before when you were talking but the service academies have all all the faculty uh for the most part is is military with a few exchange   uhhuh   instruct professors from other schools but   umhum umhum   uh having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there uh is investing in the Air Force and it or the the military itself its the future officer corps and so   right   i hear horror horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors they could never get extra help   umhum   for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day   umhum   i had all my instructors home phone numbers and could call them you go to their office anytime i had some instructors that uh   umhum   would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends when i was having trouble with something and   hm yeah you wont get that at MIT or Berkeley or anything like that and you can and you know you cant blame the professors either because you look at their job description youd see you know teaching is third down on the list of importance things and   no no and that no right right publish first and then   yeah and and thats appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research because its hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time   right   so id say go to a go to a college that has teachers people who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because thats their job   yeah   but oh well   yeah its theres a lot of factors that people dont ever ever consider   umhum   in in their selection of a college and uh i dont know maybe i wonder if if they enter these conversations that people have been having um that
