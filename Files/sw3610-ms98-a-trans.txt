              okay the change how womens roles have changed   yes   uh well i think weve moved out of the stereotype of the homemaker uh and i think its been through necessity with the economy and with the dysfunctional families   yes yes but i think it causes a lot of dysfunction in the family   well   women going out to work   uh possibly you know if if theyre doing it simply um for the money i think you know that   for the money   if if its something that they need to fulfill themselves then thats something different too   yeah   that uh they should have the opportunity to do it and the quote homemakers role should be divided equally between the partners   i do too when its a necessity i know uh but its funny how its changed because when my mother uh graduated well she took one year of normal school and then she taught school for three years before uh she met my father and they married and she had to quit teaching school because she was a married woman   uhhuh  thats right   so it its changed a lot from then   and of course now women can be anything they want to   umhum   uh one thing that has not changed is is the equality of pay among the sexes   right   and uh i dont see any great hope for that being changed in the near future quite frankly   no no i dont either i just think that well men are just kind of in charge and theyre not about to let women   but if you look at the people who make the decisions uh the Senate and the House theyre primarily male   umhum umhum   and uh you know big decision makers are still male until we get that changed  you know im a single   parent   parent well a single person my children are are grown and married but uh i still have to support myself   umhum umhum   and i you know i personally i dont work because i want to get out there and do it i work because if i want to eat im out there working   umhum well i think that makes a big difference and i think it makes a big difference too if if after your children are raised uh you want to go out and fulfill yourself   well i did i didnt work while my children were young and i was married because i did want to give them the background that they got at home i did find afterwards though   umhum   you take the children whose you know in a in a healthy family which i dont know how many of us have healthy families anymore  uh but i did find that the children of working parents   umhum   or working parent uh were more independent   umhum   and maybe that goes to where it break its breaking down the family bonds but i dont know of too many families that the women really work because they want to uh most of them are working and its not to buy the TVs and the new cars its to survive   yes i definitely think so and especially uh in those families that the husband does not have a college education   well even you know here our teachers are paid so poorly   they are in Utah too   and i dont know of any teacher whose wife is not having to work so its its not just the men without a college education its our economy is really bad right now in Oklahoma its real bad   oh is it  i dont think its  quite as bad in Utah as it is throughout the nation   yes well Oklahoma is certainly in the recession   uhhuh   uh weve been there weve been here for about three to five years now and its really hurting   oh uhhuh   but uh you know i dont i dont know that any woman would choose that a married woman would really choose to work because when youre working and youre married youre holding down two jobs one at home and one at   right i i think that thats more though with a mother thats working   well yes   than than just a wife because im im not just a wife but a wife i im grateful that none of my daughtersinlaws at this time are working because they all have small families and theyre just i just think its so sad when a  mother has to get a tiny baby up in the morning two months old and its cold here and take him to a babysitter
