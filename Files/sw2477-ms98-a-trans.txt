            okay so which uh what basketball teams are you interested in   well i guess im a big Laker LA Laker fan when it comes to pros   umhum   uh uh the college ranks um i guess i really of course i try to follow my alma mater thats uh BYU   umhum   in Utah but they dont have much of a team usually   no theyre more of a football team than they are basketball team   yeah yeah they you see them in football on TV once in awhile but you but you never see them on a   yeah   on nationally basketball   you know thats true i dont think ive ever seen them nationally on basketball   they uh last year they had a really good team was the year that Danny Aines was there   umhum   thats about five six years ago by now   hum   so they made it to the sweet sixteen once or twice in their history and thats   um yeah thats not too bad   and they usually lose in the first round what they get   umhum     how about you   well im uh originally from the Saint Louis area so the only basketball team pro anyway in that part of the country is Chicago so i i do pull for Chicago   uhhuh   uh i mean of course this year is a good year to be a a Chicago Bulls fan i guess because theyre doing pretty good   isnt the the Bulls youre talking about yeah the pro   yeah yeah um as far as college teams uh i know its really easy to say but ive been pulling for uh Duke for about four years now so uh   is that right   so i finally am feeling better about myself as far as college teams although ive ive really you know again being from Saint Louis i pull for Missouri uh but theyre on uh probation this year so you cant do much about that   uhhuh no no   but um   so did you watch the uh final four this year   oh yeah i watched every uh i watched all three games of that and uh i was very pleased with all three games because Kansas uh you know i was pulling for Kansas on the other side so it was it was real nice to have the the teams that were there   every game right right   of course i wasnt really i mean i i UNLV kind of gave me the impression of being a uh um oh i dont know a macho team you know they just didnt seem they seemed to think they were better than everybody else and and maybe they were but um i was real happy to see them get knocked off so   yeah that i i watched that game   umhum   and uh it was a good game it was a very close game and hard fought game   oh yeah   and it just i dont know it looked like UNLV may have had more uh talent but as far as playing together as a team that day it didnt Duke seemed to have them off balance   yeah umhum   and that uh they didnt just couldnt arent arent they more of a running gun team   UNLV yeah their their they play the pro style is the way ive always called it and uh you know the fast breaks and and   right fast breaks and things and they shut all that down and made them pay half court it seemed and   right and uh UNLV wasnt used to that of course ive i knew whenever UNLV went in at half time  see i dont know if they were necessarily behind but they werent ahead as much as they normally are   and what right   uh and you know that meant that they had to play a second half and theyve not theyve not had to do that all year and uh   right right they didnt have they didnt have to go through some tough games during the year and that and that and so thats the you know its a terrible time to have to deal with one right in it when when it counts so much   yeah thats right i mean Dukes schedule was was so much harder than UNLVs that it uh it just made them a much tougher team overall and uh that had to help them a lot   right i think i think that that probably was the difference in that game because it really could have gone any either way down to the end you know   umhum so do i take it you think though that the Lakers will uh will win or   well i dont know   i mean Portlands pretty good um   probably not since Kareems retired   yeah   they havent had a center and uh theyve got Perkins   yeah   but i dont think hes really been a super star for them   no well hes uh i dont i he to me is not a center hes more of a a real tall forward uh   and yes its right right so   i think Magic does a   i uh theyll make it you know i its its its going to be a war between uh between Chicago and uh and uh and uh Boston Celtics   oh yeah   thats going to be a war its going to be a great series   that sure is if i think thats going to be one of those thats uh thats won by the home team you know whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one i think   uhhuh one of those two will probably be um in there um let me see where does Detroit fit in   Detroits in that same uh that that same uh division   uhhuh so i dont know those three uh Detroit hasnt been having that great a year this year   no but as i heard Isaiah came back this week so uh that might help them   uhhuh yeah they have the they have the playoff experience well so does so does Detroit i mean so does Chicago   oh yeah   so do they all three of them do with Larry Bird back uh you can never count the Celtics out when Larry Birds   oh yeah thats true   uh starting to click on all cylinders they say hes starting to do starting to play   umhum hes yeah but hes been kind of up and down all year uh  you know one game and hell be playing to where everything he throws up goes in and then the next time hell you know he cant seem to hit the side of a barn so i dont know im im kind of im not sure about him this year   right right right last ive heard is that hes starting to peak right now   umhum well thats when you do it   and hes starting to be more consistent you know right at the right time of the year   yeah oh   oh any any dark horses i you know   well the dark horse yeah thats   San Antonio San Antonio the dark horse that could could really flip in there i think somewhere   yeah anybody who has Davi d Robinson got to have a chance anyway   yeah hes got to be pretty much you know i use to say Akeem Olajuwon was the dominant player you know when  against any team he would dominate but   umhum   Robinsons getting up there where   thats right   every game hes just i mean it looks like hes going in for a dunk and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back you know nobodys   umhum   got enough beef i guess to challenge him when hes when hes driving hard to the hoop   hum   hes uh he too bad the Mavericks couldnt get him   yeah thats true   with Roy Tarpley theyre in big trouble   yeah well then hes gone now so theyre going to have to do something about that well i thought he was gone period i i didnt read the story but i i read that uh   yeah for awhile anyways i heard he was suspended   well that might have been what it was but i i guess the headlines said something about him you know that the Mavericks you know released him or something im maybe i misunderstood what they meant   because of his um if they did theyd still have to pay his contract   well yeah   they may have done it   you never know yeah but   it was a lot of money he was making like i heard on the radio it was sixty three thousand and change a month thats what he was being paid you know he wasnt even playing   yeah   oh boy what a good job he had   thats what i think   he ruined ruined his sweet position   yeah     yeah im looking forward to the the pro playoff uh   yeah its coming up isnt it yeah   LA yeah San Antonio whos the other one thats doing so well this year Portland is that Portland Portland i havent seen them on much TV at all much at all but all i you do is hear about boy they have the scene the you know what do they have Walter Davis and   Portland yeah Portland umhum theyve got two the two Johnson brothers or theyre not brothers but i mean theres two guys named Johnson on their team that are really good doing good or something i forget exactly how that worked but   yeah umhum   um theyre like i said theyre doing extremely good right now Phoenix isnt doing too bad so its it ought to be a real interesting playoff yeah   right right yeah yeah i dont i dont think theres any clear pick that you know   umhum   i guess i guess the two teams that i just you know think you cant count out are the are the Celtics and the well because of Bird and and Lakers because of Magic Johnson they theyre two guys that seem to find a way when theres when theres when its on the line they seem to find a way   umhum when its on the line umhum   you know uh so those are what makes makes a champion i guess   yep thats true   yeah   well its been nice talking to you all right well take care bye   well nice talking to you take care bye
