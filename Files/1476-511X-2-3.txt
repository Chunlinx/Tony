                    Background        Lipid and lipoprotein abnormalities play a major role in        the development and progression of coronary artery disease        Low levels of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and high        levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol have been        identified as independent coronary risk factors            Throughout the  thcentury many investigators have        focused their interest on prevention and therapy of the        cardiovascular diseases through the evaluation and        modification of several lifestyle risk factors Among the        factors that may influence the occurrence of cardiovascular        disease the beneficial effect of physical activity on human        health has been underlined in several studies      The        protective role of physical activity on cardiovascular        morbidity has mainly attributed to its favourable effects        on several traditional coronary risk factors like body        mass composition and arterial blood pressures as well as        to inflammation process     On the other hand the        influence of physical activity on lipids levels showed        conflicting results in the few large population studies        that have evaluated this association            Therefore we sought to investigate the effect of        physical activity status on several blood lipids such as        High Density Lipoprotein HDL cholesterol Low Density        Lipoprotein LDL cholesterol Apolipoproteins Apo A and        B total cholesterol oxidized LDL cholesterol and        triglycerides in a populationbased sample of adults        without any clinical evidence of cardiovascular        disease                    Methdos                  Studys sample          The ATTICA study is a health and nutrition survey          which is being carried out in the province of Attica          during  where Athens is a major metropolis A          stratified sample of  men    years old range             and  women    years old range             was drawn from the general population with exclusion          of people living in institutions The stratification was          based on the age  gender  city distribution provided by          the National Statistical Service according to the census          of  There were only minor differences in          distribution by gender and age between the study          population and the target population The studys design          anticipates enrolling only one participant per household          The sampling was random The number of the participants          was determined by power analysis and chosen to evaluate          differences between the investigated parameters and          physical activity levels greater than  achieving          statistical power   at   probability          level Pvalue All individuals entered in this study          were without any clinical evidence of coronary heart          disease stroke or any atherosclerotic disease All          participants interviewed by trained personnel who used a          standard questionnaire Any subject with comorbidities          that may affect physical activity status was excluded          from this analysis                          Evaluation of physical activity          We estimated an index of weekly energy expenditure as          follows all participants were asked the average daily          number of stairs climbed and the number of city blocks          walked during the week in the past year We next          examined the type frequency weeks per year duration          time per week and intensity of sports related physical          activity during the same period Intensity was gradated          in qualitative terms such as light expended calories            Kcal min ie walking slowly cycling          stationary light stretching etc moderate expended          calories  Kcal min ie walking briskly cycling          outdoor swimming moderate effort etc and high          expended calories  Kcal min ie walking briskly          uphill long distance running cycling fast or racing          swimming fast crawl etc Participants who did not          report any physical activities were defined as sedentary          For the rest of the participants we calculated a combined          score by multiplying the weekly frequency duration and          intensity of physical activity Then we calculated the          tertiles of this score and the physically active          participants were classified into three groups low          physical activity  sttertile medium physical activity           ndtertile and high physical activity  rdtertile          This assessment of physical activity is reliable valid          and has been performed by other investigators in the past                        The presence of occupational exercise was recorded but          it was not taken into account for the analysis due to          difficulties in evaluation and standardization This          exclusion may confound our findings but the large sample          size and the applied randomised procedure can spread the          subjects who reported occupational exercise equally in          both groups of the study                          Biochemical and clinical parameters          The blood samples were collected from the antecubital          vein between  to  am in a sitting position after           hours of fasting and avoiding of alcohol The biochemical          evaluation was carried out in the same laboratory that          followed the criteria of the World Health Organization          Lipid Reference Laboratories All biochemical          examinations serum total cholesterol LDLcholesterol          HDLcholesterol triglycerides and blood glucose were          measured using chromatographic enzymic method in a          Technicon automatic analyzer RA HDL cholesterol was          determined after precipitation of the Apolipoprotein B          containing lipoproteins with dextranmagnesiumchloride          The intra and interassay coefficients of variation of          cholesterol levels did not exceed  and of blood glucose           NonHDL cholesterol was calculated by the formula          total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol          Fasting blood glucose mgdl was measured at serum          Resting blood pressure was measured with subject sitting          comfortably for  minutes and the cuff arm supported          at the heart level An average of three consecutive          measurements was recorded for all participants                          Demographic and lifestyle characteristics          The studys questionnaire also included demographic          characteristics like age gender financial status          average annual income during the past three years and          education level as an index of social status that was          measured in years of school We also asked for the          frequency of alcohol use and this information was          converted to daily grams of alcohol by multiplying each          glass of beer wine or spirits with its alcohol content          adjusted to  ml of  ethanol concentration          Information about smoking habits was collected using a          standardized questionnaire developed for the Study          Current smokers were defined as those who smoked at least          one cigarette per day Never smokers those who have never          tried a cigarette in their life and former smokers were          defined as those who had stopped smoking more than one          year previously For the multivariate statistical          analyses cigarette smoking was quantified in packyears          cigarette packs per day X years of smoking adjusted          for a nicotine content of  mg  cigarette Height was          measured to the nearest  cm without shoes back          square against the wall tape eyes looking straight ahead          visual axis is horizontal when the top of external          auditory meat us is level with the inferior margin of          bony orbit with a rightangles triangle resting of the          scalp and against the wall Weight was measured with a          lever balance to the nearest  g without shoes in          light undergarments Body mass index was measured as          weight in kilograms divided by standing height in          meters squared Details regarding the aims and the          design of the ATTICA study have already presented          elsewhere                               Statistical analysis          Continuous variables are presented as mean values           one standard deviation while qualitative variables are          presented as absolute and relative frequencies          Associations between categorical variables were tested by          the use of contingency tables and the calculation of          chisquared test Comparisons between normally          distributed continuous variables and categorical were          performed by the calculation of Students ttest and          oneway or multi way Analysis of coVariance MANCOVA          after controlling for equality of variances          homoscedacity In order to evaluate differences between          physical activity groups we applied post hoc analysis          using the Bonferonni correction In the case of          asymmetric continuous variables the tested hypotheses          were based on the calculations of the nonparametric test          suggested by Kruskal and Wallis Correlations between          lipids levels and age smoking habits in packyears and          body mass index were evaluated by the calculation of          Pearsons correlation coefficient Associations between          lipids levels and physical activity status were tested          through multiple linear regression analysis after the          adjustment for several potential confounders and          interactions All reported           P values are based on twosided          tests and compared to a significance level of  SPSS           software SPSS Inc  USA was used for all the          statistical calculations                            Results        Eightytwo  of men and   of women were        classified into high physical activity levels   of        men and   of women into medium and   of        men and   of women into low physical activity        levels The rest of the participants ie   of men        and   of women were classified as sedentary Women        were less physically active as compared to men p                 A gender interaction was observed between physical        activity status and lipid levels of the participants        Particularly compared to women who reported sedentary        life those who defined as physically active had        significantly lower levels of total serum cholesterol LDL        and oxidized LDL cholesterol triglycerides apolipoprotein        B and higher levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein        A However in men physical activity seems to be        associated with the aforementioned lipids but the benefits        did not reach statistical significance Table  Moreover        physically active participants were younger as compared to        sedentary    vs    years old p          and were less frequent to be active smokers  vs  p          An inverse association was observed between body        mass index and physical activity group sedentary           vs low    vs medium    vs high    Kg  m         p   Also compared to sedentary physically        active participants had lower levels of systolic and        diastolic blood pressure    vs    mm Hg and           vs    mm Hg p   as well as blood        glucose concentration    vs    mg  dl p          No associations were found between indexes of        social status education level and annual income alcohol        drinking and the adoption of a physically active        lifestyle        We further examined the associations between physical        activity status and lipids levels through multivariate        analysis Firstly we observed that all lipids measurements        were significantly correlated with age r         total cholesterol   r         HDL   r         LDL   r         apoA   r         apoB   r         oxidLDL   all p   body        mass index r         total cholesterol   r         HDL   r         LDL   r         apoA   r         apoB   r         oxLDL   all p   and        smoking habits r         total cholesterol   r         HDL   r         LDL   r         apoA   r         apoB   r         oxLDL   all p   Thus        after taking into account the confounding effect of age        body mass index dietary intake and smoking we observed        that physical activity was positively associated with HDL         cholesterol and apolipoprotein A levels in women but not        in men Table  Post hoc analysis revealed that women at        medium and high physical activity levels had significantly         p   and  p   higher        HDLcholesterol levels respectively as compared to        sedentary Similarly women at medium and high physical        activity status had  p   and  p          higher apolipoprotein A levels as compared to sedentary        Furthermore when we stratified the analysis according to        smoking status we found that compared to sedentary medium        physical activity was associated with lower total        cholesterol levels both in nonsmoker men  p          and nonsmoker women  p   as well as lower        triglycerides levels in nonsmoker men  p   and        nonsmoker women  p   No differences regarding        total cholesterol or triglycerides levels were observed        between low or high physical activity status and sedentary        life No other statistically significant differences        between physical activity status and lipids levels were        found when we stratified the analysis by body mass index        group normal overweight and obese both in men and        women Table illustrates the effect of physical activity        on the investigated lipids measurements after taking into        account the aforementioned confounders                    Discussion        In this work based on a large populationbased sample        of cardiovascular disease free people we revealed a        statistically significant doseresponse relationship        between physical activity and HDLcholesterol and        apolipoprotein A levels in women but not in men after        adjusting for age body mass index and smoking habits of        the participants Figure  Inverse linear associations        were also observed between physical activity and        triglycerides LDL cholesterol total cholesterol and        apolipoprotein B levels However the benefits from        physical activity on these lipids were mainly explained        by the observed differences in body mass and smoking habits        among the physical activity groups        Numerous studies documented the relation of increased        physical activity with an improved cardiovascular risk        factor profile in adults In particular these studies have        shown the overall benefit of physical activity in reducing        the risk of developing coronary heart disease especially        due to the reduction of arterial blood pressure levels               inflammation and coagulation markers             One of the main findings of the present work is the        doseresponse relationship between physical activity and        HDL cholesterol levels in women Particularly women at        medium and high physical activity levels had  and         higher HDLcholesterol levels respectively as compared to        sedentary Similar results were observed in apolipoprotein        A levels It is notable that the previous associations        were independent from the effect of body mass index        smoking habits and age of the participants The Pawtucket        Heart Study reported that physical activity was        significantly associated with lower blood pressure as well        as body mass index and higher HDLcholesterol levels            Moreover among  adult Japanese men frequency of        physical activity was independently and positively related        to HDLcholesterol     Similarly a pooled analysis        among three European cohorts consisting of a total of         elderly men demonstrated a significant relation of physical        activity with HDLcholesterol     The same findings        were observed in several studies that included only women              Our insignificant findings regarding physical        activity and HDL or apolipoprotein A levels among men        could be attribute to the differences on body mass        composition and smoking habits between physical activity        groups The present study cannot provide causal inference        about the effect of the gender interaction with physical        activity on HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A levels        Potential differences on eating habits between men and        women that they were not evaluated in the present        analysis could the answer in the stated hypothesis        We also evaluated the effect of physical activity on        several other lipids levels Particularly we observed that        compared to sedentary physically active men had a reduction        that varied from  to  in all lipids measurements In        women we also observed a reduction starting from  to         in all lipids with the most significant reduction in        triglycerides  However we revealed that the benefits        from physical activity on total cholesterol triglycerides        LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels were mainly        explained by the reduction in body mass index and the        decreased smoking habits among physically active men and        women Our findings are in accordance with several other        observational studies that reported a non significant        effect of physical activity on lipids levels by the        exception of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides                        Regarding the intensity of physical activity that is        needed for a considerable lowering on lipids levels several        investigators report that positive changes in HDL        cholesterol levels observed in those who were highly        exercised ie at least    miles per week             Although it is difficult to compare results among studies        because different methods were used to classify physical        activity levels our study revealed that even medium        physical activity levels    kcalmin   times per        week was associated with a significant reduction in HDL        cholesterol levels among women Three or more times per        week along with relatively moderate intensity and        duration are within the ability and tolerance of most        middle aged and older individuals        It is widely accepted that exercise affects blood        cholesterol and other lipids in a positive way by        regulating the metabolism of all lipids in the blood        Several studies including the present demonstrate that        exercise raises HDLcholesterol in the blood Another major        impact of exercise on lipids is that it lowers triglyceride        levels     However exercises exert a minor impact on        the LDLcholesterol and to a lesser extend total        cholesterol In fact dietary interventions have much better        luck in lowering blood cholesterol levels     The        latter could be viewed as disappointing concerning the        effect of physical activity However some investigators        suggest that the way to avoid a decline in HDLcholesterol        that occurs with dieting is to combine diet with exercise        It has been shown that those who decrease their fat intake        through dieting but maintain an active exercise program        note an increase in HDLcholesterol levels      Thus        if we use the above example one can easily realize the        benefits of reducing cholesterol through dieting while        HDLcholesterol are maintained As a result those who        exercise regularly have a more favourable lipid profile        than those who do not exercise This may translated to a        reduction in the risk for developing atherosclerosis            How much exercise is required to increase HDLcholesterol        levels and improve the overall lipid profile Our study        revealed that even medium exercise is adequate to increase        HDLcholesterol levels in women        Our study is a cross section survey Thus we cannot        provide evidences for causality between physical activity        and lipids levels The selfreported history of weekly        physical activity is also a limitation This work is also        limited is assessing the effects of an intensity  duration        interaction on lipid and lipoprotein metabolism In        addition the influence of diet and genetic factors cannot        be addressed by our data All these issues need to be        addressed by future interventional exercise studies        Nevertheless physical activity was associated with reduced        lipids levels both in men and women but these benefits        did not reach statistical significance when adjusted for        the effect of exercise on body mass index of the        participants and the confounding effect of smoking and        dietary habits On the other hand substantial increases in        HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A concentrations were        observed in women who exercised even at medium levels                    Competing interests        None declared
