appreciation of the sentiment expressed and my fullagreement along with bemusement I believe the most unsettling image currentlyextant in popular culture is that of Bob Dole under the influence of Viagra Idont believe children should be allowed to view this ad The craggy oldpervert is just plain scary particularly when he smiles thatbeyondthegraveand now sexually arousedsmile No wonder Liddy spends somuch time hoofing it on the road                                       Wolfman                        Dear Wolf            Many readers checked into say that they applauded the former senators forthright approach to a realproblem The following writer however was not one of them                                             Prudie                                                      Not to belabor thepoint but I have often thought Liddy Dole had better put a pillow over Bobshead if she expects to be elected president I am so sick of his whining andsniveling over his ED You know there are a lot of single women and widows inthis country who manage to stay happy without the constant focus on erectionsTime for you to get a life Bob Try reading  or chocolate cake Prudencesock it

Senate TheSenate I was shocked that such a thing could even be a possibility I sharethe sentiments of the chairman of Ohios Republican Party who said Was HowardStern busy Say its all a goof                                       Poor Resident in Ohio                        Dear Poor            It is indeeddispiriting that someone with Mr Springers history might have been consideredsimply because of name recognition There is precedent however and it isregrettably recent Dubya Texas Gov George Bush has no particularqualifications aside from being merely appealing and the son of a presidentMr Clinton was elected when he was known to be irresponsible And dont forgetMr Reagan of whom it could be said he wasnt really a president but playedone on television We are seemingly suckers for charisma and exercising anelectoral death wish            Prudie resignedly
