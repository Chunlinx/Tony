                    Background        Human immunodeficiency virus type reverse        transcriptase HIV RT is a product of the gagpol        polyprotein precursor which is subsequently cleaved by the                pol encoded protease to yield the        active form of the enzyme      This multifunctional        enzyme is responsible for copying the single stranded viral        RNA genome into double stranded proviral DNA             HIV RT is a heterodimer consisting of a  and  kDa        polypeptide chain designated as p and p respectively        The p subunit is generated via endoproteolytic cleavage        of the p subunit between Phe  and Tyr              The larger subunit p contains both polymerase and RNase        H activities while the smaller subunit p lacks these        functions in context of the heterodimer      However        both the p and p monomers are functionally inactive        when dissociated from each other     Several years have        passed since it was first suggested that agents that could        specifically disrupt the dimerization of HIV RT might        prove a worthwhile antiretroviral strategy     though        such agents have yet to be developed        Despite the fact that p shares an identical amino acid        sequence with the Nterminal portion of p the two        subunits assume different global folding patterns in the        formation of the asymmetric heterodimer     Structural        determination through Xray crystallography has revealed        that the p subunit of HIVRT has its polymerase domain        in an open conformation with its subdomains forming a        large cleft which accommodates DNA In contrast the p        subunit assumes a compact folded conformation that causes        the active site residues in this subunit to be buried and        therefore nonfunctional       It has been        proposed that the open conformation of p is supported by        interactions with a closed and compact p molecule              The two subunits interact mainly via their        connection subdomains Additional contacts between the        thumb subdomain of p and RNase H subdomain of p are        also substantial             Although there have been conflicting reports regarding        the DNA polymerase activity of recombinant preparations of        the p homodimer      it has become clear that p        mainly plays a supportive role in context of the pp        heterodimer Assembly of chimeric heterodimers formed by        mixing subunits of HIV RT and FIV RT has demonstrated        that the p subunit of HIV RT helps to preserve the        functional integrity of the HIV RT heterodimer            Despite the fact that several functions have been proposed        for the p subunit the mechanism whereby p performs        these functions has remained largely undefined Some of the        proposed functions for p include i stabilizing the        tRNA primer binding for the initiation of reverse        transcription     ii enhancement of strand        displacement DNA synthesis      and iii as a        processivity factor in DNA synthesis            CysSer mutation at position  in the p subunit has        been shown to alter the RNase H activity of the        heterodimeric enzyme indicating that this residue in the        thumb subdomain of p plays an important role in support        of the RNase H activity of p     The emergence of a        strain of HIV resistant to the nonnucleoside RT        inhibitor TSAO Tertbutyldimethyl silyspiro amino        oxathioledioside displaying GluLys mutation at position         in the p subunit of HIV RT has also been reported            thus implicating p to play a more direct role in        drug binding andor the enzymatic activities of HIVRT        This report was initially surprising since Glu of p        was thought to be quite distant from the purported        dNTPbinding pocket of HIVRT as well as the NNRTI        binding pocket However in light of our recent findings        implicating this loop region of p as a critical        structural element supporting the catalytic functions of        p it seems feasible that mutation at position  in p        effectively altered the binding of TSAO through its        influence on the p catalytic subunit            Examination of the crystal structure of HIV RT reveals        the presence of a small groove like region on the floor of        the polymerase cleft of p     The  loop of p        comprising of six amino acids denoted as SINNET appears to        fit into this groovelike region and likely stabilizes the        polymerase domain of p In an earlier communication we        have shown that the p subunit of HIV RT is required to        load the p subunit on to the template primer for DNA        synthesis     Our recent studies indicate that the         loop of the p subunit is essential for the        catalytic function of the p subunit Deletion of this        loop or substitution of four amino acid residues with        alanine within the  loop of p severely impaired the        DNA polymerase activity of the enzyme as a consequence of        the inability of the enzyme to form stable dimers            These findings clearly establish the absolute requirement        of the  loop of p for RT dimerization        Nonetheless the question regarding the optimal size and        composition requirement of this loop for efficient        dimerization remains unanswered In the present article we        have addressed the impact of increasing the size of the         loop on the dimerization process As a preamble to        these studies we have increased the size of this loop by        repeating its six amino acid sequence in tandem The        rationale for duplicating the loop sequence was to increase        the size of this loop without significantly disrupting the        interactions seen with the wild type  loop The        resulting mutant derivatives of HIV RT containing        insertion of six amino acids in the  loop in either or        both the subunits were analyzed for their ability to form        stable dimers and other biochemical characteristics In        this article we present evidence that HIV RT mutants        carrying insertion of six amino acids in the  loop        specifically in the second subunit do not form stable        dimers This inability to dimerize substantially decreases        the enzymes affinity for DNA consequently impairing its        polymerase and RNase H activities                    Results                  Glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation          analysis          The ability of the HIV RT mutants carrying          insertion of six residues in the  loop in either one          or both the subunits was analyzed by glycerol gradient          sedimentation analysis Fractions of  L were          collected from the bottom of the tube and aliquots of          every third fraction were subjected to SDS PAGE The          results shown in Figure A indicate that the          sedimentation peak for the wild type pp homodimer          was between fractions  of the gradient Panel A          whereas the wild type p species sedimented between          fractions  as a monomeric protein Panel C The          sedimentation pattern for the p WTp INSmutant          indicated two distinct peaks While the p WTsubunit          predominantly sedimented in between fractions  at          the predicted position of the homodimer the p          INSsubunit sedimented between fractions  indicating          a monomeric conformation Panel D This sedimentation          profile indicates that the p WTp INSmutant carrying          the  amino acid insertion in the  loop of its p          subunit is unable to form stable heterodimer Under these          conditions the p WTsubunit of the p WTp INSmutant          tends to homodimerize The mutants p INSp INSPanel          B and p INSp INSPanel F exhibited a distinct          sedimentation peak between fractions  of the          gradient indicating that these enzymes are unable to          form stable dimers In contrast the p INSp WTmutant          Panel E in which only the p subunit carried an          insertion in the  loop sedimented between fractions           of the gradient indicating that these two subunits          can form stable heterodimers These analyses imply that          the proper size of the  loop in the second subunit          of HIV RT is important for the formation of a stable          dimeric enzyme          In order to correlate the sedimentation profile of          these insertion mutants with their functional activity          we analyzed the polymerase activity in the various          gradient fractions These results are presented in Fig          B The polymerase activity profile of the gradient          fractions of the wildtype pp and the p INSp          WTmutant revealed major polymerase activity peaks          corresponding to fractions  Fig B This activity          peak correlates with the protein band intensity seen in          Fig Apanels A and E and is also in agreement with the          sedimentation pattern of these two enzymes          Interestingly the activity profile of the p WTp          INSmutant also yielded a peak corresponding to gradient          fractions  Fig B thus substantiating our          contention that the p WTsubunit of the p WTp          INSmutant tends to selfdimerize and form the          catalytically active p homodimer The wild type p and          the two mutants p INSp INSand p INSp INS the          sedimentation profile of which indicated a monomeric          conformation Fig A were conspicuously devoid of any          polymerase activity Fig B These results imply that          the  loop of the second subunit of HIV RT is          critical in forming functionally active dimeric          enzyme                          DNA polymerase activities of wild type HIV RT and          its insertion mutants          DNA polymerase activity of the wild type HIV RT and          its mutant derivatives were quantitatively determined on          both heteropolymeric RNA UPBS RNA and DNA mer          templates primed with P labeled mer PBS primer As          documented in Table  insertion of the six amino acid          segment in both the subunits p INSp INSor p          INSp INS resulted in significant loss of polymerase          activity corresponding to greater than  reduction          Interestingly when the p INSmutant was dimerized with          the wild type p p INSp WT the polymerase          activity was restored to wild type levels The same          result was obtained when p INSwas dimerized with p          having AspAla mutation at amino acid position  one          of the catalytically crucial carboxylate triad but          having an intact  loop The rationale for using p          DAmutant was to ascertain that the wild type          polymerase activity observed with p INSp WTwas not          due to residual polymerase activity of p These results          suggest that insertion of six residues in the  loop          of p but not in p is detrimental to the function of          the heterodimeric enzyme          As shown in figure  evaluation of the polymerase          activity of the wild type HIVRT and its insertion          mutants by primer extension assay generally mirrored the          results observed in the TCA precipitation assay          summarized in Table  Insertion of six amino acid          residues in the  loops of both the subunits p          INSp INSor p INSp INS resulted in significant          impairment of polymerase activity of the mutant enzymes          On an RNA template both these enzymes exhibited total          lack of polymerase activity Fig B though the p          INSp INSmutant exhibited residual primer extension          capability on a DNA template Fig A while the p          INSp INSmutant was inactive on this template          Consistent with the results of the TCA precipitation          assay both the mutants p INSp WTand p INSp          DA exhibited near wild type p WTp WT          polymerase activity on both RNA and DNA templates Thus          the impairment of the polymerase activity seen with these          mutants carrying insertion in either both the subunits or          specifically in the second subunit may be related to the          inability of these mutants to form stable dimers          resulting in a closed polymerase cleft                          Effect of insertion in either or both the subunits          of HIV RT on the DNA binding function of the          enzyme          Earlier we have shown that substitution of four amino          acids on the  loop with alanine reduced the DNA          binding ability of the enzyme Similar results were          obtained when four amino acids were deleted from the          loop We therefore concluded that the effect was exerted          via p since alanine substitution or deletion          specifically in the p subunit had no effect on DNA          binding and polymerase activity of the enzyme We          speculated that alanine substitution or deletion in the          loop of the p subunit may shorten the interacting          sphere of the loop which may not be able to induce          opening of the polymerase cleft in p which is          essential for DNA binding Given the fact that shortening          of this loop in p prevented DNA binding we were          interested in examining the effect of six amino acids          insertion on DNA binding Therefore we determined the          equilibrium dissociation constants K           d  of ETP binary complexes for the          wild type enzyme and its mutant derivatives by gel          mobility shift assay For this purpose we used a mer          heteropolymeric DNA template primed with  Plabeled          mer DNA Results shown in figure and table indicate          a fold reduction in DNA binding affinity when both the          subunits carried insertion p INSp INS in their           loops Similar results were obtained with the p          INSp INSmutant Interestingly the DNA binding          affinity was restored to the wild type levels when the          mutant p subunit was dimerized with the wild type p          p INSp WT We expected that the p WTp          INSmutant would also exhibit reduction in its affinity          for DNA since insertion of six residues in the p          subunit was speculated to be detrimental for the          dimerization process However the DNA binding affinity          of the p WTp INSmutant was similar to the wild type          enzyme Our glycerol gradient sedimentation analysis had          revealed that the p WTp INSmutant does not form          stable dimers rather the p WTsubunit tends to self          dimerize Thus the wild type DNA binding affinity seen          in case of the p WTp INSmutant may be attributed to          the presence of these p WTp WThomodimeric species          Based on our observations from the sedimentation          analysis we propose that the loss of DNA binding          function in case of the HIVRT insertion mutants results          from a failure to form stable dimers The wild type p          alone exhibited very low DNA binding affinity with a K           dDNA fold higher than the wild          type heterodimeric enzyme These results suggest that the          optimal size of the  loop in the second subunit of          the HIV RT dimer is crucial for opening the polymerase          cleft of the p subunit                          Ternary complex formation by the wild type and          mutant enzymes          In the crystal structures of the ternary complex of          HIV RT EDNAdNTP the finger subdomain moves by           towards the palm subdomain     In this finger          closing conformation the DNA is locked in a stable          ternary complex poised for catalysis An           in vitro assay using dideoxy          terminated primer annealed with the template which allows          the next correct dNTP to bind in the ternary complex          without actual DNA synthesis has recently been reported              Using this assay system we have evaluated the          ability of the insertion mutants to form the ternary          complexes and the effect of DNA trap on such complexes          Since binding of dNTP to the enzyme is an ordered          mechanism which occurs only after DNA binding the extent          of labeled TP remaining bound to the enzyme in the          presence of dNTP and DNA trap represents the extent of          ternary complex formed The ETP binary complex was          formed at enzyme concentrations which binds  of the          labeled template primer The preformed ETP complex was          then incubated in the presence of next correct dNTP          followed by addition of fold molar excess of          unlabeled TP as the DNA trap We found that ETP binary          complex was completely competed out by the DNA trap data          not shown while a significant amount of the ETP binary          complex converted to ETPdNTP ternary complex was          resistant to competition with DNA trap Fig           suggesting the stability of the ternary complex Table          lists the apparent dNTP binding affinity for the WT          enzyme and its insertion mutants determined from data          shown in Fig  It was observed that although the DNA          binding affinity was severely affected in case of the p          INSp INSmutant its apparent dNTP binding affinity in          the ternary complex did not change with respect to the          wild type enzyme However the p INSp INSmutant was          unable to form a ternary complex These data suggest that          these two mutants may have a different conformation and          mode of interaction in the ternary complex It is          apparent that the p INSp INSbinds to TP in a          nonproductive manner which may have a direct impact on          dNTP binding in the ternary complex                          Steady state kinetic analysis of HIV RT and its          insertion mutants          In order to determine whether alteration in DNA          binding without any change in the apparent dNTP binding          affinity of the insertion mutants is consistent with          their kinetic parameters we analyzed the steadystate          kinetic parameters of these mutants The results of this          investigation are summarized in Table  On poly          rAdT             only the p INSp INSmutant          showed a significant increase in K           m dNTP  This observation is in          agreement with the apparent dNTP binding affinity data in          the ternary complex where p INSp INSmutant was          found to be defective in forming a productive ternary          complex This observation is also consistent with our          suggestion that p INSp INSbinds nonproductively to          TP that may influence the formation of ternary complexes          Interestingly the p INSp INSmutant carrying          insertion in both the subunits did not display the same          reduction in dTTP binding affinity However the p          INSp INSand p INSp INSmutants displayed nearly          fold and fold reduction in catalytic efficiency          k           cat Km compared to their wild type          counterparts respectively on this template primer A          fold reduction in catalytic efficiency in case of the          p INSp WTwas noted only on poly rA dT            and may be templateprimer          specific None of the enzymes displayed a significant          reduction in K           m dNTP when the heteropolymeric          DNADNA template primer was used although the p          INSp INSand p INSp INSmutants exhibited drastic          reduction in catalytic efficiency The p WTp          INSdisplayed no change in either dNTP binding or          catalytic efficiency These results are in keeping with          our analysis of the polymerase and DNA binding assay for          this mutant Once again we believe that the wild type          p subunit in this enzyme preparation tends to          homodimerize since the p INSfails to participate in          stable dimer formation This phenomenon masks the          deleterious effect of the insertion mutation                          RNase H activity of the insertion mutants          Since the polymerase activity of the homo and          heterodimeric enzymes carrying insertion in the           loop in both the subunits p INSp INSand p INSp          INS was drastically impaired it was of interest to          examine how this insertion affects their RNase H          activity To evaluate this we employed a mer RNADNA          hybrid and examined the cleavage of the  PRNA          strand of the duplex by the wild type enzyme and its          mutant derivatives The result of this analysis is          presented in Fig  Similar to their polymerase          activities the RNase H activities of the p INSp          INSand p INSp INSmutants were severely impaired          This is not surprising since our analysis of the DNA          binding function of these two mutants had indicated a          substantial loss of DNA binding affinity which in turn          is expected to affect both the polymerase and RNase H          functions Dimerization of the p INSsubunit with the          wild type p p INSp WT carrying an intact           loop resulted in substantial recovery of the RNase H          activity The RNase H activity seen in case of the p          WTp INSmutant was not surprising since the p          WTsubunit of the p WTp INSmutant tends to          selfdimerize and form the catalytically active p          homodimer                            Discussion        In an earlier investigation on the role of the p        subunit of HIV RT we demonstrated that decrease in size        of its  loop impairs the catalytic function of the        heterodimer     In the present studies we demonstrate        that maintaining the wild type size of this loop in the p        subunit is critical for dimerization of the enzyme and its        catalytic activity Duplication of the  loop sequence        selectively in the p subunit did not affect the dimer        formation DNA binding or polymerase activity of the p        INSp WTmutant However insertion of the same amino acid        residues in the  loop of p prevented stable        dimerization of the p INSsubunit with either p INSor        p WTand adversely impacted the DNA binding polymerase        and RNase H activities Earlier we have shown that p        facilitates the loading of the p subunit on to the        template primer     Therefore the impaired polymerase        activity and templateprimer binding affinity of HIV RT        mutants carrying insertion in p may be due to their        inability to load the catalytic p p INS on the        template primer These altered biophysicalenzymatic        properties of these insertion mutants may be attributed to        the reduced dimer stability        Crystal structures of HIV RT show that p and p        assume different folding patterns and tertiary structures             It has been proposed that p in a monomeric form        exists in a closed conformation similar to p            Following dimerization with another molecule of p or        p it assumes an open conformation       The        polymerase domain of p is buried within its core This        difference in tertiary structures between the two subunits        makes the dimer asymmetric The amino acid residues at the        contact interface differ with respect to their position and        location in the D structure The counterpart of amino        acid residues of p located at the contact interface are        buried in the p folded conformation whereas those of p        are scattered in the p open conformation Fig         Of the several domain interactions between p and p        the  loop of p is strategically positioned to        interact with the residues on the floor of the palm        subdomain of p It has been suggested that the stability        of the dimer is related to the buried surface area between        the two subunits      In the nevirapinebound HIV        RT crystal structure the total contact surface area        between the subunits is approximately    The two        major contact regions between the subunits which provide it        stability are their connection subdomains and the thumb of        p and RNase H domain of p These contacts account for        approximately two third of the total buried surface area        Interestingly the marginal decrease in the total surface        area due to deletion of four residues in the  loop        does not account for the dimer instability thus suggesting        that polar interactions of residues in the  loop of        p with the palm subdomain of p may play a role in        conferring stability to the heterodimer The observation        that a single point mutation at L of p a residue not        in direct contact with p also destabilizes the dimer            indicates that other factors may also contribute        towards dimer stability        In order to analyze the impact of inserting the six        amino acid peptide in the  loop of p we used the        molecular modeling approach A search in the database of        known protein structures employing the loopsearch        algorithm of SYBYL yielded  loops of which only five        were sterically permissible The loop exhibiting the best        homology was incorporated in the modeled structure Fig         This loop of  amino acids RFNAHGDVN from the protein        S lectin formed a short antiparallel two strand sheet        This inserted loop lies in the vicinity of the palm        subdomain of p and exhibits additional hydrophobic and        polar interactions with residues in the palm subdomain of        p not seen in the wild type structure These additional        interactions are expected to enhance the stability of the        dimer However sedimentation analysis indicates that the        insertion mutants form unstable dimer This implies that        the insertion may have altered the relative position of the        subdomains in the two subunits thereby perturbing the dimer        stability In summary the  loop of p is an        important structural element involved in imparting        stability to the heterodimer and in opening the polymerase        cleft of p for catalysis                    Materials and methods                  Plasmid and clones          The expression vector pETa and           E coli expression strain BL          DE were obtained from Novagen The HIVRT expression          clones pKK RT and pETaRT constructed in          this laboratory      were used for PCR          amplification and construction of the insertion mutants          in the p and p subunits of HIV RT An HIVRNA          expression clone pHIVPBS was a generous gift from Dr M          A Wainberg                              Insertion of  amino acid residues in the           loop          The pKKRT clone containing two unique restriction          sites           Hpa and           Stu  at codons  and  in the          RT coding region    was used for insertion of           aminoacid residues in the  loop of the p and p          subunit The pKKRT clone was digested with           HpaI restriction enzyme to generate          a blunt end at codon  For insertion two          complementary prekinased mer synthetic DNA oligos          having the following sequences ATA AAC AAT GAG ACA          ATA sense strand and TAT TTG TTA CTC TGT TAT          antisense strand were hybridized The mer duplex DNA          encoding the insertion peptide IleAsnAsnGluThrIle          was ligated with           Hpa digested pKKRT in between          codon  and  The positive clones were screened in           E coli HB by the absence of an           Hpa site and the correct          orientation of the insertion was confirmed by DNA          sequencing This construct expresses the paa subunit          without His tag sequences A Histag at the Nterminal of          the paa subunit was introduced by sub cloning the           BalI and           Hind III fragment of pKKRTaa          into pETaRT expression cassette A unique           Sac I site was also introduced in          pKKRT template at codon  The construction of          Paa was carried out by removal of the  bp fragment          from pKKRTaa by restriction digestion with           SacI followed by religation of the          vector ends The insertion mutant in pETa and pKK          vectors were introduced into           E coli BL DE pLys S and           E coli JM respectively for          expression Induction of the enzyme protein was carried          out as described before for the wild type HIVRT              The enzyme with the hexahistidinetag was purified from          bacterial lysates by immobilized metal affinity          chromatography     while nonhexahistidinetagged          enzyme was purified using the phosphocellulose and          QSepharose columns as described previously                              Preparation of the heterodimeric enzyme with          subunit specific insertion          The p subunit with a hexahistidinetag and a          nontagged p were used to generate the heterodimers          containing insertion in either or both of the subunits          For each set of heterodimers  g of p was mixed          with  g of p in the buffer containing  mM Tris          HCl pH   mM KCl and  mM MgCl             The rationale for using a           ratio of p to p was to saturate the Histagged p          with the nontagged p ensuring heterodimer formation          and eliminating excess p during IMAC purification The          mixture was incubated for  hours at C and applied to           mL Ni iminodiaceticSepharose IDASepharose          column which was preequilibrated with the binding          buffer  mM Tris HCl pH   mM NaCl and  mM          Imidazole The column was washed with  mL of the same          buffer to remove the excess of p that was not dimerized          with p bound to the IDAsepharose column The          heterodimeric RT was then eluted from the column with          elution buffer  mM Tris HCl pH   mM NaCl and           mM imidazole Fractions of  mL were collected and          an aliquot of each fraction was analyzed by SDSPAGE          using Coomassie Blue stain The fractions containing          approximately equal band intensity of p and p were          dialyzed against a storage buffer  mM Tris HCl pH            mM NaCl and  Glycerol and this enzyme preparation          was used in all experiments                          Glycerol gradient ultra centrifugation          Fifty micrograms of the enzyme protein in  L of          buffer  mM Tris HCl pH   mM DTT and  mM NaCl          was carefully loaded onto  mL of  glycerol          gradients prepared in the same buffer The gradients were          centrifuged at  rpm in an SW rotor for  h at          C Fractions  L were collected from the bottom of          the tube and aliquots of these fractions were          electrophoresed using SDS PAGE and Coomassie Blue stain          to identify the protein peak          The polymerase activity in the gradient fractions were          analyzed by extension of the labeled dT            annealed to poly rA template          Every third fraction between  and  of the glycerol          gradient was diluted fold and analyzed for its          polymerase activity Reactions were carried out at C          for  min at  M dTTP concentration and quenched with          Sangers gel loading dye     The reaction products          were resolved by denaturing polyacrylamideurea gel          electrophoresis and analyzed on a

Cinmol dNTP          and  nM enzyme Reactions were incubated at C for           min and terminated by the addition of icecold           trichloroacetic acid containing  mM inorganic          pyrophosphate Following termination the reaction          mixtures were filtered on Whatman GFB filters The          filters were then dried immersed in scintillation fluid          and counted in a liquid scintillation counter                          Gel analysis of RNA and DNA dependent polymerase          activities          The UPBS HIV RNA and heteropolymeric synthetic          UPBS HIV DNA templates primed with the mer PBS DNA          primer were used to assess the polymerase activities of          the wild type and mutant heterodimeric enzymes The          primers were labeled using  PATP and T          polynucleotide kinase according to the standard protocol              Polymerase reactions were carried out by          incubating  nM template primer with  nM of the wild          type HIVRT or its mutant derivative in a total reaction          volume of  L containing  mM TrisHCl pH   mM          dithiothreitol  gmL bovine serum albumin  mM MgCl                     and  M of

resolved          by denaturing poly acrylamideurea gel electrophoresis          and analyzed on a PhosphorImager Molecular Dynamics          Inc                          TemplatePrimer TP binding

derivatives were          determined as described by Tong et al     The          heteropolymeric mer DNA  nM annealed to           Plabeled mer primer  nM was incubated with          varying concentrations of the wild type enzyme and its          mutant derivatives in a total volume of  L containing           mM TrisHCl pH   mM MgCl            and   BSA Following incubation          of the mixture for  min at C equal volume of           gelloading dye containing  bromophenol blue and           glycerol was added The ETP binary complexes formed were          resolved at C on  native polyacrylamide gel using          TrisBorate buffer  mM Tris  mM Boric acid pH           The amounts of the TP in the binary complex ETP          and in free form with respect to the varying          concentrations of the enzyme protein were determined by          PhosphorImager Molecular Dynamics Pharmacia analysis          of the gel The fraction of the bound DNA was plotted          against enzyme concentration and the K           d DNA value was determined as the RT          concentration at which  of DNA is bound                          Ternary complex formation assay          The ternary complex EDNAdNTP formation was          assessed by incubating the binary complexes of enzyme and          dideoxy terminated template primer in the presence of          next correct dNTP     The binary complexes were          formed by incubating  nM of the wild type enzyme or          its mutant derivatives with  nM of  Plabeled          dideoxy terminated mermer templateprimer as          described above The chosen concentration of enzyme was          such that resulted in almost complete shift during ETP          complex formation The ETPdNTP ternary complex          formation was
