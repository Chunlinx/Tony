RURAL DELIVERY AND THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE OBLIGATION AQuantitative InvestigationRobert H Cohen William W Ferguson Spyros S XenakisPostal Rate Commission Office of Technical Analysis andPlanningJuly   Introduction Scope and PurposeIt is widely believed that it costs more to provide rural areaswith postal service than urban areas This belief is basedprimarily on the perception of a cost differential between ruraland city delivery This perception is one of the bases for theargument that a universal service requirement is necessary toassure the continuation of rural delivery or at least the level ofservice currently accorded rural areasThe purpose of this paper is to analyze rural delivery costs andcompare them with city delivery costs Using routine cost datasubmitted in the course of postal rate proceedings Section  ofthis paper compares the cost of rural and urban delivery Section shows the relationship of rural delivery cost to populationdensity Section  analyzes the profitability viz contributionto overhead of serving rural areas and Section  presents someconcluding remarks and a brief summary Before turning to Section some background information on rural delivery and city deliveryis offeredThe views expressed in this paper are those of the authors anddo not necessarily represent the opinions of the Postal RateCommissionAccording to the  Comprehensive Statement on PostalOperations p  USPS delivery costs represent  percent oftotal costs window service and mail processing  percenttransportation  percent and administrative building occupancyand all other  percentThis paper focuses on the detailed comparison of delivery costsbetween rural and urban areas It does not purport to show thebearing if any this cost analysis might have on questionsregarding the complex issue of the postal monopoly whichencompasses many issues beyond the scope of this paper Relation of Rural Routes to Demographically DesignatedRural AreasThe Postal Service has about three times as many city deliveryletter routes as rural routes City delivery routes servegeographic locations within the boundaries of a post office whilerural routes generally serve areas falling outside theseboundaries City and rural carriers are in separate labor unionsand their compensation is determined separately based on differentfactorsThe United States Census Bureau  data reports thatslightly under  percent of the  million people living in theUnited States live in rural areas The remainder live in urbanlocationsIn  the United States postal system provided service to million delivery points City routes served  million and ruralroutes including contract routes served  million deliverypoints A total of  million delivery pointsUnited States cities and the areas served by their post officesoften expand to absorb surrounding areas served by rural routes Ittakes a great deal of time to administratively convert a ruralroute to a city delivery route Thus some rural routes will serveareas annexed by cities and their post offices Bureau of the Census press release CB Dec  As defined for the  census urban areas include aplaces of  or more inhabitants incorporated as citiesvillages boroughs except Alaska and New York and towns exceptin the New England states New York and Wisconsin but excludesthose persons living in the rural portions of extended cities bcensus designated places of  or more inhabitants and cother areas incorporated or unincorporated included in urbanizedareas All nonurban areas are ruralThe Census Bureau reports that in  there were incorporated places with more than  inhabitants In  theUnited States Postal Service provided city delivery to  postoffices but not all were in incorporated areasThe United Nations has estimated that  percent of thepopulation in the more developed nations would live in rural areasin  See World Population Trends and Policies  MonitoringReport The United Nations Department of International Economicand Social Affairs Population Division page  Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations  p Highway contract routes star routes are similar to ruralroutes The difference is that the carrier is a contractor to thePostal Service not an employee Contract routes serve  milliondelivery pointsare residences the remainder are businesses Thus rural andhighway contract routes serve slightly less than  percent oftotal residential delivery points this is the same as thepercentage of the population living in rural areas Description of Rural and City DeliveryAll rural routes use vehicles to deliver to a box placed alongthe roadside and virtually all provide sixdayaweek delivery Arural route is defined in terms of the roads it traverses Homes orbusinesses not located on one of these roads must place a mailreceptacle along the route traveled For this reason boxes willfrequently be clustered where a rural route intersects roads not onthe route In this sense rural service is inferior to citydelivery where service is provided to or in close proximity toeach building servedMost city delivery routes are parkandloop routes Thecarrier on these routes uses a vehicle to drive to various pointsalong the route where the carrier dismounts and delivers to aportion of the route on foot Some city delivery routes calledcurb line routes use vehicles to provide curbside delivery to amail receptacle along the curb as is done by rural routes A thirdtype of city delivery route is the foot routeCity routes are further categorized as businessresidential and mixed business and residential routesBusiness routes consisting of at least  percent businessdeliveries which account for less than one percent of allpossible city deliveries are fivedayperweek routes Mail onall other city routes is delivered six days a week Very few routesservice businesses or residences exclusively For example onresidential routes which account for  percent of all possiblecity deliveries businesses account for five percent of possibledeliveries The percentage of possible deliveries on rural routesthat are businesses is not known Although the activities of cityand rural carriers are similar some minor differences existrural carriers spend about three percent of their total timeproviding retail servicesPossible delivery is used to describe a household or businessaddress including apartments and suites to which mail might bedelivered by city carriers Box is used to describe thereceptacles each family or business sets up on a rural route towhich mail might be delivered The two terms stand for similarconcepts and for purposes of this paper are usedinterchangeablyeg selling postage stamps rating and receiving parcelsetccity carriers provide no retail servicesrural carriers transport mail to and from small post officesalong their route andcity carriers sweep more collection boxes along their routesthan do rural carriers Comparison of the Cost of City and Rural Delivery Comparison of Carrier Time Required to Serve City andRural AreasTable  shows that the average time per day per possibledelivery is  minutes for city delivery and  minutes forrural delivery This small difference would be further reduced ifretail activities of rural carriers were not counted The virtualequality of the average carrier time to serve urban and ruralcustomers is a major finding of this paper Part of the explanationfor this finding can be inferred from table  businesses requireconsiderably more time per possible city delivery than doresidencesThe average possible delivery on business routes requires fivetimes as much carrier time as the average possible delivery onresidential routes There are several reasons for this largedifference in carrier timeBusinesses receive almost three times as many pieces perpossible delivery as do residences The statistics shown in table row  reflect both inoffice and outofoffice delivery timeInoffice time is closely related to volumeIn business areas carriers travel by foot and many deliver inlarge office buildings to individual suitesThis analysis includes only city delivery letter routes Itexcludes parcel post and support routes which primarily servebusiness districts in larger citiesCity and rural carriers typically spend between three and fourhours in the office preparing for deliveryTable Selected Statisticsa for City Delivery and Rural

business routes receive service only days per weekThere are no curb delivery routes in business areas Curbroutes are suitable only for residential areas Table  row shows that they require less time than either foot or parkandlooproutesOn the other hand a direct comparison of rural to cityresidential delivery reveals that rural carrier time per possibledelivery is only ten percent greater than city residential routedelivery time Seven percent higher if retail service costs areeliminated from rural There are at least three major reasons forrural route time per possible delivery being so close to thecorresponding time for city residential routesRural routes are the functional equivalent of curbline citydelivery the most efficient form of city residential deliveryCurbline routes however account for only  percent of cityresidential possible deliveriesRural routes have only  pieces per possible delivery whilecity residential routes have Thus they incur less inoffice costsAs described earlier rural customers who do not live along therural route must place a mail receptacle along the rural routeThus rural mail boxes tend to cluster where roads not on theroute intersect with the carriers route A rural carrier canserve a cluster of boxes much faster than if the individual boxeswere spread out along the route where the carrier would have toslow down stop and accelerate for each oneThus far we have examined carrier time per possible delivery orper box We now turn to the carrier time per piece delivered Table row  shows that carrier time per piece delivered is seconds per piece for all city and  seconds for residentialcity This contrasts with  seconds per piece for rural routesThus on a delivered piece basis rural routes use  percent morecarrier time than do all city routes and  percent more than cityresidential routes The major explanation for this is fewer averagepieces per possible delivery per day for rural routes row Part of the reason for the difference in pieces per possibledelivery may be due to the fact that five percent of possibleresidential deliveries are businesses and it is thought but notknown that a lesser percentage of possible deliveries on ruralroutes are businesses Labor CostThe previous section compared city and rural delivery on thebasis of time This section estimates postal labor delivery costthat corresponds to units of time in order to convert time intomoney in subsequent sectionsThe Postal Service uses both fulltime regular carriers andcasual employees less than fulltime or temporary on its city andrural routes Casual employees are paid lower wages and have fewerfringe benefits Consequently their cost to the Postal Service isfar less than for fulltime employeesFulltime rural carriers compensation is slightly lower thanfulltime city carriers They incur less overtime and the ruralcarrier work force has a higher proportion of casual employees Asa result rural carrier labor cost to the Postal Service in averaged  per work hour or  per minute Incontrast in  city carrier labor cost the Postal Service per work hour or  per minuteThe difference in labor costs for rural and city carriers hasits roots in the development of the two crafts In another postalsystem there might be no differences in the compensation of cityand rural carriers or it might be much larger In the UnitedStates rural wages are generally lower than urban wagesFor purposes of city and rural delivery cost analysis wepresent  a comparison using the actual labor costs of the twocrafts and  a comparison using the average labor costs of allPostal Service collective bargaining employees This will allowboth an actual cost analysis and a resource comparison of city andrural routes The average labor cost per bargaining unit employeein  was  per work hour or  per minute This isvery close to the average city carrier costHighway contract carriers have compensation much lower thanrural carriers Because they are not postal employees we do notinclude them in postal labor costsSee Appendix B for derivation Includes wages premium paymentseg See Footnote  Delivery Vehicle CostRural carriers furnish their own vehicles and provide allmaintenance repairs and fuel for which they are paid anallowance In  rural carriers received an average of cents per mile as a motor vehicle allowance The average length ofa rural route is  miles The average annual cost per rural routeis shown in table Those city delivery carriers who make use of a vehicle arefurnished with one by the Postal Service which also provides allmaintenance repairs and fuel City carriers drive an estimated miles per day Analyzing Postal Service accounts for depreciationfuel and maintenance for city delivery carriers we have estimatedthe average city delivery vehicle cost per routeThis is also shown in table Rural vehicle cost per box or possible delivery is twice theaverage city carrier vehicle cost per possible delivery Ruralvehicle cost per delivered piece is two and a half times citycarrier cost per delivered piece It should be borne in mind thatthough the city column divides total city vehicle cost byIn  the rural carrier vehicle allowance was  cents permile or a minimum of  per day whichever was greater See Appendix Cthe total number of city routes including foot routes only percent of possible city deliveries are made by city carriers usingvehicles Comparison of Direct Labor Plus Vehicle Cost to Serve Cityand Rural AreasTable  combines labor cost with vehicle cost for city and ruralcarriers It shows that when vehicle costs are added thedifference in cost per box per day between city and rural carriersdepends heavily on which labor cost is used Using actual laborcosts the city cost per box per day is  percent higher Usingthe average bargaining labor cost city delivery is  percentlower On a costperpiece basis city costs are  percent lowerusing actual labor costs and  percent lower using the averagebargaining labor costs Relation of Rural Delivery Cost to Population DensityA priori population density should have an important effect onrural delivery cost We have no data available which directlyrelate rural delivery cost to population density but it seems verylikely that boxes per mile is highly correlated with populationdensityIn order to examine the impact of density on cost rural routeshave been divided into quintiles based on boxes per mile Table displays the relevant data It can be seen that there iswide variation between the quintiles In the extreme theaverage number of boxes per route differs by a factor of two Theaverage number of miles differs by a factor of  Average boxesper mile differ by a factor of nine Moreover with the exceptionof daily evaluated time and daily pieces delivered per box theaverage values of all variables change monotonically Thus theyare correlated with boxes per mileTable Distribution of Rural Routes by Density Boxes per MileSelective Averagesa a See Appendix A for sourceThe first or least densely populated quintile stands out fromthe remaining four Its time per box is half again larger than themean for all rural routes and it is nearly two standard deviationsgreater than the mean for all rural routes The other fourquintiles are less than one standard deviation from the meanMoreover the first quintile stands apart in that its secondsper piece is also nearly two standard deviations greater than themean while the other four are all less than one standard deviationfrom the mean Thus the two measures of cost for the firstquintile are substantially greater than for the other fourquintiles This will be seen clearly in Section  where theprofitability of rural delivery is calculated for eachquintileIt would not be surprising to find that the percentage of boxeswhich are businesses increases as population density increases Ifthis is true it could at least partially explain why the number ofpieces delivered per box is so much larger for the fourth and fifthquintile than it is for the other threeFinally the variability or elasticity of time with respect tovolume for the five quintiles differs greatlyAll st nd rd th th Routes     Thus for example if the volume in the first quintile were todouble total cost would increase by  percent The variationbetween quintiles can be explained by greater fixed costs in theless densely populated quintiles than in the more populatedquintiles The time required to drive the route is fixed anddriving time represents a greater proportion of total cost in theless densely populated quintilesFigure  displays the minutes per box per day as a function ofdensity It can be seen that time per box drops off sharply at thelow end of the density spectrum and then it flattensThe daily evaluated time per box for all routes  minuteshas a standard deviation of  minutes The daily evaluated timeper piece for all routes  seconds has a standard deviationof  seconds   In order to isolate the effect of density on time per box theelasticity of time per box with respect to density has beencalculated using the route evaluation factors which are used todetermine rural carrier pay Holding constant the pieces per ruralbox and route miles a one percent increase in density reducesoutofoffice time per box by  percent and total time per boxby  percentThe relation between time per box and boxes per mile densityis exponential or linear in logarithms The Pearson correlationcoefficient between the logarithmic values of the two variables is percent The econometrically estimated constant elasticitycoefficient of a simple log linear model with time per box as thedependent variable and boxes per mile as the explanatory variableis  percent with a t value of  Profitability of Serving Rural AreasThis section addresses the question Does the United StatesPostal Service find it remunerative to serve rural areas Arevenuecost model of rural delivery has been constructed todetermine the profitability of rural delivery by quintile Itssimple structure is presented belowModel for Calculating Profit Loss Per BoxProfit here means contribution to fixed overhead costs overand above paying the fixed overhead of rural deliveryThe model presented here is valid only for an unsubsidizedpostal system such as the Postal ServiceThe simplifying assumption is made that there is no costdifference between city and rural mail with respect to mailprocessing transportation and retail serviceLine the revenue per rural box per day is calculated bymultiplying average Postal Service revenue per piece from theRevenue Pieces and Weight Report for  times the averagenumber of pieces per box per day from table  Line ruraldelivery cost per box per day consists of  labor cost vehicle cost and  indirect costs Labor cost per boxis obtained by multiplying labor cost per minute from Section by the average number of minutes per box from table  Vehiclecost per box per day are from table  Because there are twolabor costs per minute one actual and the other theoretical themodel is used separately for each labor cost and provides twoannual profit loss computationsLine here the model takes into account the cost of gettingmail to the point of delivery eg processing transportationadministrative retail etc This is done by bifurcating theaverage attributable cost per piece into delivery attributablecost and nondelivery attributable cost Rural carrier cost andthe nondelivery attributable cost are then subtracted to arrive ata profit loss per box per dayObservers familiar with Postal Rate Commission costingprocedures will recognize that rural delivery cost per box includesthe attributable and institutional costs associated with thatfunction The Commission found in the most recent omnibus rate caseDocket R that  percent of rural delivery costs areattributable ie vary with volume and  percent areAppendix D presents indirect costs in more detail and shows howthey are calculatedDr John Haldi has brought to our attention that the dailyvehicle cost per box is not the same for all quintiles as wasassumed in an early version of the paper but decreases withpopulation density The estimated daily vehicle cost per box in therevenuecost model now recognizes the density differences among thefive quintilesAttributable costs are the postal costs causally traceable tomail They consist predominantly of volume variable costs Theremaining costs are called institutional costs and they can betreated as fixed In the United States the Rate Commissiondetermines the attributable cost for each class and subclass ofmail Its most recent analysis is contained in the Docket ROpinion and Recommended DecisionThese are the attributable direct and indirect costs arisingfrom the delivery function We have estimated them for purposes ofthis analysis These are total attributable costs minus deliveryattributable costsinstitutional ie nonvariable Because such a largepercentage of the costs are fixed the profitability calculation issensitive to both the average revenue per piece and the averagepieces per box If the postal system operated at a lower scalerevenue per piece would need to be higher to maintain the samerevenue cost balance It is not clear without further analysiswhat would happen to profitability if the system operated at alower scaleThe average revenue per piece for the entire Postal Service isused to estimate the average revenue per box We have noindependent estimate of the average revenue for mail delivered byrural carriers If mail delivered by rural carriers has a differentcomposition compared to the system as a whole profitabilityconclusions would vary In that case the nondelivery attributablecosts would vary in the same direction as revenue but not byenough to offset the revenue changeTable  provides both the input and output for the profitabilitycalculations for all rural routes in  It can be seen that byserving all rural routes and using actual labor costs the PostalService realized an average profit of  cents per box per dayor a total annual profit for all rural routes of  million Toput this figure in perspective the total accrued expenditures forthe Postal Service in  were  billionTable  shows that using the average labor cost for allbargaining employees the profit drops to  million The profitfrom serving all rural routes is obviously highly sensitive to thelabor cost of rural carriers However using either labor costfigure rural delivery was profitable for the Postal ServiceIf in  the Postal Services overall surplus had been muchlarger the profit from rural delivery would no doubt have beengreater Conversely if the year had been one in which the Servicehad a sizeable deficit rural delivery would have been lessprofitable Fortunately for purposes of this analysis the Serviceessentially broke even in  and so the profit fromIn Docket R the variability or elasticity of evaluatedrural route costs with respect to volume was estimated at percent by the Postal ServiceIt does seem clear that the ratio of mail delivered to ruralboxes to mail delivered to city addresses is an important factor indetermining profitability The Postal Service surplus for  was under millionrural delivery need not be interpreted based on the PostalServices overall financial resultsTable  displays the profitability of all five quintiles ofrural routes based on population density using both actualcompensation and average bargaining compensation It can be seenthat the profit per box differs substantially from the first orleast densely populated quintile of rural routes to the fifth ormost densely populated quintile Using actual labor cost only thefirst quintile was unprofitable while using average bargaininglabor cost the first two quintiles were unprofitableBecause the most densely populated quintiles of routes servemore boxes their total profit is disproportionate to their perbox profit Using either labor cost the third fourth and fifthquintiles were profitableGiven the assumptions discussed above rural delivery isremunerative and it is unlikely that it would be abandoned if theuniversal service requirement were eliminated Some observershowever might expect the Postal Service to either drop or reducethe level of service to the boxes in the first or second quintilesof rural routes The first quintile comprises only  percent ofall addresses served by rural and city carriers combined Thesecond serves  percent Concluding Remarks and Summary Concluding RemarksWhile the boxes served by the quintile of routes serving theleast densely populated areas are unprofitable we believe that itis unlikely that the Postal Service would discontinue service tothem or try to decrease their level of service if the universalservice requirement were eliminatedThe total loss on those boxes is small relative to total costsof the Postal ServiceBecause these routes are scattered all over the country boxeson these routes are not easily identifiable without consulting anextensive list Consequently it would be costly for firms toseparate mail addressed to these boxes from their remainingmailThe transaction costs involved in putting pieces addressed toboxes in the first quintile of rural routes in the hands of anotherdelivery firm which would serve these addresses would also behighIf these addresses were dropped from the delivery network itwould likely reduce the volume of mail sent by these addresses tothe remaining portions of the delivery network Thus profitablevolume would be lostPerhaps the above four points are simply underlying reasons forthe truism that for common carriers serving the general populationlarger service networks be they mail package overnight ortelephone are more valuable to customers and providers thansmaller service networks It is no accident that within the UnitedStates United Parcel Service provides ubiquitous service forparcels Federal Express and other overnight carriers do the samefor overnight delivery Moreover the major long distance telephonecarriers also provide ubiquitous service Quite possibly all ofthese common carriers find that sparsely settled portions of thecountry are unprofitable to serve That these organizations provideuniversal service suggests that rural areas would receive postalservice even absent a universal service requirement SummaryIn the United States postal system there is no real differencein the carrier time required to serve city and rural addressesThe average city delivery cost reflects the higher cost ofserving businesses compared to residencesRural delivery cost reflects a lower level of service than citydeliveryUPS does not provide parcel service at the ordinary rate to theAlaska bush where there are no roads and service must be providedby airBecause fewer pieces are delivered per box on rural routes thanper possible delivery on city routes the per piece delivery costis higher for rural routes than for city routesThe cost of delivery per box for the least densely populatedquintile of rural routes is much higher than the average for allrural routesThe revenue from mail delivered to rural areas as a wholeexceeds the cost of handling and delivering that mailThere is a loss on serving the least densely populated quintileof rural routesIt is likely that if the universal service requirement wereeliminated even the most sparsely populated rural areas wouldreceive serviceAppendix A Major Data SourcesA City Delivery Carrier DataThe  city delivery carrier data used in this paper are basedon information from several Postal Service data systems Total citydelivery carrier work hoursa come from payroll hours accountingsystems data made available in the most recent rate proceedingThese work hours are apportioned among city delivery carrier routetypes on the basis of cost allocations from the InOffice CostSystemb an ongoing work sampling system that is used to allocatecosts for certain labor crafts among different activities and ratecategories for ratemaking purposesInformation concerning the total number of possible deliveriesis taken from the  City Delivery National Totals ReportCarrier Cost System CCS data are used to allocate total possibledeliveries among different route types and to determine the averagepieces per possible delivery for different delivery and route typeson letter routes The CCS is used in rate cases to determineattributable costs and associated distribution keys for certaincity carrier activities CCS data are collected throughout the yearfrom over  thousand sampled stops on city delivery letterroutesA Rural Delivery Carrier DataMost rural routes are evaluated routes Evaluated routes arethose routes for which the rural carriers annual salary iscalculated using a set of standard time allowances Time standardsare applied to workload elements eg mileage delivery boxesquantity of mail by shape etc to calculate the total evaluatedtime required to serve a rural route and thus the salary of thecarrier serving that routeTo measure the workload elements needed to calculate theevaluated time a National
