                and how long have you lived there   ive lived in this area for about twenty six years   okay well youre familiar then very well with whats going on there   yes i am   we just moved to North Carolina from Oklahoma and im not yet familiar were out in the country a little bit   uhhuh uhhuh   so its a contract garbage pickup and its all thrown together in this area they dont have that   oh well let me tell you what we have   good   i live in a very progressive county and uh it has we have for the last uh year i suppose had um newspaper pickup but theres always been you know scout troops and that sort of thing interested in doing that because it they get earn a little money and also you know they were helping the environment but the um   uhhuh   the county government then got involved and decided to uh mandate newspaper collection and although theyre still we still give ours to the girl scout troop at our church uh they do have curbside pickup in over the entire county for newspapers   good uhhuh   uh and then in addition to that they   excuse me do you have to bundle it or   uh we we can put it in paper bags thats that makes it okay thats that makes it okay um they used to only recycle let you do it uh tied with string   okay yeah right   but now they do it in paper bags and they do say that it is paying for itself now in the actual municipality of Rockville we moved just outside of it five years ago uh theyve been doing newspaper recycling even longer and they were they had their regular um garbage or you know the the social people pick it up on a separate day and they said that was paying for itself It was paying the extra salaries for those people as well as paying you know the city for doing it   uhhuh well good   but the whole county now and its a large county this is Montgomery County right outside Washington DC um is has begun a program to over a period of the next year to um   uhhuh   have all well not all waste but um plastics um aluminum and other tin cans and uh glass of all colors   um   and its they they will you will they will also be picked up at the curb and it can be put together at one point and weve been doing it in my family for a while by at first at first we were doing it um separating it because most of the facilities that would take it were uh   yes required it yes   required its being separated but theyve got this wonderful new facility now that separates it and they had a drawing of it a diagram of it in in one of the local papers and it works um its like conveyor belts and some of it works by gravity and of course you can imagine the aluminum because its very light weight um you know falls in one place and the glass goes another place and other and tin that would be picked up by metal is just picked up you know some other way   right uhhuh   um and then the plastic um you know go because it just kind of doesnt fall  i mean i guess it keeps going on the conveyor belt or something i cant remember the the design right now but its wonderful because you dont have to separate   uhhuh that is nice and ive read articles here uh about the confusion involved in what is to be put out and what isnt and the problems that uh some of the recycling centers are having because of the slick magazine pages in with the newspaper which they say ruins the whole batch and uh   yeah   the unacceptable plastics in with the plastics which ruins the whole batch and i just wondered     well they do try to control that by giving a little instruction   uhhuh   they do try to say you you know you should have it certain way but um on the the slick newspaper print that comes in with like the Sunday papers and so on they havent really protested magazines shouldnt be as a rule should not be put in but there are always a few of those pages and they must have a better way to do it now because they they havent gotten too upset about that   right uhhuh   in general as long as its the newspaper because theres not you know volume wise maybe it does have to be you know significant volume um percentage before its a serious problem in the plastics um the the county recycling where we take ours now because we dont yet have the curbside pickup um i the the transfer the you know just solid waste transfer station they uh have indicated they only want the two liter plastic soda bottles and or i guess any soda bottles that are plastic uh caps removed and uh milk cartons   uhhuh   um but in fact there is another facility that will take other items the the you know there are little codes on the bottoms of these things uh for plastic and they look its a triangle   uhhuh   with arrows uh and that indicates it can be recycled but there are different grades of plastic and thats probably what youre talking about sometimes some of those plastics cannot be reused in certain ways   right uhhuh   some can now even our grocery stores here we have two different large chains that of the plastic bags but you see im i have a problem with that ill take them occasionally but ive decided   recollecting the the plastic bags yeah we   that ill take them occasionally but ive decided that i will only take use paper which we are we do get a choice because i know thats biodegradable plastic isnt they can reuse it but its really not biodegradable   right uhhuh    right right right well weve had weve been collecting papers here and we uh as new residents we dont have affiliation with uh scout troops and and all that   so yeah yeah   we had a difficult time finding in Charlotte uh a place to finally put them which surprised me and i thought they would be   huh yes i am surprised yeah   uh located throughout the city and weve called and finally found one fifteen miles away      oh not very convenient then   no   well what part do you actually live in Charlotte proper   no right outside north of uh of Charlotte near the university   because my sister lives in Matthews which i think is a little south of Charlotte   is south and and east yes right   yeah well actually its called Charlotte now they used to be called Matthews where she lives  they incorporated it but um i i was thinking that you know i i dont know what she does with hers either   uhhuh well how active how active are the schools there im im an old person Linda grew up uh during World War Two and we saved papers and tin foil and string and everything else and uh did it through the school systems and ive wondered   uhhuh well its its not taken on there as well although the young people i work in the school system so   if theyre really active      i teach in in the high school um the uh we have an environmental club which has just begun at our high school this year and i think maybe the young people are becoming more conscious of the need   uhhuh   um of course its going to get down to if its not made easy as i just described the way theyre going to do it in this county uh theyre making it so easy that you almost cant miss   uhhuh   uh doing it but because you dont have to separate and all that but that seems to be the only way that itll ever really take off is if its not too complicated because people in general are just lazy and   uhhuh   in the schools they are trying to make students more conscious and uh but i think the adults are the ones that have to lead the way and they have required the the students in the cafeterias to recycle but of course you know that it doesnt go all the way they they make the effort they try but i think as the younger children come on maybe theyll be a little more conscious of it and eventually   that that was sort of my point too in addition to being a a good focal or central collection point it does raise the awareness if you do it through the school system and   yes yes it does uh we because they they recycle the styrofoam because thats what most of the uh you know the little trays that they have their dinner you know we used to use those heavy uh plastic or whatever they were metal even trays in in the cafeterias in our schools but but now they have these   right   plastic these Styrofoam ones like they get at McDonalds kind of and um and those are being   uhhuh probably one of the worst things we ever done to ourselves   isnt it awful now but do you know that um   McDonalds is doing uhhuh right   um McDonalds is phasing them out and uh theyre supposedly going to try to recycle those that are still left were talking about   oh yeah   two jillion im sure so eventful it will take a time but um i i just worry about whats going to happen to the next generation um   uh no uh how do you feel about the high schools that you you teach do you feel that they have the right i i get mixed emotions when i see a bunch of uh youngsters throwing things out of the car versus   well many of them do   they theyre talking about environment   i know oh but yeah exactly  that does seem a little bizarre um i i find that   right   there is a percentage of of uh the student body uh that is a a aware active and interested there is uh a much larger percentage still that it hasnt quite you know taken yet um but i think theyre becoming more aware i think what will make the change is um enough of those who are aware and making an effort to do something about it those are going to have to  ridicule those are going to have to  ridicule peer pressure or something   right peer pressure is a big one yeah uhhuh   yeah yeah to to kind of make the effort um   well i yes i am too i am too well Linda i enjoyed talking to you   but i im hopeful well i enjoyed talking to you and i wish i wish you luck there in Charlotte   thank you uh bye     byebye
