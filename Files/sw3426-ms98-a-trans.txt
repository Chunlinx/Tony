                 all right i i like keep forgetting to make these calls ive been on this list for two months and i think ive made four calls   oh really i just oh i just got mine last week and i havent started yet because i wanted to get one first see how it worked   right well they do have some kind of nice prizes and its worth doing and im so mad i think ive had this for two months and like ive said ive made four calls and lot of times we dont answer the phone probably when i get mine early in the evening   really yeah   well were supposed to talk about movies have you been to any lately   i have i was trying to think of the one i went to a couple of weeks ago but i forgot it already   uh i really havent seen one since probably August because uh every weekend in in the fall we go to our high school football game on Friday then we go out with friends after and thats kind of the   oh thats your weekend yeah really   our social  for the but oh i saw uh Robin Hood which i didnt care for   really i didnt see that because i didnt think i would care for it   no and my husband dragged me to it i like i think Kevin Costners a nice fellow and hes nice looking but he just to me is not a very dynamic actor   oh yeah i think thats why a lot of people go to see him though  right right   i guess because he is good looking i dont know oh i saw City Slickers did you see that was a thats the last one i saw i think   yes i did see that and i really enjoyed that   i did too i thought that was so cute and   yeah i thought that was appropriate just for everyone yeah that was great   oh i do too oh i i really enjoyed that   yeah and my daughter went to see that one too so it was fine for her   and right which most of them probably arent  i dont know what my kids see any more my kids are twenty and sixteen so theyve probably seen about everything at this point   so yeah right well thats right probably they have them my daughter is twelve   oh   and we had a sleep over one night they wanted to watch Pretty Woman which i have and i was hesitant and they all had seen it anyway   umhum oh i know it thats the way it is   and theyre all twelve so   we can see some pretty raunchy stuff on on just regular TV without cable or even you know theres no way to protect them any more   yes they do yes they do right but i i love Julia Robertss movies but i didnt think they were great for my daughter   so no right itll teach a great lesson because she ended up so in so well  but it was a fun movie to watch   no really really oh i love Pretty Woman and then i like that one after that where oh what was it it was like a Fatal Attraction thing yeah   oh the scary one oh yeah i didnt see that Predator   i dont remember the name of it but that was so good   oh really   that was really excellent   oh i like scary ones that are realistic   yeah that that was  that was   they say Cape Fear is really frightening too Cape Fear the new one that came out   what was oh i dont know   they say its really horrifyingly scary but uh id never get my husband to that he doesnt like to be scared   really oh  the last scary thing i saw was Misery   oh and my kids both saw that they liked it   i that scared me to death and i watched it at a friends house on video and i was just oh yes it was horrible it was so awful   it was still scary oh my gosh i know that one sounded gross i know my husband wouldnt have stood for that he means he likes Mary Poppins and things yeah   really i like that too i like funny movies and i like scary movies   i do too i really i really like a variety   yeah   where you from   im from New York   oh i was gonna say well my husbands from New Jersey and we lived there for five years when we first got married and so it sound kind of nice so was familiar  your accent   is he really oh yeah yes its so close because im from Long Island so thats close you know thats more related to New Jersey than it is to like Rochester New York those that kind of thing   oh right i dont know they talk up there   yeah different its its different yeah i guess   just uh different umhum well see the accents up there fascinated me because even in his family alone there were several different accents the way they would pronounce words differently   oh really   and and his family they lived in the same house there most of them were twenty or so you know   really and they were all from New Jersey hum   yeah umhum and they lived you know they never moved into apartments when they were young they always stayed at home until they got married it seemed to be the custom up there or they went in the service and so they were together for all that time   really yeah   but they still had the accents differed a little in the family   huh   so and it   when did you live there   uh in the sixties i finally i finally   oh yeah well i was in New York in the sixties  yeah   oh really i converted him to being a Texan i i just thought life would be i knew it was easier back here   are you from Texas   well sort of im an Air Force brat but i was real familiar with Texas i went to college here and everything   oh yeah oh yeah   and i just thought you know we could probably get a better house and life is a little slower a little easier and he loves it he he really would never want to leave so it worked out   it is it is yeah im used to it now so i like   probably hard when you first came   hum   was it hard when you first came   oh yes it was because were here eighteen years   oh my   and you can imagine what Plano was like eighteen years ago   oh i know oh compared to New York oh yes   it was very difficult yeah it was very very difficult i didnt even want to talk   you all transferred   yeah   um   yeah so   i have a friend down the streets from New Jersey and they were he got a
