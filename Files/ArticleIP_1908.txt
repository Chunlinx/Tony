                                 Rashomon in Connecticut            Rarely in the course ofhuman events have so few people lost so much money so quickly There is nomystery about how Greenwichbased LongTerm Capital Management managed to makebillions of dollars disappear Essentially the hedge fund took huge bets withborrowed moneyalthough its capital base was only a couple of billion dollarswe now know that it had placed wagers directly or indirectly on the prices ofmore than a trillion dollars worth of assets When it turned out to have betin the wrong direction poofall the investors money and probably quite alot more besides was gone            But thereally interesting questions are all about why Why did such smart peopleandthe principals in LTCM are smart even if some of them have Nobel Prizes ineconomicstake such seemingly foolish risks Why did the world give them somuch money to play with As Akira Kurosawa could have told us the beginningand end of the story are not enough We need to know the motivations andbehavior in between            LTCM was secretive about how it made money but the basicidea went something like this Imagine two assetssay Italian and Germangovernment bondswhose prices usually move together But Italian bonds payhigher interest So someone who shorts German bondsreceives money now inreturn for a promise to deliver those bonds at a later datethen invests theproceeds in Italian bonds can earn money for nothing            Of courseits not that simple The people who provide money now in return for futurebonds are aware that if the prices of Italian and German bonds happen not tomove in sync you might not be able to deliver on your promise So they willdemand evidence that you have enough capital to make up any likely losses plusextra compensation for the remaining risk But if the required compensation andthe capital you need to put up arent too large there may still be anopportunity for an exceptionally favorable tradeoff between risk andreturn            OK its still not that simple Any opportunitythat straightforward would probably have been snapped up already What LTCMdid or at least claimed to do was find less obvious opportunities along thesame lines by engaging in complicated transactions involving many assets Forexample suppose that historically increases in the spread between the priceof Italian as compared with German bonds were correlated with declines in theMilan stock market Then the riskiness of the bet on the ItalianGermaninterest differential could be reduced by taking out a side bet shortingItalian stocksand so on In principle at least LTCMs computersprogrammedby those Nobel laureatesallowed the firm to search for complex tradingstrategies that took advantage of even subtle market mispricings providinghigh returns with very little risk            But inthe course of a couple of months somehow it all went bad What happened            One version of events makes the principals at LTCM victimsof circumstance Their trading strategy goes this story was basically soundBut there is no such thing as an absolutely riskfree investment strategy Ifthe gods are sufficiently against you if a peculiar nay unprecedentedcombination of eventsdebacle in Russia stalemate in Japan market crash inthe United Statescomes to pass even the best strategy comes to griefAccording to this version there is no particular moral to the story exceptthat  happens            Mostpeople in the investment world however are not that forgiving of LTCM Theirversion of events does not accuse the principals of evil intent but it doesaccuse them of myopia The magic word is kurtosis a k a fat tails Thestory goes like this Everyone knows that there are potential events that arenot likely to happen but will have very big effects on financial markets ifthey do A realistic assessment of risk should take into account thepossibility of these large lowprobability eventsin effect should allow forthe reality that now and then  does indeed happen But the wizards at LTCMso the story goes forgot about reality They treated the statisticaldistributions found by their computers based on data from a period when didnt happen as if they represented the entire universe of possibilities Asa result they greatly understated the risk to which they were exposing boththeir investors and those who lent them money            However knowing the people who ran LTCMwhoto repeat are as smart as they were supposed to beit is kind of hard tobelieve that they were really that naive These were experienced hands notyour typical yearold traders who dont remember anything before Anyone who has lived through energy crisis and debt crisis inflation anddisinflation Reaganomics and Clintonomics has to know that big surprises arepart of life Which brings us to the third more sinister version of eventsthat LTCM knew exactly what it was doing            Heresthe way one investment industry correspondentwho prefers to be namelessputit to me Suppose he says that someone was willing to lend you a trilliondollars to invest as you like What that lender has done is in effect to giveyou a put option on whatever you buy with that trillion dollars That isbecause you can always declare bankruptcy and walk away it is as if you ownedthe right to sell those assets at a fixed price whatever might happen in themarket And because the value of an option depends positively onvolatilitythe uncertainty about the future value of the underlyingassetthe rational way to maximize the value of that option is to invest themoney in the riskiest most volatile assets you can find After all its headsyou become wealthy beyond the dreams of avarice tails you get some bad pressand lose the money you yourself put inbut when you are allowed to make atrilliondollar gamble with only  billion of your investors capital thathardly matters And as my correspondent reminds us the people who ran LTCMunderstood all about this sort of thingindeed those Nobel laureates gottheir prizes for guess what developing the modern theory of optionpricing            This moral hazard version of the story may seem a bit toostark to be believed Did the managers really sit around saying Hey letsgamble with the money those suckers have lent us Actually its apossibility I dont know any of the LTCM players personally but some of thehedge fund types I do know are as my correspondent puts it about as moral asgreat white sharks But anyway never underestimate the power of hypocrisy Itis entirely possible for a man to act in a crudely cynical way withoutadmitting it even to himself Given their enormous incentive to take improperrisks it would actually be amazing if the managers at LTCM didnt respond inthe normal way            But we arestill not quite there For the remaining puzzle is why the world provided LTCMwith so much money to lose All those clever strategies depended oncounterpartson people and institutions who would provide cash now in returnfor the promise of German bonds or whatever later Why were thosecounterparts so willing to play along LTCM as a matter of principle refusedto divulge its assets or strategyso anyone who entered a contract with thefirm was accepting an unknown risk Were these counterpartsmainly big banksand other institutional investorssimply naive            Some of my correspondents say no They thinkthe big boys knew the risks but believed that if LTCM came to grief itscreditors would be protected from loss by the government In effect theybelieve the LTCM story is mainly an updated version of what happened to thesavings and loans in which government guarantees underwrote an era ofhighrolling risktaking True there is no formal guarantee But they believethat there was an implicit understanding that any major financial institutionis simply too big to fail            But I dont buy itEconomists often make the working assumption that the private sector alwaysknows what it is doing that markets do stupid things only when the governmentgives them distorted incentives Its a useful working assumption but it is nomore than that In fact everything I can see suggests that the big boys reallywere naivethat star struck by LTCMs charismatic leader and his prestigiousteam they failed to ask even the simplest questions such as How much moneyhave you borrowed from other people            Of course if you believethat big supposedly sophisticated players can be that foolishor for thatmatter if you believe that they are not foolish but do foolish things becausethe government will always bail them outyou start to wonder whether our wholefinancial structure is as sound as we like to imagine Did somebody say cronycapitalism
