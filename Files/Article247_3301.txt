                                 Deep Throat The Game Is Afoot            Reporter David Daley of the Hartford Courant has found W Mark Feltthe former FBI associate director believed by the late Richard Nixon andvarious other people to have been Deep Throat See Another Bulletin From the Deep Throat Desk Deep Throat Revealed Again and Deep Throat Revealed One Last Time Knowing that Felt had denied beingDeep Throat before Chatterbox wondered aloud earlier this week whether Felt would still denyit Daley did better than wonder In a story published in Wednesdays Courant  Daley tracked theyearold Felt down in California and asked him if he was Deep Throat Noits not me Felt answered                           I would have done better I would have been more effective Deep Throatdidnt exactly bring the White House crashing down did he                        Chatterbox doesnt know what to make of Felts claim that Deep Throat wasineffective but will set that aside for now Daleys story which was pickedup by the Associated Press and MSNBC broke the news that a yearold from Port ChesterNY named Chase CulemanBeckman claims to have been told by Carl Bernsteinsson Jacob that Deep Throat was  Mark Felt CulemanBeckman says that years ago he attended Hampton Day School Camp in Bridgehampton Long Islandwith Carl Bernsteins sons Jacob and Max and that Jacob was the one who toldhim According to Daley CulemanBeckman said the young Bernstein told him theinformation came straight from his dad who of course is one of the threepeople known to be party to the secret The other two are Bob Woodward and BenBradlee            Chatterbox who is increasingly drawn to the hypothesis that Deep Throat wasindeed Felt finds much to like in this story As a father Chatterbox knowsthat children tend to blab family secretsand recalls that Joe Kleinsauthorship of Primary Colors came to light partly as a result of somethings his kid talked about at school And summer camp is a wellknown crucibleof intimacy A paper that CulemanBeckman has written on the subject tells thestory most beguilingly                                             I was in the Herons group along with about fifteen other  and  year olds  One Friday in July we went on a trip to Long Beach SagHarbor and Jacob Max and I ended up sitting in the sand precociously talkingabout politics It was an election year and I was in favor of George Bushbecause he had gone to the Greenwich Country Day School where I was attendingwhile Jacob and Max were for Michael Dukakis although I do not remember whyAt some point the conversation turned to Nixon and Watergate  which I knewlittle if nothing about During the conversation Jacob told me Deep Throatwas Mark Felt hes someone in the FBI Im  sure                                       Still it would be rash to consider CulemanBeckmans paper and Daleysstory dispositive Most crucially CulemanBeckman does not back up Daleysreporting that Jacob Bernsteins information came from Carl BernsteinCulemanBeckman told Chatterbox that the context of the Deep Throatconversation was a discussion about Jacob Bernsteins dad But when pressedCulemanBeckman admitted that Jacob Bernstein hadnt said that Carl Bernsteinactually told him Deep Throat was Mark Felt CulemanBeckman justassumed that was how Jacob knew I think that would be the only way foran yearold child to hear such a name CulemanBeckman told Chatterbox Butthat isnt quite right Its at least as possible that Jacob Bernstein got theidea from his mother  journalistturnedmoviedirector Nora Ephron whohas stated publicly in the past her suspicions about Felt I always thoughtit was Mark Felt the third guy at the FBI she told the SeattlePostIntelligencer in  But Carl would never tell me So I honestlydont know          Sure enough todays New York Post has Carl Bernstein and Nora Ephron bothsaying that Jacob was merely parroting his mothers Deep Throat hypothesisBernstein says that neither Ephron nor Jacob Bernstein knows Deep Throatsidentity any more than the man in the moon does and that Jacob wasrepeating his mothers guesswork Ephron says that Carl never told me whoDeep Throat was which was very smart because I would have told the whole worldby now Ephron and Bernstein had a famously nasty divorce chronicled inEphrons novel Heartburn  later made into a movie with MerylStreep and Jack Nicholson            Incidentally CulemanBeckmans paper unearths a nifty Feltrelated snippetfrom the White House tapes that Chatterbox didnt know about As in the WhiteHouse tapes excerpt Chatterbox previously cited Felt is discussed as a probable leaker Thistime though Nixon who among other things will likely be remembered asAmericas last antiSemitic president expresses horror at discovering Felt tobe Jewish  This conversation dated Oct   is even more Gothicthan the last                           Nixon Well if theyve got a leak down at the FBI why the hell cantGray tell us what the hell is left You know what I mean                        Haldeman We know whats left and we know who leaked it            Nixon Somebody in the FBI            Haldeman Yes sir Mark Felt You cant say anything about this because itwill screw up our source and theres a real concern Mitchell is the only onewho knows about this and he feels strongly that we better not do anythingbecause            Nixon Do anything Never            Haldeman If we move on him hell go out and unload everything He knowseverything thats to be known in the FBI He has access to absolutelyeverything             Nixon What would you do with Felt            Haldeman Well I asked Dean             Nixon You know what Id do with him the bastard Well thats all I want tohear about it            Haldeman I think he wants to be in the top spot            Nixon Thats a hell of a way for him to get to the top            Haldeman You can figure a lot ofmaybe he thoughtfirst of all he has tofigure that if you stay in as president theres a possibility or probabilityGray will stay on If McGovern comes in then you know Grays going to be out            Nixon Is he Catholic            Haldeman unintelligible Jewish            President Nixon Christ put a Jew in there            Haldeman Well that could explain it too             Update   After much pestering online and by phoneChatterbox has finally gotten The Atlantic
