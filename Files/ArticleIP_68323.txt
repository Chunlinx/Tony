                                 Candidates Cagey on Net Issues            Records show former Sen Bill Bradley collected more campaign funds in SiliconValley through the third quarter of last year than any other presidentialcandidate The Democratic contender also netted more contributions over theInternet than anyone else surpassing  million            Butwhere does he stand on the issues that are of importance to the growing numberof Internet users and workers who depend on cyberspace And furthermore willit matter to the electorate            WhileBradley has been mum on some of the key Internet topics other candidates arebetting that digital issues will matter to voters This week Sen John McCainRAriz started taking out campaign ads touting his support for permanentlyextending a moratorium on Internet taxes and protecting children frompornography and other online content The candidate is betting that some of thegrowing number of Internet policy issues will resonate with voters Hespushing his antitax messages in taxfree New Hampshire the antiporn ad hasbeen airing in conservative South Carolina            Experts agree that the year  contest is a new frontier Never before in thehistory of presidential politics have candidates felt the pressure to adopt ahightech platform speak out about protecting privacy over the Internet orsign a pledge vowing they will forever oppose Internet taxes Though clearlynone of these issues yet ranks with electiondeciding topics such as economicdepression war or tax cuts            Webelieve that Internet users are the soccer moms of the  election said RonNehring director of national campaigns for Americans for Tax Reform whichasked all presidential candidates to sign a declaration opposing any Internettaxes Just as soccer moms were the constituency everyone was trying to reachin the  election Internet users will play the same role this year            TheInternet tax issue is a complicated one It pits the interests of dotcomcompanies that dont want to be burdened by collecting taxes on behalf of some different salestaxing jurisdictions against the interests of states andmunicipalities that rely on revenues to fund schools law enforcement andpublic works projects A congressional commission is expected to recommend anational policy in April There are essentially three options Ban sales taxeson Internet purchases leave the status quo in which case it only matterswhere the Internet company is located or give states the ability to go aftersales taxes from outofstate Internet companies            Republican candidates Steve Forbes Orrin Hatch and Gary Bauer have signed thenotax pledge and McCains campaign has indicated he will also sign TexasGov George W Bush has declined While he favors a threetofiveyearextension of the current moratorium he wants to await the recommendations ofthe congressional commission Democrats Bradley and Vice President Al Gore havealso declined to sign the pledge Both have said publicly that they want toawait the commissions report and that they are also concerned about thepotential drain on state and local tax revenues if a ban on Internet salestaxes is made permanent            Thevice president supports finding a solution to these issues that allows theInternet and ecommerce to flourish without stripping states and localities oftheir ability to educate children and fight crime said an administrationofficial The Bradley campaign declined to comment            Nehring predicted the issue could unite a block of Internet voters Its agalvanizing force that will serve to activate Internet users on a politicalissue            Butsome skeptics disagree that any Internet issues will sway the electorate atlarge The issue of export controls on encryption technologies or even thetax issue is not broadbased enough said Michael Cornfield a professor atGeorge Washington Universitys Graduate School of Political Management Onepossible exception is if theres a privacy Chernobyl If there is somedisaster involving a lot of peoples privacy that is the one issue where theInternet would be on the agenda on a mass level  If that happened I thinkall the candidates would be forced to take a position on the issue            Several candidates already have taken public stands or made statements aboutwhether or not they believe the government needs to ensure that consumerprivacy isnt violated by online companies Statements from Gore McCainBradley and Bush indicate they favor holding off on any general privacylegislation to allow industry to selfregulate by posting privacy policiesand developing guidelines to ensure that consumers understand how theirpersonally identifying information will be used Most of the candidates withthe exception of Bush who hasnt yet taken a stand also say that certainrecords including medical and financial information should be protected bylegislation The privacy of children under  is already protected underfederal law Forbes in a speech last month titled The Future of Privacywent further saying he would shut down all federal medical databases and endthe Internal Revenue Service as we know it by imposing a simplified flattax            Notall the candidates are closing the door on more general privacy protectionlegislation in the future For the current period we believe industryselfregulation is the way to go said Tim Adams a technology policy adviserto the Bush campaign But we dont rule out regulation in the future ifindustry fails to do a good job of policing itself            Privacy advocates say they believe the candidates are supporting industryselfregulation in order to appeal to industry interests as opposed to thegeneral population Privacy could clearly be one of the critical issues of thefirst campaign of the  st century said Marc Rotenberg executivedirector of the Electronic Privacy Information Center While a lot of themoney is in selfregulation a lot of the votes will be with legislation            Thepursuit of contributions from the hightech community is one of the reasonsthat some candidates have gone to great lengths to develop a hightechplatform The problem is that in order to appeal to this constituency many ofthe candidates have adopted postures that are eerily alike Most of the majorcandidates favor loosening export restrictions on encryption policy Most favoran international ban on tariffs on Internet purchases and services Most favorforgoing federal regulation at this time in favor of allowing the marketplaceto ensure that consumers have a choice of Internet service providers forhighspeed Internet services            Wheresome of the candidates differ is in support of federal efforts to bridge thedigital divide The Gore camp rightly takes credit for fighting for a federalsurcharge on telephone service with the funds going to help wire publicschools and libraries for Internet service In fact opponents labeled theprogram the Gore tax but even Bush supports the program although hisadvisers say he might make some changes Forbes on the other hand wouldrepeal the surcharge which has helped provide wiring and Internet service forthousands of schools and libraries to date McCain in  publiclycriticized the program saying it will fail to give schools and libraries thelevel of funding they had been led to expect It will fail to stop theinexcusable waste of money on the funds administration And it will fail tokeep consumers bills from going up yet again            TheMcCain camp clearly believes that South Carolina voters will be swayed by hissupport of efforts to keep children away from online pornography and otherpotentially offensive Internet content Hes tapped Republican South CarolinaRep Lindsey Graham to stump for him in an ad running through a laundry list ofMcCains accomplishments including his fight against Internet porn McCain hasbeen an ardent supporter of the controversial Child Online Protection Actwhich seeks to criminalize Web sites that knowingly make harmful materialavailable to minors The act is currently under consideration by a federalappeals court Hes also proposed legislation that would mandate filteringsoftware for public schools and libraries that receive federal funds The Bushcampaign says it would support the McCain filtering bill which has not yetbecome law            Another issue that has candidates staking out positions is the prosecution ofantitrust charges against Microsoft Corp This is also an issue on which theForbes campaign has taken a different position from the other candidatesForbes has chided the government for pursuing the case Hatch who hauled BillGates before a Senate hearing has been raising campaign funds from executivesat some of Microsofts rivals Bauer cited a federal judges recent ruling thatMicrosoft has a monopoly in desktop personal computer operating system softwareas a victory for the little guy Most of the other candidates have tried totread the middle ground The Bush and Gore camps have said they will staysilent on the issue because it is a legal matter and up to the courts not theexecutive branch            Goreduring a highly publicized November visit to the Microsoft campus toldemployees he wouldnt discuss the case But he did say If competition isvaluable which I think it is then antitrust laws have a place in embodyingthe values of our country If dominance in one area is used to prevent thatcompetition in another area thats wrong            Internet proponents saythey are convinced that Internet issues will matter this time around Internetissues are going to be extremely important said Jerry Berman executivedirector of the Center for Democracy and Technology in Washington DC Theelectorate could very well become very concerned about privacy protecting kidsfrom bad stuff on the Net preventing fraud on the Net  and protecting thefree flow of information both here and abroad
