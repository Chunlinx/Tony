                            On the basis of his retrospective at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art it is        evident that Roy Lichtenstein forged a narrow trajectory through the thickets of        contemporary art Unlike some of his protean fellow artists such as David Hockney or Frank        Stella he found his style early in his career and followed its course with almost        scientific precision for his entire life Through an obsessive focus on the techniques of        graphic production he turned popular imagery into a high form of art and an exploration of        the limits of visual perception        The core concept of Lichtensteins art is the iconicdrastic simplification of line and        shadowing to reduce to the Platonic ideal of the object depictedgolf ball truck tire        composition book girl in love or even the basic brushstroke of a daub of paint  The        basic inspiration of these icons is advertising imagery and comic book frames Throughout        his artistic life he drew his imagery from the detritus of printed materialgum wrapper        comics and small ads from the backs of newspapersdeliberately elevating visual sources at        the opposite pole from the high art of the Renaissance His first comic works were        motivated by his sons who challenged him by saying if he was such a great artist could he        draw Mickey Mouse for them Lichtenstein was so stimulated by the result that he worked in        the comic book style from then on Interesting Chuck Close tells a similar story about his        own work although in reverse In his case a group of school kids were not getting his        art and challenged him in the same way to prove his expertise Close passed the test but        continued in his compulsive style exploring the minutiae of the pixel structure in his        grandiose portraits while Lichtenstein explored the iconographic largesse of the new        domain opened up by this challenge        Lichtensteins cartoon style of representation can be seen as an ironic commentary on        the elitism of art implying that art is merely a selection from the endless variety of        images that bombard us His selfmockery is exemplified by the second picture in the        exhibition a sixfoot canvas bearing the letters ART  In this piece Lichtenstein is        explicitly interrogating the artistic community on the boundaries of the concept of art Is        the raw symbol placed in a gallery sufficient to constitute an artistic statement This was        a game that artists had been playing in earnest since the turn of the th        centuryLichtenstein came up with one more variation on the theme His later work consists        of an extensive series of graphic reflections on the themes of classical art from the        second period of Pompeii to the light explorations of the Impressionists to Chinese        landscapes all in his egregious comic book pastiche        The iconic is by now commonplacethe idea that cartoons capture the essence of an image        was popularized by Fred Attneave in   when he drew attention to the way the outline        of an object and indeed the points of maximum curvature of the outline captures most of        the information of the full object image The rest of the image can be thrown away without        significant loss of its import NobelPrizewinning experimental work conducted by David        Hubel and Torsten Wiesel in the late s consolidated this notion with the discovery that        individual neurons in the visual cortex can be characterized as simple line detectors        ie that they are most active when a line of a particular orientation is found in a        particular part of the visual world  The work of Hubel and Wiesel illustrated that        neural processing encodes the most relevant features in complex images Indeed they        discovered a population of neurons called endstopped cells that respond to the ends of        lines and points of high line curvature in the manner required by Attneaves analysis        Interestingly this confluence immediately predated Lichtensteins entre into the world of        the comic book image but the relationship seems to be coincidental in view of the        iconographic symbolism of his choices The likelihood that he had heard of these scientific        developments seems remote particularly in view of the fact that Andy Warhol was following        the same track of using cartoon material reputedly in mutual ignorance of Lichtensteins        breakthrough        Beyond the iconographic Lichtenstein plays with the visual impression derived from        enlarging the halftone dots of the gumwrapper comics Through time the dots become        progressively larger and more insistent emerging from their role as background fillers to        dominate the entire canvas in a dizzying field of scintillations In this sense        Lichtenstein seems to go beyond the role of cultural expositor and gadfly to explore the        sensory implications of the optical redundancy of the printers screen The regular dot        arrays shimmer and scintillate ingraining themselves in our neural memory and projecting        onto the gallery walls and neighboring paintings in a reminder of our visual fallibility        Such effects represent a resonance with socalled optical art op art a style promoted        in the mid sby Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely in particularthat relies on visual        illusion generated at the early levels of the nervous system the retinal the receptoral        the oculomotor and the neural Despite its name it is not concerned with strictly optical        effects such as diffraction diffusion interference scintillation polarization and        related optical phenomena It is concerned with the visual and perceptual effects of        dancing grids jazzy dots clashing colors sliding waves and so on        Many of Lichtensteins effects are a byproduct of the printers screen structure that        is enlarged along with the other details of the printed image structure His work seems to        have been a major precursor of the op art movement although he is not generally identified        as a member of it Indeed he plays with the dotscreen as a theme in his later works        notably in the vast         Mirror in Six Panels  which shows nothing but the mirror surface        reflecting empty space apparently rendered in the transparent sheets of Benday dots in        common use by graphic artists Refreshingly this is one of the few works that does not        contain references to other art genres but jousts with the concept of the image itself        again a reflection of nothing at all        For the visual scientist the most compelling painting in the exhibition may be         Rouen Cathedral Set V   a meditation on Claude Monets        mediation on Rouen Cathedral itself a series of impressionistic paintings of the cathedral        in different lighting conditions Here Lichtenstein abandons the cartoonstyle bravura of        line and text bubbles in a triplet of silkscreen closeups of Monets painterly        impressions differing only in the choice of colors for the three panels The dotscreen        now plays the role of a muslin or gauze curtain through which the cathedral is glimpsed        forming a vibrant haze that formalizes the image space into a kind of crystallized        transparency that never quite settles into known categories of visual experience While the        left and right panels of the triptych are in bold shades of color the central panel is        rendered in accurate redgreen isoluminance As discovered by Richard Gregory form        processing is much weakened when the luminance differences are removed and forms are        represented in colors that are accurately equated for their luminance values  Although        the colors are well seen the form seems to shimmer and fluctuate indicating that the        shapeprocessing mechanisms are not well activated by the pure color differences In        Lichtensteins Monet the shimmer of the isoluminance interplays with the shimmer of the        dotscreen to evoke a visual enigma as we explore the image space to see whether the        structure is indeed the same as in the flanking panels One of the pleasures of art is its        ability to slow down our sensory processing so that we become aware of the processes        themselves not just their symbolic role in our goaloriented lives Very few artists have        played with the power of isoluminance to achieve this role in form processing Lichtenstein        seems to have been on to this property a decade earlier than Gregory although he soon        retreats back to the boldness of his cartoon popart style to explore a potpourri of the        icons of classic sources        There is much more that could be analyzed to place Lichtenstein in an arthistorical        framework but perhaps one should just enjoy the power of the concrete image simplified to        its hightone essentials and projected at large visual angle onto our excitable retinas        One comes away from the exhibit with a sense of the power of raw imagery that one may not        have felt since the gradeschool days of reading illicit comics when one was supposed to be        learning the dates of battle sequences through history But what does Lichtensteins dot        obsession reveal about neural processing Why does repeated finegrain structure wreak such        havoc with our visual stability This question was raised in particular by Donald MacKay        with his highdensity radial ray figure Figure  which generates powerful complementary        effects in both current viewing and as an aftereffect  Just why highdensity dots and        lines elicit such powerful responses from our visual apparatus remains unexplained Indeed        the issue does not seem even to be a topic of current research interest despite the        proliferation of research activities in visual processing in general Contemplation of an        exhibit such as Lichtensteins sparks a realization of the wealth of neural processes still        to be studied and explored
