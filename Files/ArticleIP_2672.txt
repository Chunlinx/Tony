                                 One for My Baby but  for the Road            It isnt quite as much funas it used to be now that tobacco lobbyists are admitting that nicotine isaddictive and smoking is harmful But the flacks at the American BeverageInstitute are doing their best to take up the slack Theyre fighting to stopfederal legislation that would crack down harder on people who drive afterdrinking The measurebacked by Mothers Against Drunk Driving and up for avote as an amendment to the highway bill next monthwould make all stateschange their definition of who is drunk from a person with a minimumbloodalcohol level of  to someone with a level of  percent The ABIscase against the proposal is surprisingly persuasive Well almost            Currently everywhere in the country it is illegal to drive with abloodalcohol concentration of  percent or higher But with alcoholrelatedcrashes claiming over  lives a yearaccounting for  percent of alltraffic fatalities states have dropped that level to  percent NowSen Frank Lautenberg DNJ is leading a push to make the  level anational standard            The ABI says the whole effort is nuts A trade associationfor restaurants that serve alcohol it offers two arguments First itslobbyists say hardly any drinking at all can put you over the limit As ABIspokesman John Doyle says All it takes for a pound woman are two glassesof wine at a restaurant and shes going to jail  just the same as if shedowned a fifth of gin The lower standard will capture perfectly responsiblesocial drinkers and dramatically increase the number of drivers who would besubject to arrest Second they say its the roaring drunks who are out therekilling people Suppose we had people dying at  miles an hour Doyleobserves and I said lets lower the speed limit to  Wouldnt somebody saythats ludicrous            The argument is notunreasonable When Im on duty in the emergency room I see all the victims ofserious car crashes that come through The paramedics wheel them in and startrattling off information while I check their breathing and injuries This isan unidentified whitemale unrestrained driver in a highspeed rolloverunresponsive at the scene You dont even have to wait for the results Youknow hes wasted on alcohol and possibly drugs too Ive never seen a positivealcohol level less than about  percent in these cases It seems likedrivers in crashes are either completely blotto or stonecold sober            Thedamnedest thing is after we save them they hardly ever get arrested fordriving while intoxicated An injured drunken driver is far less likely to becharged than an uninjured one Studies show that  percent to  percent ofdrunken drivers escape prosecution There are many reasons Police have to putthe drivers safety first and ship them off to a hospital following after thedriver is a major hassle and things happen so fast the police sometimes donteven realize alcohol is involved But we know            National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationdata suggest my experience is a bit onesided however About  percent ofalcoholrelated fatal crashes do involve drivers with an alcohol level of percent or higher But  percent involve drivers with a level of  percentor  percentkilling an estimated  people per year            The ABIclaims that theres no evidence that a  level is any more dangerous than a level However a  study in the Journal of Studies on Alcoholfrom the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety showed otherwise It found thatthe risk of a singlevehicle crash for a driver with a bloodalcohol level of percent to  percent is  times that of someone at  percent to percent Higher is certainly worse Drivers with a level of  percentto  percent are  times more likely to crash and those at  percent ormore are  times more likely to crash But getting behind the wheel with a alcohol level is riskymore risky than any other known factor includingyoung age and driving at night            Nonetheless ABIs specter of people ending up in jail fordriving after as little as two drinks is giving some policymakers pause Butthe ABI is using loaded dice to play on our ignorance of alcohol levels Bychoosing a skinnier than average woman and defining each drink as  ounces ofhighalcohol wine they make it sound easy to hit  But two of thesedrinks are equal to about half a bottle of wine            How manydrinks does it really take for your blood to reach  percent alcohol Tomake it simple lets talk in terms of ounce cans of Budweiser about percent alcohol It would take  cans in an hour on an empty stomach to putthe average pound woman over that limit  cans for a pound man Orabout a sixpack in the course of an evening Estimate your own capacity byclicking here These arepeak levels After you stop drinking your alcohol level drops about percent an hour Also keep in mind light beer has  percent less alcoholthan regular beer Wine has anywhere from two to four times as much alcoholbut  ounces of a typical table wine would be about the same as a can of Bud Asingle martini would have about twice as much alcohol as that            Its silly that this is all such a guessinggame In countries such as Australia breathalyzer machines for checking yourown alcohol level apparently are ubiquitous at bars and stadiums Still mostpeople know by now that after a few beers at dinner theyve had too much toget up and drive A  alcohol limit is not going to catch as many peopleunawares as the ABI claims And drinking even less than what it takes to putyou over the  standard is still not entirely safe            Is lowering the legalalcohol level worth it The ABI lobbyists are right that drivers with apercent alcohol level are not the core of the drunkendriving problem Ifpolice get even a large fraction of drunken drivers off the road at most theymight save a few hundred lives This is a drop in the bucket Prosecuting thedrunken drivers who turn up in emergency rooms or offering breathalyzer checksin bars and stadiums would probably save many more            Yet there is no good reasonnot to go with the  standard I am not one of those publichealth types whothinks every hazard should be eliminated I was glad to see highway speedlimits increased to  miles per hour even knowing the greater dangers ofcrashing But the freedom to get behind the wheel after half a bottle of wineat dinner or an evening downing a sixpackor whatever it takes to get yourblood level to  percent alcoholhas little value It is not worth anelevenfold risk of crashing And its certainly not worth hundreds oflives
