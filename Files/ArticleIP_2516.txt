                                 Temperance Kills            First to prevent anymisunderstanding the warning Alcohol when abused is vicious dangerousstuff Each year about  Americans die alcoholrelated deaths No oneshould drink and drive or drink to excess Some peopleteenagers people oncontraindicated medications pregnant women and those who have troublecontrolling their consumptionshould avoid alcohol period And all that youknow already            Here iswhat you may not knowor may know only fuzzily For most people of middle ageand beyond one drink a day helps prevent heart disease and makes you lesslikely to die prematurely After one or for men two drinks bad effects swampthe gooddosage is everything But on average the positive cardiovasculareffect of moderate drinking is not small and it is not in disputeEpidemiologists figure that if all Americans became teetotalers tomorrow about more people might die each year of heart disease So there are lives onboth sides of the equation            One of those lives might just as an examplebelong to my father He is  has mild hypertension controlled withmedication and but for the rare social occasion doesnt drink He has readsome news reports suggesting moderate alcohol use may yield benefits but hisdoctor has never mentioned such benefits and my father has never given athought to changing his drinking habits And in the standard view of publichealth officialdom that is as it should be People should not be encouraged todrink even in moderation and alcohol should not be linked with betterhealth            The trouble is that moderatedrinking is linked with better health We dont know exactly why someevidence suggests alcoholof whatever sort by the way not just redwinestimulates good HDL for high density lipoprotein cholesterol and mayhelp prevent blood clotting But we do know the effects On average if youreover about  a drink a day will reduce your chances of heart trouble            Besidesthe association between smoking and lung cancer I think this is the mostconsistent association Ive seen in the literature says Eric Rimm a Harvardepidemiologist Research has shown heart benefits consistently since the swith Rimm guesses  or  studies of  to  countries by now Notsurprisingly he has a drink on most days            Alcohol also causes harm of course It canincrease chances of breast cancer cirrhosis accidents and so on Heartdisease however is an enormous cause of death improve those odds and thenet effect is significantly to the good Last December the New EnglandJournal of Medicine reported the results of the biggest and probably bestmortality study yet conducted one that followed almost half a million peopleover nine years It found that after netting out all causes of death moderatedrinkers over  were  percent less likely than nondrinkers to dieprematurely            Butthere are a lot of people like my father out there uninformed or vaguelyinformed or not thinking about it In  a free market advocacy group calledthe Competitive Enterprise Institute commissioned a survey asking peoplewhether they believed that scientific evidence exists showing that moderateconsumption of alcohol approximately one or two drinks per day may reduce therisk of heart disease for many people Only  percent of those who respondedsaid they did and a majority of those believed wrongly that the potentialbenefits come only from wine            The evidence on alcohol and health is now morethan  years oldso why the confusion Two groups have a stake in getting theword out but one of them the alcohol industry is effectively forbidden to doso Every bottle of alcohol carries agovernment warning label and the Bureauof Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms has never permitted ads or labels to carry anyhealth claims even mild ones For more on rejected health claims click here            Given that the governmentrestricts health claims even for innocuous foods such as orange juice and eggsits reasonable to decide that booze merchants are the wrong people to entrustwith public education about drinking That leaves only one other constituencyfor getting the word out the public health community Its approach howevermight charitably be called cautiousor less charitably embarrassedmumbling            Forexample the authors of the aforementioned New England Journal studycharacterized their finding of a  percent mortality reduction as slightThe accompanying editorial called it small I phoned Michael J Thun one ofthe studys authors and an epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society andasked him whether a  percent mortality reduction is indeed small in the worldof epidemiology Its a sizable benefit in terms of prolonged survival hesaid Why not say so Messages about alcohol dont come out the way you saythem when theyre broadcast he replied Theres been a very long history insociety of problems with alcohol            The British health authorities in their guidelines Sensible Drinking say that people who drink very little or notat all and are in an age group at high risk for heart disease should considerthe possibility that light drinking might benefit their health But Americanauthorities balk even at such a modest suggestion            And sothe US official nutritional guidelines say just this about potentialbenefits Current evidence suggests that moderate drinking is associated witha lower risk for coronary heart disease in some individuals They then go onto recite a litany of risks for the text click here Similarlythe American Heart Associations official recommendation advises If youdrink do so in moderation It goes on to say heart disease is lower inmoderate drinkers but then warns of other dangers and cautions againstguidelines to the general public that encourage drinking for the full textclick here See for yourself but I think the message most peoplewould get from both sources is Drinking isnt all bad but eschew itanyway            Iasked Ronald Kraussa doctor who as theimmediate past chairman of the American Heart Associations nutritioncommittee helped write that statementwhether it was aggressive enough Wedont have much leeway around that one or two drinks a day  he said andwhat isnt known is whether encouraging moderate drinking will also encourageexcessive drinking            Thepublic health people understandably dread creating more drunks more brokenmarriages more crime more car wrecks When somebody calls you up sayingYoure putting out a message to people to drink and my daughter just gotkilled last night because of some drunk thats the other side of theequation Thun says There are substantial numbers of people out there whoare looking for justification to drink more than they should            Areal worry But there are lives again onboth sides of the equation The question then is what would happen if thepublic health folks ran a campaign saying for example Just One Drink orDrink a LittleNot a Lot Would peoples drinking habits improve or wouldwe create a nation of drunksor what The answer is Nobody knows What issurprising given the public health communitys usual eagerness to save livesis that no one is trying to find out It is simply assumed that too many peoplewill do the wrong thing            Peoplehave a very hard time with complicated messages says Thun No doubt somepeople do But is it really so hard to understand that a glass a day may helpsave your life if youre of middle age or beyond but that more than that isdangerous Presumably an avoidable heart attack is equally tragic whether thecause is too much alcohol or too little To continue todays policy ofmuttering and changing the subject verges perilously on saying not just thattoo much alcohol is bad for you but that ignorance is good for you                           ENDNOTES                                       Note
