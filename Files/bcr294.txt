                    Synopsis                  Introduction          A complete understanding of the genetic events          involved in breast tumorigenesis and their heterogeneity          in relation to stage specificity will be critical to the          development of successful treatments This laboratory and          other workers recently reported the presence of a novel          LOH region in band p in nonsmall cell lung          carcinomas glioblastomas and invasive breast carcinomas             This current study uses informative loci in          p to investigate the stage specificity and extent          of molecular heterogeneity exhibited by this locus in          breast cancer progression These results are analyzed in          conjunction with other LOH data available for markers on          p p q p p and q in an effort to place          chromosome p alterations on the breast cancer          progression pathway                          Materials and methods          The material used in this study consisting of          formalinfixed paraffinembedded tissue from the          archives of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology has          been previously described   Tumors were selected at          random for those with the presence of lesions          representing multiple stages of breast disease within          individual patient samples Ninetysix foci representing          normal intraductal and infiltrating tumor were          microdissected from  tumors Matching normal and tumor          DNA were subjected to polymerase chain reaction          PCRbased LOH analysis using two p markers          DS and DS and one p marker DS          Forward primers were synthesized with either a          fluorescent FAM tag DS and DS or a          fluorescent TET tag DS on the  end PCR reactions          were performed in  l with aliquots of normal and tumor          DNA using a PCR protocol consisting of C for  s          C for  s and C for  min for a total of           cycles Horizontal ultrathin high throughput          fluorescencebased DNA fragment gel electrophoresis          GTI Genesys Technologies Inc Sauk City WI USA          was applied to the separation and analysis of          PCRgenerated alleles as previously described            Allelic ratios were calculated and expressed as a          percentage of loss of intensity for the tumor allele          compared with the corresponding normal allele Dvalue          after normalization                          Results          A total of  foci were analyzed for LOH at several          polymorphic markers in p The overall frequency of          LOH in p was   When analyzed by tumor          stage LOH on p was found in   of ductal          carcinoma           in situ DCIS foci  of          invasive ductal carcinoma IDC foci  and            of metastatic disease A schematic diagram of these          results appears in Figure           We also examined the extent of heterogeneity          associated with chromosome p LOH Fig  In tumors          where information was attainable for two or more disease          stages   displayed a pattern of classic clonal          progression LOH first appeared in the DCIS stage for the          majority Four tumors  were however interestingly          identified with genetic heterogeneity for chromosome p          events where DCISidentified events were not found in          associated invasive foci Genetic events involving          chromosome p sequences thus do not follow a classic          progression paradigm in  of tumor cases analyzed as          part of this study                          Discussion          Significant LOH on chromosome p  suggests          the presence of a putative tumor suppressor genes with          an important role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer          These measured allelic deletions represented alterations          confined to p and not whole chromosome  loss          based on results using marker DS although the          presence of simultaneous but independent LOH on q was          not examined It was discovered by analyzing multiple          foci occurring simultaneously within individual tumors          that chromosome p events occur at a significant          frequency  early in the tumorigenic process making          LOH at chromosome p one of the most common known events          in DCIS tumors A slightly higher frequency of LOH in IDC          tumors  as well as in the small number of metastatic          samples studied further supports this early event          hypothesis The majority  of these breast tumors          progressed in a clonal fashion Four cases  were          however representative of genetic heterogeneity Such          heterogeneity at multiple loci may account for treatment          failure and a combinatorial histological and genetic          approach with sufficient information on survival and          response profiles may provide more effective disease          prevention and cure in the future                            Full article                  Introduction          The molecular pathogenetic pathway of breast tumor          progression is not yet clearly defined Although LOH at          chromosomes  p q q p p q  q q           q q and X have all been reported    their          relationship to known genes and more specifically to          different stages of breast disease is still under          investigation Studies in benign fibroadenomas and          fibrocystic disease showed no LOH on p p q p          p q or q   However  of ductal hyperplasias          and  of atypical ductal hyperplasias exhibit LOH            suggesting that these foci are benign lesions resulting          from the alteration of tumor suppressor genes          Furthermore the discovery that morphologically normal          terminal ductlobule units adjacent to breast cancers          exhibit LOH in up to  of cases when analyzed with          chromosome p markers indicates these genetic events can          be cryptically present before histopathological          abnormalities are identifiable            These aforementioned studies and other research          support the idea that events affecting tumor suppressors          can occur early and that preinvasive DCIS can be a direct          precursor of invasive carcinoma a paradigm supported          pathologically by the frequency of DCIS lesions found in          areas adjacent to invasive breast cancer   These          same analyses also confirm the complexity of this          disease Examination of multiple lesions from individual          tumors for example reveals the presence of intratumoral          heterogeneity     Markers on chromosome p in          one study demonstrate loss of opposite alleles in          different ducts while examples of ducts retaining both          alleles were also found   An extensive analysis of          markers on chromosome p showed LOH early in breast          disease DCIS although examples of late stage LOH          without concomittant DCIS involvement were also found            This indicates that different components from an          individual tumor can represent genetically divergent          clones even at the preinvasive stage of DCIS The          heterogeneous nature of breast cancer alterations could          have important implications for the development of          targeted therapies          If LOH events define a localized region of increased          risk for carcinoma the presence of LOH may be clinically          important A complete understanding of all the genetic          events involved in breast tumorigenesis and their          heterogeneity in relation to stage specificity will          therefore be critical to the development of successful          treatments This laboratory and other workers have          reported the presence of a previously unidentified region          of LOH in band p in nonsmall cell lung carcinomas          glioblastomas and a small series  of invasive breast          carcinomas    The current study uses informative          loci in p to investigate in microdissected          material the stage specificity and extent of molecular          heterogeneity exhibited by chromosome p in breast          cancer progression A series of  tumors from which           multiple stages of disease have been microdissected          including normal DCIS and IDC material were studied          Associated metastases were also examined in some cases          These results were analyzed in conjunction with other LOH          data available for markers on p p q p p and          q in an effort to place chromosome p alterations on          the breast cancer progression pathway                          Materials and methods                      Patient material            The material used in this study consisting of            formalinfixed paraffinembedded tissue from the            archives of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology            has been previously described   Tumors were            selected at random for those with the presence of            lesions representing multiple stages of breast disease            within individual patient samples Ninetysix foci            representing normal intraductal and infiltrating tumor            were microdissected from  tumors Onehalf of the            patient samples contained both DCIS and IDC components            Seven patients had metastatic tumor tissue available in            addition to both DCIS and IDC material while five            patients had invasive component material with            corresponding metastatic disease Aliquots of DNA from            these microdissected lesions were used as the source            template for PCRbased LOH analysis                                LOH analysis            Matching normal and tumor DNA were subjected to            PCRbased LOH analysis using two p markers            DS and DS and one p marker DS            These markers define a region on chromosome p            previously shown to undergo LOH in invasive ductal            breast carcinomas as well as nonsmall cell lung            carcinomas and glioblastomas    Forward primers            were synthesized with either a fluorescent FAM tag            DS and DS or a fluorescent TET tag DS            on the  end PCR reactions were performed in  l            with aliquots of normal and tumor DNA using a PCR            protocol consisting of C for  s C for  s            and C for  min for a total of  cycles                                Horizontal ultrathin gel electrophoresis            Horizontal ultrathin high throughput            fluorescencebased DNA fragment gel electrophoresis            GTI Genesys Technologies Inc was applied to            the separation and analysis of PCRgenerated alleles as            previously described   One microliter of amplified            material was combined with  l formamide loading dye            Amersham Inc Piscataway NJ USA prior to            electrophoresis ROX  fluorescent size markers             l ABI Foster City CA USA were added to amplified            tumor DNA to allow sizing of alleles Samples were            heated to C loaded on the  m  horizontal            polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresed for  h and             min at  W in   TBE using the GTI Data were            collected while running the electrophoresis and stored            using the accompanying Cartographer data analysis            software program which extracts the pixel intensity of            individual peaks present in a lane trace allowing for            sizing of alleles and quantitation of fluorescent peak            areas In determining whether allelic deletion had            occurred at individual markers allelic ratios were            calculated and expressed as a percentage of loss of            intensity for the tumor allele compared with the            corresponding normal allele Dvalue after            normalization When the allelic ratio in the tumor DNA            was reduced by greater than  DO from that found            in the normal DNA the sample was denoted as having LOH            at that locus                                    Results                      Chromosome p LOH in breast cancer            progression            A total of  foci were individually microdissected            from  breast tumor cases and analyzed for LOH at the            polymorphic markers DS and DS spanning            p These microdissections resulted in normal            DCIS and IDC material from most tumors The overall            frequency of LOH in p as measured for any stage            of disease using DS andor DS was              This is significantly higher than the             frequency originally reported using nonmicrodissected            IDC samples   suggesting that allelic deletion            events may have been masked by contaminating normal            stroma in earlier studies A low frequency  of            microsatellite instability was also detected at marker            DS These microsatellite instability results were            confirmed in at least two independent experiments and            correspond to previous published results for this            marker              LOH on p was found when analyzed by tumor stage            in   of DCIS foci  of IDC foci             and   of metastatic disease A schematic            representation of all tumor foci studied appears in            Figure  The magnitude of LOH detected indicates that            alterations in this region generally occur early in            breast cancer progression In four cases cases               and  however LOH was not detected until the            invasive stage and in two cases cases  and  LOH            was only detected in metastatic disease Fig  This            suggests that allelic deletion in p may also            arise late in progression albeit with less frequency            Such heterogeneity in the stage specificity of genetic            events has also been shown for other chromosomal            regions harboring tumor suppressor loci                           The extent to which LOH is specific to band p            was determined by analysis with marker DS This            marker resides at the border between bands p and            p approximately  cM proximal to DS Of            the  tumor foci with LOH at p and for which            DS was informative   retained            heterozygosity at this p marker The majority of            measured deletion events being detected are thus            intrachromosomal events rather than loss of the entire            chromosome                                 Heterogeneity of p LOH in breast cancer            progression            Previous genetic studies have shown that            heterogeneous pathways exist for breast cancer            progression    We could examine by studying            multistage individually microdissected tumor components            from the same specimen the extent of heterogeneity            associated with chromosome p LOH Fig  In tumors            where allelic loss information was attainable for two            or more disease stages   displayed a pattern            of LOH indicative of a classic clonal progression LOH            first appeared in the DCIS stage for the majority of            these cases cases       and  Four            tumors were however interestingly identified with            genetic heterogeneity for chromosome p events LOH            detected in the DCIS component was not found in the            associated IDC component in two cases tumors  and             suggesting that the invasive foci arose from cells            other than those associated with the analyzed DCIS            focus Microsatellite instability and LOH distinguish            multiple pathways of progression in the remaining two            tumors cases  and  Thus although genetic events            involving chromosome p sequences most often follow a            classic progression paradigm a significant proportion             do not                                Correlations of allelic loss in chromosome            p            Realizing that loss on p is only one part of the            complex genetic profile for breast cancer we sought to            discover whether genetic alteration on this chromosome            correlated with LOH in other regions known to undergo            allelic deletion in cancer These tumors had previously            been shown to have undergone allelic deletion on            chromosomes p  p  p  q             q  p  and q  The LOH results            specifically for those tumors also showing detectable            chromosome p LOH are presented in Figure  In every            instance where information was available LOH on            chromosomes p region CCADS p region            DSDS p region DSDS            including p and q region THRADS including            nm was present when p LOH occurred Chromosome q            LOH region DSDS in contrast was only            found in  chromosome q DSDS in             and chromosome p region DSDS including            TH in  of tumors also having p LOH These            frequencies suggest that alterations on chromosome p            occur more often in the presence of alterations            affecting regions containing such tumor suppressors as            p p   and p p   while events on            chromosomes q q and p occur more            independently                                    Discussion          Current knowledge about the progression of breast          cancer reveals that by analogy to colon and brain          tumors genetic aberrations can occur in a disease stage          or grade specific manner Clonal evolution is however a          dynamic process from which clones that are not          necessarily committed to a malignant phenotype can also          emerge resulting in genetic heterogeneity in the tissue          Such genetic heterogeneity has been described for          multiple loci in breast cancer                providing an understanding of the complex picture of          breast cancer pathogenesis Such an understanding is          necessary if detection of LOH or other genetic          abnormalities will ever allow for consistent and useful          identification of preinvasive breast lesions at higher          risk of progression          The present study investigated stage specificity and          level of genetic heterogeneity of LOH events in a new          region p involved in breast cancer Significant          LOH for chromosome p  was discovered using          microdissected foci suggesting the presence of a          putative tumor suppressor genes on p with an          important role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer The          frequency reported in the present study  is          significantly higher than the original reported frequency          of    and most probably reflects the superior          separation of tumor cells from normal contaminating          tissue using a microdissection protocol A series of          unrelated microdissected DCIS tumors for which no          invasive component was present also show this high LOH          frequency  when measured at p data not          shown suggesting the  frequency reported in the          present study is not a consequence of analyzing samples          containing multiple stages of disease These measured          allelic deletions represent alterations specific to          p and not entire chromosome  events based on          results using marker DS although the presence of          simultaneous but independent LOH on q was not          examined          It was discovered by analyzing multiple foci          occurring simultaneously within individual tumors that          chromosome p events occur at a significant frequency           early in the tumorigenic process making LOH at          chromosome p one of the most common known events in          DCIS tumors For  of the cases in which multiple          stages of disease arose simultaneously and for which          information on at least one marker was available p          LOH in the DCIS component could also be found in the          invasive component isolated for analysis Fig  This          suggests that the majority of breast tumors progress in a          clonal fashion Four cases  were however          consistent with genetic heterogeneity at this chromosomal          region These latter observations argue that invasive          foci of an individual tumor can represent genetically          divergent clones rather than progressive stages of the          disease Such conclusions are further supported by flow          cytometric and comparative genomic hybridization analyses          on primary and metastatic disease components             In the comparative genomic hybridization study             of metastatic lesions showed a high degree of clonal          progression from the primary tumor whereas  did not          These frequencies parallel the  clonal          heterogeneous progression frequencies reported for          chromosome p events in the present study          We are not yet at a stage in our understanding of          breast disease such that genetic alterations can          substitute for the histopathology of the lesion A          combinatorial histological and genetic approach with          sufficient information on survival and response profiles          may however make for more effective disease prevention          and cure in the future The power of genetic profiles in          prognostic relevance has recently been shown by Emi           et al   Studying  loci in           women Emi           et al found that LOH at markers          p q p and q as well as two pairs of          markers pp and qp had significant          prognostic value and carried significant relative risk of          death It would be interesting given the high frequency          of LOH discovered for chromosomal region p in this          report to include this marker along with these regions          to determine its usefulness as a predictive risk marker          in breast cancer          To that extent it was interesting to view a partial          genetic profile for other regions of LOH in these tumors          when chromosome  LOH was present Chromosome p LOH          always occurred in conjunction with LOH on p p p          and q independent of tumor stage suggesting this group          of loci were critical to the development of breast          cancer Allelic deletion on chromosomes q q and p          occurred less consistently   and           respectively suggesting these regional events are more          varied depending on the stage andor type of tumor foci          analyzed Of further interest is the putative tumor          suppressor gene DAL which has recently been mapped to          chromosome band p   It will be important to          learn more about the function of this gene and its          potential mutational profile in breast cancer Future          studies will determine whether this or another tumor          suppressor gene is the target of the high frequency of          allelic deletion measured in this study for breast          cancer                            Abbreviations        DCIS  ductal carcinoma         in situ  IDC  invasive
