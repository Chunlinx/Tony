                                 The Old Carolinians            If you stick around CapitolHill long enough anything can happen And during the past few weeks it didSens Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helmsthe villainous superannuatedCaroliniansbecame Statesmen            Lastmonth the yearold Thurmond was feted for breaking the Senate longevityrecord  years and  months if youre counting There was an outpouring ofbipartisan piffle the gist of which was that Thurmond is an American miraclea South Carolinian hero a model for politicians everywhere His career wasmuch applauded He won an election  years before Bill Clinton was born Hechallenged Truman for the presidency Why hes old enough to be Bob Dolesfather            Jesse Helms too is now flirting with respectability Aschairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hes become the object ofmuch veneration Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who dutifully traveledto North Carolina to kiss his ring waxes fondly about her new friend JesseRepublicans and Democrats commend Helms for his good sense flexibilityand bipartisanship  When he struck a deal last week to repay some but notall of the United States UN debts senators on both sides hailed hiscompromise Even his latest act of spite the attempt to derail William Weldsnomination as ambassador to Mexico is being interpreted charitably byconservative pundits as a sign of Helms commitment to a tough antidrugpolicy            Therehabilitation of Strom and Jesse is Washington politesse of the worst sort atwisted InsidetheBeltway version of ancestor worship Call it the Grand OldMan Theory Anyone whos served as long as Strom or Jesse has cant be all badHeres a reminder Thurmond and Helms are all bad They have done asmuch to despoil American politics as any two men living and theyre anembarrassment to the Senate            In  years of public office Thurmond hascompiled a perfect record He has done nothing that can be called anachievement His career is an unblemished half century of efforts to impedeprogress inflame race relations and squelch good government So what has hedone Thurmond ran for president in  on what is politely called a statesrights platform or accurately called a segregationist platform He conductedthe longest filibuster in Senate history in a vain attempt to stop acivilrights bill one of many civilrights laws he opposed Heconcocted Richard Nixons  Southern Strategythe tacit appeal to whiteracism that became the blueprint for future Republican presidential candidatesThurmond incidentally was mentor to Lee Atwater the nastiest politicalstrategist in recent memory Atwater had to die to get rehabilitated Thurmondjust had to get very old            Thurmonds apologists insist that he has mellowed And he has sort of Heabandoned segregationism when South Carolinas blacks became a powerful votingbloc throwing his support behind the Martin Luther King Jr holiday hiringblack staffers and recommending a black man for appointment as a federaljudge But his racial politics can scarcely be described as uptodate A fewyears ago I interviewed him about a black exstaffer who had won fame as atalkshow host Thurmond told me that the staffers success showed what thosepeople could do This is considered great progresswhen a politician advancesfrom Neanderthal man to the Stone Age            As a legislator Thurmond has been a zero He doesnt havea significant bill to his name He does however have other things to hisname such as the Strom Thurmond High School Strom Thurmond Student CenterStrom Thurmond Federal Building Strom Thurmond Auditorium Strom ThurmondEducational Center Strom Thurmond Dam Strom Thurmond Lake Strom ThurmondHighway Strom Thurmond Soldier Service Center etc In short Thurmond spentthe first threequarters of his political life as an ardent segregationist andporkbarreler and the last quarter merely as a porkbarreler Is that a recordto honor            Thereseven less to admire about Helms As a campaigner Helms has contributed as muchas any senator to the corruption of the election process He pioneered theabuse of direct mail sending inflammatory fundraising letters to millionsof conservatives Hes notorious for massive campaign spending He set a recordin  by spending  million to win reelection Helms has perfected thestealth campaign He relies almost exclusively on television ads eschewingrallies public appearances press conferences debates and the other nicetiesof traditional politics In his  campaign for example he would respondonly to faxed questions He has been equally destructive as a legislator Afervent antiCommunist he championed rightwing despots across Latin Americaincluding deathsquad leaders He was also the chief US defender of SouthAfricas apartheid regime And his antigay antiabortion antiNEA rhetorichas lowered standards for political civility            These days Helms allies are trying to presenthim as a moderate accommodating figure but that image wont stick Helms isan absolutist and he doesnt stop till he gets his way He only knows thepolitics of the truncheon a quality thats tolerable in a backbencher butterrifying in a leader Helms can barely stomach the democratic process Lastyear for example he held up  ambassadorial nominations to force theadministration to consider his State Department reform package This spring heattempted to prevent the Senate from voting on the Chemical Weapons ConventionAnd rather than persuade colleagues that Weld doesnt deserve to be ambassadorHelms is trying to spike the nomination by not scheduling a confirmationhearing            So why are Helms andThurmond getting a free pass Thurmond is so old that its considered bad formto criticize his sorry record or dredge up his racist past Or to comment onhis current incompetenceits an open secret on the Hill that Thurmond haslost it His staff shepherds him from meeting to meeting writes his publicstatements and cleans up after his many gaffes such as his attempted pass atSen Patty Murray Helms benefits from a more curious phenomenon the vagaryof the news cycle Hes been meanspirited and vicious for so long that editorsand reporters are tired of hearing about it They need a new story about himSo voil Jesse Helms has matured into a diplomat            Thurmond and Helms each wonreelection in  but this is likely to be the last term for both Thurmondannounced a few weeks ago that he wont run again Helms who will be  whenhis fifth term ends is increasingly frail He too may retire Januarythats when we should celebrate Thurmond and Helms because thats whenthe Senate will finally be rid of both of them
