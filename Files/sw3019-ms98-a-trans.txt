        okay   first how much television watching do you do   so i do a little bit more than i think usual people do because i am here alone during the day and i like it just for the noise   uhhuh thats right but do you actually watch it and pay attention to it or is it more of a company   um um it just depends on what it is i mean i have my favorite things that i do and thats a fun thing to do sometimes but um what about you   umhum umhum okay right well actually i i work full time and when im not working im running and i dont watch a lot of television and im very selective in what i watch if theres something that i absolutely   right   want to watch i will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off i probably watch television four hours a week   well see thats great yeah   max and uh if if i dont find something that i really want or really want to watch well then i just do not turn it on i would rather listen to music   well right   part of it is that uh i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis and i think that if were doing other things and these programs come in sometimes they influence us and we dont know where that influence came from   well i think that well part i think thats partially true i think you have to have the will and the and the um   yeah   anyway i think it you you could be susceptible to stuff and it has to be reinforced at another level too but anyway what would you watch if you had you know this week to watch i mean do you like specials   uh right right right of course i uh thats right i uh well last night for example i really wouldve liked to have watched Unsolved Mysteries those are fascinating to me if i have the opportunity i watch it unfortunately i was with someone else who was flipping channels i hate that   oh oh   i do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor   oh right yeah   in our comedy programs although nobody can appreciate comedy any more than i can but i would prefer to find a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians   well we have cable also and and sometimes you can um get the uh HBO specials and sometimes those are really   uhhuh thats right and some of those are fine programs uhhuh   pretty hysterical so i i like to watch comedy i mean you know thats something but im not real up to date on whats going on now i i guess i have my old favorites that i   uhhuh i i enjoy comedy umhum umhum umhum   hooked into i mean you know like Bob Newhart still on on one channel and uh you know something on that level i i also enjoy um i dont know its Sunday morning   umhum i enjoy that umhum umhum   its channel thirteen i watch a lot of thirteen uh The McLaughlin Group and i i just laugh i mean i think its so hysterical these guys its just so much fun its just   umhum umhum thats right umhum     its just a lot of fun watching that i mean i dont agree with a whole lot of stuff they say  but its fun you know so yeah i watch to be entertained i really do   umhum right right well yeah i watch it for entertainment but i also watch it for uh cultural impact i do a lot of channel thirteen channel three some of the educational channels and i watch for special programs that have special a special play a special concert uh i recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars   oh now that was fabulous and that you know yeah yeah   uh and it was fabulous i just absolutely you just held you breath in some of those uh Patavani and uh  oh i was just   yeah i know so   makes chills all over you so i i may or may not even look at the TV guide but if i have time i may flip through and say hey this looks good if i finish this task i can watch that in an hour uh if the hour comes and i dont get a chance to watch it so what   you know well theres certain things i mean ive got um my TV in the kitchen here and um you know if theres something like cooking shows i love to watch cooking shows   umhum umhum i do too it makes me want to cook and then i eat and then i get fat so i just let other people watch when i eat what they cook   i i really do i know  i i yeah and and theres some um in fact one of the watercolor shows on now has inspired me to take watercolor lessons you know so   oh i think thats marvelous yeah oh yeah i took a lot of my college courses i took some of my college courses on television so that its very successful for some of those things but i think i really got stung very badly   you know things like that you you get a whole whole lot of exposure yeah yeah oh   about having influence in your life or at least ive i saw a very bad example of having television influence your life uh my husband had an aunt who was addicted to the soaps and i want you to know that became the most suspicious cantankerous contrary old woman that ever was i mean she   uhhuh she thought she was   absolutely i dont know who she thought she was but she just got to the point where you could might near you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice and that attitude being demonstrated   yeah   and for her to miss a soap was was a big withdrawal and   oh well see thats you you you but she was probably depressed to begin with you know what i mean  yeah grumpy to begin with   well i dont know well she was grumpy to begin with theres no doubt about that but uh but you could clearly see those influences and in my youngsters i know that one day uh my youngsters were watching the Three Stooges and i always thought that was just casual slap stick comedy   yeah i hate that show   but when one tried to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench i decided that wasnt funny anymore   yeah i i good   and i really i really feel very strong about the Bart Simpson Show i think that is the kids watch that and thats absolutely the mouthiest kid that i ever saw and i just i do not like it uh     isnt that amazing how old are your kids   huh mine are grown but i have grandchildren and young children around and uh for a four year old to think Bart Simpson is a hero is tragic   oh okay so thats yeah i had forgotten about that see its just my husband and i and so i dont have that you know i uh that constant influence of the kids shows and all that but um i dont know   umhum umhum umhum yeah yeah well i was very careful even when my kids were kids were at home and when they were young i really did uh   yeah   watch what they watched i was cautious i sat down with them and i watched it and if i did not like it i changed the channel for them you know i i you know i distracted them changed their interest   right   because i just couldnt tolerate that kind of influence on my kiddos it just would   and and you know they get it at school too anyway so you might as well not reinforce it you know i   sure thats right thats right gosh they got theyre mouthy enough anyway   i know i remember going to school my parents were a lot like that too and of course we did not have any of the variety you know kids have but all the kids used to watch Rawhide and all those shows   umhum umhum umhum   and my parents never let me watch anything like that i could watch Yogi Bear you know what kind of culture was that  and i remember going to school the next day and everybody would be asking oh did you see that did you see how he did that and did you see and i could never participate   umhum yeah well umhum umhum   and it always made me feel a little bit you know like a loner like i you know but um   sure i can understand how that would happen   but see then my parents i think then you have to replace it with other things you know to uh   absolutely well i did i ran my kids to death  i said hey i think thats enough television for awhile maybe we need to go outside     really yeah   and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company so id go out with them now see theres the problem parents dont do that they say you go outside and play   thats true or you go rent a video up at the store and come home and sit down and watch it you know   yeah i said but but we went on field trips and we did other things and i think that was   well thats you know thats something people dont do that well here we are talking on that subject but thats thats an interesting concept ive got to stick in my  um you know work with kids on but um   of course
