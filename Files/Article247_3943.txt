                                 Do Dim Bulbs Make Better Presidents            This weeks New Yorker reproduces a document that George W Bushwasnt eager to have published his Yale transcript which includes his SATscores  verbal  math and college grades C average One doesnt wantto read too much into someones yearold academic records which in thiscase are mainly interesting as a reminder of how powerful the Ivy Leaguesaffirmativeaction program for alumni brats used to be But the data do tend tosubstantiate what many have gleaned from listening to the Republicanfrontrunner abuse the English language The sharpest tool in the shed heaint            The two authors of the New Yorker article Jane Mayer and AlexandraRobbins buttress their insult to the governors privacy with a backhandedcompliment Historically there is no correlation between academic achievementand success in the Oval Office they note Many of Bushs highbrowconservative supporters such as George Will go even farther arguing thatthickheadedness is a positive advantage In a recent column lauding Bush Willrecalls the contest between three bookwriters for president in TeddyRoosevelt Woodrow Wilson and William Howard Taftnoting that such intellectin politics is rare and perhaps should be The conservative writer RichardBrookhiser recently made a version of the same case in AmericanHeritage  Perhaps the wise leader should strive to have intellectuals ontap and not be one himself Brookhiser writes            The case against intellect in the White House is brilliantlycounterintuitive If only Dan Quayle had been able to grasp it he might haveused it to great advantage in this years presidential race But is it correctThe argument rests mainly on some fairly compelling anecdotal evidence Thelist of lessthanbrilliant men judged great by those making this argumentusually begins with Ronald Reagan and often includes Franklin D Roosevelt andHarry S Truman as well The list of intellectually gifted but ineffectualpresidents has Jimmy Carter Richard Nixon Herbert Hoover and WoodrowWilson            Objection The sample here is too small to be statistically meaningful Itcould just be a coincidence that Carter happened to be both bright and ineptand that Reagan was both disconnected and lovable Another problem The nameson the list are subject to extensive quibbling Was Reagan really a greatpresident Was Wilson a failure just because Congress rejected the Versaillestreaty Someday someone will demolish the myth of Carters alleged brillianceAnd was FDR who took gentleman Cs at Harvard truly less than highlyintelligent This supposition relies heavily on Oliver Wendell Holmesoftquoted observation that Roosevelt was a secondclass intellect but a firstclass temperament There is a great deal of evidence to suggest that Holmeswas wrong about this and that FDR unserious in college had the supplest ofpolitical wits about him            I can also provide some equally tendentious counterexamples Highly capable th century presidents who were sharp as tacks include John FKennedy andbring on the hate mailWilliam Jefferson Clinton A list ofrelative dimwits who were lousy chief executives might include Warren GHarding who described himself accurately as too dumb to be president andGerald R Ford who played one too many games without a helmet in thememorable phrase of Lyndon B Johnson            Given that stupidity is not an advantage in any other profession why wouldit help a president I think the theory derives from the familiar prejudiceagainst intelligence which holds that people who are too smart must be limitedin other ways Theres a popular notion that people who think too much cantactHamlet is not the guy you want to run your company And theres aconservative political version of this idea which holds that intellectualsare bound to be impractical immoral and too eager to impose theirrationalist radical schemes on the rest of us William F Buckley expressedthis view for the ages when he made his famous observation that hed rather beruled by the first hundred names in the Cambridge phone book than by thefaculty of Harvard University            But the dumbisbetter argument falls apart when you look more closely atthe personal qualities and corresponding successes and failures of just aboutany president The ones who were dim but successful successfully compensatedfor their dimness with other qualities But the lack of intelligence stillharmed them Take Ronald Reaganplease I dont dispute that Reagan deservescopious credit for bringing an early and glorious end to the Cold War One ofthe ways he did this was by taking an unambiguous moral stand againstCommunism which gave powerful encouragement to the opposition in Easternbloccountries But the moral certainty that caused Reagan to behave in this waywasnt a tribute to his thickness Vaclav Havel acted just as singlemindedlyBut an American president also needs to grasp more complex realitiesandReagan often couldnt When it came to understanding something mildlytechnical such as the federal budget he was baffled As described by DavidStockman he simply couldnt process the information that his contradictorygoals would produce a vast deficit despite repeated attempts to spell it outfor him in words and pictures            Or look at Richard Nixon Nixons strong intelligence is the reason thatthere is something on the plus side of his presidential ledger Most scholarsagree that Nixons most significant accomplishmentthe opening of relationswith Chinawas the product of his own shrewd analysis of foreign policy notHenry Kissingers Nixon himself wrote an article on the subject in ForeignAffairs in  laying out the case for what he subsequently did Nixon wasundone as president not because he was too shrewd but because of somethingshrewdness didnt help him with personal bitterness and lack of scruplesLikewise with Bill Clinton Where Clinton has deployed his own formidablebrain primarily in economic and some areas of domestic policy he has largelysucceeded Where he does his thinking with other organs he has underminedhimself            In fact I think the conservative case for presidential stupidity has itexactly backwards Presidents get into the most trouble not when they behavelike intellectuals but when they delegate crucial brainwork to intellectualson tap as Brookhiser calls them A history of this sort of folly might startwith some of the failed schemes of the New Deal economists before describingthe way that the whiz kids led LBJ astray on both the Vietnam War and the waron poverty It would touch on the bad advice Pat Moynihan gave Richard Nixon onwelfare and that Ira Magaziner gave Bill Clinton on health care There isprobably no modern president smart or dumb who hasnt landed himself in hotwater by hiring intellectuals and then failing to secondguess them            To be sure intelligence of the kind that might manifest itself in high SATscores isnt the most important quality in a chief executive Leadershipintegrity and determination are all more critical qualities Dumb luck helpsDumbness doesnt
