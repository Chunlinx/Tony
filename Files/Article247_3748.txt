                                 Why the Press Loves John McCain            John McCain isnt running in Iowa and he may get clobbered in NewHampshire But hes miles ahead in the very first contest of the  campaignthe press primary Journalists go weak in the knees around the guy The few whohave attempted to write debunking pieces about him have failed miserably WhenI set out to spend a few days with McCain last week I promised my editor thatI wouldnt join in this collective swoon That proved impossible But perhaps Ican redeem myself a bit by examining the phenomenon            Why do the hacks love McCain You could start with our admiration for aquality not many of us possess physical courage But I think the deeperadmiration is for the guts McCain showed in his Vietnamese captivity and whichhes shown consistently ever since Everyone knows by now the story told inMcCains book how he voluntarily suffered five and a half years as a POW inVietnam after refusing an early release McCain wasnt just a war hero He wasa kind of spirit of resistance personified a man who writes in his book click here for a Ballot Box review that he found freedom in captivity bytormenting his torturers even at the cost of additional abuse McCain is aFaulknerian character in a very different sense than Bill Clinton is And Ithink that at this point even those of us who think Clinton has been a goodpresident hunger for a successor more deserving of our respect            Reporters who have covered McCain in the Senate have seen Republicanpolitics considerably enlivened by this defiant character McCain is barelytolerated by his partys leadership and he hardly conceals his contempt forTrent Lott and Mitch McConnell He has broken with his colleagues overcampaignfinance reform over legislation to punish cigarette makers and overcorporate welfare Theres a bit of the strange new respect phenomenon in theway journalists respond to these positions When a conservative politiciantakes liberal stands he is often described as having grown Yet McCainremains a genuine conservative the farthest to the right of any of the otherplausible candidates in the race a category that excludes the bornagain Bibleslinger Steve Forbes Reporters respect McCain less because he takes liberalpositions than because of the way he puts his beliefs ahead of his career as amatter of course            McCain has been conducting himself in the same delightfully subversive wayas a candidate for the GOP nomination There were two guys in the campaignbrave enough or clueless enough to oppose ethanol subsidies beforehand Bothfaced the unappealing prospect of having to run in the Iowa caucus with thismillstone around their necks One of those candidates Bill Bradley brazenlychanged his position to favor tax breaks for ethanol The other John McCaindecided not to run in the Iowa Caucuses rather than change his positioneventhough forgoing the first contest makes his uphill struggle that much steeperEvery candidate that Ive observed in a race if winning is the onlyobjective they always end up doing something  he told me Theycompromise in order to experience some real or imagined shortterm politicalgain McCain says this not with contempt but with pity for those of hiscolleagues who cannot resist political temptation            Then theres the McCain charm I doubt Ill enjoy any part of this campaign so much as a couple of days spent as part of a threeperson presscorps traveling with McCain Hes funny friendly and far too candid for hisown good Most politicians go off the record when they want to state theobvious McCain doesnt go off the record at all at least in my experience Hebehaves in fact more like a civilian talking about politics than a politiciandiscussing politics He does reverse spin Unprompted he tells me that his bigannouncement speech the previous day in South Carolina was something of afailure describing himself as tired and his audience as merely polite Andthere arent too many other senators let alone presidential candidates whowill start a conversation in the van leaving the Reagan Library with theline One of the many reasons I hate the French  the reason related to adiplomatic insult to Warren Christopher when he was secretary of state            McCain has said other things in recent weeks that would land anothercandidate in deep doodoo In a recent piece in US News  Roger Simonquoted him referring to his North Vietnamese prison guards as the goddamngooks Reporters usually either put such indiscretions off the record onMcCains behalf or congratulate him for making them One reason for this is themedias sound instinct not to punish a politician for being exceptionallycandid with the media Another is the feeling that McCain has earned the rightto say whatever he wants For those who have watched his career hisoutspokenness on the campaign trail appears as a refusal to be cowed by yetanother prison and its silly rules As Bob Dole once said about McCain youspend fiveandahalf years in a box you get to say whatever you want            He also responds to the press Unlike the inaccessible George W Bush youcan get to McCain easily and have a frank intelligent discussion with himabout just about any topic Ive developed a minor obsession with how thevarious Republican education plans dont make sense even on their own termsMcCains flawed plan like Bushs even more flawed plan wouldnt give vouchers a fair test becauseit doesnt fund the voucher at anywhere near the cost of most private schoolsAnd if a voucher wont pay for private school it wont create any pressure onpublic schools to improve I made this point to McCain on a flight from GrandRapids Mich to the Reagan Library in California His initial response wasthat while  the amount in his plan wouldnt cover tuition at SidwellFriends or Andover it would pay for many Catholic parochial schools Imunembarrassed to tell you that one of my happiest days of recent years was whenmy daughter was accepted in Catholic school he said I know shell get aquality education Shell wear a uniform and shell be away from those littlebastards that are trying to get their hands on her            McCain then called across the aisle of the plane to his wife Cindy honeygood morning How much is our tuition for Meghan at Xavier Meghan  is theMcCains oldest daughter             Mrs McCain answered Not including books or uniforms            McCain seemed surprised at how high it was And the next thing I knew hewas running with my criticism trashing his own proposal Its one thing tosay well give everybody a choice he said Well if they cant get in thenwed better either provide incentives for schools to come into being where theycan afford it or figure out a way to give them enough of a voucher where theycan You could say that McCain is to be faulted for not working out a bettereducation proposal in the first place But in a way being able to profit fromvalid criticism is more important than being a master of policy detail TheClinton healthcare plan is a case in point            This points to a final pressfriendly quality of McCains brilliantflattery Its fairly unusual in my experience for a politician to accept areporters opinion that one of his major proposals is seriously flawed Itsalso gratifying to the reporter Bill Clinton is a master of buttering upjournalists by quoting their books and articles back to them But with Clintonthe effort at seduction is transparent You know he really hates the press andis forcing himself to try to win them over When McCain flatters you itdoesnt feel automatic or calculated He truly likes us journalists Its hisfellow senators he cant stand
