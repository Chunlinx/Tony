                    Introduction        The year survival rate for patients with lung cancer        is approximately  and it has changed only marginally in        the last  years   Tumor stage is the most significant        prognostic parameter for year survival but even patients        with nonsmall cell lung cancer nonSCLC in pathologic        stage IA disease a tumor of less than  cm diameter        located in one lobe of the lung and more than  cm from the        carina without visceral pleural involvement atelectasis        or pneumonitis and absence of metastatic spread to        regional lymph nodes have a  chance of recurrence        within  years after complete surgical resection lobectomy        with mediastinal lymph node dissection   In this group        of patients the tumor most frequently recurs at distant        sites including the bone liver adrenal glands and brain          and the size of the primary tumor does not appear to        impact on survival   This suggests that even small and        seemingly resectable lung cancers metastasize early Data        from randomized screening trials for lung cancer        corroborate this observation In these studies more        cancers were detected in resectable stages and year        survival rates were higher in the screened population        compared to the control population but mortality rates        total death rate independent of time from lung cancer        were equal in both groups          For this reason it is important to develop methods that        will permit facile detection of bronchial mucosal        abnormalities that are precursors for lung cancer before        systemic shedding of tumor cells occurs Such precursor        lesions can be detected by sputum cytology and by        bronchoscopy in large airways accessible by endoscopy They        include metaplasia dysplasia and carcinoma         in situ CIS which are thought to        represent progressive histologic correlates of        carcinogenesis for squamous cell carcinoma          Current data suggest that  of current and former        smokers have metaplastic lesions and  have dysplastic        lesions   However not all such lesions progress to        lung cancer For instance smoking cessation which can be        viewed as a form of active intervention appears to result        in a decrease of metaplasia rates from  in active        smokers to  in former smokers   It is estimated that        approximately  of CIS will progress to invasive cancer        over a month time period   However of  patients        followed by regular bronchoscopy at month time intervals         developed lung cancer at sites that had previously been        biopsied and interpreted as normal bronchial epithelium          These results raise several important questions A Are        there determinants in premalignant lesions that predict        outcome ie progression versus regression B Are there        determinants in morphologically normal bronchial mucosa        that predict outcome C Can lung cancer arise directly        from normal bronchial mucosa or are histopathologic        intermediates required        To address these questions one promising approach would        be the development of specific immunohistochemical markers        capable of improving the sensitivity and reliability of        methods currently employed to detect precursor lesions in        histologic and cytologic specimens    Because        proliferation is a requirement for lung cancer development        markers specific for cell proliferation are expected to        prove useful        Two proliferation markers proliferating cell nuclear        antigen PCNA and Ki have been extensively studied in        this context PCNA is a homotrimeric protein that binds        tightly to DNA and to proteins involved in DNA replication        and repair It is essential for DNA replication and is        found in all proliferating cells However because PCNA is        also essential for several types of DNA repair it may be        present in nonproliferating cells    Ki is an        epitope of a nuclear protein recognized by the MIB        monoclonal antibody The protein is frequently expressed        throughout the cell cycle of proliferating cells and it        has not been detected in nonproliferating cells During        interphase Ki is located primarily in nucleolar and        perinucleolar regions and it appears to be associated        with condensed chromatin   The function of the Ki        protein is still unknown   however it appears to be        required for cells to progress through the cell cycle           Immunohistochemical studies with PCNA and Ki        indicate that in at least some cases increased lung tumor        staining for these markers correlates with decreased        survival      These proliferation markers can        also be detected in premalignant lesions of the lung                    In this report we describe the results of our        comparison of one of these classic proliferation markers        Ki with a new proliferation marker MCM   MCM is        one of six members of the minichromosome maintenance MCM        protein family These serve as components of licensing        factor which is essential for initiation of DNA        replication and for limiting replication to one round per        cell cycle    The MCM proteins are also associated        with replication forks and are likely to stimulate the        unwinding of the parental DNA strands at these forks          We previously demonstrated   that in normal tissues        MCM is detectable only in proliferating cells Not        surprisingly it is also present in a high proportion of        cancer cells Our results showed a higher proportion of        positively stained cells in premalignant breast lesions        than with either PCNA or Ki   Others have reported        similar results for MCM family proteins compared with Ki        and PCNA for detection of a variety of premalignant cell        types    but a comparison of MCM proteins with        Ki or PCNA as markers for premalignant lung lesions has        not previously been reported                    Methods                  Study population          MCM and Ki expression in bronchial biopsy          specimens from patients at risk for lung cancer or with          suspected lung cancer were studied by          immunohistochemistry IHC We reviewed all pathology          specimens from  patients that had undergone          bronchoscopy with standard white light and laserinduced          fluorescence at Roswell Park Cancer Institute from March           to March  Fourteen of these  patients were          selected for further analysis based on the presence of          abnormal morphology and the availability of multiple          specimen blocks  per patient for investigations Of          these  patients the highest degree of abnormality in           was metaplasia in  dysplasia in  CIS in  invasive          squamous cell carcinoma and in  invasive          adenocarcinoma Five of these patients were Caucasian          women  was an AfricanAmerican man and  were          Caucasian men All were active or former smokers                          Sample preparation and selection          From each specimen block  serial m sections were          cut and placed on charged glass slides Sections  were          used for IHC and section  was stained with hematoxylin          and eosin This latter section was reviewed and compared          with the original slide used for diagnostic purposes In           specimens the morphology was comparable between the          original slide and slide  These  specimens were used          for IHC analysis and included morphologically normal          bronchial mucosa metaplasia dysplasia and CIS see          Table for the numbers of specimens with normal and          abnormal morphology                          Immunohistochemistry          Sections were stained with polyclonal rabbit          antibodies raised and affinitypurified against the          Nterminal portion of MCM   Parallel sections were          stained with the MIB mouse monoclonal antibody against          Ki DAKO Carpinteria California IHC was performed          as described earlier   Briefly sections were          deparaffinized and those to be stained with Ki were          subjected to microwave antigen retrieval in citrate          buffer for  minutes twice Antigen retrieval was not          required for MCM MIB was used at a dilution of           The MCM antibody was used at a dilution of  The          avidinbiotin detection method was employed on a Ventana          Automated System Tucson Arizona An irrelevant rabbit          antiserum served as a negative control Percentage          intensity and distribution of stained cells were          analyzed and scored for each antibody independently by          two of the authors DFT JAH with similar results                          Statistical Analysis          The percent of cells stained for each sample was          estimated as a continuous number ranging from  to           The staining intensity was categorically coded as           absent  weak  moderate or  strong The          average of both the percent of cells stained and staining          intensity was calculated for each type of specimen          normal mucosa metaplasia dysplasia CIS To test for          differences between the staining characteristics of MCM          and Ki both the parametric paired samples ttest and          the nonparametric Wilcoxon ranksum test were performed          To test for differences across specimen classes normal          mucosa metaplasia dysplasia and CIS for each stain          Ki or MCM the analysis of variance method as well          as the nonparametric KruskalWallis tests were used To          test specifically for differences between dysplasia and          CIS for each stain the independent samples ttest and          the MannWhitney tests were performed Both parametric          and nonparametric tests were used because the          distributional assumptions required for parametric          testing may not be satisfied in all cases All          statistical tests assumed a twosided alternative with a           level of significance                            Results        In normal bronchial mucosa antibodies against both        proteins MCM and Ki generated similar patterns some        cells in the basal and parabasal layer of the bronchial        epithelium displayed immunoreactivity Fig  The        proportion of cells staining for MCM was significantly          p   greater than for Ki        Table  In both cases the intensity of nuclear staining        was variable        In premalignant lesions evaluation of the staining by        the two antibodies Table  revealed significantly          p   more frequent staining        of nuclei within metaplastic lesions by antibodies against        MCM than by antibodies against Ki We also noticed        that in metaplasia antiMCM frequently stained both        basal cells and cells throughout the entire thickness of        the epithelium while antiKi primarily stained basal        cells and cells in the lower half of the epithelium Fig         lower of the two metaplasia panels Although the        number of samples of dysplasia and CIS was too low to        permit statistical evaluation of the differences between        the two antibodies we noticed that in every case of        dysplasia or CIS the frequency of cells stained by        antiMCM was as high or higher than the frequency of        staining by antiKi In fact the same relationship was        evident in the normal mucosa and metaplasia samples        Consequently when the data for all  samples were        combined the difference in staining frequency between        antiMCM and antiKi was highly significant          p   Table         We observed variable staining in premalignant lesions        In many cases within single lesions some regions stained        while others did not and the intensity of staining was        variable from region to region and from cell to cell within        regions The level of variability was similar for both        markers Fig         In the progression from normal mucosa to metaplasia to        dysplasia the results obtained with both antibodies        suggested differences in staining frequency and intensity        For both antibodies the mean percentages of cells stained        and staining intensity were different across specimen        categories all         p values  and increased        from normal mucosa to metaplasia and from metaplasia to        dysplasia Although the sample numbers are too low to draw        a firm conclusion the data suggest a possible decrease in        staining frequency by both antibodies in the transition        from dysplasia to CIS          p   for Ki and         p   for MCM Table         No significant differences were detected between the        average stain intensities produced by the two antibodies        Fig  Table                     Discussion        This is the first comparison of MCM and Ki        expression in premalignant lesions of the human lung and        it showed that MCM was expressed in a greater percentage        of cells in normal mucosa and in premalignant lesions than        Ki The proportion of cells stained for MCM ranged from         to  and for Ki from  to  Table  The        average percentage of cells stained for MCM  was        higher than that for Ki  Statistical analyses of        the frequencies of positively stained cells were done with        the paired samples ttest and the Wilcoxon sign rank test        Both tests showed a striking difference          p   in immunoreactivity        between these markers across all  samples This finding        suggests that MCM may prove to be a more sensitive        intermediate marker for lung cancer risk than Ki        However there are several caveats to the use of MCM        for assessing lung cancer risk Most importantly the        ability of cells to proliferate even though a hallmark of        malignancy is also a component of inflammation and        healing Thus metaplastic lesions are frequently        associated with chronic inflammation as exemplified by the        presence of such lesions in  of current smokers but only         of former smokers   Furthermore even highgrade        dysplasia does not necessarily lead to invasive cancer          The fact that antiMCM more frequently stains        metaplastic cells at the epithelial surface suggests that        it is more likely than antiKi to detect exfoliated        proliferating epithelial cells in cytological specimens        such as sputum However this presumably higher sensitivity        for premalignant cells could be accompanied by an        unacceptably low specificity Therefore it is important to        assess the positive predictive value of both markers MCM        and Ki for lung cancer risk in cytologic and histologic        specimens from a defined population at risk for this        disease in a prospective study        Second there has been a shift in the predominant type        of lung cancer from squamous cell carcinoma to        adenocarcinoma in the United States over the past twenty        years    Since adenocarcinomas predominantly arise        in the periphery of the lung and less frequently in the        larger and more easily accessible airways the utility of        assessing morphological molecular and proliferative        changes in these larger airways may be called into        question During the s three randomized lung cancer        screening trials were conducted in the US and each of        these trials used sputum cytology as one of the means to        detect lung cancer at an early stage     Aside        from the major finding that screening did not reduce lung        cancer mortality several other important facts were        uncovered These included the findings that lung cancers        detected by sputum cytology only compared to chest Xray        only had a higher rate of complete resectability  vs         and a higher year survival rate  vs           that approximately onethird of the cancers detected by        sputum cytology were adenocarcinomas and twothirds were        squamous cell carcinomas   that sputum cytology        detected  of all incident cases of lung cancer        excluding interval cases   and that sputum cytology        detected  adenocarcinomas   It can thus be        concluded that cytological examination of sputum specimens        is able to detect adenocarcinomas at an early stage albeit        with low sensitivity  Staining of sputum specimens        for proliferation markers such as MCM and Ki may        increase that sensitivity by focusing the pathologists        attention on proliferating cells In addition to its        potential for detecting frank malignancy staining for        proliferation markers may also provide an estimate of the        frequency of potentially precancerous conditions        metaplasia and dysplasia in the patients airways This        estimate may be helpful for determining whether to initiate        other more costly evaluations for lung cancer        detection        Third since MCM and Ki are both markers of cellular        proliferation and required for cell cycle progression              the fact that antiMCM stained a larger        number of cells than antiKi in every specimen examined        suggests that Ki may be expressed during a shorter        interval of the cell cycle than MCM MCM is present        throughout the cell cycle   while Ki is        predominantly expressed during S G and M phase        Variability of cell cycle time in mammalian cells is        largely a result of differences in the duration of G        phase Thus specimens that consist of a relatively slow        growing population of cells and consequently a higher        proportion of cells in G phase would show staining of more        cells with MCM than Ki Conversely specimens with        cells dividing at a high rate would show staining of near        equal numbers of cells for MCM and Ki Thus it is        likely that staining for both MCM and Ki will provide        information about cell cycle distribution and possibly        growth dynamics not obtainable by staining for either        marker alone        Finally the data presented on MCM expression by IHC        were obtained with affinitypurified polyclonal rabbit        antibodies The supply of these purified antibodies is        limited and their use for MCM immunostaining is therefore        not uniformly available Although additional polyclonal        antibody preparations can be generated by immunizing more        rabbits the best solution would be the commercial        availability of specific MCM monoclonal antibodies        Fortunately several of these are now available and useful        for Western blotting and staining of frozen sections The        utility of these antibodies for IHC in paraffinembedded        specimens is being investigated                    Conclusion        We have confirmed that polyclonal antiMCM antibodies        provide consistent reliable staining in routinely fixed        tissues without a requirement for antigen retrieval        Results obtained are easy to interpret since there is a        striking difference between normal bronchoepithelium and        premalignant lesions Thus MCM is an easytouse marker        which has great potential for assessment of progression and        regression of morphologically abnormal lesions in future        primary lung cancer prevention studies and for the early        detection of lung cancer in screening studies                    Competing Interests        None Declared
