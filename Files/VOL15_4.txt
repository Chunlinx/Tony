From aspeech by President Ronald Reagan on   Submittedby                               The Cryptic Toolbox            Seventyfive years ago the daily New York Worldpresented its readers with a new kind of puzzlethat consisted of a grid and a list of clues  The WordCrossas it was called started its existence as justanother little Sunday supplement feature with nopretensions to permanence  Yet it was to become theprogenitor of the now ubiquitous crossword puzzleThe makeup of the grid has undergone various modificationsin the course of time but the rules of the gamehave remained unchanged  As for the clues they werecalled definitions and that indeed is what theywere Or were they  On closer inspection classicclues appear to be divisible into three groups  Firstthere are synonyms like rooster for COCK  Admittedlythere is no such thing as perfect synonymy but themeanings of many pairs of words are close enough forthis term to be used in the context of a pastime likecrosswords  Second a clue may name a class of objectswhich includes the answer like bird for COCK  A morespecific class eg male bird  makes solution easierwhereas a more general class eg animal  wouldcomplicate the puzzlers task  The third group comprisesdefinitions proper  Such a clue for COCK mightread adult male of the domestic fowl             Crossword puzzles soon become very popular inAmerica and perhaps even more so in Britain  Butsomeone must have felt that all this was too simple forour overtrained brains  Straightforward definitions ofall three varieties were gradually replaced by play onwords ambiguous phrasings jumble games and otherverbal pranks  A clue for COCK might thus come toread number one in the pecking order dominates hensand crows a quizzical statement unless the wordcrows is read as a verb or even creature with a cowshead and a bullocks rump found in a coop first letterof cow plus last three letters of bullock             The uninitiated may find these examples too bizarrefor words  Still the idea has caught on so wellthat most British newspapers now offer two crosswordpuzzles each day  One is in the classic style commonlylabeled concise or quick  The other is of the newerplayful genre often referred to as cryptic but thisdesignation is by no means universal  A wellknownAmerican language journal prefers the term AngloAmericanIn some countries puzzles of this type arecalled cryptograms a name we shall use from hereon  This article is an attempt to catalogue the maintools currently applied by cryptic puzzlemakers andsolvers            A cryptogram clue can be a simple pun like                           A   A message that goes from pole to pole  letters             TELEGRAM            In most cases however it consists as the previousexamples suggest of two elements each hinting at theanswer in its own way  This construction makes sensesince each hint by itself is generally so vague or openendedthat it evokes more potential answers than apuzzlers brain can handle  Two such hints howeverhave only a few possible answers in common so thatthe solver can concentrate on them and pick the mostprobable one  This quest for the correct answer restson intricate mental processes which require no elaborationOur purpose here is rather to devise a classificationof the various types of clue elements CEs currentlyin use            Let us start with the three groups of clues encounteredin the classical crossword puzzle synonymssuperordinates and definitions  Here are some examplesof their cryptic counterparts                           B   A writer or two   TWAIN            The first CE  A writer  indicates a class to whichTWAIN belongs the second  two  offers a synonym ofanother possible meaning of the answer                           C   One who counts and recounts   TELLER            The two CEs are telescoped  Each of them defines aseparate meaning of the answer            These are really oldtime clues in new apparel oncewise to the system and having enough vocabulary entriesin ones head or a thesaurus handy on the shelfit is not too difficult to decode them and arrive at theanswer  The going gets tougher however as the twomeanings of the answer move further apart                           D                 This landlord is quite a character   LETTER            The mechanism is clear landlord  LETTER onewho lets and character  LETTER but the two LETTERsdiffer in both meaning and origin  Note thatsome doubledealing has also gone on with the wordcharacter   A third layer of camouflage is added in                           E                 Straight commotion   ROW            The two ROWs differ in pronunciation as well as inmeaning and origin            Just as disorienting are clues where the two meaningsof the answer belong to different word classes                           F                 A more successful gambler   BETTER            To mystify solvers even more puzzlers may use wordsin an uncommon but perfectly legitimate sense especiallyby attributing to certain words ending in er thequality of agent noun  Bloomer for flower butterfor ram or even flower for river are recurrentexamples but solvers must always be on the alert fornew traps of this type                           G                 More than one anesthetic   NUMBER            All of the above techniques rest in one way oranother on the meanings of words  They make up theclass of Semantic Clue Elements  Another classequally important in cryptoland is that of GraphicClue Elements  Here the object of play is the writtenform of the answer or more precisely the letters ofwhich that form consists  The best known member ofthis class is undoubtedly the anagram                           H                 Victim of injustice could be grounded  UNDERDOG            The words could be which precede the anagramgrounded have a special function  They inform solversif they get the message  that an anagram is lurkingnearby  Indeed convention requires that anagramsand all other Graphic CEs be accompanied by suchflags  On the other hand the cryptogram composer isfree to conceal these signals in all sorts of phrasalhocuspocus                           I                 Overturned vote overturns all votes   VETO            Some other anagram flags are broken strange unorthodoxmaybe kind of  and a source of   There aredozens of them and new ones are being concoctedevery day            Many anagrams spread over two or more words                           J                 Brave Tim changed quarterly   VERBATIM            These are particularly tricky when short words likearticles or pronouns are involved                           K                 An event is organized for Italians   VENETIANS                           L                 You cant take it with youneither can I unfortunately  INHERITANCE            A subvariant of the anagram is the inversion                           M                 On reflection the parts will hold together  STRAP                           On reflection is a flag to indicate that parts is to beread backwards  Other inversion flags are comingback returning  and going West   Purists admit theseonly for answers that run horizontally in the grid  Forthe down words they prefer turning up travelingNorth  etc            It is worth noting that the first element of clue Mconsists of the four words On reflection the parts   Thecomma correctly inserted between reflection and the may mislead but such punctuational conflicts are consideredperfectly legitimate or even a piquant littlefeature  We shall return to this point later            Another type of Graphic CE is the acronym                           N                 The leaders of the unassuming Royal Knights Societycan be a source of delight   TURKS                           The leaders of is a flag intended to draw the solversattention to the initial letters of the words following itwhere the answer lies for the taking  The most commonflag for acronyms is as one would expect initially             The acronym does not stand by itself in the cryptorepertoire  In fact it is the key member of a wholefamily of Graphic CEs all with their own specificflags to indicate whether the answer is to be composedfrom last letters middle letters or other word fragmentsAn idea of the way they work has been given inone of the introductory examples the cowbullockcreature            A relatively new graphic technique is the sandwichThe letters of the answer are left in their original orderbut spread over two or more words                           O                 Lakeside city located inside the embankment or ontop of it   TORONTO            or contained in a single word                           P                 A small capital in Czechoslovakia   OSLO            Besides inside and in  common sandwich flags are partof and some of             As the above clues demonstrate a Graphic CE shouldbe accompanied not only by a flag but also by a SemanticCE  This conventional rule also holds for themembers of a third class the Phonic Clue ElementsThese are based just like the traditional pun onhomophony                           Q                 Critique one hears of a theatrical entertainment  REVUE            Somewhat more involved is                           R                 It sounds in one sense or in none like simplicity  INNOCENCE            Phonic CEs are not very often used probably becauseall suitable flags  I hear it sounds say  etc are soobvious that they threaten to give the game awayIn the above tour dhorizon not all aspects of cluesetting have passed in review  Nothing has been saidabout the artful ways in which abbreviations chemicalsymbols Arabic and Roman numerals musicalnotes etc may be used in clues  Hardly any attentionhas been paid to oneelement clues  There are evenoneword clues some of them particularly witty  Noexamples have been given of answers that consist ofmore than one word  More important no mention hasbeen made of the possibility of chopping the answerinto convenient pieces which are separately representedin the clue by anagrams synonyms etc            Just one reallife example                           S                 European city home of the first person withoutperverse words

thorough examinationthan space permits but perhaps it would be best tocomment on some aspects of the ethics of compilingclues            The first commandment in the puzzlers biblereads Thou shalt not waste words  A wellconstructedclue comprises only words necessary for conveying in adeceptive way the information solvers require to findthe answer  Adding fillers to distract them is consideredunfair  As for the answer it is better to avoid verylearned or rare words unknown to all but a few lexicographersThe idea is to test the solvers skill in decipheringclues rather than their familiarity with therecondite recesses of the lexicon  This being said oneBritish publication does offer a special obscurewordspuzzle probably for the benefit of glossarial masochistsLittle wonder it appears under the name ofMephisto            On the other hand it is admissible as we havealready seen to throw solvers off the scent with anoccasional comma in the wrong place  The sameholds for other dividers such as colons dashes hyphensand blanks  Likewise a bit of juggling withapostrophes quotation marks and capitals is permittedalways on the understanding that no punctuationor spelling rules are infringed  And it goes withoutsaying that clue texts may be arranged in such a waythat at first sight certain words appear to belong to adifferent inflectional form or word class than is actuallythe case when the clue is unlocked  In fact this isan essential part of the fun  This feature has alreadybeen demonstrated in the very first example the cockthat crows and also in clue F Clue J offers two furtherinstances at first reading changed is suggestive of beinga past tense but after analysis it is identified as apast participle serving as an anagram flag likewisequarterly shifts from adverb to noun            Let us end with a specimen in which several of theabove techniques are represented                           T                 Part of his imprint appears in absurd AngloSaxonrules

acquired thelargest vocabulary and inspired one of the noblest bodiesof literature in the annals of the human race            Nonetheless English is a crazy language  In thecrazy English language the

         Still you have to wonder about the crazy Englishlanguage in which your house can burn up and burndown at the same time in which you fill in a form byfilling out a form in which you add up a

         It all began with Lenin  The Russian Revolutionthe Soviet Union and journalistic expertise devotedto these supremely important phenomena of thetwentieth century began with Vladimir Ilich LeninBut as far as American journalism is concerned thatpronouncement is not quite correct because more oftenthan not American journalists began and for anembarrassingly long time continued not with Vladimiror Ilich as the founding Bolshevik is sometime affectionatelycalled peasantfashion by his patronymicbut with Nikolai Lenin  The error flawed the recordbeyond newspaper reporting  For example The ColumbiaEncyclopedia  in an edition last copyrighted in has an appropriately long entry for the founderof the USSR under Lenin Nikolai   How this mistakecame about in the first place no one is certain  Lenindid use the pseudonym N Lenin  among scores ofothers and maybe a selfstyled authority assumed thatthe N  stood for Nikolai  a name that may have beensuggested by that of the Russian emperor  In Europeancontinental usage the letter N  corresponding to X inthe Englishspeaking world is sometimes used for aname an author does not wish to reveal  At any ratethe mistake trivial in itself tended to discredit a gooddeal of American reporting about the Soviet Unionamong people who knew better  After all if the bourgeoispress could not get even Lenins name right howreliable was it about anything else in the USSR            Decades later the leadership of the CommunistParty of the Soviet Union was assumed by NikitaSergeevich Khrushchev  By then Kremlinology hadmatured and the American press had all of Khrushchevsnames right though there were several ways totransliterate and pronounce them in English  To thehorror of some Western readers however he was atleast once quoted out of context as having threatenedto bury America  And he did say that  But the Russianverb he used in a sentence that was more a bellicoseboast than a threat was pokhoronit which meansbury all right but in the sense of the verb in weburried Grandma last week  When Nikita Sergeevichbragged that the USSR would bury the USA he meantthat technologically and economically the Sovietswould leave us in the dust would be around for ourfuneral not that they would put us six feet under            If our press would attain true excellence in selectingEnglish expressions to correspond to Russian originalsit should exercise more care about designatingthe Soviet Union as Russia and Soviets as RussiansRussia now the RSFSR for Russian Soviet FederatedSocialist Republic is only one of several Soviet republicswhich are more like states of the United Statesthan what we generally mean by republic and Russianssometimes redundantly called ethnic Russiansmake up only about half of the population of theUSSR  So referring to the USSR as Russia is a mistakeon the order of calling the United Kingdom orGreat Britain England  However the boundaries ofthe tsars empire for centuries known as Russia wereapproximately the same as those of the Soviet Union itwas occasionally known as the Russias as in the formulaTsar of all the Russias thus this particularconfusion comes naturally  Gorbachev himself is saidto have had to apologize while making a speech in theUkraine when he referred to the Ukraine as RussianThis faux pas might be likened to the Queen of Englandssaying in an address before Welsh miners As wehere in England well know             The problem of drawing a distinction betweenRussians and citizens of the USSR has been solved byborrowing the word Soviet into English as an adjectiveor a noun meaning a person and not an institutionexcept rarely as in the designation Supreme Soviet   InRussian Sovt means basically counsel and counciland by extension assembly  It never means a citizen ofthe USSR or any other kind of person in Russianthough its adjectival derivative sovetskii can be usedsubstantively alone or followed by chelovek person tomean a Soviet person  So the English word Sovietcorresponds to both the Russian noun sovt or muchmore often to the Russian adjective sovetskii in theirmany inflected forms            Currently two Russian words are challengingcorrespondents among others to find Englishequivalents perestroika and glasnost   The first ofthese Gorbachevian buzzwords can be handily calquedinto English as restructuring  Glasnost  though ismore difficult  As a calque it would come into Englishas vocalness  which is no word  It is not a new word inRussian  The  edition of the fourvolume TolkovyiSlovar Russkogo Yazyka Explanatory Dictionary ofthe Russian Language defines glasnost as Accessibilityto public discussion and evaluation publicity  Ican think of no single English word that quite correspondsto this definition  Publicity perhaps comes closestBut since both perestroika and glasnost from ourpoint of view do not mean restructuring and publicitygenerally as the English words do to us but ratherrefer to reforms specifically initiated by Gorbachevthe Russian words particularly glasnost are usuallyborrowed into English unaltered except in pronunciationThere are of course precedents for this sort ofintact borrowing pogrom ukase intelligentsia  andmuzhik for example  And in the same way Russianspeakers have helped themselves to our sex jazzlynch  and business             Apropos of Gorbachevand Khrushchev too forthat matterthose es in their names pose a problem ofphonetic correspondence  Though usually written inRussian like any other e  just as in English they arepronounced like os   Sometimes in textbooks for childrenand beginners such es are marked in Russian withtwo dots over them they are sometimes transliteratedinto English as os  so that occasionally you will see thespelling Gorbachov  which in my opinion is preferableThen another variant in transliteration isovoff eveff   The name ending in double f forwhat in Russian is invariably v is seldom seen nowadaysbut a few decades ago or in documents or bookswritten then you might have seen the two Soviet leadersnames transliterated Gorbacheff or Gorbachoff                                          LiteLight            For approximately a thousand years the wordlight has been used to describe beer and winecontaining less alcohol than regular beer and winec  Ags Voc in Wr Willcker Melle dulci leoht beor  Oxford EnglishDictionaryc  Sax Leechd III  Drince leoht wynOED                        Currently however many a denizen of the UnitedStates regards light also spelled lite  as a label thatindicates that a beer is lower in calories than its nonlightcounterparts            and Khrushcheff or Khrushchoff   I have seen both theov and  off transliterations on the same page of abook  The reason for this variation is that when theCyrillic letter that represents our English v sound isfinal in a word as in the nominative case forGorbachev  it is unvoiced and sounds like f or ff forgood measure when an inflectional ending is addedas in Gorbacheva the genitive case that same letteris voiced like v             Such variations in transliteration are practicallyendless and hardly any variation can be called anerror though consistency is obviously desirable  Themost troublesome inconsistencies in transliterationseem to be owing either to the human tendency toconceal doubt behind abundance or to multiple naturalizationsas the name migrates across Europe  Forinstance in English the name of the Russian composeris usually spelled Tchaikovsky and sometimes asTschaikovsky or Tschaikowsky where three or fourEnglish letters are used to represent a sound representedby a single Russian letter and more normally byonly two in English ch   The name Chaliapin was firsttransliterated into a French spelling Chaliapine  laterwhen most of the family moved to the United Statesthe e was dropped to Anglicize the spelling  This was aconfusing half measure however the initial ch remainedas in the French spelling representing a Russianletter borrowed from the Hebrew alphabet for thesound represented in English by sh   As a result manyAmericans innocently mispronounce the name of thegreat operatic bass and his descendants  A certain Tennesseanwho became a good friend of Boris Chaliapinthe Time cover artist got off on the wrong footwhen he heard the artists name as Charley Apin Since Boris was too polite to correct the Tennesseanand others who knew better found the mistake tooamusing to rectify that one American friend calledBoris good ol Charley Apin as long as the friend lived            The roots of the reduced calorie meaning oflitelight go back to   In that year Meister BrauInc of Chicago initially marketed Meister Brau Lite areducedcalorie beer  Women were targeted as the primaryconsumers but the beer which was promoted asa diet drink was not very successful  In  PhillipMorris Incs Miller Brewing Co acquired the Litebeer label in a buyout of Meister Brau Inc Miller Litewas introduced to test markets in  and the firstLite commercial which featured Super Bowl heroMatt Snell aired in July of that year  The tenth Litecommercial which featured linebacker Dick Butkuswas shot in May  just as Miller Lite was goingnational            Miller Lite commercials were designed to convinceyoung males that it is all right to drink light beerConsequently these commercials which according toVideo Storyboard Tests Inc are among the most popularever to be shown on television have featured formerathletes eg Bubba Smith Bob Uecker and RosieGrier and celebrities eg author Mickey Spillanedrummer Buddy Rich and comedian Rodney DangerfieldThe original theme of these commercials wasEverything you always wanted in a lightand less            During the early years that Miller was convincingthe public that tough guys do drink light beer otherbreweries remained skeptical  Because they thoughtlight beer had a wimpy image they stayed out of thelight beer market for a while  When other breweriesfinally did enter the market most of them used thespelling light Bud Light Coors Light MichelobLight Natural Light Old Milwaukee Light StrohLight   The reason for this was simple enough MillerBrewing Co owned the trademark Lite  which it hadpurchased from Meister Brau Inc in   Howeverbrewer Paul Kalmanovitz owner of Falstaff BrewingCo of Omaha and General Brewing Co of VancouverWashington challenged Millers exclusive right toLite   In July  a US District Court jury in SanFrancisco ruled that Lite was just an alternate spellingof Light   As a result of this decision Lite may now beused on the label of any beer to indicate that it is areducedcalorie beer            According to The Wall Street Journal April  light beers represent approximately  percent ofthe  billion beer market  The popularity of reducedcaloriebeers has resulted in the inclusion of the followingdefinition of litelight in The Random House Dictionaryof the English Language Second UnabridgedEdition   of alcoholic beverages esp of beerand wine having fewer calories and usually a loweralcohol content than the standard product            Not all light beers are created equal howeverSome have fewer calories than others Michelob Light calories per ounce serving Stroh Light Budweiser Light  Miller Lite  Pabst ExtraLight  and Pearl Lite   As we can see MichelobLight has almost twice as many calories as Pearl LiteIn fact Michelob Light has one calorie more ie than Heidelberg regular beer  calories            Since  the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco andFirearms has been involved in rulemaking regardingthe use of litelight as a label for alcoholic beveragesJim Ficaretta of the BATF has stated that accordingto the current ruling if litelight in the sense reducedcalorie is applied to a malt beverage the label on thatproduct must contain a statement of average analysiswith regard to calories carbohydrates fat and proteinIf litelight simply describes a characteristic ofthe beer eg taste body color no such statement isrequired  The last word on this matter has not beenwritten however  A decade after it first became involvedin the litelight issue the BATF  with several            proposals on hand is still working on rulemakingwith regard to the use of litelight as a label for maltbeverages wines and spirits            The barons of beerdom are not the only merchantsto have produced reducedcalorie ingestibles  Aplethora of reducedcalorie foods are also available forthe weightconscious among us  Where food productsare concerned however no one has ever held the exclusiveright to lite   Therefore both lite and light havebeen freely used in the names of products eg PrinceLight Spaghetti Aunt Jemima Lite Syrup Thank YouLight Pie Filling Whitmans Lite Chocolates WonderLight Buns  and even Alpo Lite Dog Food   Such productsoften have one third fewer calories than their nonlightcounterparts although that proportion mightvary            Healthconscious Americans are concerned notonly with calories  They also want less caffeine in theircoffee less salt in their pickles less sodium in theirsalt no sugar added to their canned fruits and less tarin their cigarettes  Consequently those merchants whopander to and even help create our wants and needshave provided us with to name but a few the followinglitelight products Manor House Lite Coffee withone third less caffeine than regular coffee PipersFarms Lite Kosher Dills with  percent less salt thanPipers Farm regular dill pickles Morton Lite Salt withhalf the sodium of regular table

Weismantel president of Manor HouseFoods has stated  Lite is perceived by consumers as aname of a product that has less of a negative ingredient Chicago Tribune  November    His statementforeshadowed a new definition of litelight thatsix years later appeared in Random House II   lowin any substance as sugar starch or tars that is consideredharmful or undesirable light cigarettes                            LiteLight  when applied to a food may refer tothe products taste color or texture rather than to thenumber of calories or the amount of fat salt sugar orcholesterol it contains  For example in  FritoLayintroduced Light Corn Chips  which were thinnerand crispier than FritoLays regular corn chips butwhich had just as much salt and a few more caloriesthan the regular product  In order to avoid confusionFritoLay subsequently changed the name to Crisp NThin Corn Chips   Not all manufacturers of food productsare as concerned about customer confusion howeverRep Jim Cooper DTenn has observed Foodcompanies strain the limits of the English languageand our patience by overusing words such aslight   The more we distort the language the less theconsumer can understand the product  Chicago SunTimes October              In an effort to shed some light on the use oflitelight  Rep Cooper introduced in February  abill that would have limited the use of litelight toproducts that have one third fewer calories one halfless fat or three fourths less sodium than regular ienonlight products  This bill was lost in the legislativeshuffle however and as of this writing October  has yet to be passed in spite of having beenreintroduced in  and   The bill which in itscurrent form would require a product labeledlitelight to have one third fewer calories one third lessfat or one third less sodium than regular nonlightproducts will have to be introduced once again in  Perhaps the fourth time will be a charm            Potables comestibles and smokables are not theonly products to bear the litelight designation  In Hallmark introduced a series of greeting cardsthat contained puns  They were called LITE and weredescribed as being a third less serious than regulargreeting cards  This description was of course anallusion to the solecism that has been used to promoteMiller Lite Lite has a third less calories than theirregular beer  In  the Johnsons Wax people introducedGlade Light  an aerosol air freshener with lessthan half the perfume of regular sprays  In the sameyear Jhirmack introduced Lite Shampoo Lite Conditioner and Lite Mousse  which are designed to cleancondition and style ones hair without buildup            The use of litelight has extended beyond productnames  In such cases the term may be used in adescriptive sense to indicate that something is less intensethan its nonlight counterpart  Often howeverlitelight is used humorously or even caustically            Lowimpact aerobics have been called lite aerobics In music there are Lite Rock and Lite

essential problemshared with all other books of reference howeversound the advice they give it is useless and meaninglessif it is not looked up  That might seem too much ofa truism even for me to express but let me explainMany people feel that educational systems everywherehave deteriorated to an unconscionably low level andthat students are no longer taught in particular Englishgrammar and usage the way they once were  Inthe good old days when the system was presumablybetter many books on usage were also published soone must conclude that although students then mighthave been exposed to grammar and usage they didnot learn it  Yet one does have the possibly romanticimpression that even though grammar and usage werenot properly learned at least enough of a subliminalimpression of them was retained by students to leadthem to doubt a construction when they encounteredit driving them to check it in a Fowler or some otherwork  What I am getting at is that more and morepeople today seem to be less and less aware of any buttheir own way of using the language either becausethey are no longer exposed to the writings of greatauthors or because they are not taught grammar andusage and style or both  The only way students can betaught to improve their use of any language is by compellingthem to use it chiefly by requiring of them ona regular basis preferably not less often than once aweek a piece of writing which is gone over carefullyfor usage and grammar to ensure a compatibility witha standard to be devoutly wished for if not achievedAfter five years or more of such exercise even if theindividual cannot recall the difference between implyand infer  at least it is likely that whenever a choice isencountered a small bell will ring somewhere in therecesses of his mind recalling a longforgotten paperfor which the grade might have been reduced becauseof a failure to know the difference  If this were a RubeGoldberg contraption this recollection would remindthe writer of the grease spot on page  caused by hishaving eaten a Big Mac the memory of which conjuresup such a vivid image that the writer opens hismouth to take a bite and a string attached to his lowerjaw releases a mouse the sight of which arouses a catwhich chases it causing the mouse to squeal awakeninga midget who stretches tripping open a trapdoorthrough the trapdoor falls a usage book sliding downa chute into the hands of the writer            Would that life were so simple            There appears to be nothing remaining to promptpeople to use usage booksindeed reference books ofany kind  In a time when professional writers writethings like Neither Lord King nor Sir Colin Marshall were available for comment and worseone cannot accuse them of having made an error ofjudgment because that implies an awareness of choicein order to have a choice one must know of alternativesand I am ineluctably drawn to the conclusionthat people write the way they do because they knowof no alternative            Those who publish usage books seem to believethat sometime somewhere there will be people whowhen they use neither  will immediately rush to theirGood Word Guide to find out whether it takes a singularor a plural verb  That as we all know is a forlornhope to abuse a Dutch clich those who know thatwhen two or more people or things are the subject of averb you have to use were  not was  regardless of thecontext are like those who know like the people atElizabeth Arden that millennium is spelled with onen who know that it is Parmagiana  not Parmigianalike the people at Burger King and who have nodoubt that baking soda baking powder washing sodaand icecream soda are all the same thing  The causewould appear to be lost when one takes note that theonly pronunciation recorded in British dictionaries formachismo is makizmo as if it were derived fromItalian even a spelling pronunciation would have beenpreferable            Given the nature of the publishing business todayit is probably not at all surprising to see another usagebook bearing in mind that the Fowler is being updatedby Robert Burchfield though if you believe allthe foregoing palaver no one will ever refer to it  Allthat having been said it must be acknowledged that aslong as people buy books publishers do not reallymuch care whether they are read used as doorstopsor for propping up a sagging curio cabinet            Turning to the Introduction written by BettyKirkpatrick we read There is a school of thoughtprevalent mainly among older people which seeks toimpose a kind of restriction on language that is notimposed on other areas of life  p v I guess thatolder means anyone older than Kirkpatrick which Ihappen to be but while it is a matter of fact and ofrecord that I do seek to impose restrictions they aredirected against inept ineffectual inaccurate languageand poor style  Moreover who says I dont seekto impose restrictions on other areas of life  I despisebad art hypocrisy and other forms of dishonesty andin general execrate any policy or behavior that interfereswith the rights and freedoms of others            Having relegated conservatism and old fogeyismto one another Kirkpatrick asks p vi Should we sayit wasnt I or it wasnt me  between you and me orbetween you and I different from different to  ordifferent than less bottles of milk or fewer bottles ofmilk   In my own recommended usage when itcomes to milk it makes no difference but if you aretalking about beer or gin then neither is acceptableWhat does that word should mean  Smacks of oldfogeyism does it not            Further down page vi Where a supposed alternativesis in fact wrong this is clearly stated  Wrong Who is the old fogey now Kirkpatrick  Again andagain we read about the careful user who wishes touse English correctly and congently in contrast to therunofthemill user who frequently sacrifices care andcorrectness in the interests of speed  To impute suchsacrifices to a desire for speed is not only a misinterpretationof the evidence but a curious thing to say forthose who are in a hurry are scarcely likely to stopeverything pick up this or any other book to checksomething and then resume their headlong plungeinto the solecistic abyss  Are not the runofthemillusers really just the careless users who as theywould probably say could care less about using Englishcorrectly and cogently            The most attractive thing about this book is thewriting which for the most part is simple clearstraightforward and readable  In short the book isuserfriendly  It is essentially a British work for theBritish market or for people who want to use Englishthe way the British do  The entries cover spellingpronunciation grammar punctuation usage buzzwords and subsets of all of those  The advice is

between r as the symbolfor the initial sound in rim and rr for the medialsound in marry   Although these are different sounds inmany British English dialects they are not only allophonicbut in complementary distribution that isthey never exchange places hence do not need separatesymbols  Also the editors have avoided the schwa preferring to resurrect the antediluvian systemused by MerriamWebster in the Second Edition oftheir Unabridged and since abandoned by almosteveryone  Even in the ahOOgah or moogoogaipanschool of pronunciation the unstressed vowel isrendered by a uniform

socks or both there isnothing inherent in the example even hinting at theexistence of socks made of a nylon and cotton mixture            In the matter of Celsius versus centigrade  thepoint is not that they are identical which is ambiguousfor very similar and the same thing but thatthey are the same thing the scale formerly called centigradewas renamed in  to honor Anders Celsiusthe thcentury Swedish astronomer who devised it            Information on American usage is treated inconsistentlyand as the book is for the British user mightwell have been eliminated altogether            There is no entry for free gift  just as obnoxious inBritain as anywhere else English is used            An entry on this or that   would have been in orderchiefly to cover its usage as a pronoun or

good writing            As for the English word forte strength it is notthe feminine form of the French adjective fort strongbut an English feminization of the French noun fortstrength  The pronunciation fortay is an illiteracyscarcely attributable as given here and in various dictionariesto a confusion with the musical direction sopronounced because that is a loanword from Italianthose who know about musical directions are not likelyto blunder that badly            If enough people buy this book it will soon needa second printing which it is hoped will include someof the foregoing

BRAAHMAN the first vowel sounds asin the English word father  has been used in the Englishlanguage  Until a decade or so ago it was speltbrahmin  which is now given as an alternate spellingand has survived in such expressions of common occurrenceas Boston Brahmins   While every literate Americanmay not be familiar with the expression thosewho are will know that a Boston Brahmin refers to thearistocrats or first families of Boston such as the Cabotsand the Lodges  My concern is not with the meaningof the expression but with the persistent capitalizationof the word            Derived from Brahma the First Principle or SupremeBeing of some Hindu philosophical systemssuch as Vedanta a brahman is primarily a person whobelieves in Brahma  or Brahman   By extension brahmancame to mean a member of the sacred or sacerdotalcaste as Webster has it  In order to avoid confusionI shall henceforth spell the word without capitalizationto denote the caste and with a capital toimply the Absolute  This in fact is the crux of theproblem  When we use the word Absolute with a capitala we know that it has a very specific applicationIt is high time that brahman be so spelt when the casteis implied reserving Brahman when the Absolute ismeant  This will not only help the reader to distinguishbetween the two meanings but will conform toconventional capitalization in the English language            The error was originally made by the British inthcentury India  Not only were the brahmans thebest educated Hindus they met but also more importantit was soon realized that among the Hindus thebrahman was a much more sacred group than saythe molla is among the Muslims the rabbi among theJews or the priest among the Christians  From timeimmemorial the brahmans of India had insisted upontheir social and spiritual superiority  In many of thecommon Sanskrit prayers a brahman is invoked or imprecatedalong with the gods  To do reverence to abrahman was to do reverence to Brahman for a brahmanwas not simply the intermediary between manand the gods he was a god            Confronted with this attitude and somewhatawed the British acknowledged their respect by capitalizingthe word  But what is even more curious isthat they also capitalized the expressions for the threeother castes viz kshatriya martial class vaisya farmersand merchants and sudra menials  It is remarkablethat this anomaly still persists even in many modernsources            The Englishspeaking world expecially GreatBritain Canada the USA and even India claim tobe the bastions of democracy which clearly should notrecognize caste or class distinctions  Is it not ironicthen that they should still perpetuate so blatant a fallacyCompilers of our dictionaries should stop capitalizingthe words for the four Hindu castes and retainthe custom only for Brahma or Brahman when it impliesthe Absolute  Not only will it avoid confusionamong users of dictionaries but it will restore thepreeminence of Brahma or Brahman while reducingthe brahmans to the status of the rest of us mortalswhere they really belong                                             Harare Reuter  A Latin greeting from the Popebrought

Yiddish XV MessrsLederer and Schenkerman put the word cockamamyor cockamamie  at the head of a list of Yiddish wordsfound in English as published in Websters Third NewInternational Dictionary   I have spoken Yiddish sincechildhood have a fairly wide reading knowledge andacquaintance with various levels and styles of the languagebut have never come across a word or phraseresembling cockamamy   It simply has no meaning inthat language  Leo Rosten may list it in his book TheJoys of Yiddish  but he fails to make a positive identificationAs for gun moll  there was no phrase in theWarsaw or Odessa underworlds like gonif molly  If Iam not mistaken the word moll is a wellrooted nativeword in English going back at least as far as DanielDefoes Moll Flanders   The gun part derives plainlyfrom the English gun             As for schnoz  it does sound Yiddish there doesexist a verb schneitzen to blow ones nose and theshn  combination does connote something to do withthe nose but there is no word shnozzle in Yiddish onlynoz or in the alternate dialect nuz   Phudnik is not aYiddish word but was clearly formed on the Yiddishroot nik  which also occurs in Slavic  I dont knowwhere the sh sound arose in nebbish  but in all easternEuropean dialects of Yiddish the word is nebbikh ornebbakh  with a velar fricative sound that is renderedas sh by speakers who find that easier to pronounce                              Concerning Thomas H Middletons Muskrats RNot  XV according to the album cover of my LPOrys Creole Trombone Good Time Jazz Lthe origin of the name of Muskrat Ramble was at thesession at which the newly composed tune was firstrecorded  As the musicians were leaving a recordcompany representative asked the name of the newpiece which Kid Ory had not yet named  Lil Armstrongwho was the pianist for the session improvisedthe answer Thats named Muskrat Ramble isntthat right Red  Red was Kid Orys nickname  Oryreplied Thats right  I remember that Lil Armstrongwas quoted on the record sleeve as giving this explanationalthough I still have the LP the sleeve was destroyedsome years ago  The blurb went on to explainthat at a subsequent time some record company executivedecided that Muskrat Ramble was too ineleganta title and changed its name on future pressing toMuskat or Muscat Ramble  My LP from the sgives the title as Muskrat Ramble                              As always it was a delight to read the new VERBATIMIt is even more fun though to catch our omniscienteditor in a small blooper  The comment on squarethe circle in the review of Loose Cannons  Red HerringsXV misses the point when it states thereis no mathematical way of calculating the dimensions ofa square with the same area as that of a given circleThis classic geometrical problem requires that one startwith a given circle and construct a square of the samearea using the straightedge and compass the onlytools permitted the geometer            The mathematician on the other hand can calculatethe dimensions of such a square to any desireddegree of accuracy using simple algebra  You canquibble of course that such an answer can never beperfect but that has nothing to do with the problemof squaring the circle geometrically                               Similarly from Iraj Kalantari Macomb Illinois andJames G Wendel Palo Alto                                              Pace Websters Third XV but including theword cockamamie in a Yiddish lexicon is questionableas is the definition given  As a youngster in The Bronxin the early s I would occasionally take my windfallof a few pennies to the local candy store and buy astrip of cockamamies  comicstyle cartoons in brilliantcolors each about an inch by an inch and a halftransferable to forearm or forehead by wetting preferablywith saliva to make things agreeably messy  As wegrew older we came to realize that cockamamie wasmerely a childs distortion of decalcomania   Latercockamamie came to mean cheap sleazy gaudytrashy junkybut never mixedup ridiculous  Illaccept the word as a Bronxism but not as an exclusiveproperty of the Yiddish language                              Maxey Brooke writes XV that English tamale isfrom Spanish tamale   There is however no such Spanishword  Rather two explanations may be offered forthis English word  My explanation is that Englishspeakersborrowed Spanish plural tamales whose singularis tamal  from which they backformed a newsingular tamale ie the division into morphemes inSpanish is tamales whereas Englishspeakers took it tobe tamales   English has both frijol and frijole  thelatter of which may be explained in the same wayEnglishspeakers borrowed Spanish plural frijoleswhose singular is frijol  from which they backformeda new singular frijole again the morphemedivision in Spanish is frijoles whereas certain Englishspeakerstook it to be frijoles   English frijol  on theother hand is derived straightforwardly from theSpanish singular            A different explanation of tamale was offered inAmerican Speech    p  Just as theAmerican recalls that French words should be stressedon the final syllable he recalls or thinks he recallsthat all Spanish words should end with a vowel sombrero seorita  noche and so on  These items are all inthe singular  Thus by analogy many Americans maketamale  instead of the correct tamal  the singular oftamales   By the same analogy equipal  the splintand leather patio chair so popular in Mexico becomesequipale             The second explanation is possible though numerousSpanish words end in a consonant and I dontknow how the two explanations could be verified  Theleast one may say is that no English dictionary publishedthrough  gives a fully correct etymology fortamale or frijole             An English noun which is definitely backformedfrom a plural is blints often misspelled blintz  Yiddishhas singular blintse  plural blintses  henceblints is an English innovation  Interestingly whereastamale and frijole have acquired a nonetymologicalvowel blints has lost an etymological vowel  In generalbackformation of new singulars from plurals is asign that the plural is textually more frequent than thesingular indeed the Oxford English Dictionary listsonly frijoles and no singular form whatsoever forEnglish            After the new singulars emerged in English newplurals were formed  Although English tamales  frijoles and blintses  as now usually pronounced appearto be derived from Spanish tamales  Spanish frijoles and Yiddish blintses  they are actually innovationsformed in English by the addition of English s in thefirst two cases or es in the third to the innovativeEnglish singulars  This is proven by the fact that theEnglish plurals are pronounced with z and not as inthe case of the Spanish and Yiddish plurals with sThat is since Spanish or Yiddish s  English zwould be phonologically unlikely here s and es in theEnglish plurals are the native English plural allomorphsrather than Spanish or Yiddishorigin allomorphsOnly among the few people who pronouncethe English plurals with s are these words derivedfrom the plurals used in Spanish or Yiddish  Generallythese are people strongly influenced by one of thesetwo languages            Brookes derivation of machete from Spanish machomale is a folk etymology the two words are unconnectedand the

epitaphs was a glorypeculiar to our language  But then I lived in Mexicoand soon knew better  The first Mexican malapropismI heard or recognized as such was spoken at CholeDurns refreshment booth in the plaza of JocotepecJalisco  Doa Faustina was bringing Chole up to theminute and in the course of her gossip she mentionedthat her niece Socorro had been grvida but was nowaliviada   Two young farmhands were also at thebooth drinking in the prattle with their Pepsis  WhenFaustina left one of them asked the other Have youever been grvido             Just once when I was ten  But my motherbought me some pills and I got over it            Chole tried not to laugh but she laughed  Whenshe explained to us that grvida means pregnant thefarmhands loved the joke their Indian eyes brightwith amusement  One of them explained that theythought grvido was a more educated form of grave which means gravely ill  As for aliviada  it meansbeing alleviated or cured  When a child is born it isas if the mother had recovered from a disease            After that with my ears attuned I heard malapropismson all sides and even recognized that Icommitted them myself  For a while I confused

adinner vegetable or remarked that we were almost outof string beans for the water heater  I was also guilty ofasking her to serve a pork chop in adobe rather thanadobo   The latter is a sauce related to the mole thatMoctezuma served to Corts  The former of course isa mud of another color            Even so I never blundered as badly as the dowagerstaying at the little Hotel La Quinta  She was on adiet that forbade dessert and coffee so she left thedining room before the other guests  When shereached the doorway she always turned gave a statelynod and said Excusado  Obviously she thought

Villa liked best                        But Mateo changed leguas to lenguas  which meanstongues literally or languages  Was this remarkablehorse a polyglot  No wonder Villa esteemed it  Onanother Mateo warbled Ojitos de capuln a familiarmariachi song  A capuln is a small shinyblack fruitand the title means that the girls little eyesthediminutive of affection with no hint that she wasbeadyeyedwere dark and lustrous  In Mateos versioncapuln became chapuln  which means grasshopperSo she was not beadyeyed but bugeyed            Small children are often malapropists especiallywhen they have to memorize texts they cannot understandMy sister when small asked our parents if welived in America  On being assured that we did sheasked why they told her in school that we live in TizzavyIt turned out that she was referring to My countrytis of thee            Lolas daughter Teresa was almost as inventiveand again it was the Lords Prayer  In Spanish it beginsPadre nuestro que ests en los cielos santificadosea tu nombre  Teresa changed cielos to celos andsantificado to santo pintado  so that in Biblical Englishit comes out something like Our Father which art injealousies painted saint be Thy name  The first remindsme of I the Lord thy God am a jealous Godand the second is not as farfetched as it seems  Althoughsanto means saint a santo as an object meansa religious

told that the correct word was damasquinaswith its exotic evocation of damask and DamascusWhen I asked him what normalginas meant if anythinghe said that Normalgina was the trade name ofa Mexican

VERBATIM Book Club Selection            For years I have engaged in the often useful habitof reading Forewords Prefaces Prolegomena Introductionsand other bits that appear at the beginningsof books  It is a practice to be recommended for one ormore of several reasons one can often be spared readingthrough a boring badly conceived or abominablywritten work one can determine quite readily why thebook was written and what its argument or pointmight be then read the text to judge whether theauthors purpose has been carried out  Such front matteras it is more commonly called in the US orprelims so called in Britain is usually written by theauthor or one of them  There is a Preface to thisbook written by the estimable Janet Whitcut which Ishall get to in a moment  First though is an essayWhats the Usage  by the inestimable Joseph Epsteineditor of American Scholar  professor of somethingat Northwestern University and selfstyledpseud  I hadnt noticed who had written the essay till Iencountered the following barely three paragraphsinto the writingIt is closer to the truth to say that woolly circumlocutionspsychobabblous phrasing and sentimentsand language used as if it were a game of horseshoesin which one expects points for being closeoffends me                        Well they offends me too especially when theyappears in the lead essay of a book on style and usageand particularly when it are a book of this quality  Isaw little point in continuing reading Epstein when Iwas sure that matters could only improve by turning toGowers Greenbaum and Whitcut all of whom couldbe relied on to make subjects and predicates agree innumber            Putting outright downright grammatical solecismsaside it would be pertinent to reiterate my ownattitude toward usage as a linguist I regard usageclinically and would no more criticize a writer or aspeaker of any kind of English for mistakes than adoctor would criticize a patient for contracting appendicitisor the Malay wasteaway on the other hand asa writer albeit a poor one I attend to matters of stylewhich includes usage and grammar of course notonly in others writing but my own  As readers arequick to point out my attention to such matters occasionallywanders for which I offer no excuses  Yet thesense of discovery in finding Epsteinisms is undiminishedthough any glee is mitigated by the feeling ofembarrassment undoubtedly shared among David RGodine respected publisher and Greenbaum andWhitcut respected colleagues and friends            The first edition of The Complete Plain Words  anedited

Britannic Majestys Stationary sic  Office on the copyright page in  tocelebrate its bicentennial is a revision of Frasers editionAs Whitcut carefully indicates in her Prefacechapters  and  are almost pure Gowers  Inthis third edition we generally represents Greenbaumand Whitcut  I spent some time ferreting aboutin the new material and am pleased to report as Isuspected a sane and sensible approach in chapter to such topics as The trend towards informality thelanguage even in Britain is loosening up The objectionsto sexist language Present usage is unstableOfficial writers ought to take evasive actionThe influence of science and technology  I  nputhas become an overworked vogue word as hasuserfriendly  The influences of other varietiesof English in which one can find good examplesof socalled Americanisms that were formerly British            The authors pull no punches characterizing onegovernment memorandum as spoilt by carelessnessclichs and flaccidity another as rather stiltedbut by no means outrageous a third as verbose orstilted and a fourth as containing wording andpunctuation that is clumsy ambiguous and redundantFor each of five specimens selected for analysisand comment

writing  For a short list it is a good one            Of course there is not much point in having anylist unless people use it which brings me to my maincriticism of speakers and writers of a certain age sayunder  and education level  To put the matter differentlyI could write an essay called The Perils ofLiteracy or A Little Literacy Is a Dangerous ThingMuch of the ineffectual use of language is traceable tothe fact that although many people want to improvetheir language they are completely unfamiliar withthe help available to them  How for example arepeople to know whether to use infer or imply if theyare totally unaware that any problem exists  For generationspeople have pronounced the word KONtrvrseethen some odd body came along saying knTROVrseeand the faith of many speakers was shakenIf they had looked it up in a dictionary which lists thepronunciations used by a majority of speakers knTROVrseewould never have surfaced            To be useful The Complete Plain Words andother books like it must be read through   Then whenpeople are about to use infer or imply  a small voiceshould whisper I seem to recall that Gower orFowler  or some other work including every mediumsizeddictionary had something on that occasioninga quick lookup that would resolve the question atonce  But if people are not humble enough to doubttheir own control over the vast complexities of the languageand if to boot they are ignorant of the contentof even the most basic available resources then anyhope of their learning how literate people expressthemselves is lost

Encyclopedia of Word andPhrase Origins            This is a good book and an interesting book  Accordingto the authors Preface it covers some words and phrases and its great fault is that it lacks anindex  That is to say there are about  or so mainentries the rest of the terms being discussed within theentries unless they begin with the same letter orwords the user will be unable to find them without anindex  For example tsar tsarina  etc are discussed atczar  but there is no cross reference in the Ts for thetsar words and if you didnt think or know to lookunder czar  you would think them missing  Publishersought to learn that they cannot always anticipate theneeds of users of books and that indexes are almostinvariably an aid in finding things            My other complaint is about compositors andproofreaders who set loose lines because they do notknow how to hyphenate the word they have carriedover to a following line  Today compositors rely far toomuch on the automatic hyphenation programs packagedwith their computer typesetting systems  A typicalexample occurs as one might expect at the entryfor deipnosophist where a line that normally containsabout  characters plus spaces has been printedwith only  characters plus spaces mainly apparentlybecause no one knew where to hyphen Deipnosophistai the first word on the next line  This rather uglyphenomenon occurs here and there in this otherwiseattractive book            Back to the contents  General dictionaries giveetymologies albeit brief ones of most of the wordsthey list and fulfill a useful if limited function  Extensiveworks like the Oxford English Dictionary offer farmore elaborate information including where appropriateand available valuable comments on the originsof sense development  Etymological dictionariesdo pretty much the same though for the most partthey like the OED  eschew information about multiwordentries idiomatic phrases and such  Then thereare books like Funks A Hog on Ice and my own TheWhole Ball of Wax  that treat the origins of particularkinds of expressions and occasionally words  Hendricksonsbook EWPO for short covers some standardsingleword entries some oddities a number ofphrases and expressions and a good selection of itemsnot covered by most of the other books            Much of what appears is well established some ofit is speculative some taken from unreliable sourcesand some at variance with the accepted scholarshipFor instance Allen Walker Reads widely accepted etymologyof OK is just the reverse of HendricksonstheOK of oll korrect was adopted by VanBuren Old Kinderhook as a campaign cry not theother way round  At horse latitudes  the author haspicked up the theory that it comes from  golfo de lasyeguas  gulf of the mares which was the Spanishname for the ocean between Spain and the CanaryIslands and compares the supposed fickleness of mareswith the fickle winds in these latitudes  As far as Ihave been able to determine golfo de las yeguas is acomplete fiction for there is no evidence for any suchdesignation in any gazetteer that I could find nor atthe Royal Geographical Society  Besides the horse latitudesreferred to were in the doldrums which occurwest not east of the Canaries  I comment on that inBall of Wax             My current theory runs as follows the SargassoSea a region northeast of the West Indies is characterizedas an area of relative calm and an abundanceof sargassum  an entangling seaweed  As such seaweedsthrive in the Gulf Stream they are generally calledgulfweeds   In all likelihood the region was originallyknown as golfo del mar in Spanish that is gulf of thesea and was so entered on charts  English speakerswho used the charts read mar as mare female horsewhich was later generalized to horse   Another possibilityis that the origin was French golfe de la mer orlatitude de la mer  French mer being quite close insound to English mare  which was later generalized tohorse   A third possibility is that the waters were populatedby manatees which might have been likened tohorses not too farfetched a suggestion when one considersthat sailors are said to have imagined them to bemermaids  The theory that the horse latitudes were sonamed because mariners becalmed there threw overboardthe horses they were transporting because theydied of thirst or starved seems almost impossible inorder for such an event to have given rise to horselatitudes it would have to have recurred many timesand it is hard to believe that th and thcenturymariners were so improvident as to have allowed thatto happen very often  Thus I cannot accept Hendricksonsorigin for horse latitudes  though to give him hisdue he only copied the etymology from other sourcesthe OED included            A bakers dozen of other matters              At HoreBelisha  the information is given thatthe pedestrian crosswalk signals are often called HoreBelishas in my experience the term is usually Belishabeacon               At heliotrope  some might miss the point withoutthe information that Apollo was the Greek god ofthe sun              At guerilla  the usual spelling is guerrilla   Itcomes from Spanish guerra war              Perhaps the mystery of the origin of the verbgoose might be cleared up by examining the openingchapter of Gargantua  by Rabelais              Under gibson cocktail

change from numble pie to umble pie tohumble pie  attributed to some anonymous punster inthe time of William the Conqueror was actually dueto the same influences that changed a napron to anapron in

to enter thekingdom of heaven than for a camel to go through theeye of a needle results from a misreading of the originalthe original it is said has a word meaning ropenot camel which makes sense to me  I cannot insistthat Hendrickson accept the theory but he ought atleast to have acknowledged its existence instead we aretold that ancient Middle Eastern walled towns had arear gate called the Needles Eye through which a camelcould pass only if kneeling down  How camels moveforward while kneeling is not explainedperhaps paceSeattlethat is also the true origin of skid row

objection is that the terms identified asAustralian are not necessarily exclusively so  For exampleserviette scone sheila sister Smarties spannerspot on squash starkers  just to pick a handful
