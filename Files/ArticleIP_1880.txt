                                 Government and Volleyball                           A mere years ago beach volleyball was just beginning Now it is not only a sportbut in the Olympics  And theres a whole new world of opportunity openingup that didnt even exist  years ago or  years ago and no bureaucrat wouldhave invented it And thats what freedom is all about                        House Speaker NewtGingrich addressing the Republican Convention            Not muchhas changed over the last  years on the small island off the coast of Mainewhere I have vacationed most summers of my life A few things have beenlostthe inn burned down though few outside the insurance company mourned itsloss as did the little grocery store much mourned when the milk supply runslow and the harbor lies a foggy three miles distantbut not much has beenadded The farmhouse the shingled cottages the library and the chapel seemas immutable in their slightly shabby Wyethian perfection as the sea thatsparkles behind them            Yet this year there was something new a beachvolleyballnet It stands firmly moored on the white sand beach that lies a few yards tothe west of my sisters cottage and fewer than a hundred yards from my ownIll admit that when I first spotted the net I failed to grasp its symbolicimportance I thought it was something of an eyesore Only later with thebenefit of Speaker Newt Gingrichs GOP Convention instruction see above didI come to realize that what we had here was no less than the fulsome gift froma mature Freedom to the islands youth Sure it sags a bit by Olympicstandards but it stands nevertheless as a symbol of what the human spiritcan achieve when free from the oppression of Big Government            Of coursethe volleyball net didnt just wash in with the tide The tiny islandgovernment that decides such things voted money to sink the concrete pilingsthat support the nets posts and to purchase the needed equipment And theLadies Improvement Association provided personpower for the erection effortBut these are small bureaucracies more akin to the voluntary associations thatfall on the positive side of the GOPs freedomslavery divide Still I wonderEven if larger governments like for example San Diegos dont actually putup the nets surely they regulate their placement on beaches and other publicplaces            Now I dont doubt for a moment that if you puta group of bureaucrats around a conference table the chances of them coming upwith sensible rules for beach volleyball much less the seminal concept arezilch More likely they would invent a bunch of rules for keeping the playersfrom spraining their ankles or getting their toes cut by pieces of glass hiddenin the sand or contracting tetanus from rusty nails stuck in driftwoodActually you know there are rules sort of like that My sister who issomething of an amateur expert on beaches tells me for example that pursuantto Maines Natural Resources Protection Act Coastal Sand Dune Rules Chapter the state government sets standards for beach cleaningthough more withan eye to protecting the beaches than the beachgoing public Some might thinkthat these rules whether aimed at pristine dunes or uncut feet also advancethe cause of beach volleyball            It occurs to me further thatthe beach itself might not have been able to accommodate this monument tofreedom were it not for the fact that a few years back my sister took it uponherself to consult some experts among them actual bureaucrats about theerosion that then threatened it These experts notable among them Stephen MDickson of the Maine Department of Conservation and L Kenneth Fink of theDarling Marine Center in Walpole Maine quickly fingered the culprit theconcrete sidewalk erected some  years ago by an island benefactorone MrStanley of Steamer fame            Thesidewalk they counseled caused the sea to erode rather than build theimportant dune that with its beach grass and surrounding berm colonizersprotects the beach and the north end of the island And so the sidewalk wentand the dune swells with each passing year and the beach grass slithers in thewind Beachvolleyball fans everywhere should surely rejoice at the collectiveaction that at the cost of some individual freedom to be sure mine forexample as with sandfilled shoes I struggle to navigate my groceryladencart along the dirt track that is now the only access to my cottage haspreserved another venue for their sport            Come to think of it its just possible that no sportbenefits more from bureaucrats than beach volleyball To begin with ifgovernments at every level hadnt intervened beaches everywhere might havebeen incorporated by the wealthy into Gatsbyesque estates like those thatdenied most of the North Shore of Long Island to hoi polloi All four finalistsin the recent Olympic mens beachvolleyball championship as well as twomembers of Americas other topranked mens team and two from the mostsuccessful US womens team grew up playing on Californias spectacularpublic beaches And while the more aggressive types of beach maintenanceactivity have fallen into disfavor among coastal geologists in recent yearsthose beaches like the East Coasts have been the recipients of billions intaxpayers dollars spent collectively by local state and federalbureaucracies from the Squirrel Island Village Corp to the Army Corps ofEngineers            Nor does government supportfor beach volleyball stop at dunes end All six of Americas topranking maleplayers got their higher education thanks to the splendid network of collegesand universities that their home state maintains While in college they honedtheir skills playing regular volleyballnot a sport that pays its own way oncampus And though todays topranking players earn sixfigure incomes fromtheir prizes and commercial endorsements many of the great players of tomorrowmay even now be benefiting from governments biggest covert subsidy of sportsand the artsunemployment insurance and perhaps the occasional foodstamp            So let me draw a slightlydifferent moral from the saga of beach volleyball as it has evolved in ourtimes If as Speaker Gingrich says the price of volleyball is eternalfreedom still it may take a village to raise a volleyball net
