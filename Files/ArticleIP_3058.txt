                                 Smileys People            One thing you have to admireabout Jane Smiley no matter what you think of her fiction She puts her moneywhere her mouth is Two years ago Smiley published an essay inHarpers a manifesto reallyclaiming that readers have been connedinto seeing Huckleberry Finn as the definitive American novel whenits actually a mess and a moral disaster Among her charges was the claim thatthe bond between Huck and the escaped slave Jim was an evasive white fantasyTwain she says doesnt care what happens to Jim Jim is just a dumb sidekickand the novel a precursor to the kinds of buddy movies in which a sweet blackcop played by Danny Glover stands aside while a white hero played by Mel Gibsonsaves the day            Whatsmore Smiley wrote readers have always sensed that the happy ending is slappedon a copout probably the book would have dropped out of sight if certainselfpromoting writers hadnt started talking it up early in this centuryThese literary bulliesTS Eliot Ernest Hemingway and later on LionelTrillingwere invested in a single skewed view of American writing Theybelieved that its great theme was the struggle of the individual wanderingalone in the wilderness and they turned Huck into a mascot for the LonelySearching Man What made Smiley especially angry was how these canonbuildersdismissed all the  th century novels that didnt conform to thisguyinnature pattern unless the novels were written by Henry James Theydecided that the oncebeloved social novelSmileys prime example is HarrietBeecher Stowes Uncle Toms Cabin was a weepy feminine waste oftime            Iremember reading Smileys article at the time andblanching One hates to use a sexists favorite word but she came off asshrill On the other hand if you set aside her excessive loathing of Twainsome of her points are hard to argue with Shes  for instance that untilrecently men who wrote about alienation stood a decent chance of being takenseriously by critics while a whole genre of social novels written by women gotpoohpoohed as earnest and sentimental            Is it possible or evendesirable to revive the lost tradition of social fiction In The AllTrueTravels and Adventures of Lidie Newton  Smiley has supplied a test caseIts set in the Kansas Territory shortly before the Civil War when the areawas an anarchic battleground between Northern abolitionists poor proslaversfrom Missouri and speculators out to make a buck            Theeponymous heroine was born and raised in Quincy Ill and orphaned just asthe novel opens at the age of  Lidie is tall homely a tomboyandsomewhat anachronistically aware of all the  th century clothingand marriage customs that infantilize women Shes a burden to her extendedstep family so when Thomas a seriousminded man from Massachusetts passesthrough town on his way to Kansas she marries him within the week She knowshes running guns for abolitionists blond effeminate and brave hes theNorthern counterpart to Gone With the Wind s Ashley but shes totallyunprepared for the hardscrabble life shes chosen The first few chapters aregripping recreations of the hideous journey to Kansas and the daunting task ofbuilding a cabin from scratch while drunken strangers jeer at you and threatenyou with rifles            From her diatribe in Harpers  youdthink Smiley was out to revive Stowian melodrama with its coincidencesangelic children and neat distinctions between good and evil Wrong At everypoint Smiley upsets the usual expectations Coming from the no mans land ofIllinois instead of North or South Lidie represents the realists take onslaveryin her heart shes against it but she finds the abolitionists smugintoxicated by their own abstract words Instead of love at first sightLidies romance with cold fussy Thomas is slow and confusing and halfwaythrough the book just as shes prepared to investigate the possibility thattheyre in love hes suddenly murdered I might not have revealed this plotpoint if it werent announced on the book jacket            Here thestory turns into a kind of absurd picaresque Lidie driven by rage at herloss disguises herself as a boy reporter in hostile Missouri and sets out tofind Thomas killers But Smiley blocks her path with various obstacles untilLidie ends up broke and dying on the side of a road and a slaveowning familytakes her in Unwilling to give up the notion that she has a mission sheembarks on a final escapade She tries to liberate Lorna the familys angryputupon slavemaid            At which point it becomes obvious that Smiley isntwriting a traditional social novel at all Shes writing a sendup ofHuckleberry Finn  The parallels are obvious Lidie equals Huck andLorna equals JimLidie even has a mischievous young cousin whos a standinfor Tom Sawyerand the whole point of the book is to shine the harsh light ofreality on Twains irresponsible fantasy Unlike Hucks adventure Lidies endsin disaster Lorna is caught and sent down the river to a violent fate in theSouth And Lidie learns learns and learns her lesson Shes been selfish and Desperate to escape the plantation where shes been recuperating but lackingthe willpower she has selfishly accepted the defenseless Lorna as my reviverfelt the cool firm sensation of her hand on my neck as a promise            The ending of LidieNewton is quite stunning as parody But for someone so bent on unmaskingpieties Smiley is not above her own kind of sanctimony In its curious modernway this novel is a sermon It attacks sentimentality ideology and piggishmale heroism preaching ambiguity in their place No one could describe whatwas true in Kansas and Missouri the newly mature Lidie announces at the endThe message is deepSmiley may be the subtlest didact ever to write a novelBut was it worth taking down Huckleberry Finn for Only if it serves asa building block to a better Smiley novel in the future one in which herbrilliant lessons of disillusionment fly faster because theyre spurred on bya bigger warmer imagination This would be the real coup to unite Smileyscold corrective realism with the joystill unmatchedof that increasinglymisunderstood writer Mark
