                                 Beyond the Valley of the IPOs                        Good guys and bad guys I hadnt thought aboutThe New New Thing in those terms since it seemedto me that even though Clark had spats with various peopleand even though helooked at money people in particular as verminall of them even the verminwere his coconspirators Everybody involved in this story was in this thingtogether thinking and acting in this new way trying to reinvent the businessworld and perhaps even trying to redefine the nature of capitalism itself Canyou really generate a net worth of  billion withoutever doing any work  Certainly that has to rank as one of Jim Clarks moreaudacious experiments in capitalism            Ultimately every character in the book is going toturn out to be a good guyor theyre all going to turn out to be bad guysLets remember again why we both thought so highly of The New New Thing  It offers an astonishingly vivid description ofwhat Silicon Valley is like at this moment in history From my vantage point onthe East Coast it seems crazy out thereand Lewis has that craziness nailedSo lets suppose for a second that this  this  anarchy as Lewis callsit turns out to be the future of American businesswhich of course is whatmost people in the Valley firmly believe If that turns out to be the casewere going to look back on this book  years from now and say Jim Clark andthose guys in The New New Thing  they showed us theway They are true heroes But now lets suppose that Silicon Valley at themillennium turns out to be what the s were when we were in college anintoxicating flashinthepan That is all that Jim Clarkstyle anarchyultimately falls by the wayside much of the wealth evaporates and one daypeople wake up and wonder What were we thinking In that case well lookback at The New New Thing and say What a bunch ofidiots those guys were Couldnt they see that it was all about to collapseWeirdlyand this is The New New Thing s real mark of greatnessthebook will hold up no matter how this story plays out            There is no dissenter in TheNew New Thing  no East Coast sage shaking his head sadly and warning thatit is all going to turn out badly And that is perfectly appropriate for thisbook because there really is no dissent in the Valley But reading the bookprovoked in me at least the lingering thought that it cant last There istoo much venture capital money chasing increasingly marginal business ideasasexemplified by Clarks going in to see John Doerr uttering one sentence andgetting funding for MyCFO an idea that may or may not have merit As usualits impossible to know from the scenes in The New NewThing  There is an increasing lack of rigor in Internet startups Catchphrases such as business modelswhich Lewis knowingly mockshave replacedactual business plans Nobody seems to even care about profits anymore All ofthese things can be found in The New New Thing  Youjust have to come to the book predisposed to look for them            Which I admit is my general bias Yes I believe theInternet will be huge and potentially transformativeand might even make somecompanies profitable some day in the distant future But no I dont thinkwhats going on in the Valley right now is sustainable What was that line youquoted In this new world skepticism was not a sign of intelligence It was asin            Thats me a sinner Care to join me in hell
