                      Madeira and the Madeirans        A mere speck in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean Madeira        has all the elements of a mysterious dream world The volcanic island        is thickly draped with vegetation a colorful riot of flowers and fruit        trees Rugged mountains peek through the clouds and microclimates        hover over isolated villages Spectacular cliffs crash hundreds of feet        below to the deep blue surf        Even though foreign invaders stormed Portugal around         bc  Madeira was discovered only a few decades before Columbus made        his way to America Though part of the Portuguese empire since the        great expedition teams of the th century claimed it for King Joo I        Madeira is nearer to Africa than Lisbon It lies  km  miles off        the coast of Morocco and nearly  km  miles southwest of the        Portuguese capital        Formed from volcanic eruptions many millions of years ago        Madeira like the Canary Islands is an archipelago The land is like        an iceberg massive mountains poke through the clouds forming the mere        tip of a submerged mass Only one other island in the small group is        inhabitedthe little known arid and much flatter holiday hideaway        of Porto Santo Christopher Columbus visited Porto Santo in the second        half of the th century marrying the local governors daughter        Few places on earth can rival Madeiras wealth of natural        gifts especially in so small an area The island is blanketed with        flowers birds of paradise their beaklike flowers bright orange        blossom in open fields Fragrant hydrangeas line walking paths skirting        the edges of mountain terraces Private and public gardens burst with        orchids bougainvillea and jacarandas while orchards heave with        mangoes passion fruit watermelons and avocados        In the mountains water streams down from unseen springs a        onehour walk might take you past half a dozen waterfalls The cold        waters around the island once prime whaling territory are today a        marine sanctuary for whales dolphins and seals And all of this in        yearround subtropical spring weather with a southerly breeze and        temperatures averaging  C in summer and  C in winter        Madeira seems much larger than its diminutive size just         km  miles long and  km  miles wide The terrain is so        mountainous and its roads so tortuous that distances are magnified in        terms of both time and effort This can breed insularity some        villagers have never been as far as Funchal and the thought of making        the long trip to the mainland is even more remote Yet young and        upwardly mobile islanders do go off in search of fortune and the most        successful return from Brazil Venezuela or South Africa to build        sumptuous villas overlooking the Bay of Funchal        Madeira alas is no simple portrait of a Gauguinlike        tropical paradise With a history of emigration and return of        welcoming visiting merchants and seafarers and during a brief period        of occupation a garrison of British troops islanders are a        cosmopolitan mix The populace is an engaging stew of dark North        African complexions and blonde blueeyed northern Europeans        Funchal the islands capital major harbor and only city        of any note merely hints at Madeiras riches The capitals white        houses and tile roofs are clustered on picturesque hills sloping down        to a steep bay which makes for a pretty picture The city is        undeniably pleasant but its noise and traffic dont seem so far        removed from the more conveniently located places most people come here        to avoid Almost half of Madeiras  people live in Funchal        pronounced foonshawl and cruiseship passengers stride ashore        daily for a frenzied flurry of sightseeing and shopping Other visitors        kick back in luxury hotels crowding the citys western seafront In        recent years a gleaming new highrise zona turista has sprung up to        confront the oldworld hotels and distinguished quintas rural estates        of Madeiras more peaceful past        Funchal is less the sum of Madeira though than a gateway        to the rest of the island whose real charms begin in the hillsides        just a few minutes outside of town Spectacular gardens like the        Botanic Garden and Quinta do Palheiro are only a short bus or taxi        ride from the capital        Smallscale agriculture dominates the islands landscape        employing about a fifth of the people Depending on the altitude and        whether you happen to be on the warm south coast or the marginally        cooler north coast you will see terraces of bananas and vines that        produce the grapes for fortified Madeira wine There are windswept        mountain peaks craggy cliffs that plummet to the sea and emerald        valleys that could be standins for Ireland or Scotland From        strategically situated lookout points miradouros you can take in        these magical panoramas and look down upon villages carved out of the        mountains at least one so isolated it only began to receive TV signals        in the late s        Driving a car along the hairpin curves on mountain roads        and coastal lanes getting sprayed by waterfalls and constantly        rewarded with spectacular vistas can be an exhilarating experience but        Madeira is best viewed by getting out of the car or bus and exploring        on two feet The island is heaven for anyone who enjoys being outside        whether your taste runs to gentle walks or hardcore hiking Madeiras        system of irrigation channels known as levadas carries water down        from the mountains on gentle gradients and provides a readymade system        of trails The canalsmore than  miles of them crisscross the        islandhave level footpaths running along their entire length        Walkers of all ages and abilities need only find a levada to take in        some of the finest countryside anywhere Several of these walks which        will be discussed in this book are among the highlights of        Madeira        With such rapturous scenery and a climate that is        consistently delightful perhaps it would be unfair to expect nature to        have bestowed the island with miles of perfect sands as well Madeira        has no beaches to speak ofthough the day when an enterprising hotel        builds its own manmade beach cant be too far off In the meantime if        a lounge chair by the pool just cant compare youll have to follow in        the wake of Columbus and dock on the neighboring island of Porto Santo        a popular day trip        The only other inhabited island in the archipelago Porto        Santo has a kmlong beach running the length of its south coast but        few other attractions While some surely would find the notion of an        island vacation with no beach time an unusual prospect indeed perhaps        it isnt at all a tragedy that Madeiras shoreline crashes so violently        into the ocean A Madeira with sandy beaches and direct flights from        Great Britain and other points in Europe and beginning in late         North America would surely not have been capable of staving off the        masstourist market as it has thus far Lack of sand has kept Madeira        from modeling itself after Mallorca        For decades Madeira has instead attracted a genteel even        anachronistic form of island tourism Afternoon tea and blacktie        dinners are still served at the most elegant hotels The typical        visitor is still older and wealthier than in most holiday destinations        but times are beginning to changeas they are across Portugal no        longer the forgotten backwater of Europe Funchals new tourist zone        testifies to local travel industry ambitions Today Madeira is being        discovered by younger travelers who might also indulge in the spas and        dining that worldclass hotels offer but are just as likely to seek        out the modest inns up in the mountains and strap on their boots for        serious hiking        Madeirans like most Portuguese are a generally quiet and        reserved people Add to this geographical isolation and the        difficulties for most of a harsh agricultural existence where few have        the machinery to help in the tiny terraced fields and you might        forgive the islanders if they seemed less than welcoming        Instead you will find friendly people who in spite of a        month season that for decades has deposited tourists from wealthier        nations on their shores are refreshingly hospitable They are proud of        the scenic beauty delectable wines and exquisite hand embroidery that        their tiny island has become rightly famous for        The tourism ante is being upped by hoteliers        entrepreneurs and government officials eager to broaden Madeiras        offerings and appeal But the allure of Madeira remains its absence of        manmade attractions and abundance of natural ones Some people still        suggest that Madeira is part of the lost continent of Atlantis and        though it has become easier and easier to get there the island still        seems otherworldly
