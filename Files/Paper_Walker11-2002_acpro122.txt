INTEGRITY Restoring Trust in American Business and theAccounting ProfessionThis document was written by David M Walker CPA ComptrollerGeneral of the United States based on a speech he gave to theAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants leadershipconference in November November  Our profession the performance and accountability professioncurrently faces a crisis of confidence that must be addressed notonly for the good of our profession but also for the good of ourcountry and the nations capital markets We are not however theonly ones who are under the microscope as recent events in theprivate sector have made clear Restoring public trust andconfidence in a manner that can be sustained over the longtermwill require concerted actions by a various parties in order toaddress some very real systemic weaknesses plaguing our currentcorporate governance accountability and related systemsRECENT ACCOUNTABILITY BREAKDOWNSRecent accountability breakdowns in the private sector have comein a variety of forms and bear many names including EnronWorldCom Qwest Tyco Adelphia Global Crossing Waste ManagementMicro Strategy Superior Federal Savings Bank and Xerox just toname a few A recent US General Accounting Office GAO reporthighlighted the increasing frequency and changing nature ofcorporate earnings restatements Furthermore the rapid decline andfall of Arthur Andersen LLP has served as a dramatic lesson thatwill no doubt be the subject of many books and business school casestudiesClearly some of these breakdowns are more complex and harder tounderstand than others The WorldCom failure appears to be a simplematter of not following basic accounting principles in connectionwith capitalizing versus expensing certain items Although all thefacts are not known it is perplexing how such a basic errorinvolving billions of dollars could go undetected by the auditorsOn the other hand the Enron situation involved complextransactions with a number of parties and a now apparent weaknessin current generally accepted accounting principles Othersinvolved simple matters of greed by corporate executives andinadequate oversight and accountability actions by boards ofdirectorsARTHUR ANDERSEN LLPAlthough there are many dimensions to the current challengelets start with one of our own Arthur Andersen LLP AndersenAndersen may have been the auditor for more than its fair share ofthe entities associated with the most recent accountabilityfailures but it was not the auditor for all of them In fact USSecurities and Exchange Commission SEC data disclosed that until Andersen generally had a lower rate of earnings restatementsfor its public company audit clients than did other majoraccounting firms In addition while Andersen had certain unusualaudit related policies and practices that were not widely known byits partners and may not be shared by many other firms it washardly a rogue firm in the profession and any assertions to thecontrary are not only inaccurate but also inappropriate Suchassertions serve to disparage the reputations of the thousands ofAndersen professionals who did their job right every day and to thevery end Such assertions also serve as an attempt to discount theneed for meaningful reform to help prevent future accountabilityfailuresThe Andersen story illustrates how a few people can do the wrongthing with catastrophic consequences for many innocent parties Itwas not long ago that Arthur Andersen was viewed by many as thepremier professional services firm in the world For yearsAndersen had the reputation of thinking straight and talkingstraight and doing what it felt was right in connection withchallenging accounting and reporting issues  even if the clientdidnt like the answer From global gold standard to GONE in lessthan two years What happenedAs a former Andersen partner who severed all ties with the firmin  I believe that Andersen got caught up with a neverendingquest to grow the top line grow the bottom line and grow theincome of it partners Stated differently it was primarily focusedon maximizing earnings and not enough on managing risk includingrisk relating to its hardearned and priceless reputation Iobserved some of these tendencies during the later stages of myalmost year tenure with the firm These tendencies had not yetreached a critical level and the firm had not experienced a majorpublic accountability failure when I left to return to publicservice as Comptroller General of the United States in Evidently these trends became much more pronounced after I left thefirmDuring the later part of my tenure with Andersen I expressed myconcerns publicly in several partner meetings and privately tovarious internal players however as someone who had not grownup with the firm I found that my actions to speak up  especially when my views were not consistent with Arthur Andersenbusiness unit leaderships preferences   were somewhatcountercultural This was most apparent when I expressed mysupport for George Shaheen the exManaging Partner of the AndersenConsulting business unit now known as Accenture to succeed LarryWeinbach as the Managing Partner of Andersen Worldwide rather thanArthur Andersen managements choice of Jim Wadia Managing Partnerof the Arthur Andersen business unit in the United KingdomIronically it was George Shaheen rather than Jim Wadia whopublicly stated his support for modernizing the attest andassurance model for the st century This along with hisleadership skills had a lot to do with my support for hiscandidacyAndersen is not the only organization to be captured by thesirens song calling for more money more money and more moneyDuring the past few years certain partners strayed from the corevalues of leadership integrity service and stewardship that madeArthur Andersen great and caused me to join the firm in  Theresult was that a few partners actions served to bet the ranch inconnection with the firms reputation and they lost the betAlthough some of Andersens partners and employees may haveviolated the law and should be held accountable the JusticeDepartments indictment of the firm resulted in the Big Fiveaccounting and consulting firms becoming the Big Four Thisserved to further reduce competition in a profession of criticalimportance to the public that had already consolidated from eightto five major global firms It was more than a little ironic thatthe Justice Department that opposed the consolidation of the BigSix into the Big Five caused the further consolidation in theprofession Regardless of the methods and motivations of thevarious parties the deed is done and Arthur Andersen isessentially deadI am proud to have been a partner with Arthur Andersen in itsglory days but Im shocked and saddened by what happened to thefirm during the past few years Clearly one of the big lessonsfrom Andersens fall is that it may take years to create areputation of quality and integrity but that hardearned reputationcan be lost very quickly if there is a real or perceived breach oftrust In Andersens case it took decades for Andersen to climb tothe top and less than two years for it to decline into extinctionHopefully people will take that lesson to heartAMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTSAICPAAndersens fall along with the recent business accountabilitybreakdowns and other integrity failures has served to adverselyimpact the publics trust and confidence not just in CPAs but alsoin other performance and accountability professionals corporateofficials and a variety of other parties They have also served toadversely affect public confidence in our nations capital marketsMany CPAs have also shown increasing concern with recent actionsand inactions of our own professional association the AmericanInstitute of Certified Public Accountants AICPAWhat are these concerns First the AICPAs actions inconnection with the recent accounting reform legislation andcertain other reform related administrative actions have damagedits reputation in government and elsewhere Some of its externalactions may have been designed to serve the economic interests ofsome of its members but they were not necessarily consistent withthe broader public interest especially in connection with auditsinvolving public companies and public funds Furthermore some ofthe AICPAs recent internal actions have been questioned by its ownmembership For example the membership soundly rejected theInstitutes efforts to further stretch the CPA brand name and allowothers to benefit from our professions hardearned reputationthrough the socalled XYZ initiative Other AICPA actionsdesigned to enhance the value of CPAs to their clients have metwith mixed results In addition some of these have not been amodel of transparency or integrity given delayed disclosures andpotential conflicts of interestOne would expect the AICPA to lead by example in connection withtransparency and conflict issues given the role and nature of theprofession that it represents In my view the AICPA and itsleadership must set the standard for professional conduct and bebeyond reproach because they represent all of us and as a resulttheir actions reflect on all of usClearly the AICPAs valueenhancement and tradeorientedefforts have dominated its agenda in recent years Althoughvalueenhancement to the membership is clearly a legitimate rolefor the AICPA as a professional association it also has aresponsibility to aggressively address a range of professional riskmanagement issues In my view not enough has been done to managethe current and emerging risks associated with our professionespecially in connection with modernizing the attest and assurancemodel and related auditing standards including the independencestandard for the st century Yes some steps have been taken butnot nearly enough or as quickly as is called for given recentevents and the vital role that CPAs play in our overallaccountability systemAs a result some are questioning the future role of the AICPAand whether they should continue to renew their membership I forone have renewed my membership Why Because I believe that it isbetter to be an active member who tries to make needed andconstructive changes from the inside rather than voting with myfeet and simply walking away I hope that most of my fellow memberswill agree with me However I believe that additional actions bythe board and AICPA management will be needed to restore trust andconfidence in the Institute over the longertermCORPORATE GOVERNANCEOutside auditors bear varying degrees of responsibility forthese recent failures but they dont bear all the responsibilityWhere were the boards of directors boards and what was the roleof top corporate management in connection with these businessbreakdowns What involvement did other key players have inconnection with these accountability failures These and otherquestions are worth exploring to determine what changes are neededon a goingforward basis to minimize the possibility that thesetypes of events will occur in the futureIn my view the most critical element that needs to be addressedto help ensure that these failures do not proliferate in the futureis the overall governance model for public companies in the UnitedStates Many believe and I am one of them that the currentUS corporate governance model for public companies is notadequate to protect the interests of shareholders and other keystakeholders Specifically although most public companies arerequired to have a board that is comprised of a majority ofindependent directors and certain key committees are required tobe comprised solely of outside directors a closer look revealsthat the independence of many boards may be more a matter of formthan substanceThe issues of concern start at the top of the corporategovernance pyramid The CEO of many major public companies alsoserves as chairman of the board of directors As chairman and CEOthis one individual has a huge impact on the direction of thecompany the role of the board and the composition of the boardAll too frequently such individuals will have significantinfluence over who is asked to join the board and who is asked toleave it Boards are often comprised primarily of internalmanagement officials highlevel executives from other companiesand major service providers to and customers of the companyInterlocking boards are also fairly common Under sucharrangements executives from different companies who know eachother will sit on each others boards Although all theseindividuals have valuable experience and perspective to bring tothe table they are not well positioned to address all of the keyroles and responsibilities of an independent boardWhat should public company boards be doing Under moderngovernance theory the board works for the shareholders and the CEOworks for the board But how can this be if the CEO also serves aschairman of the board Boards have at least three roles that theyneed to play First they should provide strategic advice tomanagement in order to help maximize shareholder value Most boardshave historically spent most of their time on this role Secondthey need to help manage risk including risk related to attemptsto maximize current value at the expense of mortgaging the futureRisk management must also consider the interests of key stakeholdergroups such as employees customers and the communities in whichthe company operates Finally boards have a clear responsibilityto hold management accountable for results This later element is amajor reason why having a board that is both qualified andindependent is so important Board member qualifications are morethan a matter of education and experience they are also a matterof personal attributes of which integrity is number one Boardindependence does not require the elimination of all insidedirectors but it would seem to call for ensuring that asupermajority of board members are truly independent both in factand appearanceHaving a qualified and independent board is important but notenough Boards need to have adequate resources including havingaccess to their own independent attorneys and advisors when theybelieve it is appropriate Board members also must have the timeneeded to address their various roles and responsibilities From apractical standpoint this means that active executives shouldlimit the number of boards they sit on and all board members needto be comfortable that they can dedicate the time needed toproperly discharge their fiduciary responsibilitiesYes board members have a fiduciary responsibility to theshareholders that they represent They must do their best to do theright thing and not breach their fiduciary duties through eithercomission or omission After all its not just what you do thatcounts its also what you fail to do when circumstances dictatethat you should actEXECUTIVE COMPENSATIONHaving the right governance structure is of critical importanceIts also important to consider the nature and reasonableness ofthe incentives provided to top management and board members Muchhas been written regarding the meteoric rise of executivecompensation in the United States Various studies have shown howthe ratio of executive compensation to average employeecompensation has risen to levels of irrationality and levels thatfar exceed those of other major industrialized nationsHow much is a single executive worth After all unlikeinventors who should be rewarded for innovation resulting fromtheir personal efforts leadership of a major public company is ateam effort Despite the assertions of some CEOs while one keyplayer can make a difference it requires a team of talentedexecutives to add shareholder value and manage shareholder riskover time In some cases one wonders what some highly compensatedtop executives were doing to earn their pay given their publicstatements and testimonies subsequent to the decline of theircompanies Certain former Enron and WorldCom executives come tomind in this regardIts not just the total amount of compensation but the form andstructure of executive compensation arrangements that is importantas well It is well known that the behavior of individuals isaffected by the nature of their compensation arrangements topexecutives are no exception For example some executives may betempted to accelerate income or expense recognition in ways thatwill serve to help them maximize their bonus compensation in thecurrent or following year respectively Boards and auditors needto be vigilant to ensure that any inappropriate actions areavoidedRecently a significant amount of attention has been focused onthe structure of stock options and the related accountingtreatment Clearly some amount of stock compensation makes sensein order to tie the interests of the shareholders with theinterests of top executives however the amount and structure areboth important to ensure equity and avoid perverse incentives tomaximize value in the shortterm at the expense of thelongertermThere is little question that some abuse of stock compensationhas occurred In a large number of cases key executives have beengranted additional stock options or their existing options havebeen repriced ie lower strike price because of a decline inthe market value of their companys stock Part of the decline mayhave been due to general market conditions but its doubtful thatall of it was In fact some or most of the decline could have beendue to the failure of management to deliver on their promises Theresult is that these executives can make huge sums if the stockprice reboundsAlthough some have argued that stock option reloads andrepricing were necessary to keep their executives I wonder howmany of these executives wanted to give up options or raise thestrike price of their options when general market conditions werecausing all boats to rise I dont know of any but maybe you doWe should not have a headsIwin and tailsyoulose compensationstructure This situation could be mitigated if companies hadqualified independent and adequately resourced boards howeveras I noted previously this is all too often not the caseBoards have a responsibility to ensure the reasonableness ofoverall executive compensation Its clear that a number of themare not doing an adequate job in his regard At the same time thefederal government bears some responsibility for the movement tostockbased compensation due to tax changes that limited thedeductibility of certain types and amounts of executivecompensation These provisions may have to be reexamined aswellFrom a more strategic perspective there is both a need and anopportunity to forge a realignment of interests between the boardof directors and auditors in ways that can help to enhance valueand manage risk for shareholders and other key stakeholders Intheory auditors work directly for the board of directors andindirectly for shareholders Yes audit committees of the boardinteract with and recommend which audit firm to retain for approvalby the shareholders In the real world however top management hasmuch more influence on and interaction with the outside auditorsThis must change and under the recent SarbanesOxley accountingreform legislation some related changes will be requiredImportantly once additional needed corporate governance reformsare made to enhance the independence and capacity of the board theopportunity to implement the needed realignment will be greatlyenhancedACCOUNTING AND REPORTING MODELWhat about the current accounting and reporting model We haverecently seen how current accounting and reporting requirements areinadequate For example the collapse of Enron showed howaccounting and reporting for socalled special purpose entitiesSPEs is hard to understand much less defend Does it make sensefor companies to be able to keep significant financial transactionsoff their books when unrelated parties provide only  percent ofthe related capital at risk I think not Although Enron may haveviolated this  percent requirement the percent level would seemto be way too low in a environment in which we should be focusingon economic substance versus legal form in accounting and reportingas well as attest and assurance mattersThere has also been a considerable amount of discussion anddebate regarding the appropriate accounting and reporting treatmentfor stock options Strong views are held on both sides of thisgreat debate From a practical perspective if stock options arentcompensation what are they In my view its not on the issue ofwhether they should be recorded as compensation expense its morea matter of how it should be doneFrom a broader perspective I believe that the currentaccounting and reporting model is not well suited for our stcentury knowledgebased economy Unlike the industrial age in whichtangible assets were of great value and importance in todaysknowledgebased economy its intellectual capital that is drivingthe market value of many enterprises Intellectual capital iscreated by the efforts of people As a result people represent themost valuable asset in the knowledge age People are the source ofall process improvement technological innovation andenvironmental enhancements If people are our most valuable assetthen why are people treated primarily as a cost and a liabilityunder our current accounting and reporting modelWhat about historical cost Although its nice to know whatsomething costs its arguably more important to know what it isworth Furthermore the days when historical financial statementswere viewed as being of critical importance are gone Its not thatthey arent important its that they arent as important as theyused to be Today its important to have access to timely andreliable financial and nonfinancial performance information Inaddition its important to not just know what has happened butwhat is likely to happen based on key performance indicatorsprojection information and sensitivity analysesWe live in an increasingly interdependent world Our marketsare global in nature and no nation including the United Statescan go it alone And yet we still lack a set of global accountingand reporting standards that reflects the globalization ofeconomies enterprises and markets We need a set of globalstandards and various interested parties need to work together tohelp make this become a reality sooner rather than laterThese new accounting and reporting standards should not just beglobal in nature they should be principlebased rather thanrulebased Current US accounting and reporting standards havebecome much too complex Too many players are looking for specialtreatment and loopholes and are focusing on legal form rather thaneconomic substance Furthermore too many professionals are busychecking boxes rather than turning on their brains and using theirprofessional judgment to get to the right answer We must rememberthat as CPAs we get paid for our judgment so lets exerciseitNew principlebased accounting and reporting standards should befocused on value and risk Related disclosures should focus more onkey performance indicators along with selected projectioninformation and sensitivity analyses In addition all disclosuresneed to be stated as clearly and concisely as possible Too manypublic companies disclosures are written in legal language and areway too long They seem to be designed more to confuse rather thaninform the readerSome have recently advocated a threepronged approach to futurefinancial and performance reporting The first prong wouldrepresent basic reporting applicable to all public companies Thesecond prong would include key benchmark information based on thecompanys industry The third prong would include supplementalinformation on key value and risk elements affecting the company Ibelieve that such an approach has conceptual merit and should beexplored along with the other key concepts outlined aboveATTEST AND ASSURANCE STANDARDSAlthough the accounting and reporting model needs to be updatedin my view the current attest and assurance model is also out ofdate The current model relies heavily on an auditors expressionof an opinion on historical costbased financial statements afteryearend For public companies audited financial statementsgenerally are required to be filed with the SEC within three monthsof the companys fiscal yearend This report has some value but itis not as valuable as it once wasMore needs to done to enhance the scope and improve thetimeliness of various attest and assurance services and relatedreporting More also needs to be done to address the continuingexpectations gap regarding what auditors are doing in connectionwith the detection of fraud and internal controls and to auditthrough electronic information systems rather than around them Inthis regard Texas AM University has recently formed a newCenter for Continuous Auditing involving a consortium of over leading universities and others to help address these issuesCurrently outside auditor reports are not required to provideany level of assurance with regard to key internal controls Suchcontrols are critical to determining the reliability of interimreporting and various ongoing assertions by the company throughoutthe year Importantly opinion level of reporting on internalcontrols over financial reporting will be required by theSarbanesOxley accounting reform legislation that was passed inJuly  It is designed among other things to enhance oversightof public company auditors in light of recent accountabilityfailuresHowever the current auditreporting model does not provide anylevel of assurance regarding key risk and valuebased performanceand projection information that are important to a wide range ofstakeholders We also need to take steps to do so in conjunctionwith the needed enhancements to the current accounting andreporting modelIts important to enhance the scope and timing of any relatedaudit reports but its also important to ensure that firms areboth qualified and independent to perform such audits Contrary toassertions by some independence is more than a state of mindAuditors must be independent both in fact and appearance in orderto be credible In my view current AICPA independence standards donot adequately ensure the independence of auditors who providecertain nonaudit or consulting services to their audit clients Asa result the GAO issued new independence standards applicable toaudits of federal departments and agencies and entities thatreceive federal funds and the SarbanesOxley legislation limitedthe ability of auditors of public companies to perform certainnonaudit services for their audit clientsThe SarbanesOxley provisions were based in large part on GAOsnew independence standards Importantly GAO saw the need for achange in his area and we began the process to make related changeslong before Enron and other recent business failures came to lightAlthough GAO took a lot of heat in being out front on thiscontroversial issue in part due to recent events were getting alot of accolades nowDuring the past decade the AICPA and many accounting firms puttoo much emphasis on how they could grow their top line bottomline and earnings through pushing nonauditconsulting servicesand not enough time modernizing attest and assurance services thatrepresent the franchise for CPAs on which the public relies Thismust change and recent events are likely to force both theaccounting profession and the firms to place much more emphasis ontheir core services At the same time many major accounting firmsare spinning off the portions of their consulting practices thatpose the greatest potential independence problemsIn my view auditors should able to provide some consultingservices to their audit clients but there are certain servicesthat would clearly be inappropriate for them to provideSpecifically under the GAOs new independence standards auditorsmust not violate two basic principles First auditors should notperform management functions or make management decisions Secondauditors should not audit their own work when the work involved ismaterial to the subject matter of the audit These principles aresimple straightforward and timeless in nature We also need totake this type of approach in connection with keyaccountingreporting and audit issuesAs I noted earlier the board and the auditors should have astrategic alignment of interests Furthermore for any system tofunction effectively there must be incentives for parties to dothe right thing adequate transparency to provide reasonableassurance that people will do the right thing and appropriateaccountability when people do not do the right thing Thisstrategic realignment and convergence of interests between theboard and the outside auditors would help to achieve theseobjectivesLEGAL FINANCIAL AND OTHER ADVISORSA variety of outside players other than auditors have beeninvolved in and bear differing degrees of responsibility for someof the recent business failures Attorneys investment bankersconsultants and other advisors have played major roles instructuring or engineering business transactions in order toachieve not just a desired business result but also a desiredaccounting and reporting result In some cases this has resultedin changing the form of certain arrangements in order to meet theminimum technical requirements of any related accounting andreporting requirements while coming close to the line of what islegal Some might call this aiding and abettingMany advisors try to help their clients meet a shorttermvalueoriented objective However in doing so they must rememberthat shortterm gain can come at a huge longterm cost if thetransaction unravels or otherwise comes under close regulatoryreview or public scrutiny Such was clearly the case in connectionwith certain recent business failuresSeveral companies have used such aggressive approaches to dealwith a variety of tax issues and other matters For example anumber of major multinational companies based in the United Statesare trying to have their legal headquarters located in anothercountry for tax reasons Typically companies and their advisorstry to minimize the visibility of such techniques in order to avoidpublic criticism Sometimes they succeed and sometimes theydontIn my view too many people today are trying to structuretransactions and other business dealings so they are technicallyacceptable rather than doing what is right It is time for peopleto realize that things like the law and accounting and reportingstandards represent the floor of acceptable behavior and not theceiling Values like integrity morality compassion andstewardship represent higher callings that more people shouldstrive to achieve In the end we all need to be more responsiblefor our actions and inactions The simple rule is if in doubtabout what to do then check it out both from a technical and valueoriented perspective If still in doubt dont do it Its notworth betting your reputation or the reputation of yourorganization Just ask the former partners and employees of ArthurAndersenWall Street firms are subject to these same tendencies Theyalso have certain conflicts in connection with their investmentbanking and brokerage operations that need to be addressed just asindependent auditors do in connection with their consultingservices The independence and objectivity of stock analystsreporting is also a matter of concern The SEC and several statesare looking into these issues Hopefully Wall Street will takevoluntary steps to address these issues before it is forced toactIn the final analysis attorneys and other advisors need to keepin mind that their actions can have an adverse affect on theirreputations as well as the public Given the lessons from ArthurAndersens fall they need to keep this in the forefront ratherthan the back of their mindsFEDERAL REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENTThe primary federal regulator in connection with financialaccounting and reporting for public companies is the Securities andExchange Commission SEC The SEC promulgates and enforces theregistration requirements dealing with public companies The SEChas vast responsibilities and finite resources As a result theyneed to constantly look for process improvements and technologicalenhancements to leverage their finite resources to maximize theireffectiveness In light of recent events a consensus has emergedthat the SEC needs significant additional resources to help ensurethat it can do its job properlyAlthough the SEC has the authority to issue certainaccountingreporting and auditing standards for public companiesit has historically relied to a great extent on certainselfregulatory bodies to help maintain trust and confidence in ournations capital markets For example it has historically reliedon the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB to set generallyaccepted accounting principles and the AICPAs Auditing StandardsBoard ASB to set generally accepted auditing standards Inaddition other parties such as the major stock exchanges play arole by imposing various requirements for companies to attain andmaintain their listingsWhile selfregulatory approaches can and have worked in varioussituations there are certain instances in which it is unrealisticfor them to work as effectively as needed in order to adequatelyprotect the public interest One example of this is in connectionwith what type of nonaudit or consulting services that outsideaudit firms can provide to their audit clients and still maintaintheir independence History has shown that the presentselfregulatory structure has not been adequate in this regardThere is too much of a tendency for selfregulatory structures torationalize how the provision of a broad range of services can addvalue to the client and does not present an independence problemThis has clearly been the case in connection with the AICPAscurrent independence standardsAnother area where the current selfregulatory structure hasproved to be inadequate is in connection with the AICPAsselfdisciplinary function The process usually takes too long andin the final analysis the most severe sanction the AICPA canimpose is expulsion from the Institute Since CPAs are not requiredto belong to the AICPA in order to conduct public company auditsthe most severe sanction would only serve to save the CPA some dueswithout any other practical effect This is clearlyineffectiveWhile the state boards of accountancy have the ability to imposemuch stiffer sanctions including revoking a CPAs license topractice in a state these boards have not exercised this sanctionvery frequentlyWhile I believe that it is not always desirable to have thegovernment intervene at times it is necessary in order to protectthe public interest especially when others who could act fail todo so Recent examples include actions taken by the Congress theSEC and the GAO to address areas of concern that each feltwarranted government action Hopefully government intervention canbe minimized in the future but for that to occur others must takesteps to address serious public interest issues before they reachcrisis proportions If they fail to do so I have little doubt thatgovernment will eventually actFrom an enforcement perspective the SEC has certain civilenforcement powers that it can use to address violations of thenations securities laws In some cases its sanctions are adequatebut not always Most corporate officials board members andprofessionals are people of ability and integrity who try to do theright thing At the same time every country and sector has badactors that take short cuts and push the envelope to achieve adesired result Many of these players tend to be arrogant andbelieve that the end justifies the means In addition as we haveseen in the case of various derivatives transactions involvingEnron Qwest and Global Crossing sometimes bad actors join forcesto help achieve their goals To effectively deal with these typesof individuals civil sanctions must be strong enough and targetedenough to discourage potential bad actors from doing things thatharm others Too many existing civil sanctions are imposed directlyor indirectly through company paid premiums on officers anddirectors insurance on the company and ultimately theshareholders In this case shareholders can pay twice for the sinsof othersWhile more meaningful and targeted civil penalties can help todiscourage many bad actors in my view civil sanctions arentenough in some cases You need to be able to issue a few socalledwidestriped suits to players who violate criminal statutesNothing will focus someones mind like looking at the world fromthe inside of a prison cell In addition we need to be sure thatwhite collar criminals are not merely detained in socalledcountry club federal prison facilities for relatively shortprison terms The price for criminal behavior must be high forthese individuals as wellPENSION AND SAVINGS PLANSThe recent business failures have also served to harm a numberof innocent parties including pension and savings planparticipants A number of defined benefit pension plans lostsignificant sums as a result of the decline in the value of theirholdings in Enron WorldCom etc When defined benefit pensionplans lose money the plan sponsor typically the employer willultimately bear the cost of the loss However when definedcontribution plans like k plans incur such losses theindividual plan participants are directly affected and bear thelosses themselvesParticipants in k plans can be particularly harmed insituations where their accounts are heavily invested in employerstock either because their employer matches their employeecontributions in the form of such stock or because they themselvesmake significant investments in their employers stock using theirown voluntary contributions In these cases participants risklosing not only their jobs but also a significant portion of theirretirement savings if their company files for bankruptcy This wasthe case in connection with Enron and certain other businessfailures In addition in the Enron case plan participants werenot allowed to sell company stock in their k account when thestock price was declining rapidly due to a pending change in planadministrators At the same time top Enron executives were free toexercise their stock options and some did This inappropriate andunlevel playing field was addressed in part of the SarbanesOxleylegislation Some suits are likely in order to attempt to rightalleged fiduciary breaches Additional legislation has also beenproposed that would among other things give employees the abilityto diversify their employer matching contributions out of companystock more rapidly than they can under current lawPAST AND FUTURE ACTIONSA variety of parties have already taken some steps in light ofthese recent business accountability failures The New York StockExchange is moving to adopt certain changes in its listingrequirements relating to governance matters boards and auditcommittees are taking their related responsibilities much moreseriously the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB isexploring a principlesbased approach to accounting standards andis reconsidering the current accounting and reporting treatment forSPEs and stock options the AICPA has issued a new fraud detectionaudit standard and is beginning to assess the need for otherenhanced attest and assurance standards but it clearly needs topick up the pace the US Congress has passed the SarbanesOxleylegislation which included establishment of the Public CompanyAccounting Oversight Board PCAOB tougher independence standardsfor auditors of public companies and independent funding sourcesfor the PCAOB and the FASB the SEC has taken a number ofregulatory and enforcement actions and made initial appointments tothe PCAOB various US Attorneys have filed charges againstseveral key players associated with some of the recent integrityand accountability failures the New York State Attorney Generaland the SEC are taking steps to address certain conflicts withinthe investment banking community and the GAO has taken a number ofsteps as discussed belowThese actions are clearly steps in the right direction Howeveras noted above additional actions are necessary in order toaddress several remaining systemic issues Hopefully theappropriate parties will take steps to address these issues Ifthey dont the government may chose to act again in order to fillany related voidsGAOS ROLEThe GAO is a professional services organization within thelegislative branch of the federal government Our job is to helpthe Congress discharge its constitutional responsibilities andimprove the performance and assure the accountability of thefederal government for the benefit of the American people To doso we perform a variety of oversight insight foresight andadjudicatory functions spanning everything the federal governmentdoes or is thinking about doing anywhere in the world Simplystated at GAO we speak truth to power Power comes in many formsincluding the US Congress various government officials thepress and ultimately the greatest source of power in our democracy the American people Today Im speaking what I believe to be thetruth about how to restore confidence in American business and ourprofession to each of you I will continue to speak out on theseissues in the coming monthsAmong other things GAO serves as the independent auditor of thelargest most diverse and most important entity on the face of theearth  the US Government We conduct financial statementperformance and compliance audits of federal entities andpromulgate generally accepted auditing standards for audits offederal entities and entities that receive federal funds We alsohelp to promulgate generally accepted accounting principles forfederal government entitiesAs the leading performance and accountability organization inthe United States and arguably the world we believe that we havean obligation to lead by example and practice what we preach Wetake these obligations very seriously with all of ourresponsibilities including those relating to the Congressconcerns regarding the recent accountability failures in theprivate sector We held a Corporate Governance and AccountabilityForum in February  involving prominent leaders from the publicprivate and notforprofit sectors to discuss the recentaccountability failures in the private sector and what actions maybe necessary to help prevent such failures in the future Thisforum served to help inform the GAOs work and other efforts tosupport the Congress including our efforts that helped lead to theeventual passage of the SarbanesOxley legislation We are holdinga followup forum on December   to discuss what actions havebeen taken by a variety of parties and those that remain in orderto help restore public trust and confidenceIn addition to these actions GAO has voluntarily decided toexpress an opinion on internal controls and key compliance issuesin connection with our audit of the consolidated financialstatements of the US Government and various other federalentities We are also advocating enhanced reporting in connectionwith key federal performance and projection information Aspreviously noted we published new independence standards dealingwith nonauditconsulting services when the AICPA failed to act Weare working with others within the federal government includingthe Secretary of the Treasury and the Director of the Office ofManagement and Budget to modernize federal financial managementand promote expanded performance and accountability reportingFurthermore at GAO we are using the bully pulpit and speakingout to encourage others to do their part to help restore publictrust and confidence and we will continue to do soCLOSINGIn the final analysis for any system to work you need to assurethat the key people have integrity that the information providedto key stakeholders is timely and reliable and that the persons orentities that are providing assurance as to the reliability of anyfinancial and nonfinancial information are qualified andindependent both in fact and appearance The importance ofintegrity can not be overstated if the key players dont haveintegrity not much else matters In addition systems shouldincorporate incentives for people to do the right thing adequatetransparency mechanisms to provide reasonable assurance that peoplewill do the right thing and appropriate accountability mechanismsif people dont do the right thing These basic principles aretimeless and can be applied to a broad range of professionalbusiness government and personal issues including how to restoretrust and confidence not only in the performance and accountabilityprofession but also in the broader business community and ournations capital marketsI hope that all key parties will take the necessary steps toaddress any real and perceived problems that serve to undercutpublic trust and confidence As recent events illustrate trusttakes years to gain but can be lost in an instant The performanceand accountability profession and in my opinion our corporategovernance system are at a critical crossroads As CPAs we mustchose the right path If we do we will not only regain any lostpublic trust and confidence in our profession but we can positionourselves to help add value and manage risk in a whole new range ofareas that are both needed and which we are well positioned toaddress a whole new range of performance projection and complianceissuesDuring these challenging times CPAs must look to what we sharein common and how we can help to create the future of ourprofession I would suggest that all CPAs regardless of whatposition they hold or what sector they work in share certain rolesresponsibilities and values With regard to roles all CPAs are inthe business of maximizing the performance and assuring theaccountability of their enterprises and areas of responsibilityWith regard to responsibility all CPAs should be mindful of thebroader public interest in connection with all their activitiesWith regard to values all CPAs share certain basic values such asintegrity objectivity competence and professionalismIn my view we all need to return to a set of core values andtimeless principles that can help us to do the right thing at theright time all the time These core values serve as both beliefsand boundaries beliefs in the form of positive concepts one can becommitted to and boundaries in the form of limits that should notbe violated At GAO our core values are accountability integrityand reliability Accountability describes what we do integritydescribes how we do our work and reliability describes how we wantour work to be received Every worldclass organization should havea set of core values and so should our profession I touched onthese earlierIn addition to core values we all need to keep certain timelessprinciples in mind at al times First dont believe what GordonGecko said in the film Wall Street Greed is not good  greed isbad Second remember that the law and other standards set thefloor of acceptable behavior and not the ceiling Dont lie on thefloor  reach for the ceiling Dont just do what is acceptable dowhat you think is right Third CPAs and other professionals arepaid for their judgment Turn on your brain rather than checkingboxes in connection with key accounting reporting and auditingissues Fourth say what you mean mean what you say practice whatyou preach and lead by example in everything that you do Finallyremember that your reputation is priceless It takes many years tobuild a reputation which can be lost very quickly if you breach thetrust that others hold in you In addition if you act improperlyor fail to properly discharge your duties you can harm a number ofinnocent parties As a result if it doesnt seem right dont doitIn closing we all have a stake in the future of our professionand the reputation of CPAs I can assure you that GAO and I will doour part to practice what we preach and lead by example in ourroles responsibilities and values I hope that I can count on eachof you and others to do the same After all the time to act isnow Lets do it
