                              Gunning for the English Language            At the very end of the last century there was acrisis at the Barnum and Bailey Circus  Theman who was shot out of the cannon during each showwas asked by his wife to quit his highrisk job much tothe distress of the great PT Barnum  Barnum whosewit was equal to his showmanship summoned the fellowto him and said I beg you to reconsider  Men ofyour caliber are hard to find            Without fully realizing it all of us speak the languageof guns and cannons in our everyday conversationand many words and phrases we spark forth dateback to the era of black powder and muzzleloadingTake the words shot shoot  and shooting   Sure asshooting some hotshot big shot is bound to shoot thebreeze and shoot this big mouth off about taking acheap shot potshot at some troubleshooting competitorThen he shoots his bolt and wad by taking a longshot at some oneshot deal that will win him the wholeshooting match  It is not always easy to ascertainwhether the underlying metaphor in such expressionsis the bow and arrow or the gun and cannon see PeterA Douglass The Bows Stratagem VERBATIM VIbut we can be fairly certain that the wad in shootingones wad refers to the wad that held the powder andshot in position to be fired from early guns and thatthe pot in potshot signifies the dinner pot to be filledwith an animal that was shot close up without anyregard for rules            Or take two of the most popular verbs we use todescribe somebody who has been dismissed from thejob fired and discharged   Both are metaphors thatcompare the unfortunate victim to a projectile shot outof a gun or cannon  Hand guns of the fourteenth centurywere equipped with touchholes in order to dischargesuch a weapon it was necessary to touch it witha torch            I am feeling quick on the trigger quick on thedraw hot as a pistol and loaded for bear so I amgoing to get the drop on you and let you have it withboth barrels  Here is a small arsenal of words andexpressions that turn out to be figurative sparkoffsfrom the language of guns and cannons                           bite the bullet If you visit a RevolutionaryWar battle site like Fort Ticonderoga you may seesome gruesome artifacts in its museumbullets withteeth marks in them  Having no real anesthesia to easethe agony of amputation or surgery a surgeon of twocenturies ago offered wounded soldiers the only painreducer availablea bullet to bite on  The whole ideaof such a procedure is enough to make one sweat bulletsAfter anesthesia was introduced in the US in the phrase came flguratively to mean to dealwith a bad situation resolutely as in Rudyard Kiplingslines Bite the bullet old man And dont let themthink youre afraid                           flash in the pan This phrase sounds as if itderives from the way that prospectors pan rivers forgold  In truth though flash in the pan refers to theoccasional misfiring of the old flintlock muskets whenthe flash of the primer in the pan of the rifle failed toignite the explosion of the charge  The estimates ofmisfirings like this run as high as fifteen percent bythose who fire flintlocks these days when the expressionsignifies an intense but shortlived success or aperson who fails to live up to his or her early promise                           go off half cocked Muzzleloaders then asnow had a half cock or safety position for a gunshammer that partially backlocked the trigger mechanismso that the weapon could not be fired  Half cockdoes not give enough power to generate sparks and firethe pistol so it is a futile gesture  Thus in modernparlance when a person goes off half cocked or athalf cock  he or she is not in control of the situation                           skinflint In many parts of early America necessitiessuch as flint were scarce  When one side of aflint used in a flintlock weapon had worn away it lostproper contact with the frizzen and caused inadequatesparking to set off the powder charge  Faced with thisproblem some gun toters would skin or sharpen theflint with a knife creating a bevel in the flint whichcould then make full contact and generate an adequateshower of sparks  A fellow who skinned his flint waslooked upon as being a parsimonious pennypinchingstingy cheapskatea veritable skinflint                           ramrod A ramrod is a rod of wood or metalfor ramming the ball and patch down the barrel of amuzzleloading firearm and setting them against themain powder charge  Eventually ramrod became personifiedtaking on the added meaning of one markedby rigidity stiffness and severity even though theoriginal ramrods which were straight were ratherflexible                           pointblank In ballistics a weapon firedpointblank is one whose sights are aimed directly at atarget so that the projectile speeds to its destination ina flat trajectory  By extension a pointblank questionor accusation is one that is direct and straightforwardright to the mark  The opposite of pointblank ishanging fire  undecided up in the air  In munitionshanging fire describes the delay in the explosion orcharge in a firearm                           heavens to Betsy  Digging up the roots of thisexclamation has given many a scholar calluses and abent back  In his introduction to Heavens to Betsy andOther Curious Sayings Harper  Row  CharlesEarle Funk said that the very title of his book turnedout eventually to be completely unsolvable  Funk dismissesQueen Elizabeth I and Betsy Ross as possibleeponymous sources and concludes It is much morelikely to have been derived in some way from the frontiersmansrifle or gun which for some unknown reasonhe always fondly called Betsy  However despiteexhaustive research I am reluctantly forced to resortto the familiar lexical locution Source unknown Discussion with my gunloving friends supports Funkspenultimate etymology  The smoothbore muskets usedduring colonial revolutionary and frontier days wereknown as Brown Besses hence the nickname Betsy                            cold enough to freeze the balls off a brassmonkey Before you cancel your subscriptionplease read on  In nautical jargon the monkey was atraylike metal casting with round indentations arrangedin a square pattern  These monkeys heldpyramids of cannonballs for each gun in a muzzleloadingbattery on a battleship  Soon iron monkeys gaveway to more expensive but corrosionresistant brassmonkeys  But because the iron balls and the brassholders had markedly different coefficients of expansionthe pyramids of cannonballs had a tendency tocollapse during cold snapsweather that was coldenough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey            As further ammunition to support my bulletproofcontention that our language is loaded with gunsand cannons Ill conclude by gunning for items thathave the word gun in them                           go great guns The word great used to meanbig and great guns referred to cannons and otherlarge firearms as opposed to small guns or musketrifles  By the late nineteenth century these uses ofgreat and small became obsolete but to go great gunscontinued to allude to the loudness forcefulness andlarge size of longago cannons and still means to proceedwith considerable momentum to go full steamahead at full bore                           son of a gun This expression is frequently employedas a euphemism for another phrase that beginswith the same three words but the question remainswhy gun has been elected as the surrogate word  TheSailors Wordbook  published more than a hundredyears ago offers this explanation  Son of a gun is anepithet conveying contempt in a slight degree and wasoriginally applied to boys born afloat  One admiraldeclares that he was literally thus cradled under thebreast of a guncarriage  Taking this clue word detectivessuggest that son of a gun originated during theeighteenth century when nonmilitary women werepermitted to live aboard naval ships  When one ofthese women gave birth to a child without knowingwhich sailor had fathered it the paternity was loggedas gun perhaps alluding to the midship gun whichwas often located near the makeshift maternity room                           stick to ones guns When we stick to our gunswe hold adamantly to our position  To stand and continuefiring when under heavy attack on the battlefieldtook courage because artillerymen usually lacked infantryweapons  When an artilleryman broke and ranthe enemy could turn the guns to their own use  Thusmany a soldier was actually chained to his gun to ensurebravery                           spike ones guns If an army had to fall backand abandon its field artillery the simplest way torender its guns useless was to jam a spike into the fusehole  Gradually spike ones guns came to mean frustratethe enemy by blocking his intended plan ofaction                           give it the gun While giving their airplane enginesall the gas they could handle World War I combatpilots would open fire on the enemy with theirmachine guns  This led to the association of rapidacceleration with gunning and to give it

More            Besides going to Valencia for paella the compleattraveler in Spain should experience duende   Thisis not easy to arrange however for duende  unlikepaella cannot be made to order  All the ingredientsmay be presentthe music the singers the dancersthe setting and costumesbut alas duende itselffails to show up and the production fizzles            As the cognoscenti define it duende pronouncedDWEHNdeh is a magical quality of a peculiarly Spanishnature that raises a performance to peaks of enthrallmentThe occasions when duende grips a singerdancer or torero are punctuated with cries of Olfrom the audience  When a performer is inspired it issaid that he or she tiene duende has it            The Spanishness of duende is underlined by theabsence of a lookalike word in the sister Romancelanguages Italian and French  Like Italian Spanishhas estro  from the Latin oestrus gadfly English estrus to denote artistic inspiration and female sexualheat but duende goes further  It is something like thezone of current sports lingo in which a tennis playersay enters a trancelike state putting him on a rollwhere he cant miss a shot  But duende has deepervibrations evoking for its disciples the very ethos ofSpain  Soul  from the black culture is perhaps closestin English                           Duende meant hobgoblin sprite or ghost inSpanish for a long time but it is not known when itacquired its artistic coloration  It did not become abuzzword at any rate until fairly recently  In his IberiaRandom House  James A Michener saidduende now dominates Spanish conversation andseems to have become the sine qua non of Spanishexistence whereas in previous visits to Spain he hadnot heard it at all  At the time he was writing Michenernoted that dictionaries had not caught up with thecurrent meaning  It does appear now however in dictionariesand the Englishlanguage media  A New YorkTimes story by Hubert Saal on flamenco March  speaks of the mysterious duende  as a kind ofgypsy soul which flies only on the wings of spontaneityand improvisation  I have seen a calendar WorkmanPublishing Co New York which defined it aspersonal magnetism and charm and said Giventodays extensive TV coverage political candidatesneed duende if they hope to be accepted by thepublic            Etymologists say it originally meant dueo de unacasa lord or master of a house and is a contraction ofduen de casa   Duen is the apocopated cutoff form ofdueo  which stems from the Latin dominus   As theSpanish word evolved the de was suffixed to the duen the casa was omitted altogether and el duende thusbecame the lord of the house  But its plural formduendes also signified household gods like the RomanLares and Penates and took on even broader pantheisticovertones in duendes de las montaas y de lascuevas spirits of the mountains and caves            The connotation of gifted artistic performancehowever might stem from the gypsy culture in Andalusiawhose dialect cal  has words like duquendepossibly from the Russian dook  meaning spirit orghost and duquendio  meaning maestro  Onescholar Allen Josephs of the University of West Floridasurmised that from duquendio or duquende toduende is a short step especially in Andalusia wheregypsy mastery would be precisely flamenco mastery            Whatever its derivation duende as artistic inspirationfound its apostle and guru in AndalusianbornFederico Garca Lorca lyric poet and dramatist whowas murdered in  at age  in the early days ofthe Spanish Civil War  His empathy with the gypsies ofhis native region is reflected in many of his poems  In Garca Lorca gave a lecture in Buenos Aires onthe Teora y Juego del Duende Theory and Play ofDuende  which has become the bible of the initiatesThe address Obras Completas Aguilar Madrid is a word virtuoso performance in whichhe describes duende variously as the spirit of theearth with Dionysian roots and as the mysteriousspirit of sorrowful Spain  He quotes an Andalusianartist Manuel Torres as having exclaimed of composerManuel de Fallas Nocturno del Generalife Todo lo que tiene sonidos negros tiene duende Allthat has black sounds has duende   Garca Lorca recallsa Spanish girl street singer and dancer transformingthe horrendous Italian song O Mar into an artisticgem by virtue of her rhythms silences andintention            But Garca Lorca also finds duende to be intimatelylinked with death and hence achieving its moststriking manifestation in the bullfight  At the momentof the kill he says the help of duende is needed tobring it off with artistic truth

Concise Oxford But in  it was moved into second place by thesecond edition of Collins Dictionary of the EnglishLanguage    Websters New World Dictionary of theAmerican Language seems about the same size as theOxford  the Gage Canadian Dictionary is slightlysmaller  The first edition of Chambers was issued in Bernard Shaw said of it my favorite of half adozen            The Scots who edit and publish Chambers do notaccept what most English and Americans and Canadiansdo when they say some Scottish words that havebecome standard English on both sides of the AtlanticFor instance it gives played as the proper pronunciationfor plaid although with delicate condescensionit parenthetically notes by the English also plad The Concise Oxford allows both pronunciations  It isshameful that the Gage Canadian allows only pladas does Websters New World   According to Chambers a plaid is a long piece of woollen cloth worn over theshoulderand it need not be of checked materialwhich is plad as we generally think of it  In Scotlandthe checked material of course is tartan             In June  I moved from Ottawa to Victoria onVancouver Island where I now enjoy genteel retirementNot long after

role in early Victoriaand there are many oatmeal accents to be heardhere these days  Collins allows the Scots pronunciationbut I am sorry to report favors the English  Chambersgave me warm feelings of

pronunciationissue was shown by Sir Ernest Gowers inhis  revision of HW Fowlers A Dictionary ofModern English Usage   He moved on from Fowlers followingof the big Oxford English Dictionary in allowingboth pronunciations but with preference for skoanGowers himself an Englishman said that in Scotlandits land of origin the pronunciation is skawn  and Englishpeople who know this so pronounce it            Dictionary buffs have long been attracted toChambers because its editors have not scrupled againsta little editorializing in some of the definitions theyoffer such as those already mentioned  The user isoffered a choice with maneater a cannibal a tigeror other animal that has acquired the habit of eatingmen a woman given to chasing catching and devouringmen  An eclair is a cake long in shape but shortin duration with cream filling and chocolate or othericing  A picturerestorer is one who cleans and restoresand sometimes ruins old pictures  That kind ofpawkiness is fitting in

little ahead of Chambers But I havent found it quite as much fun to browse in            Recently in Chambers I came across the adjectiveperjink  a Scots word given also in Collins  but not inany of the other desk dictionaries I use it meansprim finical  A more emphatic adjective isperjinkety  and it has the noun perjinkity  defined asa nicety  It also gives pernickety as another Scotsword with a similar meaning this is found in the otherdictionaries  I am inclined to prefer perjink and itsderivatives            Wordfanciers and not only those with some sortof Scottish bias might enjoy dipping into anotherChambers dictionary Chambers Scots Dictionary which was first issued in  and most recently reprintedin   It is specifically a dictionary of Scotsor Lallans which some scholars consider merely a dialectof English and others a distinct language rooted inOld English  A good book for browsing in givingmany Scots words which have come into use in otherparts of the Englishspeaking world

from his bivouac in Waukesha WisconsinMaledicta is not for everyones taste and somemay even go so far as to maintain that the subject of itsattention is not a valid one for investigation  There isno arguing with taste but even those who support thesecond tenet must admit that if researchers felt thatway about cancer syphilis and AIDS there would notbe much point to research at all  It is unlike Dr Amanto cloak his subjectdirty languageunder the euphemismverbal aggression he and most of the authorsof the articles appearing in Maledicta let it allhang out some however tuck it away neatly andwrite under a pseudonym  And everyone should nowtake a few minutes to ponder the meaning of it in thepreceding sentence            Not all of verbal aggression is concerned withfourletter words much of it and many of the fourletterwords involves insults racist and other prejudiciallanguage and other parts of the nether reaches oflanguage formerly represented largely by asterisks  Ihave often wondered why the publishers did not havethe nerve to call themselves Fk and Wagnalls  Toignore it is plainly wrong all the reasons that can beadduced for ignoring it are compelling testimony to itsimpact and anything with such impact cannotmustnotbe dismissed as unimportant  Contrary to popularbelief the point of studying verbal aggression is notto modify or ameliorate or eliminate itserious scholarsconsider it bad form to tamper with the evidencebutto describe and codify it much as investigatorshave tried to do with all other availablephenomena whether natural or artificial whether inpure or physical or social science  To quote in partfrom what may be termed its statement of purpose Maledicta specializes in uncensored studies and glossariesof offensive and negatively valued words andexpressions from all languages and cultures past andpresent            The present volume only one year in arrearsincludes an interview by Aman with Lillian MerminFeinsilver an authority on Yiddish and author of TheTaste of Yiddish   At the end of the interview is a goodbibliography of Feinsilvers work  It should be notedthat interviews are quite rare in such journals and it iscertainly unusual to find a linguist humanized by sucha device  Although the interview suffers from a numberof faultsfor instance it is not penetrating orthorough enough probably because Aman is a betterscholar writer and editor than interviewer and itcontains gratuitous information about the interviewerwho cannot resist blowing his own hornit is at leastan attempt at documenting that has not to my knowledgebeen done before in the field of linguistics  PerhapsAman will sharpen his perspective and techniquesand institute such interviews as a regularfeature of Maledicta             Mrs Feinsilver has an interesting article in thisvolume too Comment on Amans A Yiddish MinnieLegendand the Romanization of Yiddish  Other articlesinclude Is George Bush a Wimp   The MovingSpray Can on graffiti in England On the Pronunciationof Cunnilingus in Dictionaries and numerousothers on a wide variety of subjects these are interspersedwith short bits and pieces cartoons and asidesgenerally attributed to Folklore and presumablygathered by the editor  Although the subject mattermight be viewed as an area of legitimate investigationI am not sure I see the point in employing the subjectstyle of language in the descriptive text which wouldbe far more telling were it restricted to the language ofthe linguistic clinician  Aman evidently disagrees forhis writing is peppered salted with references likeevery asshole with access to a typewriter  It is manyyears since my contemporaries and I got a kick out ofseeing even the bowdlerized fk in print in PartridgesDictionary of Slang and Unconventional English  and fug in Mailers The Naked and theDead allowed prudery to mock itself  But the power ofwords is such that I contend their impact is totally lostif not treated clinically somehow there is a differencebetween Someone had written shit on the wall andSome asshole had written shit on the wall the writerof the former has more credibility the writer of thelatter was very likely the very asshole who had writtenshit on the wall            These are minor quibbles  Maledicta is instructivefunny gross informative vulgar impolite andsometimes well written  I am afraid that an adjectivelike penetrating is not only a bit strong but would belikely to be adopted as a slogan by the editor  I dothink that Aman contributes something important tothe linguistic literature and I think he ought to view abit more seriously and less rancorously the opportunitiesaccorded him by his experience with these powerfulprivate parts of the language to pursue a themeof analysis of its impact and why and how it carries somuch weight both denotatively and connotatively            Laurence Urdang                              Note Maledicta is available by annual subscriptionfrom

at work  They did not however conform to theletter of Galefs definitionconjunct words of contradictoryliteral meaning            Consider for instance the assertion by a womanbeing interviewed on the

expanded metaphor hadcanceled the sense of her loss a moroxish pun  Substantivelyif not literally she made a morox            Now consider the lament of an NBC Today guestthat an undertaking had been frustrated and nowwere back to ground zero  The inadvertent substitutionof ground zero for square one  while luminouslyludicrous is not selfcanceling and hence does not conveythe empty sense of morox            But what about a reference by MacNeils partnerJim Lehrer to some ten thousand black gold anddiamond miners on strike in South Africa  The ambiguityresulting from the conjunction of black

ofthe world XIV he quotes a splendid passage fromDr Samuel Johnsons poem on London which culminateswith the words Here falling houses thunder onyour head  And here a female atheist talks you deadThis while perhaps not strictly an example of a travelersdenunciation is certainly appropriate to the articleas a choice description of one of the Babylons of theworld  While Mr Conniff is doubtless aware of theconnection he does not mention the fact that Johnsonspoem is throughout a very close and respectful pasticheof the Latin poet Juvenals Satire III on the cityof Rome  It should be noted that Johnson made thesame kind of adaptation of another poem by JuvenalSatire X calling it The Vanity of Human Wishes Juvenal wrote his satire on Rome in the early years ofthe second century during the reign of the EmperorTrajan  Among the subjects he touches on in his poemare street crime unemployment the degradation ofthe welfare system tacky urban renewal projectsovercrowding high rents and unscrupulous landlordsnoise vehicular traffic congestion even problems ofimmigration and integration  Under this last headingamong the many alleged undesirables in JuvenalsRome is what he calls in a memorable phrase Graeculusesuriens  the hungry little Greek  In Johnsonspoem this becomes a fasting Mounseer  Of the despisedand wily but accommodating Greek Juvenalsays In caelum iusseris ibit Tell him to go to the skyand he will be off  For Johnsons Frenchie this becomesBid him go to hell to hell he goes            The passage in Juvenals poem which correspondsmost closely to the one quoted by Mr Conniff is nearthe beginning lines  where Juvenal building upto an ironic crescendo shudders at the thought ofincendia lapsustectorum adsiduos ac mille pericula saevaeurbis et Augusto recitantes mense poetasfires the constant collapse of buildingsand the thousand perils of the savage city  andpoets reciting in the month of August                        Johnson had no trouble finding fairly exact counterpartsin his London of the eighteenth century formany of the blights of Juvenals ancient Rome butthere was really nothing to match the horror of theamateur poetry reading in Trajans time the closestanalogy Johnson could come up with an elegant oneunder the circumstances is his female atheist                              Henry Henn gets a linguistic maggies drawers forNam Gook Gungho

by soldiers who thencarry it into civilian life  When enough Americansserve in uniform or when their slang is picked up bythe news media as it was in WWII Korea and Vietnamit spreads to the general slang lexicon  Examplesof this type of linguistic osmosis as GI  poop  honcho gook  and gungho  all of which are now understoodby a substantial number of Americans who have neverbeen in the military

who called the Nicaraguans gooks in            I agree with Mr Henn that the origins of slangwords are hard to pinpoint  To call a brownskinnedperson a gook may be reinforced by words in his

gobbledegook the brown mans language andgook his food                           Gungho  which once had a positive connotationis now used derisively among servicemen to describeindividuals or organizations in a state of active andzealous military enthusiasm and usually modifiesother words such as sonofabitch etc  If today amongcivilians it has come to mean a gogetter or a standoutthen it has undergone another permutation and that isjust additional proof of the languages dynamismGungho was popularized in WWII by Lt Col EvansFordyce Carlson USMC who picked it up from theRed Chinese when he was an observer to the th RouteArmy in   It is a contraction of gungyeh hodzo industrial cooperation and it caught on becauseit is easy to pronounce as in Nam or the States   Namby itself is no more derogatory or misleading thanshortening airplane or telephone or gungho             The nuances of Vietnamese history which MrHenn finds so fascinating were as useful to the menwho fought Ho Chi Minhs military machine as thefacts of the Meiji Restoration to anyone who fought theJapanese Empire in WWII            Finally I would remind Mr Henn that the pointof the Vietnam war has nothing to do with whether wecalled the country Nam or Vietnam   It is that todayRussian military personnel operate their ships andplanes out of our former base complex at Cam RanhBay while the political language

     Cannon Garland  Historical Change and EnglishWordFormation Recent Vocabulary  pp  Peter Lang                              Longman Dictionary of the English Language            This is a curious work  I was under the impressionit was based on Websters Ninth Collegiate Dictionary and indeed it was but there are so many improvementsand changes that the absence both of a Longmancopyright notice and of any identification of aspecific editorial director are a bit mysterious  One isdrawn to conclude that the work is the product ofsome disembodied corporate entity  To be sure fournamesHeather Gay Brian OKill Katherine Seedand Janet Whitcutappear on the Acknowledgementspage but so do names of a lot of other people likeFrank Kermode Melvin Bragg Clement Freud GermaineGreer Clive Jenkins and Janet StreetPorterwhose direct connection with the book at hand wouldseem to be much more remote  Having myself dealtwith consultant linguists and specialists in other fieldswho contribute something to the preparation of accuratestructure and definitions to a dictionary I think Ican safely say that such people are only indirectly responsiblefor the quality of a dictionary and the majorresponsibility for a book of such complexity rests withthe editors  But only four editors for such a massivework  I suppose it is possible  In any event it seemsunfair not to have listed them on the title page assuningas I presume we must that their contributionswere more or less equal                           Websters Ninth Collegiate Dictionary hereafterW despite many improvements over its forebears stillsuffers from shortcomings ultimately traceable to theaberrational lexicography reflected in Websters ThirdUnabridged   Although direct comparison between theLongman Dictionary of the English Language hereafterL and the W reveals many similarities there aremany differences too  One gets the impression thatthe editors of L used the good stuff from the W andsubstituted their own much better material whenthey encountered some of the bad stuff            The L was based on the W  but a comparisonalbeit superficial reveals a number of differencesto wit              The headword is syllabified in W  not in L   Inolder dictionaries the words are syllabified mainly tohelp in pronouncing them latterly syllabication hasbeen used largely to find where a word can be hyphenatedat the end of a line of text though judging bytodays newspapers and magazines one would be soreput to believe that a dictionary had ever been withinthe grasp of their editors proofreaders or the programmerswho wrote the hyphenation programs forthe automatic typesetting many of them now employThe syllabication of headwords is not an importantfeature in British dictionaries the Collins English Dictionary which offered an elaborate system in its firstedition  set the words solid in its second edition but I am informed that the major portion ofthe correspondence received at Collins Publishing concerningthe dictionary concerns this change and is criticalof it              The pronounciation systems differ  L s set ofsymbols is somewhat closer to that of the InternationalPhonetic Alphabet W follows the system used in theThird Unabridged  which is too complicated for mytaste being replete with diacritics  L uses a version ofwhat I call the Moo Goo Gai Pan or Ahoogahsystem favored by newspapers because though primitiveit is virtually transparent unlike the W systemwhich requires even a casual user to deal with distinctionsbetween a    and a rendered in L as a  ay o  ah  and ow  respectively  The description of thepronunciation of English is much fuller in the frontmatter of the W  but as the only people who read thefront matter of dictionaries seem to be students whoare enjoined to under pain of death and other lexicographersthe absence of comprehensive coverage of thesubject in L would not appear to be a serious omissionW follows the useful practice of listing a shortenedpronunciation key on each righthand page L s failureto do so is a disadvantage notwithstanding the simplicityof their system for the user must ferret about tofind the description given on page xxii to clarify anyquestion  L would be well advised in future printingsto give a complete pronunciation key on the insidefront cover of the book an easily accessible place thatis at present unused              W lists etymologies near the beginning of thoseentries that have them directly following the inflectedforms if any L places them at the end of the entryAs surveys have shown that etymological informationis the least often sought after making the average userwade through the etymology before getting to the definitionhas always seemed pointless and irritating tome besides it is unlikely that the serious consistentseeker of etymological information is likely to use anythingbut the OED or a major etymological dictionaryW lists the date of the earliest recorded use in Englishof the sense which the date precedes  The SecondEdition of the Random House Unabridged follows asimilar practice and I find it speculative spuriousand specious except for the documentation of relativelyrecent coinages  Such information is very likely to bemisinterpreted by the average user who does not approacha dictionary with a critical eye  For exampleW shows for leeway the date  from my experiencewith even aboveaverage users that is usually taken tomean that  was the first time that leeway appearedin English one day it did not exist the nextPresto  ChangeO it sprang into view on a printedpage  That is nonsense of course but even if the usersremain keenly aware that  is the date only of theearliest written evidence of what use or importance isthat to them  Moreover as we in the dictionary biz areonly too well aware an earlier citation might be foundtoday or tomorrow making the information obsoleteI feel less strongly about a designation like c whichseems usefully vague  To give  as the date forlemonade after giving c as the date for lemonmight give one the impression that it took Englishmenabout  years to find out how to make lemonade orwhat to name what they got when they squeezed alemon and mixed the juice with water and sugarEven the Scots are likely to give them more credit thanthat  Also the date given for the adjective lemon as inlemon flavor lemon color  would draw one to the conclusionthat those retarded speakers of the languageneeded some  years to use the noun as a modifierMercifully L has omitted such dating              Another odd thing in the W etymologies carriedover into the L is the practice of using moreat as a cross reference indicator  For example atlento  after showing it to have come via Italian fromLatin lentus slow one reads more at LITHE  But ifyou look up the etymology for lithe you discover onlythat the original form of that word  lithe in Old Englishis akin to Latin lentus slow  My objectionto the form of the reference is that its wording suggeststhere is more information about the etymologyof lento to be found under lithe  but that does notactually turn out to be the case all the user haslearned is that lento and lithe are or might be cognatesIn the event why not just say cogn lithe under lento and the reverse under lithe   This latterpiece of information is unaccountably lacking              Compare the entries for literally in the twodictionariesW  in a literal sense or manner ACTUALLY took the remark    was  insane    ineffect VIRTUALLY  will  turn the world upsidedown to combat cruelty or injusticeNormanCousins usage Since sense  is the opposite in meaningof sense  it has been frequently criticized as amisuse  Instead the use is pure hyperbole intendedto gain emphasis but it often appearsin contexts where no additional emphasis isnecessaryL  in the literal sense without metaphor orexaggeration  with exact equivalence verbatim follow the instructions     used to intensifya metaphorical or hyperbolic expression she was   tearing her hair out  disapprovedof by some speakers                        To be sure the W usage note even with its verbosityand the oxymoron pure hyperbole is morehelpful than L s cryptic disapproved of by somespeakers but the definitions are better in L becausethey assume that if a user does not know the meaningof literally  then that of literal is unlikely to be thatobvious  On the other hand figurative or exaggeratedexpression would probably have been a simplified improvementover metaphorical or hyperbolic expressionwhich might be tough going for someone whohad to look up literally to begin with            Users of the L will be far better off if spared thetechnique of defining in the W  carried over from theThird Unabridged  in which the full explanatory definitionis abandoned in favor of a scattering of synonymsset in SMALL CAPITALS which more often thannot are likely to lead the user who has the paitence topursue them to other words defined in the same ineptmanner  There is a difference between using a wordin a phrasal definition and suggesting it as apresumably substitutablesynonym  In the presentcase ACTUALLY is such a loosely used filler word inthe language like really  I mean  yknow  etc as to bealmost useless as a substitute except literally            In general the definitions in W have been clarifiedsimplified and made more precise in L   Also thecitations in W have either been omitted where unnecessaryor paraphrased and sources are not given  Ihave never understood why in a dictionary of this sizeW ever thought it useful to give the sources of citationsespecially inconsistently who among the generalcollegedictionaryusing population of todayknows the identity of Norman Cousins  Is H G Rickoverbeing held up to the user as a paragon of Englishusage  What is the significance in citing anonymouswriters Longfellow L P Smith or giving no citationat all  The treatment in W is erratic to say the least              The entry list in L seems to be fuller than in W but a quick direct comparison is not easily done  Inone interval checked W reveals Montague Romeosfamily name Montmorency a kind of cherry Montrachetwine monuron a herbicide mooneye afish mooneyed openeyed and moonflower  asheadwords not in L  the same interval in L revealsmontbretia a plant Montessorian teaching methodmonth of Sundays  Montilla  mony suffix Moog synthesizer moon daisy the oxeye moonfaced  moonglow and moonrat  which do not appear in W   Leavingaside the plants and animals which are differentlydistributed for American and British users the onlysignificant omission from L is Montrachet  while theimportant words omitted from W are Montessorian month of Sundays  mony  Moog synthesizer  moonfaced and moonglow   The last word is not in the RHD               II  but it should be for the L citation is from HenryMiller and the word also appears in the lyrics writtenfor the popularized rendition of Tchaikovskys thsymphony  It should also be noted that idiomatic expressionseg once in a blue moon  listed undermoon in L  may be listed elsewhere under blue moonin W  and that others eg over the moon elated arenot much used in American English            On the whole readers can draw their own conclusionsabout the breadth of coverage as for meI should regrettably sacrifice Montrachet to gainothers              There are lengthy usage notes and synonymstudies in W that do not appear in L at all or in greatlyabbreviated form sometimes mercifully so for Woccasionally succumbs to prolixity  Notwithstandingsuch features are valued by users and cutting themcould be a disadvantage              W has illustrations better than those in theThird Unabridged  L has none but it must be notedthat other British dictionaries lack them also so Lneed not have included them purely for competitivereasons in the main market it is intended to serve              Both dictionaries list abbreviations and biographicaland geographical entries in separate sectionsat the back a practice I have never liked  Experienceand a moments thought shows that names of peopleand places occur with equal sometimes greater frequencyin the language than a very large percentage ofthe words listed in dictionaries of almost any size exceptthe smallest and on that ground they should notbe treated as nonwords or as being outside the pale oflexicon  Also it is awkward to find Glasgow or Shakespearein one part of the dictionary and Glaswegian orShakespearian in another  Finally fictional people andplaces are listed in the main body of those dictionariesthat include them but real people and places appearin the appendices as it may be assumed that users lookup things they do not know the immediate assumptionis that they ought to come to a reference bookalready aware that Homer was a real person despitespeculation to the contrary and that Jesus was bothreal and as the Jewish religious teacher fictionalfundamentalists will be disturbed to discover that mostof the characters in the Bible are treated as fictionalIt seems silly to separate Gruyre the cheese fromGruyre the place in Switzerland whence it comesindeed the latter is not even an entry in the geographicalsections of either dictionary  Of the two the Wgeographical listings seem more complete W listsAylesbury  which through some grievous egregiousfault is not in the geographical section of the L butdoes appear in the AZ section because of the ducks              Although L has in addition to

two commutativebinary operations and that can be described byany of various systems of postulates all of whichcan be deduced from the postulates that anidentity element exists for each operation thateach operation is distributive over the other andthat for every element in the set there is anotherelement which when combined with the firstunder one of the operations yields the identityelement of the other operationunder the operationsof taking intersections and unions thesubsets of a given set form a Boolean algebra                        The definition in the Third Unabridged was a modelof clarity compared with that  Focusing on these twodefinitions it must be conceded that naive users whodid not know the meaning of Boolean or of Booleanalgebra before going to either dictionary are unlikelyto come away any the wiser  But the second reads likegobbledygook while the first tries to provide some basicnotion of what is involved and where it is appliedwhile at the same time gently notifying users thatthey are going to have to seek elsewhere for a properdefinition the understanding of which requires farmore backgound in mathematics and logic than can beassumed in the average user            Lexicographers constantly face problems of definingterms that in some instances might require abrief essay to explain and far more specialized knowledgethan can reasonably be expected from the userThe source of the problem lies in the fact that there isno law forbidding ordinary mortals to bandy aboutterms like theory of relativity which only a few peoplein the world truly understand to be sure it is impossibleto conceive of writing a definition for it that wouldfit into a dictionarys procrustean requirements  Thedilemma can be resolved either by attempting a definitionwhich no one will understand or by providing asuperficial pass at a definition couched in languagesuggesting that the user can find no succor in the workin hand  I prefer the latter approach though I haveof ten thought it might be only fair to mark such entrieswith some symbol like a deaths head            Conclusion  I think the Longman is a fine dictionarysuperior to the Webster  but I have been carefulnot to compare it with the Collins  which remainsmy favorite British English dictionary for reasons thatmodesty forbids my detailing here            Laurence Urdang                                             Computational Lexicography                        I recently purchased a new computer and becauseit operated on a system different from the one ofmy old computer I asked a few friends to recommenda wordprocessing package that I mightfind useful  Iwas particularly interested in one that would allow meto designate a variety of typestyles during keyboardingideally one that showed the styles on the monitoras the text was being typed            Those who are familiar with computers or do notwant to know about them should skip to the next paragraphFor those who are unfamiliar with computersand the need for a wordprocessing package I shouldexplain that when you buy what is fondly call a personalcomputer you get three pieces of equipmentthough they may be combined in some models ormakes a rectangular box with some slots in the frontand sockets in the back a monitor which is nothing buta small TV set and a keyboard which looks like anordinary typewriter keyboard but in many models soldtoday has a number of additional keys alongside thosefor the familiar alphanumeric characters on mine nestledamong some control keys on the right side is what iscalled a number pad which resembles the key arrangementone sees on a small adding machine or calculatoron the left side is a double bank of five keysmarked F through F which when pressed aloneor in combination with another key perform certainfunctions some of which are useful others of which areevidently thought useful by the manufacturer butwhich I never use  These boxes come with wires calledcables for some reason that allow them to be connectedto one another and into a power source  The trick isthat they will not do anything unless and until you haveinstalled what is called a Disk Operating System whichcomes with the machine  After it has been installed theDOS as it is called once identified nothing in computereseis ever called by its full name again a PersonalComputer becomes a PC a Disk Operating Systembecomes a DOS if it is made by a company calledMicroSoft it is called MSDOS performs certain functionsthough rarely any that anyone but a computerspecialist would want to perform  In order to do somethinguseful you have to buy a program which is apackage consisting of a number of diskettes and a manualA diskette is also called a floppy the reason forthe name is not immediately apparent nor why theitem is called a diskette for that matter but allbecomes clear  The socalled diskette is a flat blacksquare of rather tough plastic with a hole in the middleand an oblong slot on each of the flat sides it is said tobe  inches square but that is a lie as the only personwho probably ever measured one of these things I cantell you it is   inches square that may seem irrelevantbut it is only the beginning of the Great DeceptionInside this square plastic casing which you shouldnever open is a flimsy flat black plastic papadum  Ifthe diskette is placed in the slot of the machine a motorengages the center of the disk inside and spins it aroundat a great speed so that portions of it are exposed as theypass by the oblong slot allowing them to be writtenon or read by some device inside the box  The diskettesthat contain programs have information on themthat the computer understands and translates into anumber of commands that make the machine do certainthings  The things done depend on what kind ofprogram is on the diskette            I bought a wordprocessing program called FrameworkII  It is quite versatile and as I required allowsme to create certain kinds of files in which I am able tostyle the text as I wish but I shall not go into that hereFramework is sold by AshtonTate a SiliconValley concernthat makes quite good programs but like most ofthe software companies produces such abominablemanuals with directions for using the programs thatthey have to maintain a staff of several dozen technicalpersonnel who are on duty about  hours a day beginningat six in the morning California time merely inorder to answer the questions of confused customersThis failing appears to be endemic to the industry Irecently spoke with an executive of Okidata a manufacturerof a very good computer laser printer whotold me that his technical staff answers  telephonequeries a month  I pointed out to him that if theymade available a proper manual the number of callscould probably be reduced to   Only the telephonecompany was profiting from such ineptitude            But the foregoing is all preliminary and backgroundto the main theme  One of the services performedby Framework is in a program subroutinecalled Spelling Check  I do not need a spelling checkerbut I have found it extremeely useful as a means forproofreading text that has been keyboarded into storagein the Framework program  The way it works isthis after completing an article chapter of a book orwhatever it is that I am working on I press a few keysand the program automatically scans every word oftext comparing each with a dictionary contained inthe program  It is not really a dictionary of course inthe sense that is lacks definitions it is merely a wordlist  I have not seen the word list but from the directoryof programs I can invoke on the monitor I know itcontains about  characters or about words  Being a computer the machine performs thiscomparison checking very very rapidly it takes only aminute to proofread a file containing about words  The proofreading is slightly moronic for theprogram cannot alert the user to an error like an forand because an is a valid word in its memory stillit is better than nothing  If it encounters a word that isnot in its repertoire it offers a choice of actions at thestroke of a key or two you can ADD the word to the listGO ON and ignore the word entirely or EDIT the questionableitem by correcting a typo for instanceThere is another option called SUGGEST which if invokedlists up to seven or eight words that you mighthave had in mind when you wrote the one that offendedthe machine and this brings me to the point ofthis article            It seems unnecessary to point out that Frameworkcannot have a very sophisticated list of words if it hasonly  in its memory but I thought it might beinteresting to see what substitutions were evoked bySUGGEST  In each listing below the boldface word isthe word at which Framework stopped offering toSUGGEST a substitute the words following are the substitutionsit suggested  Where ellipses occur I have notbothered to copy down the entire list of offerings selectingonly those that struck me as odd either becauseof the incongruity of the choice or because I could notin the wildest flights of dyslexic schizophrenicfancyimagine the criteria employed in arriving at the selectionsI am fully aware that some of the words in mytext are not everyday items you find about the housebut I included those anyway attention is drawn particularlyto the suggestions for the more

              Well you get the idea  I had some fun substitutingthe programs words in my sentences and in simplesentences too  For instanceAll arachnids and insects are arthriticScientists at NASA are

enjoy some bordellos or beautieswith my steak                        As if the preceding were not enough I also noticedassuming that the program did not stop andoffer choices if the word was in its memory that oligopsonyis in but psychoneurotic is not Winston is inChurchill is not isosceles is in scalene is not            It is a good thing that the technical staff atMicroSoft is not being asked to field questions about itsSpelling Check I am not sure I would want to hear theanswers            Finally it might be worth mentioning that theprogram has the capacity to store in a temporarymemory buffer about  words proper names forinstance that it has identified as not stored in its dictionaryThe first time such a word is encountered ifthe operator chooses GO ON the program stores it andwill recognize it when it recurs obviating the need torepeat the GO ON command  For example if you arewriting an article on Churchill  not listed in theentry dictionary the program will stop at thefirst encounter but once you have signaled it to GO ONit will pass over any further repetitions of Churchill When the temporary memory has been filled the followingmessage appears on the screen which makesme wonder why I am relying on the program at allNO FURTHER WORDS CAN BE REMEMBERED FOR CORRECTMULTIPLE OCCURRANCES OR FOR GO ONSpelling check check thyself
