        the best to do       for voting   well i think that uh i guess i just everybody knows that education is is important but i guess the main thing is theres some things you just dont care about       so if you dont care about them you dont vote for them right   one of the biggest stumbling block is at first getting registered   yeah although although uh thats theres a lot of people out there thatll do that for you that i just thought of something now that that made a big difference to me and uh come to think of it its got to do with Jerry Brown and thats when i was in i used to live in California and when he was Secretary of State there one of the things that he did was he sent out a booklet and the booklet was uh here are the issues heres the pros heres the cons heres the pro rebuttal to the cons and heres the con rebuttal to the pros by the time i got through reading that article by the time i got through reading that booklet i knew exactly what the issues were   isnt that what you have now in Oregon you have the booklets   well we had a little booklet and it says heres the issues   yep and each uh party or whatever against or for the proposition or   but for fifty bucks you can or whatever it is fifty or three hundred or five hundred or something like that you can put in a statement for or against but the nice thing about this other thing was that and was that you have uh like i say you have the people say well its going to uh its gonna reduce taxes and the other people say yeah itll reduce taxes but at the expense of something else and so it was how shall i say it it was kind of focused pros and the cons and then the rebuttal and so i got to see both sides whereas in the current booklet it just says heres uh if somebody thinks its a good idea he tells me but you know its are you uh are you involved in software   excuse me   are you an engineer or or involved in software at all   oh well that yeah   okay well one of the things about a lot of programs is they tell you what they do but they dont tell you what they dont do and the only way you know what i mean they say oh look this is great this this slices slices bread but they dont tell you that  that it also mashes it at the same time and uh so that   uhhuh yeah i i i understand to giving pros and cons and being informed but   yeah   i thinking also uh you can you should have voter registration by phone things like that   well out here they do it by uh mail you can do it by mail that   yeah well you you know a lot of places do it by mail but a lot of people dont but you know get to the step of putting it into the mail you know and uh if you can do it from the phone and pick it up at anytime twenty four hours a day and do it thats thatll make   well the problem with that i think is fraud we havent been around voter fraud uh too much but   well well actually theres there are ways i mean if they can get the speaker identity verification and those kind of technologies out there it would help um you know in terms of verifying who they are and what theyre saying and and uh you know people could uh use that you know   or the other option i guess is to i mean why do you even have to do it over the phone why couldnt you just walk up to the booth and and uh register right there and then they have with uh everything hooked up by the computer you could say okay youve already voted   where do you live yeah and all that stuff yeah they dont do that which is a problem and uh i dont know i think um that or you can also the problem is also oh motivating people to do it seeing that their voting has an impact on the process and people frankly dont see any connection with what they they vote and what happens so they very frustrated and they dont do anything so theres learned helplessness type of you know no matter what i do its not gonna help so why bother   thats thats certainly true too   um   theres uh the other side of the coin is that uh in the educational side the IRS does a wonderful job right about now at putting articles in the paper about uh motivating motivating people to turn in their taxes   umhum   uh and i dont think the that very many people try to motivate you to to vote   umhum well they should i you know what i think also they should do is build in the process the election process   uh   is not just vote getting i mean to get those people candidates saying that not that their votes arent any good unless they also motivate so many percent of the populace to vote they could be identified by them   oh i see what youre saying   so put it in the political process that that you know not only you have to get petitions in order to get on the ballot but you have to attract you know you have to attract so many people just to come to vote they dont have to vote for you but they have to come to the polls and actually vote you know those something built in to the system to motivate people to to bring them into the process and especially the people who wanna hold office i mean thats what
