                            Throughout his career Bela Julesz created new scientific disciplines by remarkable        combinations of seemingly disparate approaches The selection of his major discipline        which would eventually be called visual neuroscience may have been serendipity or        choice        When the unexpected Soviet invasion of Hungary in  spurred his emigration to the        United States Bela Julesz with his Hungarian doctorate in engineering joined the        numerous mathematical luminaries working at ATT Bell Laboratories such as John Tukey        Harry Nyquist Claude Shannon and John Kelly One of the projects underway at the time was        the creation of long randomnumber binary sequences that did not repeat Bela told the        story that he was assigned the problem of testing these number generators he decided to        use the best pattern recognizer that he knew ofthe human visual system The random bits of        zeros and ones drawn from the random number sequences were plotted as sequential rows in an        image Any repeats any correlations across space would be instantly seen by the human        visual system as patterns in the random dots What caused Bela to choose this unusual        approach to looking for patterns combining computers and vision His doctoral thesis        research in network theory and television signals clearly influenced him but it was        quintessential Bela to give himself a hand up into a new field by building on his base of        knowledge moving in a new and unexpected direction using mathematical and psychological        insight He termed this talent scientific bilingualism Julesz         This success in exploiting the visual system and the intellectual freedom intrinsic to        the design of Bell Labs provided Bela with the opportunity to use these new random dot        patterns to explore the visual system Most of us know well that we can use the small        differences in the images in each eye to see depth Sir Charles Wheatstone showed in         that if two different perspective images were observed through a stereoscope so that each        eye observed only one view a startlingly realistic threedimensional image occurred        Oliver Wendell Holmes stereoscope enthusiast wrote of the experience that the shutting        out of surrounding objects and the concentration of the whole attention which is a        consequence of this produce a dreamlike exaltationin which we seem to leave the body        behind us and sail away into one strange scene after another like disembodied spirits        Holmes         The basis of this threedimensional perception was hotly debated between Wheatstone and        fellow physicist Sir David Brewster Though it may seem odd for physicists to concern        themselves with the physiology of optics this was felt to be a natural extension of the        study of the physics of optics Brewster opined that perspective was the source of the        apprehension of an objects shape Wheatstone insisted that the images in the each eye had        identifiable landmarks that were combined to assign depth to the landmarks Bela read much        of the literature of that time and he must have seen two greats as wrestling without        either finding the overwhelming hold to pin down the other More than one hundred twenty        years after Brewster and Wheatstone Bela realized that his random dot patterns could be        used to probe this question What Bela did was create a pair of identical random dot        patterns When viewed binocularly through a stereoscope ie fused they would be seen        as a single surface Then Bela took a central region from the right random dot pattern and        displaced it minutely to the right Now when the two patterns were fused the central        square was not seen double but after a moment or two eerily moved into depth behind the        surrounding region In  Belas experiment with what eventually became known as Julesz        random dot stereograms unambiguously demonstrated that stereoscopic depth could be computed        in the absence of any identifiable objects in the absence of any perspective in the        absence of any cues available to either eye alone It was a perfect combination of        psychological and mathematical insight and technology that solved this puzzle It is an        interesting aside that Bela sent his first report to the         Journal of the Optical Society of America  where it was rejected the         Bell Labs Technical Journal holds the now classic paper Julesz         The         Journal of the Optical Society of America published Belas second paper        Julesz  The stereoscope had existed  years        Bela proposed in his book         Foundations of Cyclopean Perception  that early in the vision        process the two images from the two eyes were combined to form a single view imbued with        inherent depth information The perceptual cyclops within us was proposed to analyze the        visual world first before the motion color and contrast systems began their perceptual        operations Belas book is full of powerful visual experiments that make this point        irrefragably from his psychophysical analysis binocular vision forces unexpected        constraints on the rest of vision         QED Foundations of Cyclopean Perception is still considered one of the        classics of modern psychophysics and continues to have profound relevance to both those        entering the field and established investigatorsover thirty years after its publication        At the time of his death Bela had begun working on a second edition        His success in determining the sequence of visual processing using random dot        stereograms led Bela to propose that the anatomical hierarchy of the visual system could be        understood in part through visual psychophysicshe termed this approach psychoanatomy        His ingenious use of the stereogram established a new approach in the field of vision        research and presaged the now common use of carefully controlled computational techniques        in brain science By this time Belas reputation was established and in  he received        a prestigious MacArthur Fellowshipthe genius award He used the funds for travel        including an annual peregrination to the California Institute of Technology where I first        met Bela in         His seminars and lecture courses were enthusiastically received and endorsed by        countless students postdoctoral trainees and faculty as evidenced both by his        formidable reputation and through the numerous citations of his work His approach to        presenting his research was modest and gently selfdeprecating He always encouraged young        scientists his joy and passion in their science were transmitted both through his warm        persona and his suggestions of directions for future study His insights guided my        development of random dot kinematograms ie movies to examine how motion could be used        to construct threedimensional form Siegel and Andersen  He collaborated with Derek        Fender David Van Essen and John Allman at the California Institute of Technology on the        combination of the computer the psychophysical approach and the physiological        experiment        Bela was a fount of ideas each building on the priors advance His later passions were        explorations of texture and attention notably with Jonathan Victor and Dov Sagi Belas        appealing hypothesis that textons putative elements of textures are represented at a        cellular level is now questionable Julesz et al  Bela was groping for an        overarching computational theory for the representation of random geometry but none was to        be had Nonetheless the texton elements served useful duty in the demonstration that there        were two stages to early visionan effortless phase preceding attention and a guided        identification phase Sagi and Julesz  Many contemporary laboratories examining        vision studying either perception or the activity of neurons now incorporate designed        complicated yet highly controlled stimuli that have evolved knowingly or not from Belas        original forays in the s and s His continuing impact was recognized by his        election to the National Academy of Science in         In  Bela retired from Bell Labs by then he was a department head and joined the        Department of Psychology at Rutgers University to establish the Laboratory of Vision        Research Bela continued investigating mechanisms of form texture and stereopsis his        presence led to numerous studies into the implications of his original findings as well as        new investigations into computational vision His collaborations greatly aided the        establishment of neuroscience at Rutgers Bela wrote         Dialogues on Perception  a wideranging intellectual effort in        which he uses classic dialectics to question both his own successes and those of his chosen        field In the book one reads of two competing intellects a Bela who believes in his        contributions to science and another Bela who is constantly belittling and judging his        contributions        Throughout his career Bela Julesz was able to add language after language to his        research imperative becoming a true scientific polyglot Although his arrival in the        United States was propelled by political events beyond his control his intellectual        directions followed a chosen path less traveled by and that has made all the difference        In  an engineer set out from Hungary By  his unique combination of mathematical        precision combined with deep biological insight had carried him to elegant solutions for        seemingly intractable problems in visual neuroscience Bela was always in dialogue often        with others and often with himself In the process he would gently drive each of us and        himself forward to our final destination of understanding the brain Bela Julesz died on        December   fortyseven years to the day after starting at Bell Laboratories
