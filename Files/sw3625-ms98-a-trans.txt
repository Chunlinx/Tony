                do any woodworking at all   yes as a matter of fact i do i uh i i took a lot of shop classes when i was in junior high and high school   oh great   and uh had a had a lot of fun in it i i made uh a table with a shelf underneath that goes thats for my room and uh   oh how nice   stereo cabinets and all kinds of stuff   oh wow you do do a lot do you have your own tools or do you have some   yeah my my dad has uh lets see a a radial arm saw and all that kind of stuff out in the garage that that i use once in a while now i dont have a lot of time for that kind of thing any more but   uhhuh uhhuh   whenever he needs a help hand doing something that hes making then i go out there and help him   oh thats nice so do you um what kind of wood do you use usually the pine or   uh it depends on the project really uh   oh   i think i made my stereo cabinet out of pine   uhhuh   um something my dads been he made my grandmother a jewelry box and he made that out of poplar   oh oh how neat   yeah uh   so hes done hes done wood projects too   yeah i i i think         my my involvement in in school got him in that   oh   hold on for just one second   okay       okay   oh well thats thats good So do you stain them and all that yourself when youre finished with them   yeah yeah theres just about everything i make is either its either stained or   oh uhhuh   that definitely is a real if you like the color of the wood its real nice to just put on that clear finish coat that keeps it sealed up and   uhhuh oh   looks nice   oh well thats interesting i ive always been interested in woodworking i the type i do is a little bit different but i after the projects are done i like to paint them and um you know make different types of   yeah   oh i just finished some Christmas decorations a friends husband cut cut them out for us and then we you know got together and painted them   yeah   and um he does you know he makes the shelves to hang on your wall or he makes bookshelves or corner cupboards and i think its fascinating i i really think its if you have the tools yeah i think youd have to have the tools to make it   yeah its its a lot of fun as long you you got the right tools and everything   uhhuh        oh do you so you dont have much time for it though even though you       you have access to the tools now   yeah yeah right i havent done anything on my own for about six years now   uh well now do you follow a pattern or do you just kind of   uh   start measuring and cutting or   if if youre if if you start to make something you have to like basically draw draw the design of whatever it is you want   uhhuh   and and determine the the measurements uh of everything   oh   and then make sure that that make sure that that what you put on paper will work and then put it to wood   uhhuh oh do you save a lot of money rather than buying the finished project   yeah you you really you can save a whole a a a lot of money   oh   you can go to a like a a furniture shop and a stereo cabinet like i built only a lot smaller would cost you probably in the neighborhood of forty to fifty dollars   uhhuh oh   i think i spent a total of maybe fifteen to twenty   oh wow that is a big difference   yeah and and had wood left over and you know to use for other other things   oh wow oh that is a   and it and it and i and i got my when i made it its made to the specifications that i wanted because i have an oversize stereo   umhum umhum   that wouldnt fit in most newer stereo cabinets because they make all those   uhhuh so you got what you want besides getting it for a better price and   yeah they make all those smaller components and this is a stereo that ive had since       i think about nineteen eighty   oh   so   oh well thats great how do   that that kind of thing works out to your advantage as well you can make it to to fit your design instead of whatever they give you   right huh so youve made the a stereo cabinet and what else did you say   uh ive made a its a its a table that has a shelf underneath     oh   uh ive made a it its supposed to be a uh old style lamp holder you know like oil lamp holder   uhhuh oh oh how neat   with a with a mirror in the back of it but i dont have a lamp to put in it   oh   so i just use it as a mirror in my room   uhhuh       uh huh well thats interesting i i like a lot of the oldfashioned type furniture the washbasin type things and i guess you could make that   yeah   now where you dont find those in the stores to buy very often you can make the kind of   right   things that you want have you ever made any type of chair   no i i never dove into the chairs it   i wonder if they would be a harder type project would it   um it depends on how intricate the the the design is and whether or not youre going to uh
