                                  Hold That Martyrdom            On May  the first and probably last trial ofJulie Hiatt Steele for lying and obstruction of justice ended with a hung juryThe lowkey coverage of the event reflected several preestablished mediathemes a Steele is a peripheral figure hounded by a vindictive specialprosecutor Kenneth Starr b the Steele trial is a pathetic coda to Flytrapsnowfinished symphony Starrs Last Gasps says Time  and c the soleremaining function of the case is to help determine the credibility of KathleenWilley the Richmond Va socialite who accuses President Clinton of crudelygroping her near the Oval Office in             All wrong Id argueWhat follows is a short primer on the Steele case for those whounderstandably have been paying more attention to the wars tornadoes massmurders and nuclear espionage that constitute the rest of the news                           Who isSteele                        Steele is a former friend of Willeys The issue iswhether Steele provided the truth to Starrs grand juries about what Willeytold her about Clintons supposed grope Steele its been alleged has atvarious times offered three different stories            Story No  That Willey told Steele of apresidential pass the very day it occurred in November and thatit was a sexual advance that left Willey humiliated scared embarrassedSteele told this story to Newsweek s Michael Isikoff in March according to his book Uncovering Clinton  after Willey had suggested toIsikoff that he could check out the grope story with Steele            Story No  That Willey only told Steele aboutthe incident weeks after it happened saying only that the president had made apass at her not necessarily an unwelcome pass According to Isikoff Steeletold this version to him in the summer of  just as he was preparing towrite up the Willey story for Newsweek  Steele at that time said thatStory No  was a lie she had told him at Willeys request Isikoff reportedboth Steeles initial story and Story No  in his first piece on the Willeyepisode published in Newsweek in August  Isikoff has reported thatSteele repeated Story No  to him as recently as early  and at Steelestrial two of her friends said she told them something like Story No  beforeIsikoff even appeared on the scene            Story No  That Willeynever told Steele of any sexual advances made by President Clinton evenwelcome sexual advances and that the first Steele heard about any such thingwas in  when Willey called her and asked her to lie to Isikoff Steele tookthis position in an affidavit she signed in February  after the Lewinskyscandal broke It is the story she told Starr and claims today is the truthSteele also denies that in recanting Story No  she confirmed to Isikoff thatWilley had told her about any pass In effect Steele says she nevertold Story No             President Clintons story which he repeated under oath toa grand jury is that he never made any sort of pass at Willey ie it jibeswith Steeles Story No  Willey in her Steele trial testimony stuck to thestory that she told Steele of an unwanted pass the day it happened Story No although she said that she only knows she told Steele immediately becauseSteele once reminded her of it            The prevailingperception of course is that there were only two Steele stories oneproWilley one antiWilley Press accountseven Isikoffs account in hisbooktend to omit Story No  presumably for simplicitys sake But Story No is what makes Starrs prosecution of Steele seem rational                           So why has Starrpursued Steele                        The basic press take isthat Starr is pursuing Steele to vindicate Willey Thats doubtful Starr mightlike to believe Willeyand Willeys story was bolstered more than underminedby the testimony at last weeks trial Click to find out why Still Willeysstory has serious problems quite apart from Steele as a recent endlessanalysis in The Nation makes clear Starr is much morelikely to be interested in Steele herself and in why she changed her story            This is where Steeles Story No  becomes important Thekey thing about Story No  is that while it helped clear Clinton of the chargeof making an aggressive unwanted sexual overture it still contradictedthe Clinton camps official line which was and is that there was nosexual overture at all  not even a welcome one Story No  was onlysemiexculpatory            If Steele really changedher story a second time to Story No  that might suggest she was trying tofall in line with the official White House account which in turn suggests thatsomeone from Clintons side somehow got to her That at least is whatStarrs camp seems to believe Starrs goalas Bruce Shapiro in a perceptiveantiStarr Salon                essay  recognizesis most likely not to vindicate Willey butto unravel a presidential coverup conspiracy            How By convicting Steele of lying and thengetting her to flip and finger in the Clinton camp got to her to change herstory to version No  Starrs theory may be a bit florid in its paranoia butits not crazy given what we already know about current White Houseoperations Significantly the White House could have pressured Steele tofalsely switch to Story No  even if Willey is lying about Clintons gropeand even if Willey at some point asked Steele to lie to Isikoff for her                           What makes Starr sosure Steele lied                        Hes got evidence At thetrial three friends of Steeles contradicted her account One said Steele toldhim shed heard Willeys account long before  the other two said shedactually told them something like Story No  before  All this is quiteapart from Willeys testimony and Isikoffs reporting                           But Steeles still aperipheral figure right                        She is now but shewouldnt be if she flipped and finked Security guard Christoph Meili was anextremely peripheral figure in the Swiss Holocaust banking scandal until heblew the whistle on the destruction of bank records Detective would have beena peripheral figure in the OJ Simpson trial if the defense team hadnt made abig fuss over whether he was or was not telling the truth about his use of aracial epithet                         Y et Steele had no obvious sufficient motive for lying                        Right but thats thepoint If she did in fact lie what made her do it Starr may be wrong inthinking the reason was intimidation by a Clintonite conspiracy But theresonly one clear way left for him to try to find out                           At least Steeles asympathetic figure                        Steele is a divorcedsingle mom and grandmother who has had to set up a Web site to solicitmoney for her defense fund On the other hand her lawyers are representingher pro bono And of all the peripheral figures in the Lewinsky scandalSteele has been among the most industrious at marketing herself Indeed Steeleseems to have followed Strouts Law which summarizes the advice of legendaryjournalist Richard Strout to sell every story three times Long before shewas threatened with prosecution Steele sold a photo of Willey to theNational Enquirer for  At the same time she also met with anEnquirer reporter Then she was paid  for sitting down with RichardGooding of the tabloid Star to see what else she might have to sellThen most surprisingly after the Lewinsky scandal broke she was paid by Time magazine Click for more on why Time is                          B ut didnt Starr threaten to take away Steeles adoptedyearold son                        As even Steelephileslike Jeffrey Rosen of the New Republic acknowledge Starr was trying tofind out whether someone in Clintons camp might have somehow threatenedto take away Steeles adopted Romanian son and thereby gotten her to changeher story So Starr asked questions about the legality of the adoptionWhether in asking these questions Starr himself was pressuring Steeleandwhether that constitutes a vicious attempt to threaten Steeles adoptionShapiro in genuine Gestapo fashion Al Hunt in the Wall StreetJournal is a question the current criminal proceeding will notanswer                           So                w               as the evidence at trialenough to prove Steele guilty beyond a reasonable doubt                        After reading thetranscript Id say probably not But thats because Starr mindful of JusticeDepartment guidelines discouraging compelled testimony from journalists nevereven tried to get the testimony of his best potential witness  MeanwhileSteele could not be called by the prosecution thanks to the Fifth Amendmentand did not testify in her own defense Her lawyers rested their case withoutpresenting any evidence of their own Only a criminal justice system assophisticated as ours could hold Steeles trial without hearing testimony fromthe two most important witnesses                                        In other words Steelewon and Starr lost                        After the jury deadlocked Steele proclaimedvictoryand victimhood Its time to start my life again she said Butthe Steele juryunlike the jury in the recent trial of Susan McDougal withwhich Steeles trial is often twinneddid not acquit her of any of thefour charges against her Jurors didnt say which way they were split and vowednot to talk to reporters though it came out that one thought Willeys skirtwas too short Starr could seek to retry the Steele case He hasnt announcedwhether he will            Pssst If you do callIsikoff this time            F ull                disclosure I worked forNewsweek in the second half of  and am still listed on the mastheadas a contributing editor Im also friends with Isikoff Steele is suingNewsweek and Isikoff claiming Isikoff broke an offtherecordpromise Isikoff denies making any such promise I suspect Steeles suit isgroundless but whether it is or is not it has had the effect of more or lesssilencing Newsweek on the subject of Steele Starrs prosecutors toldthe judge at Steeles trial that one of Steeles former friends was ready totestify that Steele said the lawsuit was filed to shut Isikoff up Thejudge did not allow the testimony
