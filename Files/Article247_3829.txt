                                 What Is Moores Law                        Last month in Science magazine a scientist wrote that the computerindustry is in serious danger of violating Moores Law What is he referringto            Moores Law is really just a prediction that the processing power of thestateoftheart computer chip will double every  months Its named aftercomputer engineer Gordon Moore a cofounder of the Intel Corporation In Moore observed that since the invention of integrated circuits or microchipsin  the number of transistors that a chip of constant surface area couldhold had doubled once every year or two Integrated circuits are the basicunits of computer logic and memory and transistors are the onoff switchesthat allow digital information to be transmitted processed and stored Themore transistors you can pack on a circuit the more powerful the circuitbecomes Moore simply predicted that this pattern would continue            Even though its not really a law Moores prediction has held true for thepast three decades In fact its hallowed status has made it selffulfillingChipmakers and industry analysts now set their goals and forecasts based onMoores Law And because chip prices have decreased even as capacity has risenthe computer processing power available to consumers at a given price hasdoubled even more quickly            Since Moores Law depends on the continuous shrinking of transistorsscientists generally agree that it will eventually be violated Previouspredictions that it would break down have proved incorrect and most scientistsexpect Moores Law to hold for at least  more years But theScience article suggests that Moores Law may encounter physical limitssooner Transistors have already shrunk to one fivehundredth the width of ahuman hair To adhere to Moores Law within five years engineers would have tocreate transistors that are only a few dozen atoms acrossa feat that might beimpossible since atomic movement is so difficult to predict Click here to read the New York Times nontechnical piece on the Science article Engineers are currentlyinvestigating new materials and technologies that might allow Moores Law tosurvive this latest challenge                         Next question
