                                 Spiritual Opium            Hong Kong Did you know thatHong Kong leads the world in per capita consumption of oranges That it has theworlds biggest neon sign is home to  of the worlds  busiest McDonaldsand boasts the worlds highest number of RollsRoyces relative topopulation            If youdidnt you will Well in advance of the mobs of reporters editors filmcrews radio disc jockeys news anchors and photographers now descending onthe territory to cover the July  transfer of power at last countthepress handlers in the Hong Kong government wisely assembled mounds ofprepackaged material The result a journalistic Greshams law whereby hardnews is driven out by the sheer volume of fluff and clichs Time  forexample not only availed itself of much of the government bumph in itsspecial  issue but also added fun facts of its own eg mostbreathtaking bathroom view Newsweek trotted out not one but twoillustrations of old opium smokers And TVnetwork crews have been parkedbeside the territorys flagpoles waiting to stock up on footage of the Britishstandard being lowered against a dusklit sky            Still the arrival of foreign newspeople has not beenwithout its headaches for Hong Kongs business and political establishmentsThey are now complaining about negative coverage that focuses on disputes overthe electoral arrangements for Hong Kongs legislature and the fate of civilrights That is only to be expected inasmuch as most of the aforementioned reporters are interviewing the same three or four peopledemocratsMartin Lee Emily Lau and Christine Loh But Hong Kongs wheelers and dealersshould consider themselves fortunate Because if the press ever did decide tomove seriously past politics it would discover that the real threat to HongKongs future may have as much to do with Chinesestyle capitalism as withChinesestyle communism            Thatthreat arises from the blurring of lines between the kind of probusinessregimes with all the attendant corruption that characterize the rest of Asiaand the promarket regime that has distinguished Hong Kong until now When GovChris Patten who himself comes from the wet side of the Tory fence sharplyincreased social spending in his budgets the business community thunderedrightly I happen to think that the proposals had been introduced with scantregard for longterm implications Mainland officials were livid seeing theinitiatives as a lastminute British effort to rob the territory of its richesby saddling it with a European welfare system Spiritual opium Beijingcalled it            Yet Hong Kongs champions of laissez faire andlow government spending have been curiously silent in response to the newsignals coming from the top Just the other day Chief Executivedesignate TungCheehwawho will take over from Patten come July sent a very loud officialsignal by declaring that a noninterference policy would not meet the needs andstrengthen the competitiveness of todays Hong Kong The remarks echo asimilar speech Tung made in December to the Chinese General Chamber of Commercein favor of a new industrial direction that would look more kindly upon statesubsidies for preferred businesses            In thisTung has been supported by a large number of Hong Kong businessmen many ofwhom oddlyand despite their successsee Singapore as a better model for HongKong than Hong Kong Were the legions of reporters to look as closely at Tungsbusiness as they do his politics moreover they might discover that he iscloser to a Korean chaebol chieftain than to a Hong Kong entrepreneurNot only does Tungs containershipping line operate within a cartel marketwhere routes and quotas are routinely carved out but it was bailed out as heacknowledged last year by the Chinese government in  when on the brink ofbankruptcy            Tungs fellow businessmen have not been shy about takinghim up on his new offer Just recently the International Herald Tribunecarried an alarming piece in which Henry Tang a prominent local industrialistand member of Tungs Cabinet suggested tapping Hong Kongs considerableforeign exchange some  billion in reserves plus another  billion in aspecial fund from land sales to develop southern China Given that there is nogenuine infrastructure need for which China could not easily find privatesourcingof which Hong Kong accounts for the lions sharethe suggestion by aCabinet member to raid the reserves is a virtual invitation for scam and graftIts why I always told the democrats to oppose the Provident Fund agovernment pension scheme says a director of one of the territorys oldesthongs as firms are still called here You put a pile of money outthere and theres every chance it will end up in some Chinese dam            Andraiding of the reserves is only one worry Although hailed by no less than theHeritage Foundation as the worlds most open economy colonial Hong Kong hasretained many notable exceptions to the rule exceptions that may prove morecostly after July  The banking industry for example is run by a cartel thatuntil recently fixed interest rates every Friday The same insulation frommarket forces prevails elsewhere in the nontraded sector Even todayeverything from legal and medical services to airlines and utilities is almostimmune from market competition thought good for everyone else About a year agothe chairman of Cathay Pacific Peter Sutch defended such arrangements sayingthat unfettered competition would destroy the stability of the market            Over the past two years or so Chineseinterests have been buying into these companies usually at a substantialdiscount to the market This is not simply a matter of substituting Chinese forBritish vested interests For one thing the British vested interests didntalso regulate their own industries as the Chinese state firms frequently doFor another mainlandconnected players generally are able to buy in at muchbetter terms than anyone elsecertainly at terms better than their balancesheets suggest they deserve And so the Hong Kong we have on the eve of thehandover is one where Jimmy Lais Next Groupthe most popular Chinese mediagroup in Hong Kongcannot find an underwriter to take it public Yet whenBeijing Enterprises a company with nothing to show but its connection as theinvestment arm of the Beijing mayors office made an initial public offeringin Hong Kong last week there were almost  applications for each availableshare            None of this means that HongKong is about to go bust So long as China continues to develop Hong Kong willget a substantial chunk of that growth But the market has clearly signaled afuture in which guanxi  or connections will count as much astraditional pluck and enterprise Such an outcome invites an irony that wouldbe appreciated as much by Lenin as by Adam Smith that the same businesseswhose investments have done so much to undermine communism in China may beresponsible for bringing down capitalism in Hong Kong
