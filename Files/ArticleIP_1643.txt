                                 The Inscrutable West                         Renewal of Chinas MostFavored Nation trading statusthe privilege that allows an overseas nation tosell its goods at the lowest possible level of tariffs in the giant USmarketis an annual struggle Every year the president favors renewal Oneach occasion a significant section of Congress is unconvinced This patternhas repeated itself for the past decade no matter which party controls theWhite House or Congress In every case the president has prevailed and MFNstatus has been awarded for another  months            Althoughthis years dispute may be more intense and the final margins closer than lastyears Congress will not derail Chinas MFN status unless Beijing commits anact of monumental folly over the next few weeks The rules favor the occupantof the White House Under US law the president has until early June todeclare formally his support for MFN renewal Congress then has a maximum of days to decide whether it wants to reject the presidential preference Even ifboth houses of Congress vote against MFN the administration can veto thelegislation In effect MFN rejection requires not merely a simple majoritybut one of twothirds in both the House of Representatives and the Senate            In the past Congress has come nowhere near even a simplemajority in either chamber In part this is because the various pressuregroups hostile to China have known that success was too unlikely to merit theirmobilizing troops It also reflects the enormous pressure brought to bear bythe US business community which is aware that placing restrictions onChinese trade would lead to swift retaliation from Beijing Even in theaftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre the power of corporate interest hasalways prevailed over other concerns Clinton can be quietly confident that itwill do so again            HoweverMFN renewal should not be interpreted as a sign that USChina relations haveresumed a more intimate path or that opponents of the administrationsconstructive engagement approach are in retreat In fact the opposite istrue Policy toward China remains the most difficult and divisive aspect ofUS foreign relations Successful MFN renewal simply reflects the peculiarcircumstances that affect this element of the China debate Moreoverproponents of a closer USChina relationship have been forced to compromiseClinton had hoped that Congress would vote to make MFN status a permanentfixture this year thus ending this annual largely symbolic fight Any suchaspirations were abandoned several months ago            The administration is engaged now in adefensive strategy aimed at preserving what it can of theconstructiveengagement ideal until congressional pressure eases For themoment Clinton has largely succeeded in limiting the damage However threefactorswhich could surface at any timemay derail his ambitions                                             Campaignfinance                The campaignfinance scandals that have tarnished Clintonssecond term could spin out of control The most politically explosiveaccusation is that agents of the Chinese government attempted to influence the elections in favor of Clinton and the Democrats through covert campaigncontributions and that administration officials were warned about the practicebut did not act If either the current FBI investigation or congressionalhearings substantiate these allegations the White House will have littleoption but to distance itself from China Beijing would in turn reactfuriously                                             Hong Kong                Theimminent return of the Britishadministered territory to Chinese rule hasgalvanized antiChina activists inside the United States They will insistthrough legislation and other means that Beijings behavior toward Hong Kongbecome the yardstick by which Washington determines its level of cooperationwith China The high profile and emotive power of the Hong Kong issue will makeit very difficult for the administration to ride roughshod over suchdemands                                             Chinas WTObid                Beijing is keen to be included in the World Trade Organizationand subject to certain conditions the US State Department would like tofacilitate its application However a majority in Congress either favors amuch tougher stance toward Beijing or rules out its WTO membership altogetherThe position of those seeking further tradeliberalization concessions fromBeijing has been strengthened by recent increases in Chinas huge trade surpluswith the United States            US lawdoes not require the president to request congressional support beforesupporting a WTO bid However Clinton would risk legislative revenge if hetried to pursue the issue in the face of firm majorities against him inCongress Beijing however believes that if Clinton were to spend politicalcapital on pushing Chinas membership in the WTO he could prevailas he didon NAFTA and WTO ratification Should Clinton decide not to try Beijing willreact badly to what it will perceive as prevarication Should he try and thenfail Beijing will conclude that it is dealing with a weak administration                           Mutual                Misunderstanding                        Beijing views the UnitedStates as the one country that can influence Chinas emergence as a majorglobal political and economic power in both a positive and a negativedirection Under Deng Xiaoping Beijing actively sought to cultivate a goodbilateral relationship Hardliners suspicious of US ideological influenceasserted themselves in March  when missile tests in the Straits of Taiwanwere timed to intimidate Taiwans politicians and electorate as the countryheld its first direct elections to the presidency The United States respondedby deploying US naval forces in the region Since then the hardliners haveplayed a less prominent role Dengs successors broadly favor cooperation butlack the late paramount leaders dominating influence It is thus veryimportant to Beijing that relations remain on track until the planned exchangeof formal presidential visits which could happen as early as next year            The uncertainty over USChina policy means that this cannot be guaranteed The conflict in Washingtonhas its ironies As a candidate during the  presidential election Clintonattacked President Bush for coddling the butchers of Beijing Republicansin Congress by contrast generally favored constructive engagement with Chinawhile liberal and protectionist Democrats usually opposed it The liberal andprotectionist Democrats have stayed in place but Clinton and manycongressional Republicans have swapped positions US policymakers often findthe operation of Chinese politics quite incomprehensible but Chinese officialsmust find the United States equally perplexing It will be some time beforeboth sides establish better mutual understanding
