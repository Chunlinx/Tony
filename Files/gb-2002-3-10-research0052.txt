                    Background        Transposable elements are a prominent component of the        human genome accounting for approximately  of the        initial draft sequence   This is probably an        underestimate because the heterochromatic and other        regions that are difficult to assemble were excluded from        these estimates Nevertheless this large fraction is a        testament to the efficiency with which these elements now        mostly fossil sequences      have been able to        propagate and it is clear that they played a large part in        determining the structure and organization of our genome        Transposable elements mobilize either directly through DNA        or through an RNA intermediate Retrotransposons mobilize        through an RNA intermediate and are classified as either        having longterminal repeats LTRs or not nonLTR Ls        are one of the most abundant nonLTR retrotransposons        comprising  of the human genome   Also Lencoded        proteins were almost certainly involved in the insertion of        most of the         Alu elements and processed        pseudogenes in the genome       thus Ls are        probably responsible directly or indirectly for the        genesis of most of the transposed fraction of human        DNA        A fulllength active human L is approximately         nucleotides long and consists of a  UTR with an internal        promoter two open reading frames ORFs separated by a        nucleotide intergenic region and a  UTR terminating        in a polyA tail   Figure a The functional        significance of ORF is not clear whereas ORF contains        three domains critical for L propagation endonuclease          reverse transcriptase    and a terminal Zn        fingerlike domain          Fulllength Ls are capable of autonomous        retrotransposition They propagate by being transcribed        from an internal RNA polymerase II promoter    and        then use their endonuclease and reverse transcriptase        respectively to nick a target site and reverse transcribe        L RNA integrating the L into a new genomic locus            this process is known as targetsiteprimed        reverse transcription TPRT A new L insertion is usually        flanked by short direct repeats derived from the target DNA        locus upon L integration   these repeats are referred        to as target site duplications TSDs and can range from        just a few to more than  nucleotides in length                 Relatively recent retrotransposition events can be        recognized in genomic DNA with computational sequence        analysis tools however the precise determination of the        boundaries of L elements is complicated by the highly        variable sequence and anatomy of L insertions Thus        single L insertions can be mistakenly annotated as several        separate L segments by RepeatMasker AFA Smit and P        Green   and similar repeatfinding algorithms The        most variable features of Ls are the polyA tail which        has a variable length and can contain simple repeats the        polyadenylation signal and the  UTR but many changes        have also been reported in the coding regions of young Ls        especially in a segment of ORF             Relatively little is known about  UTR sequences        especially of the older elements as the majority of Ls        are  truncated   Sequence differences in these        highly variable components of L elements confound precise        definition of the TSDs that define L insertion        boundaries        In addition to sequence variability the structure of L        elements is also quite diverse Many L elements are         truncated or both  truncated and  inverted Figure b        Some Ls have an extra  nucleotides in their  UTR        starting at position    Also  transduction        events associated with L insertions add an additional        structural variation    such elements are generated        when the elements transcript includes some downstream        flanking sequences that become transduced along with the        L sequence to a new genomic locus Consequently the         TSD of the resulting L insertion event can be located        hundreds of nucleotides downstream of the L sequence        itself    Finally target site deletions can occur        therefore sequence boundaries for some L insertions        cannot be determined computationally in the absence of the        preintegration target            The above variations provide a formidable bioinformatic        challenge to accurate and automated identification of L        termini Nevertheless we developed an algorithm that        refines the coordinates of L insertions found by the        existing DNA sequence analysis tool RepeatMasker The basis        of our algorithm is the identification of the flanking TSDs        and polyA tails of  intact L insertions Using this        algorithm we collected from the human genome sequence        those Ls with recognizable TSDs This enabled us to carry        out a largescale study of L sequence features related to        the molecular mechanisms involved in retrotransposition We        present here some primary structural features of these Ls        and a detailed analysis of their TSDs We also investigated        the chromosomal location at which these Ls were found        Studying L insertion events in our genome can provide new        insights to both L biology and the mechanisms by which Ls        and the smaller geneencoding portion of the human genome        have reached an equilibrium                    Results                  TSDfinder program          To identify the location of Ls in the human genome          we ran RepeatMasker using default settings with a custom          library see below For each L found the program          TSDfinder   was used to refine the location          coordinates in the following ways First it tested          whether adjacent L fragments could be merged see          Materials and methods In the set of  intact Ls          studied here approximately  were originally annotated          by RepeatMasker as several separate L segments This          merging step was important for maximizing the yield of          correct TSDs without this merging we found nearly           fewer TSDs Next TSDfinder found the polyA tail and          TSDs critical components of the insertion signature of          an L In addition the algorithm for TSD recognition          allowed detection of both standard insertion events in          which the  TSD immediately follows the polyA tract          associated with the retrotransposon and putative           transduction events in which the  TSD follows a          polyA tail further downstream from the  end of the          retrotransposon Figure b This program also detected          any  inverted elements and identified the inversion          breakpoints          An important step for the validation of TSDfinder          results was the analysis of the TSDs identified by the          algorithm As seen in Figure  the majority of TSDs          identified by TSDfinder had high TSD scores the scoring          system is described in Materials and methods with an          average score of  out of a maximum possible score of           The distribution of TSD lengths Figure           correlates well with TSDs observed in biological          experiments      The peak of          ninenucleotide TSDs the minimum TSD length allowed by          TSDfinder is likely to be enriched in false positives          because they have a relatively low average TSD score of           there is obviously a higher likelihood of finding          these shorter matches by chance The second major peak in          Figure indicates that the majority of TSDs with a score          greater than  were  nucleotides long This finding          combined with generally high TSD scores and manual          inspection of hundreds of Ls recovered gives us          confidence that the sequences identified by the TSDfinder          algorithm represent actual TSDs The longest TSD found          was  nucleotides even after we relaxed and extended the          TSDfinder parameters to enable the identification of long          TSDs Although TSDs longer than this have been found in          new insertions    it is possible that long TSDs          are eliminated or unstable in the human genome          Alternatively long TSDs may be an artifact of          transposition assays in cultured cells                          Ls in the human genome          We limited this analysis to younger Ls which are          more likely to be intact thereby allowing greater          confidence in assigning the  and  endpoints of each          L element In addition TSDs are generally relatively          short and thus relying on their conservation in the          genome is most reasonable for the young Ls Focusing on          older L family members is likely to increase the rate of          falsenegative results          We used the recently transposed L sequence   as          the query sequence with which the RepeatMasker program          identified the location of young Ls in the human genome          L is one of the most active Ls in a cellculture          assay   and is a member of the humanspecific Ta          subfamily of Ls which encompasses the vast majority of          active young L elements in the human genome   L          elements used in this study were identified from          nonredundant human sequence contigs NT records          assembled at NCBI by  August  build  which          constitute approximately  of the euchromatic genome          Table  The set of all Ls identified by RepeatMasker          averaged    identity with the L reference          sequence A total of  of the Ls were from          primatespecific classes of Ls and nearly  of them          belonged to one of the following younger subfamilies          LHs LP LP and LP   The Ls for which TSDs          could be identified exhibited a mean identity with the          L sequence of   This confirms that TSDs are          more recognizable in younger elements          Table summarizes the dataset and some general          features of the L elements analyzed in this study After          merging we identified  L insertions  of the          total L segments found with an intact  end that is            nucleotides deleted from the  end of the           UTR It is likely that those Ls that do not meet this          definition of  intact are distantly related to L          with divergent  UTRs Only the set of  intact Ls was          further analyzed for polyA tails and TSDs Of these            had TSDs immediately flanking the L          element and thus represented standard insertion events          and   had TSDs consistent with  transduction          This proportion of  transduction events is similar to          previously reported estimates    however a          majority of the  transduction events found are likely          to be artifacts of segmental genome duplications STS          OKP DL and JDB unpublished observations These          TSDs were selected by the TSDfinder program in part          because the  TSD was preceded by a polyA tail see          Materials and methods Nevertheless it is interesting          to note that the proportion of Ls with TSDs nearly          doubled when the polyA tail requirement was eliminated          data not shown This may indicate that L element          polyA tails shorten over time obscuring their          identification   while TSDs stay intact          We next investigated the chromosomal densities of Ls          Column  in Table shows the calculated average density          of Ls with TSDs on each chromosome These data indicate          that the Ls annotated here are positioned much more          densely on the X and Y chromosomes at approximately nine          Ls per megabase Mb of genomic DNA compared with a          mean density of around five Ls per Mb for all autosomes          This observation is consistent with previous reports that          the density of Ls on the X chromosome is almost double          that on the autosomes     The density of          fulllength Ls with and without TSDs on the sex          chromosomes is also more than twice as high as on the          autosomes this may be a simple consequence of the lower          recombination potential on the sex chromosomes as          reported by Boissinot           et al   With approximately          three Ls per Mb chromosome  has the lowest density of          L insertions                          TSD composition and preinsertion loci          Sequence patterns of TSDs are likely to reflect the          targeting preference of L integration machinery In          addition the target site may influence the resulting L          anatomy To investigate this we segregated our set of          Ls with TSDs into the following major classes of          structural variants and analyzed their respective TSDs           truncated  inverted or fulllength L start            standard insertions and  transduction candidates          Figure b When the TSDs of each structural variant          were analyzed we observed little difference in the          distribution of TSD lengths and scores between these          variants data not shown          When the A content in all nucleotide TSDs was          compared with randomly generated nucleotide sequences          based on the human genome percentage A content it is          clear that the majority of TSDs are Arich Table           This quality is consistent with previous computational            and biochemical    observations of Arich          target sequences of Ls and           Alu sequences Figure ashows          preinsertion locus sequence composition displayed as          logo graphics for Ls with TSDs between  and           nucleotides long It is readily apparent that TSDs equal          to or greater than  nucleotides long exhibit a TTAAAA          topstrand consensus corresponding to a bottom strand          TTTT AA cleavage site A comparable profile of L          endonuclease cleavage sites was seen when the same          analysis was performed for each of the L structural          variants Figure b and data not shown Because the          nucleotide TSDs lack the TTAAAA consensus as a          result of contamination by fortuitous TSDs Figure           the scoring scheme for TSDfinder was revised during its          development to assign a scoring penalty to TSDs less than           nucleotides long          The target sequence patterns were further analyzed for          the set of  nucleotidelong TSDs without          mismatches and their nucleotide flanking regions The          percentage of each nucleotide observed at each position          in this nucleotide region was calculated and is shown          graphically in Figure b Once again a clear TTAAAA          consensus is seen in these data at the boundary between          the  flanking region and the TSD Interestingly          symmetrical but much less dramatic peaks of T and A          nucleotides are seen near the  end of the          nucleotidelong TSDs          The initial analysis of the draft human genome          reported a GC content of  in the neighborhood of          Ls as opposed to  GC across the entire genome            In agreement with these and other data that Ls          preferentially reside in ATrich DNA   our          preinsertion loci are only  GC These data suggest          that Ls may insert preferentially into preexisting Ls          in the human genome because excluding the  UTR and any          polyA tail the L element is over  AT To          investigate this we recreated preinsertion loci by          collecting  nucleotides of upstream and downstream          flanking sequence and the TSD sequence of each L          insertion for which a highscoring TSD was found We then          used RepeatMasker to analyze these preinsertion          sequences for the presence of highcopy repeats L          insertions were found in unique sequence  of the time          Table  A robust match with known highcopy repeats          including L was found in only  of the preinsertion          loci Ls were found inserted in presumably preexisting          elements of the LINEL family  of the time and into          SINE           Alu just  of the time most          probably because           Alu sequences have a relatively          high GC content  The results for the remaining          preinsertion loci were inconclusive because of limited          coverage of the sequence by fragmented repeats                          L polyA tails          During the process of TPRT whereby a copy of an L is          inserted into the genome reverse transcription is          believed to be primed on the polyA tail of the L          transcript      To investigate whether          there was a correlation between the polyA tail of an L          and its final insertion signature we analyzed the length          and percentage A content of polyA tails for each class          of L structural variant Figure b We reasoned that          the robustness of a poly A tail may dictate the fate of          the resulting L insertion We found that both standard          insertion events and putative  transduction events have          very similar polyA tails of average length           nucleotides and  A content All other structural          variants had similar values The range of poly A tail          lengths found by TSDfinder was  nucleotides          The polyA tails found in I factors a transposable          element in           Drosophila melanogaster similar to          Ls contain several copies of the simple repeat TAA          instead of a traditional polyA tail    We refer          to these as patterned repeats Of the  L polyA          tails identified in our study   had tails with          similar sequence patterns The most common patterned          repeat found in these L tails was a TAAA tetranucleotide          mean of  As per repeat element with the most common          nonA nucleotide being a T  of the time followed by          C  and G  The longest patterned tail found was           nucleotides and contained almost exclusively the          simple repeat GAAA The presence of patterned repeats in          polyA tails did not correlate with L structural          variants all exhibited a  incidence of patterned          tails whereas for putative  transduction events we          only observed a  frequency of patterned tails Finally          we compared the translated reverse transriptase sequences          of Ls with and without patterned repeats We were unable          to detect any predicted aminoacid changes in reverse          transcriptase that correlated with patterned tails data          not shown                          Fulllength L elements          Several instances of disease have been attributed to          the disruption of genes by an L insertion for a review          see   The progenitor elements of these insertions          were always fulllength or near fulllength Ls with          intact ORFs that were active in retrotransposition assays                It is estimated that           fulllength active Ls reside in the average human genome            To identify Ls in the human genome that might          have retrotransposition potential we identified Ls that          were fulllength and had intact coding regions          We identified  fulllength L elements Table           This is a minimum estimate because it is theoretically          possible that some relatively diverged family of L          element not detected by our threshold criteria see          below could have active copies To assemble this set we          allowed no more than a nucleotide deletion at the           end and no more than a nucleotide deletion at the           end relative to the L reference sequence ensuring the          presence of an intact L internal promoter              This minimal allowance for a  deletion is conservative          because the LRE element an L element in the same          subfamily as L has a nucleotide  deletion yet          retains transposition ability   We did not require          our set of fulllength Ls to have TSDs An extra           nucleotides are found in the  UTR of some L elements          starting at nucleotide position    In our set of          fulllength Ls   lacked this insertion          whereas   had this sequence in the  UTR          The BLASTX program   was used to translate our set          of fulllength L DNA sequences in all three reading          frames and compare them to the L ORF and ORF          aminoacid sequences The translation for each          fulllength L sequence was analyzed for the presence of          nonsense mutations and for missense mutations that          inhibit retrotransposition activity by destroying the          catalytic sites of the endonuclease or reverse          transcriptase or any other critical residues on which          retrotransposition depends see Materials and methods for          a complete list     We identified           fulllength L elements that if translated would yield          fulllength ORF and ORF proteins that did not contain          any missense mutations known to destroy their          retrotransposition potential Table a On average          these fulllength Ls were  identical in their          aminoacid sequences The most divergent protein sequence          in this group was only  different from the L ORFs          None of these fulllength Ls was found on chromosomes            or  whereas the highest concentration  of          the total was found on the X chromosome One of the most          commonly altered codons compared to the L ORF was          codon  VA in  of these Ls In addition codon           VT in ORF differed from the L ORF sequence          for  of these Ls Table b Neither of these codon          changes represents a conservative aminoacid change          however these alternative codons have been documented in          GenBank records for active ORF and ORF proteins pids           and  respectively Moreover the          preponderance of these codons suggests that they are in          fact the consensus ancestral codons from which L has          diverged          Importantly all of these putative          retrotranspositioncompetent Ls lacked a common          nucleotide insertion in the  UTR supporting the          assertion that this is a signature of an older inactive          subfamily   Indeed we found the average percent          identity to the L DNA sequence of the fulllength Ls          containing this insertion to be  whereas those          fulllength Ls lacking this insertion averaged           identity Furthermore of the  fulllength L          elements that lack this insertion   have TSDs          whereas only   of those that have the extra          sequence have recognizable TSDs the reduced frequency of          TSDs further suggests that Ls with the nucleotide          insertion in their  UTR represent an older class of          insertions                          Characteristics of  truncated L elements          The majority of Ls in the human genome are          significantly  truncated   indeed only  of the           intact Ls in our study were fulllength Table           The histogram of start positions of all Ls with TSDs is          shown in Figure  There is a clear dominance of          significantly truncated L elements whose  end lies in          the last  nucleotides of the L reference          sequence Although most L elements are severely           truncated a significant fraction are full length Figure           Of the fulllength elements  have TSDs whereas          only  of all Ls do This may result from imprecision          in the assignment of the  breakpoint We investigated          the L sequence composition at the breakpoint in           truncated Ls by collecting  nucleotides of L sequence          upstream and downstream of the position at which the L          had been truncated we were unable to detect any          consensus nucleotides at these breakpoints data not          shown                          Rearranged Ls          An additional variable of L structure is the presence          of rearranged elements typically these consist of two          L segments of which the  segment is inverted Figure          b Previous reports have estimated that  of all L          insertions in the genome are internally rearranged            We identified a total of   of all  intact Ls          inverted L segment pairs and   of these have          TSDs Like other Ls found in the genome most inverted          elements are also  truncated although we identified           fulllength  inverted Ls          The annotation of the breakpoint between two segments          that make up a  inverted L element is rarely perfect          Figure  Ostertag and Kazazian   suggested that          this imperfection is a consequence of a twinpriming          mechanism by which  inverted elements are formed The          vast majority of the time we found either a small mean            nucleotides overlap or deletion in the L sequence          at the breakpoint location Furthermore a          fivenucleotide microhomology in the contig sequence          occurred nearly  of the time at the junction where the           ends of the two L segments meet Figure           To test whether the inversion breakpoints occur at a          conserved distance from the  or  ends of the L          elements the start and the end positions of the           inverted L segment were compared using a scatterplot          diagram for each inverted L with TSDs Figure a From          this display it is clear that there is no clear site          preference the lengths of  L segments are quite          variable and the inversion point itself can be          positioned almost anywhere within the L although the          density of the breakpoints is significantly higher          towards the  end of the element as expected since          most Ls are  truncated A similar scatterplot diagram          was used to explore any interdependence between the          lengths of the inverted and noninverted segments within          each pair Figure b The distribution of these pairs of          lengths is also quite variable although there may be a          tendency for the  inverted segment to be shorter than          the direct segment To confirm this observation we          calculated the ratios of the  direct segment length to          the  inverted segment length For nearly  of          inverted Ls this ratio was greater than one and the          median ratio for this group was  If all length ratios          were considered the median ratio was  Figure           Next we examined the sequence composition of the          prebreakpoint site This analysis was performed on the          subset of the inverted L segment pairs that exhibited a          flawless breakpoint no deletion insertion or          microhomology Figure  We concatenated the first           nucleotides of the  direct segment with the reverse          complement of the  nucleotides that were most  with          respect to the L sequence in the  inverted segment          This preinversion breakpoint sequence exhibited a slight          tendency for an A  of cases immediately  of the          inversion breakpoint data not shown          We found only two examples of twiceinverted Ls in          the genome The anatomy of these two insertions is shown          in Figure  These elements lacked TSDs and in one case          appear to represent coincidental insertion of two          elements near each other                          Gene neighborhood of L insertions          To investigate the distribution of our set of Ls in          the genome with respect to genes we identified the start          and end points of coding sequence CDS and mRNA          annotations defined in the header of each NCBI contig          record Next the position of each L on the same contig          was compared with the coordinates of the gene          annotations We found that Ls have inserted within a          genomic segment to which an mRNA andor CDS has been          mapped approximately  and  of the time          respectively Table  The mean length of these Ls was          around  nucleotides similar to the nucleotide          mean length of our entire TSDcontaining set of Ls Of          the Ls found within an annotated gene segment  were          oriented in the opposite direction to the transcription          of the gene This modest majority may reflect a weak          selection against Ls in the same orientation such          insertions could result in premature truncation of a          genes mRNA due to the L polyadenylation signal              When we analyzed the groups of structural          variants of L separately Figure b we observed little          difference among them in their distribution in genes          data not shown          We found that  mRNAs approximately  of all          genes have Ls in their introns or UTRs Table  The          average genomic extent of these genes approximately           kb is five times longer than the  kb genomewide          average   The average GC composition of these genes          is  which is similar to the  average GC content          of genes in the genome   For Ls that did not insert          within the genomic boundaries of a gene the closest          annotated mRNA or CDS was on average  kb upstream or          downstream No trend in L orientation with respect to          gene orientation was evident for these Ls Table           To obtain a more global view of relatively recent L          insertions and gene location we plotted the distribution          of Ls with TSDs and the annotated genes in each  kb          bin along the length of select chromosomes Figure           Alongside this distribution we show the estimated          boundaries for the cytogenetic bands on the chromosomes          allowing us to explore whether L density is associated          with a particular cytogenetic band It is clear from          Figure that Ls are neither concentrated in nor excluded          from any particular cytogenetic band In fact the          proportions of the entire genome defined by each type of          cytogenetic band are equivalent to the proportions with          which Ls are found in each type of cytogenetic band          data not shown          Although Figure shows that Ls and genes are          generally intermixed there are regions at which one or          the other predominates as reported previously   see          peaks with stars in Figure  We analyzed chromosomal          regions  kb bins for which the difference between L          number and gene number was maximal yet the proportion of          sequence in the region occupied by genes was less than           Such regions include the class III major          histocompatibility complex and histone gene clusters on          chromosome  the human alphaglobin gene cluster located          on chromosome  and others Our analysis of these          regions of the genome revealed an enrichment in SINES          approximately  of the sequence bin versus  overall          in the genome and GC content approximately  two          common properties associated with generich Lpoor          regions of the genome            Interestingly one of the Lpoorgenerich regions          identified is on the X chromosome Figure  This          particular locus Xq encompasses genes that are          believed to be subject to X inactivation These genes          include those for glucosephosphate dehydrogenase          XAP reninbinding protein           N acetyltransferase homolog of           Saccharomyces cerevisiae ARD           signal sequence receptordelta isocitrate dehydrogenase           NAD  gamma biglycan tafazzin deoxyribonuclease          Ilike  and emerin   The paucity of Ls identified          at this locus suggests that Ls are not critical for the          propagation of the X inactivation signal along the length          of the X chromosome as has been proposed            Furthermore the concentration of Ls with TSDs on the p          arm of the X chromosome is lower than that on the q arm          Figure  Lahn and Page   have hypothesized that          the distal p arm is the site of the youngest evolutionary          strata on the X chromosome indicating that the X and Y          chromosomes actively recombined at this location most          recently Therefore as proposed by Boissinot           et al   it is possible that          recombination prevented the accumulation of Ls at this          chromosomal region                            Discussion        To gain insight into the mechanisms by which L        structural variants are created and to identify trends        associated with their insertion we carried out a        comprehensive analysis of the L sequences and their        surrounding DNA loci To facilitate this study we wrote        the software TSDfinder which identifies the TSDs polyA        tails and inversion breakpoints if any associated with        Ls We found no correlation between the length and quality        of either the TSDs or the polyA tails and the resulting        anatomy of the L element Thus the polyA tail quality        probably does not influence the formation of  inverted        elements Furthermore this suggests that the specificity        of the initial step of the retrotransposition is conserved        in all classes of elements It is important to consider        however that any hallmark sequence structures uniquely        associated with the insertion of structural variants may be        refractory to analysis after millions of years of        evolution For example Ovchinnikov         et al reported that the polyA        tails of Ls may become shorter over time          Our analysis of the preinsertion loci of Ls with TSDs        confirms that the top strand consensus site of L        endonuclease is TTAAAA This result is completely        consistent with previous studies of the L endonuclease        targeting preference         in vitro and as inferred from the        TSDs of         Alu elements which are thought to        hijack the L machinery for their insertion     We        also observed this pattern albeit not as robust at the         end of the preinsertion locus suggesting that L        endonuclease may also be responsible for the secondstrand        cleavage of host DNA during L insertion There is evidence        that the related sequencespecific R element endonuclease        makes both cuts in the target DNA          The frequency with which Ls were found in highcopy        repeats indicates that insertion into preexisting Ls and         Alu sequences may be somewhat        disfavored Apart from this the observed frequencies are        roughly similar to those with which these same sequence        classifications occur in the human genome   therefore        other than a preference for ATrich DNA L insertion at a        particular genomic locus may be influenced more by local        chromatin structure than by specific longrange sequence        composition of the DNA On the other hand Ovchinnikov         et al   found that very recently        inserted polymorphic Ls were randomly distributed and        their distribution shifted over time Thus the current        flanking sequences of Ls may be an inaccurate reflection        of the target DNA of any given L at the time of        insertion        In our analysis of  inverted Ls we failed to reveal        any similarity of the breakpoint at the junction between        the two fragments with the L endonuclease consensus        cleavage site This suggests that L endonuclease does not        participate in  inversion formation by cleaving L cDNA        Instead our findings support the recently proposed        twinpriming model for inversion   as we showed above        the  end topstrand cleavage product has a modest bias to        be a T nucleotide Figure b and we indeed see a modest        preference for a complementary A nucleotide at the        corresponding position of the inversion breakpoint data        not shown On the other hand whereas Ostertag and        Kazazian   report that the inversion points are        clustered towards the  end of inverted Ls we found no        clear bias in the position of the breakpoint position in        our set of  inverted Ls This discrepancy may be due to        their small sample size of inverted elements the majority        of which were less than  nucleotides long Another        discrepancy between our datasets is their observation that        the length of the noninverted L segment is shorter than        the inverted segment In contrast we found the  segment        of  inverted Ls to be generally longer than the         segment        As inverted elements are found  of the time in         intact elements  twiceinverted elements were predicted        to occur if such events are permitted that is  of  of        the time if the two inversions can occur independently more        than once during the same retrotransposition event This        provides a powerful independent test of the twinpriming        model which cannot explain multiply inverted elements The        fact that we only found two such events suggests that        whereas single inversions are a simple perversion of the        normal retrotransposition process such as twin priming        doubly inverted elements require some other extremely rare        event to occur        We found that compared to the other L structural        variants a smaller proportion of  transduction Ls have        a patterned polyA tail This is consistent with the        polyA tails of  transduction events being formed mostly        through the action of polyA polymerase On the other        hand the presence of Ls with patterned tails is        consistent with the results of Chaboissier         et al   who found that elements        with patterned tails could be converted to elements with        heritable polyA tails We propose that L elements also        exist as two populations and that Ls with patterned tails        beget other elements with patterned tails These data        suggest that polyadenylation of L transcripts by polyA        polymerase may not be obligatory in the formation of        standard L insertions Alternatively it has been reported        that the polyA tails of retrotransposons may be a source        for the creation of microsatellites through        postinsertional mutations    the patterned tails        we found may therefore exemplify this transition from        polyA tail to microsatellites        It has been suggested that the high concentration of Ls        on the X chromosome may have a role in X inactivation of        select genes   This hypothesis seems unlikely as we        see the same elevated density of Ls on the Y chromosome        Boissinot         et al   have hypothesized that        the high frequency of fulllength L elements on the Y        chromosome may be due to the inability of the Y chromosome        to recombine which is a process by which potentially        harmful fulllength Ls are eliminated from the genome        Furthermore we found that a region of the X chromosome at        which many Xinactivated genes are located is quite        Lpoor a finding that is contrary to a direct role for        Ls in X inactivation        Implementation of TSDfinder on a genomewide scale has        provided new insights to a variety of hypotheses about L        insertion and evolution Finally analysis of inverted        elements by TSDfinder provides strong independent support        for the twinpriming model                    Materials and methods                  Dataset          The dataset of human genomic DNA sequence records used          was the set of contigs assembled at NCBI   as of           August  build  This set of sequences should be          nonoverlapping eliminating the problem of multiple          sampling of the same L elements The dataset consisted          of  human contigs amounting to  gigabases Gb          of nonredundant genomic sequence and corresponding to          approximately  of the human euchromatic genome Table           The contigs are a mixture of finished and draft          sequence                          Identification of Ls and TSDs          L elements in the contigs were annotated using          RepeatMasker version of  April    using          default settings with a custom library containing only          the L element GenBank accession number L          lacking the nucleotide polyA tail and therefore          ending with the first three nucleotides AAT of the          putative polyadenylation signal Within this L          sequence we also included the variably present           nucleotides in the  UTR of Ls at the appropriate          position   Even though the custom library was          limited to the L element we expected most young L          elements to be collected by using this single consensus          sequence          In the TSDfinder program   written in Perl            L coordinates were parsed from the RepeatMasker results          in the out file Only Ls intact at the  end          RepeatMasker annotation ends   nucleotides from          the  end were considered in the TSDfinding analysis          Ls that were fragmented in the RepeatMasker annotation          because of the absence of the variably present           nucleotides in the  UTR were merged Annotated L          segments were also merged if intervening insertions were            nucleotides long and deletions of the standard L          sequence were   nucleotides By merging adjacent L          fragments in this way the actual L element was likely          to be recreated and positioned the insertion ends with          maximal precision This step was important for maximizing          the yield of correct TSDs without this merging we found          nearly  fewer TSDs          Candidate polyA tails were identified in the  kb          downstream of the  UTR and the polyA tail startend          coordinates were recorded Stretches of sequence that          qualified as polyA tail candidates had a minimum length          of  nucleotides and at least  As These criteria          were previously defined by analyzing the DNA sequences          that extended from the end of the  UTR to the start of          the  TSD in a random sampling of  Ls from the genome          that were collected on the basis of having          highconfidence TSDs   nucleotides long In          addition tails containing more than two adjacent nonA          bases were disallowed These criteria were relaxed if          patterned repeats were detected in a polyA sequence          tract for example AAAT          For each element found by RepeatMasker following the          merge step  nucleotides of upstream sequence and           kb of sequence downstream from the L boundaries were          collected The longer region downstream is used to detect           transduction events The first and the last           nucleotides of the L itself are also included in the TSD          search to allow for some L boundary imprecision TSDs          were identified using blseq parameters g F W  F F          S  d  e     TSDs were required to          be at least nine nucleotides long The algorithm for TSD          signature recognition allows for detection of both          standard insertion events in which the  TSD          immediately follows the polyA tract associated with the          retrotransposon and possible  transduction events in          which the  TSD follows a polyA tail further          downstream from the retrotransposon  end                          TSD scoring scheme          The highscoring pairs HSPs identified by blseq          were scored heuristically by considering three factors          the HSP position in the  flank of the L the HSP          position in the  flank of the L and HSP quality          score If the  HSP ends within  nucleotides from the          L start the  HSP position score is  If the  HSP          ends further away from L start the score function is          described by the formula P  FF  where FF is          the length of the L flanking sequence used for TSD          finding  nucleotides is default and P is the  HSP          end position within this flank The  HSP position score          was created to give a higher weight to a standard          insertion as opposed to a  transduction event in case          both signatures are present for a given L element The           HSP position score of  is given if the  HSP starts          within  nucleotides of the annotated L end The last          scoring function HSP quality score assigns a score of           for HSPs  nucleotides long without mismatches          and  for all other HSPs with an acceptable number of          mismatches no mismatches allowed for HSPs            nucleotides one mismatch allowed for HSPs up to           nucleotides one mismatch per  nucleotides allowed for          HSPs   nucleotides The final TSD score is the sum          of the scores described above In cases where multiple          TSDs were identified TSDs with the best score and with a          candidate polyA tail immediately preceding the  HSP          were defined as the TSD for a particular L insertion          When a microhomology existed between the polyA tail and          the TSD the microhomologous region was arbitrarily          considered part of the TSD by TSDfinder Figure c          As           in vivo studies of L insertions          have shown that the average length of TSDs is          approximately  nucleotides our scoring function          reflected this by giving a higher weight to exact matches          of lengths  nucleotides To exclude the possibility          that the abundance of the nucleotide long TSDs in          our collection is exclusively a result of this aspect of          the scoring scheme TSDfinder analysis of this dataset          was repeated without rewarding a higher value to TSDs of          length   nucleotides and the distribution of TSD          lengths remained generally unchanged          Monte Carlo simulation of TSD nucleotide composition          was carried out using an array of  nucleotides with          the same composition as the human genome  GC  AT            to generate  nucleotide random sequences          Note for comparison that there were           nucleotidelong TSDs without mismatches found in the          genome                          Preinsertion loci          The preinsertion locus of each L was recreated by          collecting  nucleotides upstream and downstream from          the  and  TSDs respectively and appending them to          the TSD sequence This sequence was used to analyze the          nucleotide neighborhood of each L insertion for which          the TSD score was   These sequences were input to          RepeatMasker software for determining the frequency with          which Ls had inserted into preexisting highcopy          repeats To perform this analysis the out file was          parsed In determining whether an L had inserted into a          highcopy sequence the repeat must be equal to or          greater than  identical to a reference repeat and it          must extend across the fused TSDflank sequence for           nucleotides in either direction unless the repeat starts          or ends elsewhere in the preinsertion locus          DNA sequence logos   of TSDs were generated using          binary code downloaded from the site   Only TSDs          that did not have mismatches were used to generate logos          Ten nucleotides upstream and downstream of the TSDs were          included in the logos                          Genome distribution and features of L insertion          sites          To determine the gene neighborhood of each L the          header for each chromosomal contig GenBank flatfile the          gbs files are available in the individual chromosome          files at   was collected and scanned for mRNA or CDS          annotations The name and the absolute start and end          positions of each annotation were recorded The location          of each L within that particular contig was compared          with the locations of the mRNA and CDS annotations Ls          were recorded as either falling entirely within the          boundaries of a gene annotation or the distances to the          closest upstream and downstream gene annotations were          calculated Such statistics for certain Ls could not be          determined because some contigs with Ls include no          annotated CDS or mRNAs The same approach was used to          generate the mRNA and CDS densities along the length of          each chromosome if multiple mildly variable annotations          were assigned to the same gene name the first annotation          listed in the GenBank flatfile header was used as the          definitive location          The cytogenetic banding pattern associated with each          L was determined from the information included in the          seqcontigmd and ISCN files   These same files          were used to generate the cytogenetic figure if the          orientation of a contig was unknown it was arbitrarily          considered to be positive                          Fulllength L analysis          All L sequences for which there was no more than a          nucleotide deletion at the  end and no more than a          nucleotide deletion at the  end were collected The          BLASTX program   was used to translate these L DNA          sequences in all three reading frames and compare them to          the ORF and ORF amino acid sequences of L We          analyzed the highestscoring translation for each L          sequence for the extent of the protein alignment          nonsense mutations and missense mutations that would          likely eliminate protein function In the ORF protein          residues critical for retrotransposition include the          following conserved blocks of amino acids REKG           ARR residues  and YPAKLS             For ORF key residues for endonuclease activity          include the residues at positions N E Y          D N T D and SDH            In addition mutations at the catalytic FADD box in the          reverse transcriptase domain codons  a          cysteinerich region    and the invariant          HC at  and the conserved blocks of amino acids          HMKK and  result in reduced L          transposition activity   Finally residues G          and D in the conserved Z motif in ORF are required          for reverse transcriptase activity
