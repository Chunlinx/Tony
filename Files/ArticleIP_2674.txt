                                 The Human Cost of Crippling Castro            A joke making therounds in Cuba                           QWhat are the three greatest accomplishments of Fidels revolution                           AHealth education and sports                           QWhat are the three greatest failures of Fidels revolution                           A Breakfastlunch and dinner            On a recent trip to Cuba Iwalked through Havanas crumbling neighborhoods to the Hospital NacionalHermanos Ameijeiras I found myself in a modern lobby with the size and feel ofa new airport terminal and with my feeble Spanish talked my way into meetingsome fellow surgeons I asked them to show me around I was interested I saidin what they could do But what I really wanted to see was what they couldntdoand why            For years the United States has resolutely tightened the screws on trade with Cubain an effort to topple Castros regime However in the weeks since the popespoke in Havana against the US embargo the pressure seems to have lessenedNot long after the papal visit Clinton allowed humanitarian flights and thesending of money to Cuban relatives Congressional legislation to end bans onthe sale of food and medical supplies is gathering bipartisan support and aSenate vote is expected this spring Embargo defenders however say the harmis more rhetorical than real Cuba can get supplies elsewhere they argue andtrading with a dictator is immoral Here I had a chance to see the effects formyself            The hospital one of Havanas best wasimpressive It has  beds and  specialties and offers the services of a topUS hospital Its surgeons perform microsurgery neurosurgery and organtransplants And ordinary Cubans seem to have no trouble getting access to thiscare Later on my trip for example I met a woman who had no specialconnections but had been sent here after she developed frightening stomachpains One gets a sense of the priorities in Cuba A teacher who couldnt putmeat on her table what little she finds she gives to her son was able toobtain a full medical workup including endoscopy and biopsy of her stomach Aparasite from the drinking water had invaded her stomach lining            Stillfor all the resources Castro provides the system founders from an unreliablesupply of materials Dr Nilo Rodriguez a cardiac surgeon told me We can doany kind of surgery but not always            Rodriguez appeared to be in his s His officewas spacious but his bookshelf was bare except for a single textbookAmerican a few patient files and some knickknacks Like the other doctors Imet he was quick to brag about his hightech accomplishments He described theheart transplants and complicated valve replacements he performed But Iwondered how he a surgeon could spend an hour meeting with me at the spur ofthe moment He admitted that for all he was capable of doing he operated ononly five patients per week            Was theproblem getting time in busy operating rooms No Rooms were free as we spokeWas it a lack of patients He laughed and said that he had over a hundredpatients with failing hearts in the hospital awaiting surgery The problem wasthe constant struggle for supplies Yes they were costly but that wasnt thebiggest issue Even if Cubans lacked for meat Rodriguez would have money forventilators and heart valves The problem he said was the embargo            Cardiac surgery like every surgery is aseries of interlocking steps each requiring specialized materials You needanesthetic agents IV tubing blades for the bone saw and so on Every weekRodriguez must halt surgery because he cant get one or another materialthrough the embargo Among the sickest patients waiting were some  who needednew heart valves He had been able to get some Chinesemade replacement valvesThey are not that reliable he told me but they get the job done Sometimes hecan get American valves sold illegally through third parties at inflatedprices Your CarboMedics valve he said his eyes shining is beautifulThat week however he didnt have the suture he needed to sew in the valvesAnd a lack of perfusion fluid to prime the heart bypass machine had held up allhis operations            Rodriguez was reluctant to admit anyone would die waiting We are strongpeople he told me But maybe sometimes it happens            Once home I learned the United States cuts offsupplies in two ways First sale of goods with USmade or patentedpartswhich include most new drugs and medical devicesis embargoed under theTrading With the Enemy Act As US companies merge with foreign competitorsthe ban covers more and more For example according to the WashingtonPost  US acquisitions removed Cubas suppliers for pacemakers and severalchemotherapy agents Companies can seek a permit for medical sales but hardlyany have because of the unmanageable requirements            Secondthe  Torricelli Act cut European supplies by prohibiting ships that dock inCuba from entering US ports for six months Few shippers are willing to loseaccess to the worlds largest market for the sake of this tiny country The actalso outlawed food sales to Cuba Only Libya faces a similar ban Iraq andNorth Korea can at least barter for food            Its disingenuous to argue that the embargodoesnt actually hurt many people After all the point of the evertighterprovisions is to cut off goodsincluding food and medicine But imposingsuffering can be justified if it averts greater suffering or serves a largergood And the embargo once served worthwhile purposesforcing the Soviet Unionto spend resources propping up Castro and denying Cuba resources to fomentrevolution elsewhere Now however Cuba poses no threat to anyone            Its conceivable we couldjustify continuing to cause pain and death if the embargo fueled enoughdiscontent to cause Castros overthrow But it shows no sign of doing so Therelationship between political freedom and economic conditions seems far morecomplicated than advocates of free trade or the embargo seem willing to admitI doubt that either policy can bring Castro down Meanwhile the embargocontinues to exact its human costs            The names of patientswaiting for surgery at Rodriguezs hospital are kept on a computerized listThe sickest patients are at the top When supplies are obtained they getsurgery first On a walk through the hospital Rodriguez was unwilling to takeme to the intensive care unit to see these patients He claimed he was toobusy and by the end of our conversation he had grown reticent At one pointhe admitted that he feared he had said too much that I could use theinformation to write antiCuban propaganda He steered me to a young woman witha new valve and a vigorous man recovering from a heart transplant We finishedwalking the wards and shook hands as medical colleagues Then we parted waysthe list of the sick scrolling through my head
