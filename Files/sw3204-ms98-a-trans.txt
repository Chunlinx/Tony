              what is it about nursing homes   um well about nursing homes and and older people uh my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother   yeah umhum   and theyre just really close here and his mother has bad health too and so i go over sometimes in the day when hes at work and i um help with her and bathe her and feed her   right   and um and i i its hard to be a caretaker i really believe its really difficult to be a caretaker twenty four hours a day   oh its very difficult i know   uh it she has Alzheimers and does not remember uh a lot if anything and so she asks the same questions over and over again   umhum umhum   which is not unrealistic you know unrealistic um and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question   right yeam   uh i i some nights his mother calls me and says can your family and just bring the kids in the family and just come over and and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented   yeah how old is she   shes ninety two   uh my see my father is ninety two and still uh he and mother still live at the house and drive and   oh well i think thats wonderful   and do the whole thing but you know if something would uh whenever something happens to one of them then i dont know what ill do up there i i just know that too many horror stories about nursing homes and so   well umhum yeah i was just gonna say   theyre in Missouri and i could i i know i know stories for sure that they just they they just well they cant take the proper care of them most of them   yeah um   and uh its its tragic that you know when people live so long that they uh dont have a place really dont have a place to go   yes uh i think its wonderful these these places that arent nursing homes necessarily but they can and reside there like little apartment places in between places   so right   and i like that idea if they can handle it themselves um   yeah theres one very close to where my parents are but uh i think it would be nice but my dads the type he wouldnt wanna spend the money on anything so uh i mean hes from that old depression era and uh you know its oh its just blissful that theyre both able to do everything for themselves   yeah yeah yeah   i would imagine that ill uh if something happens ill move one of them or both you know in in with me   umhum   so uh but i know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is and but i think youd have to really they also wanted us to talk about youd have to really check on the uh   yeah nursing homes   on this this homes but i just dont know how much you can see when you go for a i think you just have to drop in all uh unexpectedly a lot   visit uhhuh   and so many people when they put people in a nurses home they never see them   they dont go and see them thats right thats right   they never go to see them ive talked to many uh owners of places and say that nobody even maybe maybe Christmas   you know um i i think nursing homes are our um some are good i have to say that but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children   umhum right oh i do too   um   or if  if they could be real real nearby where they could see them everyday or so   right right   uh because i know Governor Richards is really upset about what shes finding in the nursing homes homes uh regulation in Texas so maybe well get it improved   umhum i hope so you know its i think its very difficult in the first place to make that choice   so  anyway right   to have them go there and then if you find out that they are not having good care you know im sure that it is just you know youd pull them out of there so fast   oh its tough im sure oh right itd be devastating im sure so   and uh and yet if you didnt feel like you could be a good caretaker i dont  its a very very hard decision i think   it is a tough decision and its one that needs a great deal of thought and prior probably   umhum i think thats right and especially if youre not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment   yeah right   now i know a friend of mine who had a father um she brought to her home um to live there but he needed the medical treatment and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to to help him out   umhum   and that might be a partial solution or something but um   right   i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think id ever   i would hope we could do that and then go from there   yeah   well anyway   well  i i think we kind of are along the same lines   weve covered a little bit and uh its good to hear from you and   good to hear from you have a lovely day   have a good have a good life
