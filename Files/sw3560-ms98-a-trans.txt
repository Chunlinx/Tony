        well lets go ahead and start with you what kind of kind of pets did you have     okay well yeah when i was growing up uh we had dogs all the time so i always had at least two dogs i think at the most we had three and uh then when i met my my wife she was more of a cat person and she kind of more or less got me converted over to cats   uh oh   and that was the last pets that we had um but uh we we went ahead and gave them away to uh another family you know i put an ad out and had them had them take over the pets   umhum   uh because we had uh we started our family and and you know the cats shed a lot and plus they were kind of rough for the babies playing with them and stuff so   right umhum   we decided to not have any pets for awhile   well cool uh when i was growing up we had a dog one dog and   umhum   it had a disease and we had to put it to sleep and that was traumatic and that was traumatic enough for our family for the time being and   oh no        they have another one right now at home but im not there so thats kind of a bummer but   yeah yeah well were thinking of maybe as a matter of fact my wife was was telling me that uh when she was out Christmas shopping ah they had a display for one of these pet stores and they had a a cat a cat there and turned out to be ah an older cat about two years old   uhhuh   and uh it was really good with the boys ive ive got two boys   uhhuh   four years old and two years old and she said it was real good with them and uh real real tame cat and she was asking me you know when do you think we should go back and get it now or should we wait a little bit longer and  and i told her well i think we should probably wait         but i you know shes shes gonna want uh get least another cat uh but i think id like to go ahead and get get them a dog   uhhuh cool yeah i kind of like dogs myself i think theyre just fun to have around fun to play with   i think you know i really do think that a dog is more of a a childrens pet and a cats more of an adults pet   uhhuh    yeah i tend to agree with that   because uh i know i i when i was younger and uh growing up with dogs i didnt like cats at all i didnt want anything at all to do with them     uhhuh   because you know they just dont respond to you the way dogs do and you know that and i you know i feel that thats something that  that a kid looks forward to   oh absolutely   you know you tell a dog to do something and it does it or you throw a ball and he chases it that kind of thing and hell  hell play with you but a cat   uhhuh umhum   pretty much just keeps to himself and you know you know how cats are   right  well i kind of tend to agree i think especially dogs i really when we had ours i enjoyed it just because like you say you know you could throw things at it and hed go chase it and     umhum umhum   that whenever  there was you know any sense of of urgency or any sense of problems with any of my friends or anybody around our family he would just jump up there and protect us you know he was a small dog and it was just it was good to know that there was always somebody there or something there to to take care of you   umhum yeah i i agree i agree i know that uh you know your yard is always a safe haven and and then if you have got a dog back there  then youre really protected because they theyll theyll stand up for you   yeah exactly yeah   and thats the i i guess i kind of miss that you know my dad uh   yeah   well our our the pets that i grew up with all either ran away or died a long time ago and my dad just recently got another dog and it ran away   umhum oh no   but it was a real small dog and hes thinking of getting another one i dont know if he will or not but he wants to get another dog my mom   uhhuh   mom can go either way   umhum   she doesnt really care too much  as long as its clean     yeah well thats a big thing too at our house it was we couldnt let it in the house but the thing that i think my parents used it most for was to teach us responsibility   umhum   you know it was our dog and we had to take care of it and if we didnt there was you know definite   yeah yeah   definite   yeah i agree   repercussion   i think probably id be happier happier with just a ordinary mutt you know you get a dog thats uh show quality and you know you got to be real careful with it and   yeah yep i agree i think i think a lot of times the mutts the best dogs anyway just because theyre you know they really dont you know you care enough about them to to take care of them but not so much that youre worried about what you do with them   umhum yeah yeah   where as if youre paying millions of dollars for it i think youd be a little more concerned   yeah that that you know i dont wanna get into a thing where you take him to shows and and you know all these papers and stuff and you got to be careful and all this and that   uhhuh   you know not that you wouldnt take care of it any less but that just something you know i dont want my boys to have to to get into that kind of thing   yeah yeah well i agree i think its its a lot more fun when you dont have to worry about the cost of what you spent on it as much as just having it as a friend and       sure basically a companion and thats it   yeah exactly and thats you know it was really weird because although we fought a lot about it you know and who was gonna take care of it when we had it we really all missed it when it was gone     umhum umhum   and so   i reckon i can agree with that well it was nice talking to y ou   hey its been my pleasure you have a great afternoon   all right you too take care byebye   thanks byebye
