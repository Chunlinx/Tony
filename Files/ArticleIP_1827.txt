                                 Bertie Woosters Party Tricks            Anyone whom Jesse Helmsbrands as his enemy is instantly sympathetic Helms says he will use his powersas chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to derail William Weldsnomination to become ambassador to Mexico because Weld supports thedecriminalization of marijuana for medical use But unlike other Clintonnominees who have given up when Helms opposed them Weld has girded for battleEarlier this week he resigned his position as governor of Massachusetts tocombat Helms ideological extortion full time            Weldwants his fight with Helms to be a battle over the soul of the RepublicanParty And where does Bill Weld think the soul of the Republican party shouldlie He declares himself a philosophical libertarian who discovered Hayek inlaw school But his alleged libertarianism is inconsistent and may be no morethan a convenient fancy formulation for the combination of policiesfiscallyconservative socially liberalneeded to get elected as a Republican in aDemocratic state Weld certainly did not advertise himself as a libertarianwhen he worked for the Reagan administration running the Criminal Division ofthe Justice Department            Welds popular appeal is based less on the perception thathes a libertarian than the perception hes that even rarer animal a moderateRepublican With the crusty rural reactionary Helms as a foil Weld seems amoderate cosmopolitan thinking man above petty politics He is even willingto accept a job in a Democratic administration But Welds moderation hisindependent spirit like his libertarianism may actually reflect two lessadmirable qualities first a Clintonesque political slipperiness and seconda lack of seriousness Hes a flake            Hes aflake because hes an aristocrat And he brilliantly fuses these twopolitically disadvantageous conditions into a political plus Weld comes fromwealthy pure WASP stock and married a great granddaughter of TheodoreRoosevelt Far from playing this down he revels in Brahmin shtick incessantlygabbing with reporters about his prepschool days publicly proclaiming thesacrosanctity of his twiceweekly squash games and cracking jokes like TheWelds arrived in  with only the shirts on their backs and  pounds ofgold            More successfully than Ross Perot or SteveForbes Welds demeanor plays on the ancient myth of the Cincinnatusthenotion that a man of wealth makes the best statesman because he will never betempted to act in his own selfinterest and will work solely for the commongood Unlike Forbes and Perot Weld never seems to be straining to garner thepublics approval An obsequious  New York Times Magazine profileput it this way In the Governors office Weld has restored a tradition ofaristocratic Yankee lordship he has made governing look easy and WASPascendancy seem an expression of natural law if not of divine right He candrink a martini while balancing a budget            But allis not aristocratic ease and devilmaycare frankness Weld came to nationalprominence in  when he resigned as head of the Justice DepartmentsCriminal Division allegedly in protest over Attorney General Edwin Meesesinterference in the investigation of Meeses friend E Robert Wallach accusedof using his company Wedtech to abuse government contracts Weld later concededthat he had planned months before to leave the Justice Department He didntmention this when he struck his headlinegrabbing stance            And then theres his claim that as governor he restored thehealth of the Massachusetts economy Remember back to Michael Dukakis presidential run Midcampaign the states economy which Dukakis wasreferring to as the Massachusetts miracle sank creating a huge governmentbudget deficit and threatening the states financial solvency To stave offcollapse during his last two years in office Dukakis stewarded over  billionin tax increases through the state legislature            When Weldcampaigned for governor in  against Boston University President JohnSilber he vociferously supported a ballot measure that would have reversed theDukakis tax increases Silber argued correctly that repealing the taxincreases would ruin the states bond rating and result in irresponsibly largesocialspending cuts Silber was too persuasive for his own good As it becameclear that the disastrous tax cut would not pass the liberals of CambridgeNewton and Bostondisliking Silber for his cranky hardline views on socialissuesfelt it was safe to vote for Weld The Republican won by less than percent            Welds combination of positions on issues playsto the great weakness in todays liberalism its obsession with social issuesand relative indifference to economics Because Weld is progay prochoiceand proaffirmative action liberals overlooked his strident economicconservatism As promised in the campaign he slashed social spending andwelfare rolls However taxes remain at nearly the same levels as when heentered office and government spending has increased more than  percentduring his sixyear tenure If he had got his way about repealing the Dukakistax increases he and his state would be up shit creek He has the unpopularstands taken by Michael Dukakis and John Silber to thank for creating theconditions for solid growth that have buoyed his popularity            The poseof the postpartisan suits Weld because he can change his positions on a dimeThree years into his term he dropped his strident opposition to gun controlwhen the position began hurting his poll numbers Though he describes himselfas being to the right of Attila the Hun on crime he authorized the WillieHortenesque early parole of more than  sex offenders in  Despite twicecampaigning actively against Bill Clinton he has begged for a post in hisadministration            Welds capriciousness is key to his success Even when itwould seem blatantly selfserving his unpredictability jibes with the publicsexpectation that his personal wealth will allow him to do whatever he thinks isright His whimsy can be downright charming During a signing ceremony for abill he dove headfirst fully clothed into the Charles River And he once sentpictures to reporters of himself with a giant boar he claims to have hunteddownthough it turned out to be in captivity            His decision to resign andrun for the ambassadorship few expect him to win should be treated like theseother nutty episodes Even reporters who describe the move as quixotic expressadmiration for his audacity He has already demonstrated his acumen at milkingthe confrontation with Helms for its maximum theatrical and political valueAnd since he clearly has further political ambitionshe has talked aboutbecoming attorney general or secretary of state and no doubt thinks of evenhigher officethe spotlight will serve him well He can indulge in theselfserving grandstanding and selfeffacing silliness that only William Weldcould possibly pull off
