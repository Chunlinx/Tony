                                 Why the Tube Aint the Movies                        David            Just caught up with your postscript In the discussion of video projectionvs film you ask What is the distinction is between hypnosis and reverieThat sounds like mystical poetry I first got turned on o this in JerryManders book Four Arguments for the Abolition of Television  Tosimplify he suggests that TV actually does hypnotize its viewers while filmcreates more of a dream state That is one reason so many of us get restlesswhen a film runs for more than two hours yet are perfectly capable of watchingthe TV for five hours at a stretch We can only take so much dreamingperhaps            My own feeling is that when a film is really working it takes me to amental state that nothing on television has ever approached Nor have I everfelt even on the very best video projection systems the film experience I amproud of my hometheater setup A superb Runco quadrupling projector DVD assource THX surround footwide screen etc But film it aint            Digital projection of course is not to be confused with projectedtelevision It does not scan the screen but organizes the material into digitalframes Whether these frames do the same thing as frames of film is doubtfulbut Hollywood has certainly not spent one dime to find out One wistfullypictures the lab technicians of the Academy of Arts and Sciences with theirbeakers and flasks            As for subjective comparisons between projected video and projected film Ihave here an email from a man who asks not to be quoted by his name which youwould recognize and respect who points out            Theyre digitally projecting at k  but also comparing against film atk so that both film and digital are of equal resolution And both are half ofthe normal film resolution of k I would love to see them put up somethingdigital against a film image by Freddie Young even derived from an oldergrainier film stock In short as I see it the test of digital vs film isrigged to make digital look good            What we have here is a company TI with unlimited resources that wants totake film away from us and replace it with their system And the film communityis so technically uninterested and illiterate that there is no outcry I myselffeel keenly inadequate on this subject I am not technically trained But I gotinto this issue and the more I find out about it the more disturbed Igrow            BestRoger
