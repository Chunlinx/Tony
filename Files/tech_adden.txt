TECHNICAL ADDENDUM METHODOLOGIES FOR THE BENEFIT ANALYSIS OFTHE CLEAR SKIES INITIATIVESeptember I INTRODUCTIONBackgroundThe Need for Multipollutant LegislationIn the United States power generation is responsible for  ofsulfur dioxide SO  of nitrogen oxides NOx and  ofmanmade mercury released to the environment Once released thesepollutants together with their atmospheric transformation productseg ozone and fine particles can travel long distances beforebeing deposited Environmental and public health problems resultingfrom power generation emissions includeCardiovascular and respiratory conditions associated withexposure to fine particles PM and ozoneVisibility impairment associated with regionalhazeAcidification of surface waters and forestecosystemsEcosystem and public health effects associated with theaccumulation of mercury in fish and other wildlifeAcidic damage to cultural monuments and othermaterialsOzone damage to forested ecosystems andEutrophication in coastal areasWhile the current Clean Air Act has played a role insignificantly improving some of these issues additional reductionsin the emissions of SO NOx and mercury are necessary to addresspersistent public health and environmental problems Because of theregional and global scale of these pollutants individual states orlocalities experiencing the environmental effects cannot alwayscontrol them In addition current law tends to address eachenvironmental problem independently even if one pollutantcontributes to several problems To more effectively address theenvironmental problems caused by power generation there is a needfor a national program that would take advantage of synergies ofcontrolling multiple pollutants at onceThe Clear Skies ActOn February   the President announced the Clear SkiesInitiative a proposal to reduce emissions from electric powergenerating sources The proposal was embodied in legislative formas the Clear Skies Act which was introduced in the House ofRepresentatives as HR and in the Senate as S in July For the purpose of the analyses presented here the centralfeatures examined in the Initiative are identical to thosecontained in the ActThe Clear Skies Act would reduce emissions of sulfur dioxideSO nitrogen oxides NOx and mercury from fossil fuelfiredcombustion units by approximately  from current levels Thesemandatory emission reductions would be achieved through a cap andtrade The Clear Skies Act would cut sulfur dioxide SO emissionsby  percent from current emissions of  million tons to caps of million tons in  and  million tons in  It would cutemissions of nitrogen oxides NOx by  percent from currentemissions of  million tonsprogram modeled on the current Acid Rain Program for SOFederally enforceable emissions limits or national caps for eachpollutant would be established Sources would be allowed totransfer these authorized emission limits among themselves toachieve the required reductions for all three pollutants at thelowest overall cost This proposal would alleviate many of theremaining environmental and health problems associated with powergenerationThis document reports the methods and results of an analysis ofthe environmental and health benefits of the Clear Skies Act Itpresents quantitative estimates of the health improvements andmonetary benefits that would be achieved by this proposalSummary of the Benefits Analysis Methods and ResultsThe Clear Skies Act would provide significant benefits to publichealth and the environment whether expressed as health andenvironmental improvements or as monetized benefits These includeprolonging thousands of lives and reducing tens of thousands tomillions of cases in other indicators of adverse health effectssuch as work loss days restricted activity days and days withasthma attacks Environmental benefits include significantincreases in visibility and substantial improvements in chronicallyacidic conditions in lakes in the Northeastern US Based onemissions reductions that would start well before  and theexpected increase in benefits between  and  the cumulativehealth benefits of the program across the next two decades would besignificant The key results of this analysis of the Clear SkiesAct are summarized in Exhibit Section II Analytical Approach discusses the analyticframework used in conducting this assessment which includesscenario development emissions modeling air quality modelinghuman health and visibility effects estimation economic valuationand adjustments for income growth and benefits aggregationAs depicted in Exhibit  we have used two approaches to providebenefits in health and environmental effects and in monetary termsWhile there is a substantial difference in the specific estimatesboth approaches show that the monetary benefits of the Clear SkiesAct are well in excess of the estimated costs of  billion in and  billion in The first approach presented the Base Estimate is apeerreviewed method developed for previous risk and benefitcostassessments carried out by the Environmental Protection Agency Itis the method used in the regulatory assessments of the Heavy DutyDiesel and Tier II Rules and the Section  Report to CongressFollowing the approach of these earlier assessments along with theresults of the Base Estimate we present various sensitivityanalyses on the Base Estimate that alter select subsets ofvariables these sensitivity analyses yield results as much as percent lower to over  percent higher By far the largestcomponent of these monetized benefits is related to prematuremortality from longterm exposure to particulate matter billion and  billion in  and  respectively followedby chronic bronchitis  billion and  billion in  and respectivelyto caps of  million tons in  and  million tons in Mercury emissions would be reduced by  percent fromcurrent emissions of  tons to caps of  tons in  and  tonsin Detailed information on the costs of Clear Skies can be found inthe Clear Skies Act Analytical Support Package In order to provide some insight into the potential importanceof the key elements underlying estimates of the benefits ofreducing SOx and NOx emissions we developed an AlternativeEstimate using different choices of data methods and assumptionsthat are detailed in Section II Analytical Approach As indicatedin Exhibit  the differences between the Alternative and BaseEstimates are found in the estimation of the impact of fineparticle reductions on premature mortality and the valuation ofreducing the risk of premature mortality and the risk of chronicbronchitis The Alternative Estimate of the impact of fine particlereductions on premature mortality relies on recent scientificstudies finding an association between increased mortality andshortterm days to weeks exposure to particulate matter whilethe Base Estimate relies on a recent reanalysis of earlier studiesthat found associations between longterm exposure to fineparticles and increased mortality The Alternative approach alsouses different data to value reductions in the risk of prematuremortality and chronic bronchitis and makes adjustments relating tothe health status and potential longevity of the populations mostlikely affected by PM Even using the more conservative assumptionsof this Alternative the benefits of Clear Skies still outweigh theprojected costs of the proposalAll such benefit estimates are subject to a number ofassumptions and uncertainties which are discussed in Section IIIMajor Uncertainties in the Benefits Analysis of this report Forexample key assumptions underlying the Base and AlternativeEstimates for the mortality category include the following Inhalation of fine particles is causally associated with prematuredeath at concentrations near those experienced by most Americans ona daily basis While biological mechanisms for this effect have notyet been definitively established the weight of the availableepidemiological evidence supports an assumption of causality All fine particles regardless of their chemical composition areequally potent in causing premature mortality This is an importantassumption because fine particles from power plant emissions arechemically different from directly emitted fine particles from bothmobile sources and other industrial facilities but no clearscientific grounds exist for supporting differential effectsestimates by particle type  The concentrationresponse functionfor fine particles is approximately linear within the range ofambient concentrations under consideration Thus the estimatesinclude health benefits from reducing fine particles in areas withvaried concentrations of particulate matter including both regionsthat are in attainment with fine particle standard and those thatdo not meet the standard  The forecasts for future emissionsand associated air quality modeling are valid Although recognizingthe difficulties assumptions and inherent uncertainties in theoverall enterprise these analyses are based on peerreviewedscientific literature and uptodate assessment tools and webelieve the results are highly useful in assessing thisproposalIn addition to the quantified and monetized benefits summarizedabove there are a number of additional categories are notcurrently amenable to quantification or valuation These includethe health and environmental benefits of reducing mercuryaccumulation in fish and other wildlife reduced acid andparticulate deposition damage to cultural monuments and othermaterials reduced ozone effects on forested ecosystems andenvironmental benefits due to reductions of impacts ofacidification in lakes and streams and eutrophication in coastalareas Additionally we have not quantified a number of known orsuspected health effects linked with PM and ozone for whichappropriate concentrationresponse functions are not available orwhich do not provide easily interpretable outcomes ie changes inforced expiratory volume FEVAs a result both the Base and Alternative monetized benefitsestimates underestimate the total benefits attributable to theClear Skies ActExhibit  Summary of Results The Estimated PM and OzoneRelatedBenefits of the Clear Skies Act in  and  Results calculated using three percent discount rate asrecommended by EPAs Guidelines for Economic Analysis US EPAa Results calculated using seven percent discount rate asrecommended by OMB Circular A OMB The two sets of estimates depicted in this table reflectalternative assumptions and analytical approaches regardingquantifying and evaluating the effects of airborne particles onpublic health All estimates assume that particles are causallyassociated with health effects and that all components have thesame toxicity Linear concentrationresponse relationships betweenPM and all health effects are assumed indicating that reductionsin PM have the same impact on health outcomes regardless of theabsolute level of PM in a given location The Base Estimate relieson estimates of the potential cumulative effect of longtermexposure to particles while the Alternative Estimate presumes thatPM effects are limited to those that accumulate over much shortertime periods The Alternative Estimate also uses differentapproaches to value health effects damages All such estimates aresubject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties It is of notethat based on recent preliminary findings from the Health EffectsInstitute the magnitude of mortality from shorttern exposureAlternative Estimate and hospitalER admissions estimates bothestimates may be under or overestimatedII ANALYTICAL APPROACHThe framework for the Clear Skies Act benefits analysis is thesame as that used in three recent stateoftheart EPA regulatoryanalyses the Section  Prospective Analysis US EPA athe Tier II motor vehiclegasoline sulfur rules Regulatory ImpactAnalysis RIA US EPA b and the HeavyDuty EngineDieselFuel RIA US EPA b The analysis uses the same healtheffect and valuation functions employed in the most recent of theseanalyses the HeavyDuty EngineDiesel Fuel RIA The analyticalapproach can be described as a sequence of six steps summarizedbelow and described in detail later in this report These stepslisted in order of completion areScenario developmentEmissions modelingAir qua lity modelingHuman health and visibility effects estimationEconomic valuationAdjustments for income growth and benefitsaggregationExhibit  outlines the analytical framework used to study thebenefits of the Clear Skies Act The first step in the benefitsanalysis is the specification of the regulatory scenarios that willbe evaluated Typically an analysis will include a baselinescenario that simulates future conditions in the absence of theproposed regulation and one or more control scenarios that simulateconditions under the regulations being evaluated The benefits of aproposed regulation are then estimated as the difference in benefitoutcomes eg adverse health effects between the control andbaseline scenarios For this analysis the baseline scenarios for and  assume no additional emissions control regulationbeyond the continuing effects of Title IV of the Clean Air ActAmendments the NOx SIP Call and other promulgated federal rulesissued under the Clean Air Act For each year  and  ouranalysis evaluates a single control scenario as describedbelowAfter scenario development the second step of the benefitsanalysis is the estimation of the effect of the Clear Skies Act onemissions sources We generated emissions estimates for thebaseline by projecting changes in emissions under the baseline casefor  and  We generated emissions estimates for the ClearSkies Act control scenario using the same set of economic activityprojections as the baseline but with additional emissions controlsconsistent with the Clear Skies Act caps Emissions inputs werederived from the  NTI and the  NEI In addition emissionsinventories prepared for the HeavyDuty Diesel Engine rulemakingwere the basis for future year emissions projections TheIntegrated Planning Model IPM was used to derive all futureprojections of electricity generation source emissionsAfter the emissions inventories are developed they aretranslated into estimates of futureyear air quality conditionsunder each scenario We employed two sophisticated computer modelsthe Regulatory Modeling System for Aerosols and Deposition REMSADand the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions CAMx toestimate changes to the concentration of particulate matter andozone respectively resulting from the Clear Skies Act The REMSADmodel was also used to estimate changes in visibility associatedwith those changes in particulate matter concentrations and toestimate changes in deposition of sulfur nitrogen andmercuryThe air quality modeling results serve as inputs to a modelingsystem that translates air quality changes to changes in healthoutcomes eg premature mortality emergency room visits throughthe use of concentrationresponse functions Scientific literatureon the health effects of air pollutants provides the source ofthese concentrationresponse functions At this point we deriveestimates of the differences between the two scenarios in terms ofincidences of a range of human health effects that are associatedwith exposure to ambient particulate matter and ozoneIn the next step we use economic valuation models orcoefficients to estimate a dollar value for the reduced incidenceof those adverse effects amenable to monetization For exampleanalysis of estimates derived from the economic literature providesan estimate of the value of reductions in mortality risk Finallywe adjust the benefit values for expected income growth through and  and aggregate the benefits to the appropriategeographic levelAs noted in Section I Introduction we present Base andAlternative estimates for mortality and chronic bronchitisbenefits The different methodologies and assumptions for theseapproaches are discussed in separate subsections in the effectsestimation and valuation sections belowExhibit  Analytic Sequence for MultiEmissions ReductionProposal Benefits AnalysisBaseline and Regulatory Scenario DevelopmentThis analysis looks at the impacts of the multipollutantreductions that are part of the Clear Skies Act for two futuretarget years  and  Avoided health effects and visibilityimprovements are quantified by comparing two scenariosA baseline scenario Base Case that reflects thecontinuing effects of

athttpwwwepagovotaqhdmodelshtmExhibit  National SOx and NOx Emissions Projections for Baseand Clear Skies Scenarios million tonsThe  Base Year inventory was used to project futureemissions under the Base Case and differences between the Base Caseand the Clear Skies Act It was constructed using existingemissions inventories created for various recent rulemakingactivities For criteria pollutants the  National EmissionsInventory NEI used for the Heavy Duty Diesel vehicle rulemakingwas used For mercury the  National Toxics Inventory wasmodified based on the  information collection effort for coalutilities and the  MACT implementation for medical wasteincinerators and the  MACT implementation for municipal wastecombustors was usedFor the  and  Base Cases emissions under currentregulations with economic and population growth were projected Theelectric utility portion was developed using the IntegratedPlanning Model IPM IPM projects power sector emissions underTitle IV of the  Clean Air Act Amendments The Acid RainProgram which caps SO emissions at  million tonsyearbeginning in  In addition IPMs projections for electricutilities under the Base Case include the NOX SIP Call with a capon summertime NOX emissions in SIP Call states in  based on lbmmBtu from  and stateimposed NOX caps in TexasConnecticut and Missouri This case also includes no controls onmercury emissions from power generation The emissions inventoryfor the Base Case also includes Tier II and Heavy Duty Diesel Rulesfor mobile sources The uncertainty about how these mobile sourcerules will be implemented in the future contributes to uncertaintyin both the Base Case and the Clear Skies Act profileThe  and  Clear Skies Act profile includes a  milliontonyear cap on EGUs beginning in  for SO emissions whichwill be lowered to a  million ton cap in  a  milliontonyr cap beginning in  for NOX emissions which will belowered to a  million ton cap in  and a  tonyr capbeginning in  for mercury emissions which will be lowered to a ton cap in  Because sources can reduce emissions earlyearn allowances for these actions and use the allowances lateractual emissions are projected to be higher than the cap in thefirst years of each capThe Integrated Planning Model IPMThe Integrated Planning Model IPM predicts future emissionsoutputs from EGUs affected by the Clear Skies Act These outputsare used to develop the emissions inventoriesIPM is a linear programming model of the electricity sector thatfinds the most efficientie least cost approach to operating the electric powersystem over a given time period subjectto specific constraintseg pollution caps or transmission limitations The model whichwas developed for EPA by ICF Resources Inc selects investmentstrategies given the cost and performance

resourcesavailable to utilities and their customers is optimized given theresource mix unit operating characteristics and fuel and othercosts Unit and system operating constraints providesystemspecific realism to the outputs of the modelThe IPM is dynamic it has the capability to use forecasts offuture conditions requirements and option characteristics to makedecisions for the present This ability replicates to the extentpossible the perspective of utility managers regulatorypersonnel and the public in reviewing important investment optionsfor the utility industry and electricity consumers Decisions aremade based on minimizing the net present value of capital andoperating costs over the full planning horizon IPM also models avariety of environmental market mechanisms such as emissions capsallowances trading and banking Air Quality and Deposition ModelingAir quality modeling is a critical analytical step that providesthe link between emissions changes and the physical effects thataffect human health and the environment This step of the analysisemploys complex computer models that simulate the transport andtransformation of emitted pollutants in the atmosphere The resultsof these model runs are predictions of pollutant concentrationsunder each of the emission control scenarios specified above Thesepredicted concentrations are then used as inputs to the humanhealth effect estimation model discussed in the next sectionAir quality modelers face two key challenges in attempting totranslate emission inventories into pollutant concentrationsFirst they must model the dispersion and transport of pollutantsthrough the atmosphere Second they must model pertinentatmospheric chemistry and other pollutant transformation andremoval processes These challenges are particularly difficult forthose pollutants that are not emitted directly but instead formthrough secondary processes Ozone is the best example it forms inthe atmosphere through a series of complex nonlinear chemicalinteractions of precursor pollutants particularly certain classesof volatile organic compounds VOCs and nitrogen oxides NOxModelers face similar challenges whenComplete documentation of the IPM model can be foundathttpwwwepagovairmarktepaipmindexhtmldocumentationestimating PM concentrations Atmospheric transformation ofgaseous sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides to particulate sulfatesand nitrates respectively contributes significantly to ambientconcentrations of fine particulate matter In addition torecognizing the complex atmospheric chemistry relevant for somepollutants air quality modelers also must deal with uncertaintiesassociated with variable meteorology and the spatial and temporaldistribution of emissionsAir quality modelers and researchers have responded to the needfor scientifically valid and reliable estimates of air qualitychanges by developing a number of sophisticated atmosphericdispersion and transformation models Some of these models havebeen employed in support of the development of federal clean airprograms national assessment studies State Implementation PlansSIPs and individual air toxic source risk assessments In thisanalysis we used two of these wellestablished models theRegional Modeling System for Aerosols and Deposition REMSAD andthe Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions CAMx todevelop a picture of future changes in air quality resulting fromthe implementation of the Clear Skies ActRegional Modeling System for Aerosols and DepositionREMSADThe change in PM concentrations due to the Clear Skies Act wasmodeled using the Regional Modeling System for Aerosols andDeposition REMSAD REMSAD was also used to estimate the changesin visibility and deposition of mercury nitrogen and sulfurREMSAD is a threedimensional gridbased Eulerian air qualitymodel designed to simulate longterm eg annual concentrationsand deposition fluxes of atmospheric pollutants over large spatialscales eg over the contiguous US Air pollution issues meantto be addressed by REMSAD include longterm PM ambientconcentrations visibility ambient concentrations and depositionfluxes of several hazardous air pollutants

fullyear simulationgenerating predictions of hourly PM concentrations including bothPM component species and PM at each grid cell These hourlypredictions form the basis for direct calculation of daily andannual PM air quality metrics eg annual mean PM concentrationas inputs to the health and welfare CR functions of the benefitsanalysis REMSAD also gives visibility which is used as an inputinto the visibility damage functionFor this benefits analysis we applied REMSAD to the entire USfor four futureyear scenarios a  Base Case a  Base Casea  Clear Skies Act Case and a  Clear Skies Act Case Thedifference in REMSADmodeled PM concentrations for these scenariosrepresents the expected change in PM due to the emission controlsunder the Clear Skies ActComprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions CAMxWe modeled changes in ozone in the eastern US using theComprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions CAMx CAMx is anEulerian photochemical dispersion model designed to assess bothgaseous and particulate air pollution over many scales from urbanto superregional The model estimates concentrations of both inertand chemically reactive pollutants by simulating the physical andchemical processes in the atmosphere that affect ozone formationThe latest version of the model CAMx  provides full supportfor parallel processing for increased computational performance aswell as new algorithms for gas phase chemistry CAMx v UsersGuide April The modeling domain for this analysis encompasses most of theeastern US bounded on the east by the  degrees west longitudeand on the west by the  degrees west longitude Ozone modeling isonly done for the East because there is very little confidence inthe application of this model to the West The horizontalresolution for the outer grid is approximately  km Thehorizontal resolution for the inner grid is approximately  kmThe vertical resolution for both grids consists of nine layers Thetop of the modeling domain is  meters above ground levelRecognizing the relationship between grid cell resolution and thecertainty of results we sought to estimate pollutantconcentrations in more populated areas using higher resolutionmodels Similarly we used an intermediate resolution grid  km x km to model ozone in inner OTAG states where populationdensity is high and ozone transport is a major problem Thisapproach makes CAMx well suited to estimate effects based on arange of ozone averaging times an important capability forbenefits assessment applicationsThis study extracted hourly surfacelayer ozone concentrationsfor each gridcell from the standard CAMx output file containinghourly average ozone values These model predictions are used inconjunction with the observed concentrations obtained from theAerometricThe Ozone Transport Assessment Group OTAG consists of the easternmost states and the District of Columbia The inner OTAGregion is comprised of the more eastern and more populated stateswithin the OTAG domainInformation Retrieval System AIRS to generate ozoneconcentrations for the entire ozone season  The predictedchanges in ozone concentrations from the Base Case to the ClearSkies Act serve as inputs to the health and welfare CR functionsof the benefits analysis ie the Criteria Air Pollutant ModelingSystem CAPMSIn order to estimate ozonerelated health and welfare effectsfor the eastern US fullseason ozone data are required for everyCAPMS gridcell Given available ozone monitoring data wegenerated fullseason ozone profiles for each location in themodeling domain in two steps  we combine monitored observationsand modeled ozone predictions to interpolate hourly ozoneconcentrations to a grid of  km by  km population gridcells aswill be described in the Human Health and Environmental EffectsModeling section and  we converted these fullseason hourlyozone profiles to an ozone measure of interest such as the dailyaverage   For the analysis of ozone impacts on agriculture weuse a similar approach except air quality is interpolated to countycentroids as opposed to population gridcells We report ozoneconcentrations as a cumulative index called the SUM The SUM isthe sum of the ozone concentrations for every hour that exceeds parts per million ppm within a hour period from  am to pm in the months of May to September These methods are describedin detail in the Heavy Duty EngineDiesel Fuel RIA USEPAbHuman Health and Environmental Effects ModelingAs part of the evaluation of the effects of various scenariosconcerning SO and NOx emissions we have identified and

streams in the EastExhibit  provides a list of the health effects for which weestimate quantified benefits as part of our analysis plus a list ofthe health effects for which we are unable to quantify

effects of nitrogen oxide gases and sulfur dioxide gases arealso unquantified Although CR functions are available to estimatehealth effects of exposure to nitrogen oxidesThe ozone season for this analysis is defined as the monthperiod from May to September however to estimate certain cropyield benefits the modeling results were extended to includemonths outside the month ozone seasonBased on AIRS there were  ozone monitors with sufficientdata ie at least  hourly observations per day  am to  pmin a given seasonThe  km grid squares contain the population data used in thehealth benefits

limitations Thehealth and environmental effects of mercury exposure are also notquantified EPA is currently investigating methods to quantify andmonetize the human health related benefits of reductions in airemissions of mercury However there are still major gaps in thescience of mercury fate transport and transformation that makesuch an assessment difficult at time Methods for mercury

approach takesthe estimates of changes in ambient pollutant concentrationspredicted by air quality modeling for each scenario relative tothe baseline scenario and converts them into estimates of changesin the incidence of adverse health effects usingconcentrationresponse CR functions The model we use togenerate these estimates is the Criteria Air Pollutant ModelingSystem CAPMSWe calculated the benefits attributable to the Clear Skies Actas the change in incidence of adverse health effects between thecontrol and baseline scenarios CAPMS estimates incidence changesfor each health effect within  km x  km grid cells covering thecontiguousUS and generates national health benefits estimates by summingthe annual incidence changefor each effect across all grid cellsCAPMS uses CR functions specific to each health effect tocalculate incidences in each grid cell CR functions are equationsthat relate the change in the number of individuals in a populationexhibiting a response in this case an adverse health effect suchas respiratory disease to a change in pollutant concentrationexperienced by that population In general the CR functions usedin CAPMS require four input values  the gridcellspecificchange in pollutant concentration  the gridcell affectedpopulation ie asthmatic children  the baseline incidencerate of the health effects and  an estimate of the change inthe number of individuals that suffer an adverse health effect perunit change in air quality Both the form of the CR function andthe fourth input value are derived from epidemiological studies inthe scientific literature that link pollutant exposures withadverse health effectsIn addition to our national benefits results we generatedregional estimates of the benefits of the Clear Skies Act using thesame benefits estimation procedure used to generate the nationalestimates The REMSAD and CAMx air quality models provideinformation on the improvements in ambient air concentrationsthroughout the country within  km by  km gridboxes Thisinformation is used in subsequent exposure doseresponse andvaluation steps including locationspecific baseline mortality andmorbidity risk data to generate locationspecific estimates ofhealth benefits This bottomup approach provides a more accuraterepresentation of regional benefits estimates than a comparabletopdown emissionsweighted approach might

geographicallydisaggregated based on either the location of the recreationalClass I area where visibility is improved or on the state oforigin of visitors to these sites For this analysis wedisaggregated benefits based on the state of origin of visitorsreflecting the notion that many of the recreational sites with thehighest visitation rates are valued by individuals throughout thecountry not only by those individuals who live closest to thesite The results of the regional analysis of visibility benefitsindicate that benefits are realized throughout the country with ahigher concentration of benefits in those areas of higherpopulation densityExhibit  provides a list of the health effect endpoints wequantified as part of our analysis of the Clear Skies Act as wellas references to the studies that serve as the basis for the CRfunctions As with emissions and air quality estimates ourestimates of the effect of ambient pollution levels on all of theseendpoints represent the best science and analytical toolsavailable With the exception of the shortterm mortality endpointthe choice of CR functions and the majority of the analyticalassumptions used to develop our estimates have been reviewed andapproved by EPAs Science Advisory Board SAB The CR functionsin Exhibit  only capture effects related to exposures toparticulate matter and ozone they do not include human healtheffects related to exposures to SO NO or mercury As a resultfor these exposures we have underestimated the total healthbenefits attributable to Clear Skies emissions reductionsAir Quality ChangesAs in the analysis of the HeavyDuty EngineDiesel Fuel RuleUS EPA b the REMSAD PM and CAMx ozone results discussedabove served as direct inputs to the CAPMS model To calculatepopulation exposure to PM each  km by  km CAPMS grid cell wasassigned to the nearest REMSAD grid cell by calculating theshortest distance between the center of the CAPMS grid cell to thecenter of a REMSAD grid cellTo develop baseline and control exposure predictions for ozonewe used the results of the variablegrid Comprehensive Air QualityModel with Extensions CAMx for each scenario and observed ozonedata for the baseline year  At each ozone monitor wequantified the relationship between CAMx modeled levels of ozone atthe monitor for  and the future year  or  Theseadjustment ratios are applied to the actual monitoring data togenerate estimates of ozone levels at the monitor for the futurescenarios Note that we do not use the modeling data directly toestimate futureyear ozone levels Instead we use them in arelative sense to simply adjust actual  ozone monitor levelsto future Base Case or Clear Skies levels This provides a betterestimate than the CAMx modeling data itself To calculatepopulation exposure

epidemiological study typically focuses on a particular agecohort eg adults age  and older and the CR relationshipfound in a particular study can not necessarily be generalizedacross broader age categories Therefore to avoid overestimatingthe benefits of reduced pollution levels we applied CRrelationships only to those age groups corresponding to the cohortsstudied For outcomes where the study population reflects datalimitations and not the agespecificity of a health effect thisassumption may lead us to underestimate the benefits of reductionsin pollutant exposures to the entire exposed populationBaseline Incidence RateSome CR functions those expressed as a change relative tobaseline conditions require baseline incidence data associatedwith ambient levels of pollutants County

published scientificliterature to ascertain the relationship between particulate matterexposure and adverse human health effects We evaluated studiesusing the nine selection criteria summarized in Exhibit  Thesecriteria include consideration of whether the study waspeerreviewed the study design and location and characteristicsof the study population among other considerations The selectionof CR functions for the benefits analysis is guided by the goal ofachieving a balance between comprehensiveness and scientificdefensibility The CR functions for PM exposure selected for theBase Estimate are the same as those the Environmental ProtectionAgency used in the HeavyDuty EngineDiesel Fuel RIA TheAlternative Estimate uses alternative CR functions to evaluate theeffect of shortterm exposure to particulate matter on prematuremortality We present information below on the selection of CRfunctions for the two most significant health effects evaluated interms of monetized benefits premature mortality and chronicbronchitis Detailed information on the selection and applicationof CR functions for other endpoints in Exhibit  is available inthe HeavyDuty EngineDiesel Fuel RIA US EPA bExhibit  Summary of Considerations Used in Selecting CRFunctionsConsideration CommentsPeer reviewed research Peer reviewed research is preferred toresearch that has not undergone the peer review processStudy type Among studies that consider chronic exposure egover a year or longer prospective cohort studies are preferredover crosssectional studies aka ecological studies becausethey control for important confounding variables that cannot becontrolled for in crosssectional studies If the chronic effectsof a pollutant are considered more important than its acuteeffects prospective cohort studies may also be preferable tolongitudinal time series studies because the latter type of studyis typically designed to detect the effects of shortterm egdaily exposures rather than chronic exposures If shorttermeffects are considered more important distributed lag approacheswhich assume that mortality following a PM event will bedistributed over a number of days following the event arepreferred over daily mortality studies Daily mortality studiesexamine the impact of PM on mortality on a single day or overthe average of several daysStudy period Studies examining a relatively longer period oftime and therefore having more data are preferred because theyhave greater statistical power to detect effects More recentstudies are also preferred because of possible changes in pollutionmixes medical care and life style over timeStudy populationStudies examining a relatively large sample are preferredStudies of narrow population groups are generally disfavoredalthough this does not exclude the possibility of studyingpopulations that are potentially more sensitive to pollutantseg asthmatics children elderly However there are tradeoffsto comprehensiveness of study population Selecting a CR functionfrom a study that considered all ages will avoid omitting thebenefits associated with any population age category However ifthe age distribution of a study population from an all populationstudy is different from the age distribution in the assessmentpopulation and if pollutant effects vary by age then bias can beintroduced into the benefits analysisStudy location US studies are more desirable than nonUSstudies because of potential differences in pollutioncharacteristics exposure patterns medical care system and lifestylePollutants included in model Models with more pollutants aregenerally preferred to models with fewer pollutants though carefulattention must be paid to potential colinearity between pollutantsBecause PM has been acknowledged to be an important and pervasivepollutant models that include some measure of PM are highlypreferred to those that do notMeasure of PM PM and PM are preferred to other measures ofparticulate matter such as total suspended particulate matterTSP coefficient of haze COH or black smoke BS based onevidence that PM and PM are more directly correlated withadverse health effects than are these other measures of PMEconomically valuable health Some health effects such as forcedexpiratory volume and other technical measurements of effects lungfunction are difficult to value in monetary terms These healtheffects are not quantified in this analysisNonoverlapping endpoints Although the benefits associated witheach individual health endpoint may be analyzed separately caremust be exercised in selecting health endpoints to include in theoverall benefits analysis because of the possibility of doublecounting of benefits Including emergency room visits in a benefitsanalysis that already considers hospital admissions for examplewill result in double counting of some benefits if the categoryhospital admissions includes emergency room visitsConcentrationresponse relationships between a pollutant and agiven health endpoint are applied consistently across all locationsnationwide This applies to both CR relationships defined by asingle CR function and those defined by a pooling of multiple CRfunctions Although the CR relationship may in fact vary fromone location to another for example due to differences inpopulation susceptibilities or differences in the composition ofPM locationspecific CR functions are generally not available Asingle function applied everywhere may result in overestimates ofincidence changes in some locations and underestimates elsewherebut these locationspecific biases will negate each other to someextent when the total incidence change is calculated It is notpossible to know the extent or direction of the bias in the totalincidence change based on the general application of a single CRfunction everywhereCR functions may also be estimated with or without explicitthresholds Air pollution levels below the threshold for eachhealth effect studied are assumed not to cause the effect When nothreshold is assumed as is often the case in epidemiologicalstudies any exposure level is assumed to pose a nonzero risk ofresponse to at least one segment of the population In the benefitsanalyses for some recent RIAs eg the Regional Haze RIA and theNOx SIP Call RIA the lowend estimate of benefits assumed athreshold in PM health effects at  gm However the SABsupported by recent literature addressing this issue Rossi et al Schwartz  subsequently advised EPA that there iscurrently no scientific basis for selecting a threshold of  gmor any other specific threshold for the PMrelated health effectsconsidered in this analysis EPASABCouncilADV Therefore for our benefits analysis we assume there are nothresholds for modeling health effects We do however present aquantitative sensitivity analysis of this assumption in the resultssectionRecently the Health Effects Institute HEI reported findingsby investigators at Johns Hopkins University and others that haveraised concerns about aspects of the statistical methods used in anumber of recent timeseries studies of shortterm exposures to airpollution and health effects Greenbaum a Some of theconcentrationresponse functions used in this benefits analysiswere derived from such shortterm studies The estimates derivedfrom the longterm exposure studies which account for a majorshare of the benefits in the Base Estimate are not affected Asdiscussed in HEI materials provided to sponsors and to the CleanAir Scientific Advisory Committee Greenbaum a b theseinvestigators found problems in the default convergence criteriaused in Generalized Additive Models GAM and a separate issuefirst identified by Canadian investigators about the potential tounderestimate standard errors in the same statistical packageThese and other investigators have begun to reanalyze the resultsof several important time series studies with alternativeapproaches that address these issues and have found a downwardrevision of some results For example the mortality risk estimatesfor shortterm exposure to PM from NMMAPS were overestimatedthis study was not used in this benefits analysis of fine particleeffects However both the relative magnitude and the directionof bias introduced by the convergence issue are casespecific Inmost cases the concentrationresponse relationship may beoverestimated in other cases it may be underestimated Thepreliminary reanalyses of the mortality and morbidity components ofNMMAPS suggest that analyses reporting the lowest relative risksappear to be affected more greatly by this error than studiesreporting higher relative risks Dominici et al  Schwartzand Zanobetti Most of the studies used a statistical package known asSplus For further details seehttpwwwhealtheffectsorgPubsNMMAPSletterpdfHEI sponsored the multicity the National MorbidityMortality and Air Pollution Study NMMAPS SeehttpbiosunbiostatjhsphedufdominicNMMAPSnmmapsrevisedpdffor revised mortality resultsOur examination of the original studies used in this analysisfinds that the health endpoints that are potentially affected bythe GAM issues include reduced hospital admissions in both theBase and Alternative Estimates reduced lower respiratory symptomsin the both the Base and Alternative Estimates and reducedpremature mortality due to shortterm PM exposures in theAlternative Estimate While resolution of these issues is likely totake some time the preliminary results from ongoing reanalyses ofsome of the studies used in our Clear Skies analyses Dominici etal  Schwartz and Zanobetti  Schwartz personalcommunication  suggest a more modest effect of the Spluserror than reported for the NMMAPS PM mortality study While wewait for further clarification from the scientific community wehave chosen not to remove these results from the Clear Skiesbenefits estimates nor have we elected to apply any interimadjustment factor based on the preliminary reanalyses EPA willcontinue to monitor the progress of this concern and makeappropriate adjustments as further information is madeavailablePremature

endpointquantified in this analysis Because of the importance of thisendpoint and the considerable uncertainty among economists andpolicymakers as to the appropriate way to value reductions inmortality risks this section discusses some of the issuessurrounding the estimation of premature mortality Additionaldiscussion is found in the section on uncertaintiesHealth researchers have consistently linked air pollutionespecially PM with excess mortality Although a number ofuncertainties remain to be addressed by continued research NRC a substantial body of published scientific literaturerecognizes a correlation between elevated PM concentrations andincreased mortality rates Two types of community epidemiologicalstudies involving measures of shortterm and longterm exposuresand response have been used to estimate PM mortalityrelationships Shortterm studies relate shortterm oftendaytoday changes in PM concentrations and changes in dailymortality rates up to several days after a period of elevated PMconcentrations Longterm studies examine the potentialrelationship between longerterm eg one or more years exposureto PM and annual mortality rates Researchers have foundsignificant associations using both types of studies Base EstimateOver a dozen studies have found significant associations betweenvarious measures of longterm exposure to PM and elevated rates ofannual mortality eg Lave and Seskin  Ozkaynak andThurston  While most of the published studies found positivebut not always significant associations with available PM indicessuch as total suspended particles TSP fine particles componentsie sulfates and fine particles exploration of alternativemodel specifications sometimes found inconsistencies eg Lipfert These early crosssectional studies were criticized for anumber of methodological limitations particularly for inadequatecontrol at the individual level for variables that are potentiallyimportant in causing mortality such as wealth smoking and dietMore recently several new longterm studies have been publishedthat use improved approaches and appear to be consistent with theearlier body of literature These new prospective cohort studiesreflect a significant improvement over the earlier work becausethey include information on individual information with respect tomeasures related to health status and residence The most extensivestudy and analyses has been based on data from two prospectivecohort groups often referred to as the Harvard SixCity studyDockery et al  and the American Cancer Society or ACSstudy Pope et al  these studies have found consistentrelationships between fine particle indicators and mortality acrossmultiple locations in the US A third major data set comes fromthe California based th day Adventist study eg Abbey et al which reported associations between longterm PM exposureand mortality in men Results from this cohort however have beeninconsistent and the air quality results are not geographicallyrepresentative of most of the US More recently a cohort of adultmale veterans diagnosed with hypertension has been examinedLipfert et al  Unlike previous longterm analyses thisstudy found some associations between mortality and ozone but foundinconsistent results for PM indicatorsGiven their consistent results and broad applicability togeneral US populations the SixCity and ACS data have been ofparticular importance in benefits analyses The credibility ofthese two studies is further enhanced by the fact that they weresubject to extensive reexamination and reanalysis by an independentscientific analysis team of experts compiled by the Health EffectsInstitute Krewski et al  The final results of thereanalysis were then independently peer reviewed by a Special Panelof the HEI Health Review Committee The results of these reanalysesconfirmed and expanded those of the original investigators Thisintensive independent reanalysis effort was occasioned both by theimportance of the original findings as well as concerns that theunderlying individual health effects information has never beenmade publicly available The HEI reexamination lends credibilityto the original studies but also found unexpected sensitivitiesconcerning a which pollutants are most important b the role ofeducation in mediating the association between pollution andmortality and c the magnitude of the association depending onhow spatial correlation was handled Further confirmation andextension of the overall findings using more recent air quality andACS health information was recently published in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association Pope et al  In general therisk estimates based on the longterm mortality studies aresubstantially greater than those derived from shorttermstudiesIn developing and improving the methods for estimating andvaluing the potential reductions in mortality risk over the yearsEPA has consulted with a panel of the Science Advisory Board Thatpanel recommended use of longterm prospective cohort studies inestimating mortality risk reduction EPASABCOUNCILADV More specifically the SAB recommended emphasis on Pope etal  because it includes a much larger sample size and longerexposure interval and covers more locations eg  citiescompared to  cities examined in the Harvard data than otherstudies of its kind As explained in the regulatory impact analysisfor the HeavyDuty EngineDiesel Fuel rule US EPA b morerecent EPA benefits analyses have relied on an improvedspecification from this data set that was developed in the HEIreanalysis of this study Krewski et al  The particularspecification estimated a CR function based on changes in meanlevels of PM as opposed to the function in the original studywhich used median levels This specification also includes abroader geographic scope than the original study  cities versus The SAB has recently agreed with EPAs selection of thisspecification for use in analyzing mortality benefits of PMreductions EPASABCOUNCILADV  For these reasonsthe present analysis uses the same ConcentrationResponse functionin developing the Base Estimate of mortality benefits Alternative EstimateTo reflect concerns about the inherent limitations in the numberof studies supporting a causal association between longtermexposure and mortality an Alternative benefit estimate was derivedfrom the large number of timeseries studies that have establisheda likely causal relationship between shortterm measures of PM anddaily mortality statistics A particular strength of such studiesis the fact that potential confounding variables such associoeconomic status occupation and smoking do not vary on adaytoday basis in an individual area A number of multicity andother types of studies strongly suggest that theseeffectsrelationships cannot be explained by weather statisticalapproaches or other pollutants The risk estimates from the vastmajority of the shortterm studies include the effects of only oneor twoday exposure to air pollution More recently severalstudies have found that the practice of examining the effects on asingle day basis may significantly understate the risk ofshortterm exposures Schwartz  Zanobetti et al  Thesestudies suggest that the shortterm risk can double when thesingleday effects are combined with the cumulative impact ofexposures over multiple days to weeks prior to a mortalityeventThe fact that the PMmortality coefficients from the cohortstudies are far larger than the coefficients derived from the dailytimeseries studies provides some evidence for an independentchronic effect of PM pollution on health Indeed the Base Estimatepresumes that the larger coefficients represent a more completeaccounting of mortality effects including both the cumulativetotal of shortterm mortality as well as an additional chroniceffect This is however not the only possible interpretation ofthe disparity Various reviewers have argued that  the longtermestimates may be biased high andor  the shortterm estimates maybe biased low In this view the two study types could be measuringthe same underlying relationshipReviewers have noted some possible sources of upward bias in thelongterm studies Some have noted that the less robust estimatesbased on the SixCities Study are significantly higher than thosebased on the more broadly distributed ACS data sets Some reviewershave also noted that the observed mortality associations from thes and s may reflect higher pollution exposures from thes to s While this would bias estimates based on morerecent pollution levels upwards it also would imply a trulylongterm chronic effect of pollutionWith regard to possible sources of downward bias it is of notethat the recent studies suggest that the single day time seriesstudies may understate the shortterm effect on the order of afactor of two These considerations provide a basis for consideringan Alternative Estimate using the most recent estimates from thewealth of timeseries studies in addition to one based on thelongterm cohort studiesIn essence the Alternative Estimate addresses the above noteduncertainties about the relationship between premature mortalityand longterm exposures to ambient levels of fine particles byassuming that there is no mortality effect of chronic exposures tofine particles Instead it assumes that the full impact of fineparticles on premature mortality can be captured using aconcentrationresponse function relating daily mortality toshortterm fine particle levels Specifically aconcentrationresponse function based on Schwartz et al  isemployed with an adjustment to account for recent evidence thatdaily mortality is associated with particle levels from a number ofprevious days Schwartz  Previous daily mortality studiesSchwartz et al  examined the impact of PM on mortalityon a single day or over the average of two or more days Recentanalyses have found that impacts of elevated PM on a given daycan elevate mortality on a number of following days Schwartz Samet et al  Multiday models are often referred toas distributed lag models because they assume that mortalityfollowing a PM event will be distributed over a number of daysfollowing or lagging the PM event There are no PM daily mortality studies which report numericestimates of relative risks from distributed lag models only PMstudies are available Daily mortality CR functions for PM areconsistently lower in magnitude than PMmortality CR functionsbecause fine particles are believed to be more closely associatedwith mortality than the coarse fraction of PM Given that theemissions reductions under the Clear Skies Act result primarily inreduced ambient concentrations of PM use of a PM based CRfunction results in a significant downward bias in the estimatedreductions in mortality To account for the full potentialmultiday mortality impact of acute PM events we use thedistributed lag model for PM reported in Schwartz  todevelop an adjustment factor which we then apply to thePM based CR function reported in Schwartz et al If most of the increase in mortality is expected to beassociated with the fine fraction of PM then it is reasonable toassume that the same proportional increase in risk would beobserved if a distributed lag model were applied to the PM dataThe distributed lag adjustment factor is constructed as the ratioof the estimated coefficient from the unconstrained distributed lagmodel to the estimated coefficient from the singlelag modelreported in Schwartz  The unconstrained distributed lagmodel coefficient estimate is  and the singlelag modelcoefficient estimate is  The ratio of these estimates is This adjustment factor is then multiplied by the estimatedcoefficients from the Schwartz et al  study There are tworelevant coefficients from the Schwartz et al  study onecorresponding to allcause mortality and one corresponding tochronic

pollution As discussedearlier EPAs Science Advisory Board while acknowledging theuncertainties in estimation of a PMmortality relationship hasrepeatedly recommended the use of a study that As discussed above based on recent preliminary findings fromthe Health Effects Institute the magnitude of mortality fromshorttern exposure Alternative Estimate and hospitalERadmissions estimates both estimates may be either under oroverestimated by an uncertain amountdoes reflect the impacts of longterm exposure The omission oflongterm impacts accounts for approximately  percent reductionin the estimate of avoided premature mortality in the AlternativeEstimate relative to the Base EstimateChronic BronchitisChronic bronchitis is characterized by mucus in the lungs and apersistent wet cough for at least three months a year for severalyears in a row Chronic bronchitis affects an estimated fivepercent of the US population American Lung Association  Alimited number of studies have estimated the impact of airpollution on new incidences of chronic bronchitis Schwartz and Abbey et al  provide evidence that longterm PMexposure leads to the development of chronic bronchitis in the USFollowing the same approaches of the HeavyDuty EngineDiesel FuelRIA US EPA b and the Section  Prospective Report USEPA a this analysis pooled estimates from these two studiesto develop a CR function linking PM to chronic bronchitis TheSchwartz  study examined the relationship between exposure toPM and prevalence of chronic bronchitis The Abbey et al study examined the relationship between PM and new incidences ofchronic bronchitis Both studies have strengths and weaknesseswhich suggest that pooling the effect estimates from each studymay provide a better estimate of the expected change in incidencesof chronic bronchitis than using either study aloneIt should be noted that Schwartz used data on the prevalence ofchronic bronchitis not its incidence Following the approach ofthe Section  Prospective Report we estimated the percentagechange in the prevalence rate for chronic bronchitis using theestimated coefficient from Schwartzs study in a CR function andthen applied this percentage change to a baseline incidence rateobtained from another source For example if the prevalencedeclines by  percent with a drop in PM then baseline incidencedrops by  percent with the same drop in PMVisibility BenefitsAs the name chosen for the Clear Skies Act implies one of thedirect consequences of the reductions in fine particles thataccompany implementation of the SO and NOx emissions caps

reducingconcentrations of sulfate and nitrate particles Fine particlesabsorb and scatter light impairing visibility Visibility directlyaffects peoples enjoyment of a variety of daily activities both inthe places they live and work and in the places they travel to forrecreation The Clean Air Act recognizes visibility as an importantpublic good in naming visibility as one of the aspects of publicwelfare to be protected in setting secondary NAAQS In Sections and  the Act places particular value on protecting visibilityin  national parks and wilderness areas eg ShenandoahAcadia and Grand Canyon that are termed class I Federal areas Asnoted above the REMSAD modeling estimates regional and nationalvisibility improvements associated with Clear Skies As discussedin a subsequent section this analysis also provides partialestimates of the potential economic value of these visibilityimprovementsA number of related measures can be used to measure changes invisibility associated with reduced fine particle concentrations Akey such measure is light extinction a measure of the amount oflight scattered and absorbed by particles suspended in air Thislight scattering and absorption reduces atmospheric clarity and isperceived as haze Changes in fine particulate mass components areused directly to estimate changes in extinction Decreasingextinction in units of inverse distance can in turn be used toestimate quantitative measures more directly related to humanperception such as contrast of distant targets and visual rangeMore recently Sisler  created a unitless measure ofvisibility based directly on the degree of measured lightabsorption called the deciview Deciviews like the analagous termdecibel employ a logarithmic scale to evaluate relative changes invisibility that is more directly related to human perceptionSisler characterized a change in light extinction of one deciviewas a small but perceptible scenic change under manycircumstances For this analysis REMSAD version  was used topredict the change in visibility measured in deciviews andpresented graphically of the areas affected by the Clear SkiesActEconomic Valuation of BenefitsThe overall approach applied in our estimates of the benefits ofthe Clear Skies Act closely parallels that used in prior EPAanalyses including the Section  series of Reports to CongressUS EPA  and  and the recent HeavyDuty EngineDieselFuel RIA US EPA b As in those analyses the EPA has notconducted extensive new primary research to measure economicbenefits for individual rulemakings As a result our estimates arebased on the best available methods of benefits transfer Benefitstransfer is the science and art of adapting primary benefitsresearch from similar contexts to obtain the most accurate measureof benefits for the environmental quality change under analysisWhere appropriate we have made adjustments to existing primaryresearch for the level of environmental quality change thesociodemographic and economic characteristics of the affectedpopulation and other factors in order to improve the accuracy androbustness of benefits estimatesIn general economists tend to view an individualswillingnesstopay WTP for an improvement in environmentalquality as the most complete and appropriate measure of the valueof an environmental or health risk reduction An individualswillingnesstoaccept WTA compensation for not receiving theimprovement is also a valid measure Willingness to pay andWillingness to accept are comparable measures when the change inenvironmental quality is small and there are reasonably closesubstitutes available However WTP is generally considered to be amore readily measurable and conservative measure of benefitsAdoption of WTP as the measure of value implies that the value ofenvironmental quality improvements is dependent on the individualpreferences of the affected population and that the existingdistribution of income ability to pay is appropriateOur analysis relies on uptodate reviews of the relevantresource economics literature that provides WTP values for healthrisk reductions and visibility improvements similar to those thatwill be provided by implementation of the Clear Skies Act Exhibit provides a summary of the base WTP values used to generateestimates of the economic value of avoided health effects for thisanalysis adjusted to  dollars and a brief description of thebasis for these values Exhibit  provides a summary of themonetary values for the Alternative Estimate used for economicvaluation of mortality and chronic bronchitis For these twoendpoints the Alternative Estimate valuation differs from the BaseEstimate valuesIn the sections that follow we discuss in greater detail thebasis for generating WTP for premature mortality risk reductionsand WTP for reductions in the risk of contracting chronicbronchitis and the basis for making adjustments to unit values tomake them more applicable to the air pollution reductions weanticipate from the Clear Skies Act The mortality and chronicbronchitis health endpoints are the most influential in ourestimation of monetized benefits because they account for over percent of the total estimated monetized benefits of the ClearSkies Act In addition we provide a brief summary of our approachto valuing visibility and agricultural yield

Premature Mortality Base EstimateThe monetary benefit of reducing premature mortality risk wasestimated using the value of statistical lives saved VSLapproach although the actual valuation is of small changes inmortality risk experienced by a large number of people The VSLapproach applies information from several published valueoflifestudies which themselves examine tradeoffs of monetarycompensation for small additional mortality risks to determine areasonable benefit of preventing premature mortality The meanvalue of avoiding one statistical death ie the statisticalincidence of a single death equivalent to a product of apopulation risk times a population size that equals one isestimated to be  million in  dollars This represents anintermediate value from a range of estimates that appear in theeconomics literature and it is a value the EPA uses in rulemakingsupport analyses and in the Section  Reports to CongressThis estimate is the mean of a distribution fitted to theestimates from  valueoflife studies identified in the Section reports as applicable to policy analysis The approach andset of selected studies mirrors that of Viscusi  with theaddition of two studies and uses the same criteria as Viscusi inhis review of valueoflife studies The  million estimate isconsistent with Viscusis conclusion updated to  that mostof the reasonable estimates of the value of life are clustered inthe  to  million range Five of the  studies arecontingent valuation CV studies which directly solicit WTPinformation from subjects the rest are wagerisk studies whichbase WTP estimates on estimates of the additional compensationdemanded in the labor market for riskier jobs controlling forother job and employee characteristics such as education andexperience As indicated in the previous section on quantificationof premature mortality benefits we assume for this analysis thatsome of the incidences of premature mortality related to PMexposures occur in a distributed fashion over the five yearsfollowing exposure To take this into account in the valuation ofreductions in premature mortality we apply an annual three percentdiscount rate to the value of premature mortality occurring infuture yearsThe economics literature concerning the appropriate method forvaluing reductions in premature mortality risk is still developingThe adoption of a value for the projected reduction in the risk ofpremature mortality is the subject of continuing discussion withinthe economic and public policy analysis community Regardless ofthe theoretical economic considerations distinctions in themonetary value assigned to the lives saved were not drawn even ifpopulations differed in age health status socioeconomic statusgender or other characteristicsFollowing the advice of the EEAC of the SAB the VSL approachwas used to calculate the Base Estimate of mortality benefitsEPASABEEAC While there are several differences betweenthe risk context implicit in labor market studies we use to derivea VSL estimate and the particulate matter air pollution contextaddressed here those differences in the affected populations andthe nature of the risks imply both upward and downward adjustmentsFor example adjusting for age differences between subjects in theeconomic studies and those affected by air pollution may imply theneed to adjust the  million VSL downward but the involuntarynature of air pollutionrelated risks and the lower level ofriskaversion of the manual laborers in the labor market studiesmay imply the need for upward adjustments In certain cases labormarket studies have not adequately controlled for nonfatal injuryrisks and other unfavorable job attributes eg dirt and noiseThese factors may increase the estimated risk premium forreductions in premature mortality riskSome economists emphasize that the value of a statistical lifeis not a single number relevant for all situations Indeed the VSLestimate of  million  dollars is itself the centraltendency of a number of estimates of the VSL for some rathernarrowly defined populations When there are significantdifferences between the population affected by a particular healthrisk and the populations used in the labor market studies as isthe case here some economists prefer to adjust the VSL estimate toreflect those differences The CVbased estimates of VSLcollectively may better represent the population affected bypollution than the labor market studiesThere is general agreement that the value to an individual of areduction in mortality risk can vary based on several factorsincluding the age of the individual the type of risk the level ofcontrol the individual has over the risk the individualsattitudes towards risk and the health status of the individualWhile the empirical basis for adjusting the  million VSL for manyof these factors does not yet exist a thorough discussion of theseuncertainties is included in EPAs Guidelines for PreparingEconomic Analyses US EPA a The EPA recognizes the needfor investigation by the scientific community to develop additionalempirical support for adjustments to VSL for the factors mentionedabove The choice of a discount rate and its associated conceptualbasis is a topic of ongoing discussion within the federalgovernment We adopted a  percent discount rate for our Baseanalysis in this case to reflect reliance on a social rate of timepreference discounting concept We have also calculated benefitsusing a  percent rate consistent with an opportunity cost ofcapital concept to reflect the time value of resources directed tomeet regulatory requirements In this analysis the benefitestimates were not significantly affected by the choice of discountrate Further discussion of this topic appears in EPAs Guidelinesfor Preparing Economic Analyses EPA R SeptemberAs further support for the Base Estimate the SABEEAC advisedin their recent report that the EPA continue to use awageriskbased VSL as its Base Estimate including appropriatesensitivity analyses to reflect the uncertainty of theseestimates and that the only risk characteristic for whichadjustments to the VSL can be made is the timing of theriskEPASABEEAC In developing the Base Estimate of thebenefits of premature mortality reductions we have discounted overthe lag period between exposure and premature mortality Howeverin accordance with the SAB advice we use the VSL in the BaseEstimate and present age adjusted values in the tables ofalternative calculations Exhibit  and  Alternative EstimateThe Alternative Estimate reflects the impact of changes to keyassumptions associated with the valuation of mortality Theseinclude  the impact of using wagerisk and contingentvaluationbased value of statistical life estimates in valuing riskreductions from air pollution as opposed to contingentvaluationbased estimates alone  the relationship between ageand willingnesstopay for fatal risk reductions and  the degreeof prematurity in mortalities from air pollutionThe Alternative Estimate addresses this issue by using anestimate of the value of statistical life that is based only on theset of five contingent valuation studies included in the larger setof  studies recommended by Viscusi  as applicable to policyanalysis The mean of the five contingent valuation based VSLestimates is  million  which is approximately percent of the mean value of the full set of  studiesThe second issue is addressed by assuming that the relationshipbetween age and willingnesstopay for fatal risk reductions can beapproximated using an adjustment factor derived from JonesLee The SAB has advised the EPA that the appropriate way toaccount for age differences is to obtain the values for riskreductions from the age groups affected by the risk reductionSeveral studies have found a significant effect of age on the valueof mortality risk reductions expressed by citizens in the UnitedKingdom JonesLee et al  JonesLee  JonesLeeTwo of these studies provide the basis to form ratios of the WTPof different age cohorts to a base age cohort of  years Theseratios can be used to provide Alternative ageadjusted estimates ofthe value of avoided premature mortalities One problem with bothof the JonesLee studies is that they examine VSL for a limited agerange They then fit VSL as a function of age and extrapolateoutside the range of the data to obtain ratios for the very oldUnfortunately because VSL is specified as quadratic in ageextrapolation beyond the range of the data can lead to a verysevere decline in VSL at ages beyond A simpler and potentially less biased approach is to simplyapply a single age adjustment based on whether the individual wasover or under  years of age at the time of death This isconsistent with the range of observed ages in the JonesLee studiesand also agrees with the findings of more recent studies byKrupnick et al  that the only significant difference in WTPis between the over  and under  age groups To correct for thepotential extrapolation error for ages beyond  the adjustmentfactor is selected as the ratio of a  year old individuals WTPto a  year old individuals WTP which is  based on theJonesLee  results and  based on the JonesLee results To show the maximum impact of the age adjustment theAlternative Estimate is based on the JonesLee  adjustmentfactor of  which yields a VSL of  million for populationsover the age of  Deaths of individuals under the age of  arevalued using the unadjusted mean VSL value of  million Since these are acute mortalities it is assumed that there is nolag between reduced exposure and reduced risk of mortalityJonesLee and Krupnick may understate the effect of age becausethey only control for income and do not control for wealth Whilethere is no empirical evidence to support or reject hypothesesregarding wealth and observed WTP WTP for additional life years bythe elderly may in part reflect their wealth position vis a vismiddle age respondentsThe third issue is addressed by assuming that deaths fromchronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD are advanced by months and deaths from all other causes are advanced by  yearsThese reductions in life years lost are applied regardless of theage at death Actuarial evidence suggests that individuals withserious preexisting cardiovascular conditions have a remaining lifeexpectancy of around  years While many deaths from daily exposureto PM may occur in individuals with cardiovascular disease studieshave shown relationships between all cause mortality and PM andbetween PM and mortality from pneumonia Schwartz  Inaddition recent studies have shown a relationship between PM andnonfatal heart attacks which suggests that some of the deaths dueto PM may be due to fatal heart attacks Peters et al  Anda recent metaanalysis has shown little effect of age on therelative risk from PM exposure Stieb et al  which suggeststhat the number of deaths in nonelderly populations and thus thepotential for greater loss of life years may be significantIndeed this analysis estimates that  percent of nonCOPDpremature deaths avoided are in populations under  Thus whilethe assumption of  years of life lost may be appropriate for asubset of total avoided premature mortalities it may over orunderestimate the degree of life shortening attributable to PM forthe remaining deathsIn order to value the expected life years lost for COPD andnonCOPD deaths we need to construct estimates of the value of astatistical life year The value of a life year varies based on theage at death due to the differences in the base VSL between the and older population and the under  population The valuationapproach used is a value of statistical life years VSLY approachbased on amortizing the base VSL for each age cohort Previousapplications have arrived at a single value per life year based onthe discounted stream of values that correspond to the VSL for a year old worker US EPA a This assumes  years of lifelost is the base value associated with the mean VSL value of million  The VSLY associated with the  million VSL is annualized assuming EPAs guideline value of a  percentdiscount rate or  annualized assuming OMBs guidelinevalue of a  percent discount rate The VSL applied in thisanalysis is then built up from that VSLY by taking the presentvalue of the stream of life years again assuming a  discountrate Thus if you assume that a  yearold dying from pneumoniawould lose  years of life the VSL applied to that death would be million For populations over age  we then develop a VSLYfrom the ageadjusted base VSL of  million Given an assumedremaining life expectancy of  years this gives a VSLY of assuming a  percent discount rate Again the VSL isbuilt based on the present value of  years of lost life so inthis case we have a  year old individual dying from pneumonialosing  years of life implying an estimated VSL of  millionAs a final step these estimated VSL values are multiplied by theappropriate adjustment factors to account for changes in WTP overtime as outlined aboveApplying the VSLY approach to the four categories of acutemortality results in four separate sets of values for an avoidedpremature mortality based on age and cause of death NonCOPDdeaths for populations aged  and older are valued at  millionper incidence in  and  million in  NonCOPD deathsfor populations aged  and younger are valued at  million perincidence in  and  million in  COPD deaths forpopulations aged  and older are valued at  million perincidence in  and  million in  Finally COPD deathsfor populations aged  and younger are valued at  millionper incidence in  and  million in  The implied VSLfor younger populations is less than that for older populationsbecause the value per life year is higher for older populationsSince we assume that there is a year loss in life years for a PMrelated mortality regardless of the age of person dying thisnecessarily leads to a lower VSL for younger populationsValuation of Avoided Cases of Chronic Bronchitis Base EstimateThe best available estimate of WTP to avoid a case of chronicbronchitis CB comes from Viscusi et al  The Viscusi etal study however describes a severe case of CB to the surveyrespondents We therefore employ an estimate of WTP to avoid apollutionrelated case of CB based on adjusting the Viscusi etal  estimate of the WTP to avoid a severe case This is doneto account for the likelihood that an average case ofpollutionrelated CB is not as severe The adjustment is made byapplying the elasticity of WTP with respect to severity reported inthe Krupnick and Cropper  study Details of this adjustmentprocedure can be found in the HeavyDuty EngineDiesel Fuel RIA andits supporting documentation and in the most recent Section study EPA We use the mean of a distribution of WTP estimates as thecentral tendency estimate of WTP to avoid a pollutionrelated caseof CB in this analysis The distribution incorporates uncertaintyfrom three sources  the WTP to avoid a case of severe CB asdescribed by Viscusi et al  the severity level of an averagepollutionrelated case of CB relative to that of the casedescribed by Viscusi et al and  the elasticity of WTP withrespect to severity of the illness Based on assumptions about thedistributions of each of these three uncertain components wederive a distribution of WTP to avoid a pollutionrelated case ofCB by statistical uncertainty analysis techniques The expectedvalue ie mean of this distribution which is about  is taken as the central tendency estimate of WTP to avoida PMrelated case of CB Alternative EstimateFor the Alternative Estimate a costof illness value is used inplace of willingnesstopay to reflect uncertainty about the valueof reductions in incidences of chronic bronchitis In the BaseEstimate the willingnesstopay estimate was derived from twocontingent valuation studies Viscusi et al  Krupnick andCropper  These studies were experimental studies intended toexamine new methodologies for eliciting values for morbidityendpoints Although these studies were not specifically designedfor policy analysis the SAB EPASABCOUNCILADV  hasindicated that the severityadjusted values from this study providereasonable estimates of the WTP for avoidance of chronicbronchitis As with other contingent valuation studies thereliability of the WTP estimates depends on the methods used toobtain the WTP values In order to investigate the impact of usingthe CV based WTP estimates the Alternative Estimate relies on avalue for incidence of chronic bronchitis using a costofillnessestimate based Cropper and Krupnick  which calculates thepresent value of the lifetime expected costs associated with theillness The current costofillness COI estimate for chronicbronchitis is around  per case compared with the currentWTP estimate of Valuation of Changes in VisibilityEstimating benefits for visibility is a more difficult and lessprecise exercise than estimating health benefits because theendpoints are not directly or indirectly valued in markets Thecontingent valuation CV method has been employed in the economicsliterature to value endpoint changes for visibility Chestnut andRowe a b Chestnut and Dennis  The CV methodvalues endpoints by using carefully structured surveys to ask asample of people what amount of compensation is equivalent to agiven change in environmental quality There is an extensivescientific literature and body of practice on both the theory andtechnique of CV The EPA believes that welldesigned andwellexecuted CV studies are valid for estimating the benefits ofair quality regulation Individuals value visibility both in the places they live andwork referred to as residential visibility and in the placesthey travel to for recreational purposes referred to asrecreational visibility Although CV studies that address bothtypes of visibility exist in our analysis we rely only onrecreational visibility studies as explained further belowWe considered benefits from two categories of visibilitychanges residential visibility and recreational visibilityResidential visibility benefits are those that occur fromvisibility changes in urban suburban and rural areas and also inrecreational areas not listed as federal Class I areas For thepurposes of this analysis recreational visibility improvements aredefined as those that occur specifically in federal Class I areasA key distinction between recreational and residential benefits isthat only those people living in residential areas are assumed toreceive benefits from residential visibility while all householdsin the US are assumed to derive some benefit from improvements inClass I areasOnly two existing studies provide defensible monetary estimatesof the value of visibilityConcerns about the reliability of value estimates from CVstudies arose because research has shown that bias can beintroduced easily into these studies if they are not carefullyconducted Accurately measuring WTP for avoided health and welfarelosses depends on the reliability and validity of the datacollected There are several issues to consider when evaluatingstudy quality including but not limited to  whether the sampleestimates of WTP are representative of the population WTP whether the good to be valued is comprehended and accepted by therespondent  whether the WTP elicitation format is designed tominimize strategic responses  whether WTP is sensitive torespondent familiarity with the good to the size of the change inthe good and to income  whether the estimates of WTP arebroadly consistent with other estimates of WTP for similar goodsand  the extent to which WTP responses are consistent withestablished economic principlesThe Clean Air Act designates  national parks and wildernessareas as Class I areas for visibility protectionchanges One is a study on residential visibility conducted in McClelland et al  and the other is a  survey onrecreational visibility value Chestnut and Rowe a bBoth utilize the contingent valuation method There has been agreat deal of controversy and significant development of boththeoretical and empirical knowledge about how to conduct CV surveysin the past decade In EPAs judgment the Chestnut and Rowe studycontains many of the elements of a valid CV study and issufficiently reliable to serve as the basis for monetary estimatesof the benefits of visibility changes in recreational areas Thisstudy serves as an essential input to our estimates of the benefitsof recreational visibility improvements Consistent with SABadvice the EPA has designated the McClelland et al study assignificantly less reliable for regulatory benefitcost analysisalthough it does provide useful estimates on the order of magnitudeof residential visibility benefits EPASABCOUNCILADV Residential visibility benefits are therefore only includedas part of our sensitivity tests The methods for this calculationare similar to the procedure for recreational benefitsThe Chestnut and Rowe study measured the demand for visibilityin Class I areas managed by the National Park Service NPS inthree broad regions of the country California the Southwest andthe Southeast Respondents in five states were asked about theirwillingness to pay to protect national parks or NPSmanagedwilderness areas within a particular region The survey usedphotographs reflecting different visibility levels in the specifiedrecreational areas The visibility levels in these photographs werelater converted to deciviews for the current analysis The surveydata collected were used to estimate a WTP equation for improvedvisibility In addition to the visibility change variable theestimating equation also included household income as anexplanatory variableThe Chestnut and Rowe study did not measure values forvisibility improvement in Class I areas outside the three regionsTheir study covered  of the  Class I areas in the US We caninfer the value of visibility changes in the other Class I areas bytransferring values of visibility changes at Class I areas in thestudy regions However these values are not as defensible and arethus presented only as a sensitivity calculationThe estimated relationship from the Che stnut and Rowe study isonly directly applicable to the populations represented by surveyrespondents We used benefits transfer methods to extrapolate theseresults to the population affected by the Clear Skies Act Ageneral willingnessAn SAB advisory letter indicates that many members of theCouncil believe that the Chestnut and Rowe study is the bestavailable EPASABCOUNCILADV  However thecommittee did not formally approve use of these estimates becauseof concerns about the peerreviewed status of the study EPAbelieves the study has received adequate review and has been citedin numerous peerreviewed publications Chestnut and Dennisto pay equation for improved visibility measured in deciviewswas developed as a function of the baseline level of visibilitythe magnitude of the visibility improvement and household incomeThe behavioral parameters of this equation were taken from analysisof the Chestnut and Rowe data These parameters were used tocalibrate WTP for the visibility changes resulting from the ClearSkies Act The method for developing calibrated WTP functions isbased on the approach developed by Smith et al  Availableevidence indicates that households are willing to pay more for agiven visibility improvement as their income increases Chestnut The benefits estimates here incorporate Chestnuts estimatethat a one percent increase in income is associated with a percent increase in WTP for a given change in visibilityFor the sensitivity test calculation for residential visibilitythe McClelland et al studys results were used to calculate theparameter to measure the effect of deciview changes on WTP The WTPequation was then run for the population affected by the ClearSkies ActAgricultural BenefitsThe Ozone Criteria Document notes that ozone affects vegetationthroughout the United States impairing crops native vegetationand ecosystems more than any other air pollutant US EPA Reduced levels of groundlevel ozone resulting from the final ClearSkies Act will have generally beneficial results on agriculturalcrop yields and commercial forest growth Welldeveloped techniquesexist to provide monetary estimates of these benefits toagricultural producers and consumers These techniques use modelsof planting decisions yield response functions and agriculturalproduct supply and demand The resulting welfare measures are basedon predicted changes in market prices and production costsLaboratory and field experiments have shown reductions in yieldsfor agronomic crops exposed to ozone including vegetables eglettuce and field crops eg cotton and wheat The mostextensive field experiments conducted under the National Crop LossAssessment Network NCLAN examined  species and numerouscultivars The NCLAN results show that several economicallyimportant crop species are sensitive to ozone levels typical ofthose found in the US US EPA  In addition economicstudies have shown a relationship between observed ozone levels andcrop yields Garcia et al To estimate changes in crop yields we used biologicalexposureresponse information derived from controlled experimentsconducted by the NCLAN NCLAN  For the purpose of ouranalysis we analyze changes for the six most economicallysignificant crops for which CR functions are available corncotton peanuts sorghum soybean and winter wheat For somecrops there are multiple CR functions some more sensitive toozone and some less Our estimate assumes that crops are evenlymixed between relatively sensitive and relatively insensitivevarietiesWe analyzed the economic value

set ofstatistically The total value for these crops in  was  billionestimated demand and supply equations for agriculturalcommodities produced in the United States The model is capable ofanalyzing the effects of changes in policies that affect commoditycrop yields or production costsThe measure of benefits calculated by the model is the netchange in consumer and producer surplus from baseline ozoneconcentrations to the ozone concentrations resulting fromattainment of particular standards Using the baseline andpostcontrol equilibria the model calculates the change in netconsumer and producer surplus on a cropbycrop basis Dollarvalues are aggregated across crops for each standard The totaldollar value represents a measure of the change in social welfareassociated with implementation of the Clear Skies ActAdjustments for Changes in Income Over TimeRecent SAB deliberations on mortality and morbidity valuationapproaches suggest that some adjustments to unit values areappropriate to reflect economic theory EPASABEEAC As noted above we apply one adjustment by discounting laggedmortality incidence effects A second adjustment is conducted aspart of the mortality morbidity and visibility valuationprocedures to incorporate the effect of changes in income over timeon WTP To estimate the effects of changes in income over time weuse a procedure originally outlined in Appendix H of the Section Prospective Report to Congress EPA  That procedure usesper capita income estimates generated from Federal Governmentprojections of income and population growth and applies threedifferent income elasticities for mortality severe morbidity andlight symptom effectsBenefits for each of the categories  minor health effectssevere and chronic health effects which include chronic bronchitisand premature mortality and visibility  were adjusted bymultiplying the unadjusted benefits by the appropriate adjustmentfactor listed in Exhibit  belowAGSIM is designed to forecast agricultural supply and demandout to  We were not able to adapt the model to forecast out to Instead we apply percentage increases in yields fromdecreased ambient ozone levels in  to  yield levels

other health and welfareendpoints in the length of the assumed ozone season Foragriculture the ozone season is assumed to extend from April toSeptember This assumption is made to ensure proper calculation ofthe ozone statistic used in the exposureresponse functions Theonly crop affected by changes in ozone during April is winterwheat Note that the Environmental Economics Advisory CommitteeEEAC of the SAB advised EPA to adjust WTP for increases in realincome over time but not to adjust WTP to account forcrosssectional income differences because of the sensitivity ofmaking such distinctions and because of insufficient evidenceavailable at present EPASABEEACExhibit  Adjustment Factors Used to Account for Projected RealIncome Growth through  and Benefit Adjustment Factor

are based on a methodthat reflects peerreviewed data models and approaches that areapplied to support EPA rulemakings and generate Reports to Congresson the benefits of air pollution regulation Although EPA has madea concerted effort to apply wellaccepted methods there remainsignificant uncertainties in the estimation of these benefitsThere are three types of uncertainty that affect theseestimatesIn the remainder of this section we discuss the major sourcesof each of these three categories of uncertainty related to theestimate of avoided health effects avoided ecological effects andmonetary valuation of these benefits Our analysis of the ClearSkies Act has not included formal uncertainty analyses although wehave conducted several sensitivity tests and have analyzed a fullAlternative EstimateUncertainties Associated with Health Benefit EstimatesWithinStudy VariationWithinstudy variation refers to the precision with which agiven study estimates the relationship between air quality changesand health effects Health effects studies provide both a bestestimate of this relationship plus a measure of the statisticaluncertainty of the relationship This size of this uncertaintydepends on factors such as the number of subjects studied and thesize of the effect being measured The results of even the mostwell designed epidemiological studies are characterized by thistype of uncertainty though welldesigned studies typically reportnarrower uncertainty bounds around the best estimate than dostudies of lesser quality In selecting health endpoints wegenerally focus on endpoints where a statistically significantrelationship has been observed which by definition assures areasonablytight confidence interval around the best estimate of the meanconcentrationresponse relationshipAcrossstudy VariationAcrossstudy variation refers to the fact that differentpublished studies of the same pollutanthealth effect relationshiptypically do not report identical findings in some instances thedifferences are substantial These differences can exist evenbetween equally reputable studies and may result in health effectestimates that vary considerably Acrossstudy variation can resultfrom two possible causes One possibility is that studies reportdifferent estimates of the single true relationship between a givenpollutant and a health effect due to differences in study designrandom chance or other factors For example a hypothetical studyconducted in New York and one conducted in Seattle may reportdifferent CR functions for the relationship between PM andmortality in part because of differences between these two studypopulations eg demographics activity patterns Alternativelystudy results may differ because these two studies are in factestimating different relationships that is the same reduction inPM in New York and Seattle may result in different reductions inpremature mortality This may result from a number of factors suchas differences in the relative sensitivity of these two populationsto PM pollution and differences in the composition of PM in thesetwo locations In either case where we identified multiplestudies that are appropriate for estimating a given health effectwe generated a pooled estimate of results from each of thosestudiesApplication of CR Relationship NationwideWhether this analysis estimated the CR relationship between apollutant and a given health endpoint using a single function froma single study or using multiple CR functions from severalstudies each CR relationship was applied uniformly throughout theUS to generate health benefit estimates However to the extentthat pollutanthealth effect relationships are regionspecificapplying a locationspecific CR function at all locations in theUS may result in overestimates of health effect changes in somelocations and underestimates of health effect changes in otherlocations It is not possible however to know the extent ordirection of the overall effect on health benefit estimatesintroduced by application of a single CR function to the entireUS This may be a significant uncertainty in the analysis but thecurrent state of the scientific literature does not allow for aregionspecific estimation of health benefitsUncertainties in the PM Mortality RelationshipHealth researchers have consistently linked air pollutionespecially PM with excess mortality A substantial body ofpublished scientific literature recognizes a correlation betweenelevated PM concentrations and increased mortality rates Howeverthere is much about this relationship that is still uncertainThese uncertainties include PM is a mix of particles of varying size and chemicalproperties The composition of PM can vary considerably from oneregion to another depending on the sources of particulate emissionsin each regionThe morbidity studies used in the Clear Skies Act benefitsanalysis may also be subject to many of the uncertainties listed inthis section Much of this literature is summarized in the  PM CriteriaDocument US EPA a There is much about this relationshipthat is still uncertain As stated in preamble to the  PMNational Ambient Air Quality Standards  CFR   theconsistency of the results of the epidemiological studies from alarge number of different locations and the coherent nature of theobserved effects are suggestive of a likely causal role of ambientPM in contributing to the reported effects which includepremature mortality The National Academy of Sciences in theirreport on research priorities for PM NAS  indicates thatthere is a great deal of uncertainty about the implications of thefindings of an association between PM and premature mortality forrisk management due to the limited scientific information aboutthe specific types of particles that might cause adverse healtheffects the contributions of particles of outdoor origin to actualhuman exposures the toxicological mechanisms by which theparticles might cause adverse health effects and other importantquestions EPA acknowledges these uncertainties however for thisanalysis we assume a causal relationship between exposure toelevated PM and premature mortality based on the consistentevidence of a correlation between PM and mortality reported in thescientific literaturerelationship independent of that for PM However most of thestudies examined by Ito and Thurston only controlled for PM orbroader measures of particles and did not directly control forPM As such there may still be potential for confounding ofPM and ozone mortality effects as ozone and PM are highlycorrelated during summer months in some areas In its September advisory on the draft analytical blueprint for the secondSection  prospective analysis the SAB cited the Thurston andIto study as a significant advance in understanding the effects ofozone on daily mortality and recommended reevaluation of the ozonemortality endpoint for inclusion in the next prospective studyEPASABCOUNCILADV  Thus recent evidence suggeststhat by not including an estimate of reductions in shorttermmortality due to changes in ambient ozone both the Base andAlternative Estimates may underestimate the benefits ofimplementation of the Clear Skies ActC Shape of the CR Function The shape of the true PM mortalityCR function is uncertain but this analysis assumes the CRfunction to have a loglinear form as derived from the literaturethroughout the relevant range of exposures If this is not thecorrect form of the CR function or if certain scenarios predictconcentrations well above the range of values for which the CRfunction was fitted avoided mortality may be misestimatedC Regional Differences As discussed above significantvariability exists in the results of different PMmortalitystudies This variability may reflect regionally specific CRfunctions resulting from regional differences in factors such asthe physical and chemical composition of PM If true regionaldifferences exist applying the PMMortality CR function toregions outside the study location could result in misestimationof effects in these regionsC ExposureMortality Lags It is currently unknown whether thereis a time lag  a delay between changes in PM exposures andchanges in mortality rates  in the chronic PMmortalityrelationship The existence of such a lag is important for thevaluation of premature mortality incidence because economic theorysuggests that benefits occurring in the future should bediscounted There is no specific scientific evidence of theexistence or structure of a PM effects lag However currentscientific literature on adverse health effects similar to thoseassociated with PM eg smokingrelated disease and thedifference in the effect size between chronic exposure studies anddaily mortality studies suggest that all incidences of prematuremortality reduction associated with a given incremental change inPM exposure probably would not occur in the same year as theexposure reduction The smokingrelated literature also impliesthat lags of up to a few years are plausible Adopting the lagstructure used in the Tier Gasoline Sulfur and HeavyDutyEngineDiesel Fuel RIAs and endorsed by the SABEPASABCOUNCILADV  we assume a fiveyear lagstructure This approach assumes that  percent of PMrelatedpremature deaths occur in each of the first two years after theexposure and the rest occur in equal parts approximately  ineach of the ensuing three yearsC Cumulative Effects As a general point we attribute thePMmortality relationship in the Shortterm ozone mortality risk estimates may also beaffected by the statistical issue discovered by the Health EffectsInstitute Greenbaum a See page  for a more detaileddiscussion of this issueunderlying epidemiological studies to cumulative exposure to PMHowever the relative roles of PM exposure duration and PM exposurelevel in inducing premature mortality remain unknown at thistimeUncertainties Associated with Environmental and EcosystemEffects EstimationOur analysis of the Clear Skies Act includes a quantitativeestimate of only two environmental effects recreational visibilityand ozone effects on agriculture Scientific studies however havereliably linked atmospheric emissions of sulfur nitrogen andmercury to a much wider range of other environmental and ecologicaleffects Some of these effects are acute in nature and some arelongerterm and could take many years to manifest The effectsinclude the followingThese effects are left unquantified for a variety of reasonsbut mostly because of the complexity of modeling these effects andthe major uncertainties in reliably quantifying the incrementaleffects of atmospheric emissions reductions on ecologicalendpointsIndividually many of these environmental effects may berelatively small in terms of their overall ecosystem and monetaryimportance particularly in the nearterm Their cumulative andlonger term effects however some of which may be largely unknownat this time may be substantial As a result the omission of thisbroad class of benefits from our quantitative results likely causesour estimates to substantially understate the total benefits of theClear Skies ActUncertainties Associated with Economic Valuation ofBenefitsEconomic valuation of benefits often involves estimation of thewillingnesstopay of individuals to avoid harmful health orenvironmental effects In most cases there are no markets in whichto directly observe WTP for these types of commodities In somecases we can rely on indirect market transactions such as theimplicit tradeoff of wages for onthejob mortality risk among theworking population to estimate WTP In other cases we must relyon survey approaches to estimate WTP usually through a variant ofthe contingent valuation approach which generally involvesdirectly questioning respondents for their WTP in hypotheticalmarket situations Regardless of the method used to estimate WTPthere are measurement errors data inadequacies and ongoingdebates about the best practices for each method that contribute tothe overall uncertainty of economic estimatesGeneral Benefits Transfer ConsiderationsFor the Clear Skies benefits analysis we do not have the timeor resources to conduct primary economic research targeted at thespecific air pollutionrelated benefits provided As a result werely on the transfer of benefits estimates from existing studiesThe conduct of benefits transfer exercises necessarily involvessome uncertainties These uncertainties can be reduced by carefulconsideration of the differences in the health risk or airpollution commodity and the study populations in the underlyingeconomic literature versus the context of benefits conferred by theClear Skies Act For example we make adjustments to the mortalityvaluation estimates to account for the estimated lag betweenexposure and manifestation of the effect reflecting the basiceconomic tenet that individuals prefer benefits that occur soonerto those that occur later We also make adjustments to account forexpected changes in WTP over time as per capita income increasesWe cannot adjust for all benefits transfer considerations howeverthus introducing additional uncertainty into our estimatesLack of Adequate Data or MethodsThe lack of adequate data or methods to characterize WTP resultsin our inability to present monetized benefits of some categoriesof effects For example while studies exist that estimate thebenefits of visibility improvements to individuals in the placesthey reside these residential visibility studies are considered bysome in the resource economics community to be less reliablebecause of the methods applied In the case of residentialvisibility we conduct sensitivity analyses to estimate the impactof this uncertainty in the reliability of methods To the extenteffects such as these represent categories of benefits that aretruly valuable to the US population we have underestimated thetotal benefits of the Clear Skies ActUncertainties Specific to Premature Mortality ValuationThe economic benefits associated with premature mortality arethe largest category of monetized benefits of the Clear SkiesAct In addition in prior analyses EPA has identified valuationof mortality benefits as the largest contributor to the range ofuncertainty in monetizedAs noted in the methods section it is actually reductions inmortality risk that are valued in a monetized benefit analysisIndividual WTPs for small reductions in mortality risk are summedover enough individuals to infer the value of a statistical lifesaved This is different from the value of a particular identifiedlife saved The value of a premature death avoided then shouldbe understood as shorthand for the value of a statisticalpremature death avoidedbenefits see USEPA a Because of the uncertainty inestimates of the value of premature mortality avoidance it isimportant to adequately characterize and understand the varioustypes of economic approaches available for mortality valuationSuch an assessment also requires an understanding of howalternative valuation approaches reflect that some individuals maybe more susceptible to air pollutioninduced mortality or reflectdifferences in the nature of the risk presented by air pollutionrelative to the risks studied in the relevant economicliteratureThe health science literature on air pollution indicates thatseveral human characteristics affect the degree to which mortalityrisk affects an individual For example some age groups appear tobe more susceptible to air pollution than others eg the elderlyand children Health status prior to exposure also affectssusceptibility At risk individuals include those who have sufferedstrokes or are suffering from cardiovascular disease and anginaRowlatt et al  An ideal benefits estimate of mortalityrisk reduction would reflect these human characteristics inaddition to an individuals willingness to pay WTP to improveones own chances of survival plus WTP to improve otherindividuals survival rates The ideal measure would also takeinto account the specific nature of the risk reduction commoditythat is provided to individuals as well as the context in whichrisk is reduced To measure this value it is important to assesshow reductions in air pollution reduce the risk of dying from thetime that reductions take effect onward and how individuals valuethese changes Each individuals survival curve or the probabilityof surviving beyond a given age should shift as a result of anenvironmental quality improvement For example changing thecurrent probability of survival for an individual also shiftsfuture probabilities of that individuals survival Thisprobability shift will differ across individuals because survivalcurves are dependent on such characteristics as age health stateand the current age to which the individual is likely tosurviveAlthough a survival curve approach provides a theoreticallypreferred method for valuing the benefits of reduced risk ofpremature mortality associated with reducing air pollution theapproach requires a great deal of data to implement The economicvaluation literature does not yet include good estimates of thevalue of this risk reduction commodity As a result in this studywe value avoided premature mortality risk using the value ofstatistical life approach in the Base Estimate supplemented byvaluation based on an ageadjusted value of statistical lifeestimate in the Alternative EstimateOther uncertainties specific to premature mortality valuationinclude the followingAcrossstudy Variation The analytical procedure used in themain analysis to estimate the monetary benefits of avoidedpremature mortality assumes that the appropriate economic value foreach incidence is a value from the currently accepted range of thevalue of a statistical life This estimate is based on  studiesof the value of mortal risks There is considerable uncertainty asto whether the  studies on the value of a statistical lifeprovide adequate estimates of the value of a statistical life savedby air pollution reduction Although there is considerablevariation in the analytical designs and data used in the underlying studies the majority of the studies involve the valueof risks to a middleaged working population Most of the studiesexamine differences in wages of risky occupations using awagehedonic approach Certain characteristics of both the For a more detailed discussion of altruistic values relatedto the value of life see JonesLee population affected and the mortality risk facing thatpopulation are believed to affect the average willingness to payWTP to reduce the risk The appropriateness of a distribution ofWTP estimates from the  studies for valuing the mortalityrelatedbenefits of reductions in air pollution concentrations thereforedepends not only on the quality of the studies ie how well theymeasure what they are trying to measure but also on  theextent to which the risks being valued are similar and  theextent to which the subjects in the studies are similar to thepopulation affected by changes in pollution concentrationsC Level of risk reduction The transferability of estimates ofthe value of a statistical life from the  studies to the ClearSkies Act analysis rests on the assumption that within areasonable range WTP for reductions in mortality risk is linear inrisk reduction For example suppose a study estimates that theaverage WTP for a reduction in mortality risk of  is but that the actual mortality risk reduction resulting from a givenpollutant reduction is  If WTP for reductions in mortalityrisk is linear in risk reduction then a WTP of  for a reductionof  implies a WTP of  for a risk reduction of which is ten times the risk reduction valued in the study Underthe assumption of linearity the estimate of the value of astatistical life does not depend on the particular amount of riskreduction being valued This assumption has been shown to bereasonable provided the change in the risk being valued is withinthe range of risks evaluated in the underlying studies Rowlatt etal C Voluntariness of risks evaluated Although there may beseveral ways in which jobrelated mortality risks differ from airpollutionrelated mortality risks the most important differencemay be that jobrelated risks are incurred voluntarily orgenerally assumed to be whereas air pollutionrelated risks areincurred involuntarily There is some evidence that people willpay more to reduce involuntarily incurred risks than risks incurredvoluntarily If this is the case WTP estimates based on wageriskstudies may understate WTP to reduce involuntarily incurred airpollutionrelated mortality risksC Sudden versus protracted death A final important differencerelated to the nature of the risk may be that some workplacemortality risks tend to involve sudden catastrophic eventswhereas air pollutionrelated risks tend to involve longer periodsof disease and suffering prior to death Some evidence suggeststhat WTP to avoid a risk of a protracted death involving prolongedsuffering and loss of dignity and personal control is greater thanthe WTP to avoid a risk of identical magnitude of sudden deathTo the extent that the mortality risks addressed in this assessmentare associated with longer periods of

scenarios Exhibit  presents the meanestimate of avoided health effects in  and  for each healthendpoint included in the Base analysis We estimate that reductionsin exposure to fine PM and ozone due to the Clear Skies Act willresult in over  fewer deaths in  and nearly  fewerdeaths in  as well as nearly  fewer cases of chronicbronchitis in  and over  fewer cases in  In addition fewer asthma attacks are estimated to occur in  and fewer in  Exhibit  summarizes the mean monetizedhealth and visibility benefits due to the Clear Skies Act As thatexhibit shows we estimate the monetized benefits of the ClearSkies Act in the continental United States will be  billion in including  billion in health benefits and  billion inrecreational visibility benefits In  total benefits increaseto  billion with

arerealized in the easternmost  states including the states ofNorth Dakota South Dakota Nebraska Kansas Oklahoma and TexasWe estimate total benefits of  billion in these  states in and  billion in In addition to calculating the physical effects and monetaryimpacts of the Clear Skies Act we also estimated the distributionof particulate matter air quality improvements that will beexperienced by the US population Exhibit  illustrates thenumbers of individuals and the percent of the US population thatthey represent that will experience changes in ambient particulatematter concentrations in  and

roundingSensitivity AnalysesThe Base Estimate is based on our current interpretation of thescientific and economic literature its judgments regarding thebest available data models and modeling methodologies and theassumptions it considers most appropriate to adopt in the face ofimportant uncertainties The majority of the analytical assumptionsused to develop the Base Estimate have been reviewed and approvedby EPAs Science Advisory Board SAB However we recognize thatdata and modeling limitations as well as simplifying assumptionscan introduce significant uncertainty into the benefit results andthat reasonable alternative assumptions exist for some inputs tothe analysis such as the mortality CR functionsTo address these concerns we supplement our Base Estimate ofbenefits with a series of sensitivity calculations that make use ofother sources of concentrationresponse and valuation data for keybenefits categories These sensitivity calculations are conductedonly for the Base Estimate and not for the Alternative EstimateFirst we applied three alternative concentrationresponse CRfunctions to estimate premature mortality incidence Although weused the Krewski et al  meanbased PMDC AllCauses model exclusively to derive our Base Estimate of avoidedpremature mortality this analysis also examined the sensitivity ofthe benefit results to the selection of alternative CR functionsfor premature mortality We used three sources of alternative CRfunctions for this sensitivity analysis  an alternativespecification of the PopeACS model from Krewski et al that adjusted for spatial correlation in the dataset  theoriginal PopeACS model and  the Krewski et al Harvard SixCities estimate Exhibits  and  present the results of thesesensitivity analyses for  and  respectivelyThe first alternative CR function is based on the relative riskof  from the Fine Particles Alone Regional Adjustment RandomEffects model reported in Table  of the HEI report Commentaryby an independent review panel noted that a major contribution ofthe HEI Reanalysis Project is the recognition that both pollutantvariables and mortality appear to be spatially correlated in theACS data set If not identified and modeled correctly spatialcorrelation could cause substantial errors in both the regressioncoefficients and their standard errors HEI  This CRfunction is a reasonable specification to explore the impact ofadjustments for broad regional correlations However the HEIreport noted that the spatial adjustment methods may have overadjusted the estimated effect for regional pollutants such as fineparticles and sulfate compared with the effect estimates for morelocal pollutants such as sulfur dioxide Thus the estimates ofavoided incidences of premature mortality based on this CRfunction may underestimate the true effect Note that this CRfunction is based on the original air quality dataset used in theACS study covering  cities and used the median PM levelsrather than mean PM as the indicator of exposureFor comparison with earlier benefits analyses such as the firstSection  Prospective Analysis we also include estimates ofavoided incidences of premature mortality based on theoriginal ACSPope et al  analysis in the second row ofExhibit  and  The third row of Exhibit  shows the Krewskiet al Harvard Six Cities estimate of mortality TheKrewskiHarvard Six Cities study used a smaller sample ofindividuals from fewer cities than the study by Pope et alhowever it features improved exposure estimates a slightlybroader study population adults aged  and older and afollowup period nearly twice as long as that of Pope et al TheSAB has noted that the Harvard Six Cities study had bettermonitoring with less measurement error than did most other studiesEPASABCOUNCILADV Second we use an alternative valuation procedure to estimatethe value of avoided premature mortality with explicitconsideration of the expected age of mortality incidence associatedwith air pollution exposure Agespecific VSL adjustment factorscan be derived from a series of contingent valuation studiesconducted in the United Kingdom to evaluate WTP for road safetyimprovements that reduce mortality risk The two available sourcesboth authored by Michael JonesLee derive significantly differingadjustment factors and reflect reflecting the overall uncertaintywithin the literature about agespecific VSL adjustments Theresults of this alternative calculation reduce the overall BaseEstimate for the Clear Skies Act by  percent for the more extremeadjustment derived from JonesLee  and by  percent for theless extreme adjustment derived from JonesLee  assummarized in Exhibits  and  below The specific adjustmentprocedure applied is described in more detail in the HeavyDutyEngineDiesel Fuel RIA US EPA bThird as noted in the section above on visibility valuation wechose not to include in our Base Estimate the valuation ofresidential visibility or valuation of recreational visibility atClass I areas outside of the study regions examined in the Chestnutand Rowe a b study The last three rows of Exhibits and  summarize

finding that older people value mortality risk reductions onlysomewhat less than middleaged peopleFourth we conducted a quantitative sensitivity test on oneaspect of the PMmortality doseresponse function Although theconsistent advice from EPAs Science Advisory Board has been tomodel premature mortality associated with PM exposure as anonthreshold effect that is with harmful effects to exposedpopulations regardless of the absolute level of ambient PMconcentrations some analysts have hypothesized the presence of athreshold relationship The nature of the hypothesized relationshipis that there might exist a PM concentration level below whichfurther reductions no longer yield premature mortality reductionbenefits EPA does not necessarily endorse any particularthreshold Nonetheless Exhibit  illustrates how our estimates ofthe number of premature mortalities in the Base Estimate mightchange under a range of alternative assumptions for a PM mortalitythreshold If for example there were no benefits of reducing PMconcentrations below the proposed PM standard of  gm ourestimate of the total number of premature mortalities in  wouldbe reduced by approximately  percent from approximately annually to approximately  annuallyOne important assumption that we adopted for the thresholdsensitivity analysis is that no adjustments are made to the shapeof the concentrationresponse function above the assumed thresholdInstead thresholds were applied by simply assuming that anychanges in ambient concentrations below the assumed threshold wouldhave no impacts on the incidence of premature mortality If therewere actually a threshold then the shape of the CR function abovethe threshold would likely changeExhibit  Sensitivity Analysis Effect of Thresholds onEstimated  and  Clear
