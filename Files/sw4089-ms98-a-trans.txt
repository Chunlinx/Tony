        hows the quality of air in Portland     very good   really   uh well let me put it this way its its relatively uh its very good if if you are a little bit away from the city and its and its wonderful on days that it rains   umhum   but uh downtown they have a few problems but its   umhum probably a lot of ozone lot of smog   but its fairly localized its not like uh Los Angeles where i used to live   yeah it oh yeah ive heard that Los Angeles is horrible and Denver is i hear is really bad   yes yes uh   Atlantas Atlantas moderately bad um you know we have we have a big problem with ozone um and you know its generally you know its it its quite often you know be a very hazy sort of day you know because therell just be this pollution hanging in the air um i think a lot i think well i think most of our problems caused by automobile emissions because you know its a very you know mobile city   it i guess thats the the major problem with most cities except except places like uh   umhum   oh Mexico City or some place like that well i guess its its a problem there too but but they do have some places where thats caused by power plants and and stuff like that   umhum hm umhum of heavy industry yeah i think i think the  has been you know relatively good about um you know having regulations at least in the last twenty years or so about industry industry pollution but it just seems that i think i think i think we really suffer because you know we dont have any sort of an organized mass transit system any sort of you know like high speed rail or even you know even even you know decent regular passenger rail across the country um it seems it seems like like theres a lot you know theres a lot theres a lot more federal subsidies for automobile you know for through through the construction through the construction of highways for automobiles   yeah although  there is one thing that i uh i learned in in   yeah   chemistry many years ago and thats uh i dont know are are you a chemist   hm i know a little bit of chemistry   okay anyway this is principle called Le Chateliers principal as i remember and its basically uh uh when you have uh a reaction and it it uh  the reaction will go until it until until it kind of comes to a balance but if you take away some of the products of that reaction then the reaction will go farther   umhum umhum umhum   and so uh the illustration that the chemistry teacher pointed out was he said he said in a in a desirable area people will move in until until bad things happen that cause the uh desirabilities to go to   umhum   you know to uh balance kind of balance out he says if its not air pollution itll be   umhum   it will be uh congestion or price of land or something like that so what im looking at here in the Portland area is is a temporary situation its a very desirable area as far as im concerned and uh   umhum umhum umhum   the wonderful air the lack of of uh congestion the low low cost of of uh property uh   umhum   in a few years somethings going to cause i mean theres uh people just going to continue to move in until we either   umhum until just gets the air it cant just it cant support them and the quality of life they want   and and and as many people move in as move out   umhum   and itll come to a balance and then if they come along and they add new freeways so lets say they reduce traffic congestion then air pollution will get bad or something else and thats happened in California thats for sure   umhum umhum umhum umhum   uh as far as in Atlanta do they have a uh do they have uh regulations on on uh like inspection   um they they do have automobile automobile emissions tests but um its there theres some sort of rule i dont have a car so i dont know the actual specifics but its like if your your car is if the make if the model model year of your car is like more than twenty years old you dont have to have it inspected any more   yeah the grandfather type thing   you know which is which is just kind of ludicrous you know because those are the ones that youd expect to   yeah   you know be the hardest be the most biggest polluters   although i think thats partly because its harder to get parts and and uh   yeah its true   so lets see what was my other question uh my wife thinks this is uh a uh sales call so shes telling me to talk to you about one of the problems with uh she thinks its from from uh our cable company       uh lets see what else we have uh uh lets see do you live you dont live too close do you live close to the city or far away from it   i basically live downtown   okay downtown   and i go to school at Georgia Tech which is pretty much located in the heart of downtown or within a mile from the heart of downtown   do they have smog days there uh   its i dont think its really announced you know in the sense that the way it the way it is in California but um i have heard on the news in the you know in the past couple of months or so that you know that apparently theres some federal guidelines for um smog and Atlantas like it
