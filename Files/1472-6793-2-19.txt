                    Background        Activitydependent potentiation is the enhancement of        contractile response which occurs as a consequence of        prior activation Staircase the progressive increase in        developed tension DT during low frequency stimulation        and posttetanic potentiation the enhancement of twitch DT        following tetanic stimulation are two common forms of        activitydependent potentiation       It is generally        considered that the enhancement of DT during staircase and        following a tetanic contraction occurs as a result of        phosphorylation of the regulatory light chains of myosin                    It has been reported that there is a lengthdependence        of potentiation in skeletal muscle Experiments conducted        at C have demonstrated that the magnitude of staircase        potentiation is proportional to muscle length with a        negative slope        This is the case whether the        staircase is conducted at the different lengths or the        poststaircase twitch contractions are evaluated at        different lengths after staircase at a given length             Lengthdependence of posttetanic potentiation has been        evaluated         in vitro at room temperature and it        has been reported that there is a lengthdependence of        potentiation with the fractional enhancement of force        being proportional to muscle length with a positive slope                   Considering these studies of lengthdependence of        potentiation it would appear that the impact of muscle        length on the force potentiation of a twitch is different        between staircase and posttetanic potentiation This would        suggest that there is a fundamental difference in the        mechanism of posttetanic potentiation relative to        staircase Alternatively this difference in        lengthdependence could be a function of the different        temperatures at which the experiments were conducted        In this study the lengthdependence of staircase and        posttetanic twitch contraction amplitude was evaluated in        skeletal muscle         in vitro  at room temperature with        measurement of sarcomere length In addition staircase was        assessed at a warmer temperature to permit comparison with        the responses previously done with staircase The results        indicate that there is a lengthdependence of force        modulation in the twitch contraction for both staircase and        posttetanic response and that in both cases the twitch        potentiation is proportional to sarcomere length with a        negative slope Therefore there is no justification for        ascribing a mechanism for posttetanic response that is any        different from the mechanism for staircase                    Results                  Sarcomere length measurements          In many preparations after obtaining a clear laser          diffraction pattern at rest the tracing was lost during          the contractions This was probably caused by          translations of the muscle which resulted in connective          tissue andor adherent damaged fibers moving into the          laser beam preventing a consistent diffraction pattern          Due to this variability of sarcomere length during          contractions all results presented herein are related to          sarcomere length readings made prior to the contractions          passive sarcomere length at one position along the          length of the fiber Results of a given contraction were          included only when the sarcomere length after the          contraction was the same as it was in the beginning          ie the tracing was still clear and without apparent          change                          Forcesarcomere length relation of tetanic          contractions          The forcesarcomere length relation for tetanic          contractions is presented in Figure  The results          obtained at the two temperatures used in this study          depict virtually the same forcelength relation DT             SL  SL r   and DT             SL  SL r   for C and C          respectively The force is plotted relative to the          highest force obtained at any length in a given          experiment By extrapolating the results obtained on the          descending limb of the forcesarcomere length relation          the force appears to decrease to zero at approximately           m   m consistent with previous findings with          intact    or skinned fibers    of EDL muscle of          the rat  m and  m respectively Similar to          previous studies the descending limb of the forcelength          relation shows a shift to the right when compared to the          theoretical predictions based on the length of          myofilaments obtained from ter Keurs et al                              Activitydependent potentiation          Twitch amplitude was evaluated after each of the          following  Hz stimulation for  s at C  Hz          stimulation for  s at room temperature and  Hz for           s at room temperature In each case the amplitude of          the potentiated twitch DT expressed relative to a control          twitch P           t P           t  was proportional to sarcomere          length with a negative slope          When stimulation was  Hz for  s at C there          was a staircase potentiation P           t P           t   which was evident at all          sarcomere lengths studied range   m   m          Figure Aillustrates the lengthtension relation for          twitch contractions obtained at the start and end of  s          of  Hz stimulation at each of  different sarcomere          lengths in a given muscle preparation Two features of          the lengthtension relation should be noted The obvious          point is that enhancement of DT whether expressed in          absolute or relative P           t P           t  terms is much greater at short          sarcomere lengths than at long sarcomere lengths The          second point is that the shape of the lengthtension          relation relative to sarcomere length has shifted such          that optimal length peak of the lengthtension relation          for potentiated contractions is less than optimal length          for nonpotentiated contractions This pattern is apparent          as an increase in DT going from  m to  m          prestaircase as opposed to a decrease over this length          range for poststaircase twitch contractions The relative          enhancement of force P           t P           t  at a variety of sarcomere lengths          is presented in Figure B showing the strong          lengthdependence of the staircase response with very          little potentiation at long sarcomere lengths          Stimulation at  Hz for  s at C always resulted          in potentiation at short sarcomere lengths but          potentiation was not always observed at long sarcomere          lengths A representative experiment is shown in Figure          A There is a shift to the left in the length at which          the peak DT occurs after staircase Figure Bpresents P           t P           t for staircase at a variety of          sarcomere lengths in muscles at C The magnitude of          potentiation at C is less than the magnitude of          potentiation at C but the lengthdependence is still          evident          Twitch contractions following tetanic contractions          were potentiated only at short sarcomere lengths C          At longer sarcomere lengths posttetanic depression was          apparent as the posttetanic twitch was smaller than the          pretetanic twitch P           t P           t   Figure A In studying          posttetanic potentiation the length tension relation for          twitch contractions was obtained with sequential          contractions at different lengths both prior to and          after a tetanic contraction at optimal length For this          reason the lengthtension relation is more clearly          defined in these experiments than in the staircase          experiments for which twitch contractions were obtained          at a given length prior to and after repetitive          stimulation at that sarcomere length In Figure A the          length associated with maximal twitch amplitude is          shifted to the left in the posttetanic contractions In          spite of the posttetanic depression which was evident in          these experiments there was a marked lengthdependence          of the posttetanic twitch amplitude P           t P           t  The ratio of the posttetanic          twitch to the pretetanic one decreased with increased SL          see Figure B                            Discussion                  The forcelength relation          In order to discuss the results regarding the          lengthdependence of potentiation we had to first define          the forcelength relation for the muscle preparation used          in this study The forcelength relation for tetanic          contractions had a descending limb which was deviated to          the right when compared to the theoretical forcelength          relation It also showed an extended plateau where the          force did not decrease until well beyond estimated          optimal filament overlap This extended plateau and          deviation from the theoretical forcelength relation          Gordon et al    has been observed in other studies          that used fixedend contractions       This          augmented force observed at a given sarcomere length is          due either to inhomogeneity of sarcomere lengths or to a          compliance within the muscle or measurement system          Forces that are higher than predicted could be          explained if there is an inhomogeneity of sarcomere          lengths during the contraction as proposed by Gordon et          al     Inhomogeneity has been shown to occur during          tetanic contractions elicited on the descending limb of          the forcelength relation      where some          sarcomeres are being stretched while others are          shortening The sarcomeres that are shortening are likely          situated near the end of the fibers In our study          sarcomeres near the tendons may have been operating at a          shorter sarcomere length during the contraction when          compared to the passive sarcomere length that we actually          measured          Any compliance in the muscle or measuring system would          also cause the sarcomere length during the contractions          to be shorter than that before or after the          contraction Assuming all of the discrepancy between the          theoretical and actual length tension relation is due to          compliance a correction factor can be generated The          data in Figure would center around the line representing          the theoretical lengthtension relationship if sarcomere          length for each contraction was corrected by subtracting           m This correction could relate to a short range          compliance that could be due to movement of the aluminum          clips during each contraction          The forcelength relationship observed in this study          is consistent with previous investigations on the          forcelength relation for fixedend tetanic contractions          of skeletal muscle Therefore our measurements of          sarcomere length in the experiments on the          lengthdependence of potentiation are a reasonable          expression of the actual initial sarcomere length for          these conditions                          Lengthdependence of potentiation          The observation that the magnitude of the posttetanic          twitch response P           t P           t  was proportional to length but          with a negative slope is in direct contrast with a          previous report     However this observation is          consistent with data of Roszek et al     who          reported enhanced lowfrequency responses when these were          preceded by tetanic stimulation in the medial rat          gastrocnemius muscle at C They observed that this          enhancement was greater at short muscle lengths Our          results provide evidence that the discrepancy between             and those of    is not a function of          temperature Furthermore it would appear that it is          unnecessary to propose different mechanisms for          posttetanic potentiation and staircase          There are other differences between the study by             and this one They used a whole mouse EDL while we          used a fiber bundle While it is tempting to suggest that          they may have had a central core of fatigued or damaged          cells it is not clear how this could account for the          reversal of the relationship between length and          potentiation Another difference is the apparent length          range which was studied In the paper by Moore           Persechini     length is expressed relative to a          reference length which appears to be the length at which          tetanic developed tension is greatest Contractile          response was measured at this length and up to           longer at which length tetanic developed tension was          apparently less than  of the peak value at the          reference length At this same length twitch tension was          just over  of its respective peak value at the          reference length In contrast in our experiments the          length range studied was from a sarcomere length of           m to  m The relative length increase here is over           We would appear to be studying a greater range of          lengths but the range of twitch amplitudes is much less          In fact twitch amplitude at the longest length studied in          this paper has a developed tension that is not          substantially different from that at  m The greatest          twitch amplitude occurred at an intermediate length Of          interest our tetanic developed tensions were about           of the maximum at a sarcomere length of  m This          difference in the lengthdependence of tetanic and twitch          contractions has been reported previously and is          attributed to length dependence of activation                       It is interesting that the twitch contraction after a          brief tetanic contraction at C in our experiments          demonstrated potentiation when the response was measured          at short sarcomere lengths and depression when the          response was measured at long sarcomere lengths This is          consistent with the observation of Krarup    that in          the poststimulation period at room temperature there are          both factors which enhance subsequent contractile          response and factors that diminish the contractile          response Krarup    reported that the dissipation of          the depression of force was faster than the dissipation          of enhancement such that after a period of time the          enhancement became evident In the case of the          posttetanic contractions reported here the enhancement          apparently predominated at a short length while          depression was evident at long sarcomere length This          indicates that the factors resulting in depression may          have a mechanism that is lengthdependent It is also          possible that the depression may be similar at all          lengths and the potentiating effects may be the only          factor that is lengthdependent It is important to point          out that our posttetanic twitch contractions were          obtained at a variety of lengths after a tetanic          contraction at optimal length The metabolic disturbance          or level of regulatory light chain phosphorylation would          not have been different between these lengths          The depression of twitch amplitude after a tetanic          contraction may be a consequence of hydrogen ion or          inorganic phosphate Pi accumulation These factors are          likely to be more evident after the tetanic contraction           pulses per s than after staircase  pulses per s          It is known that decreased pH or increased P           i results in a rightward shift in the          forcepCa relation       It has been shown for          both pH and P           i that the shift is more evident at          room temperature than at physiological temperature                This factor may also explain why potentiation          is less during staircase at C than at C  in fact          Martyn and Gordon    have shown an interdependence of          changes in Ca sensitivity associated with pH and          length          The mechanism for the lengthdependence of          potentiation may be related to lengthdependence of          activation as suggested previously     It was argued          that the rightward shift in the control forcelength          relation during twitch in comparison with tetanic          contractions is apparently due to enhanced sensitivity to          Ca as muscle length is increased      Since          regulatory light chain phosphorylation also results in          increased sensitivity to Ca      then it may be          that there is a ceiling effect and the two mechanisms          are not simply additive Light chain phosphorylation may          be less effective in enhancing the contractile response          when it is already enhanced by lengthdependent          activation          This interpretation relies on the assumption that the          magnitude of light chain phosphorylation was similar          after staircase elicited at different lengths Myosin          light chain kinase the enzyme responsible for          phosphorylating the regulatory light chain is activated          by Ca bound to calmodulin A similar level of light          chain phosphorylation would be expected if Ca          transients during this stimulation were not affected by          length Balnave and Allen    have shown that Ca          transients in mouse muscle are independent of length          Furthermore a lengthdependence of potentiation similar          to that reported here has been reported for rat muscle          after staircase at one length     an approach          similar to that used in this study for the posttetanic          potentiation It seems unlikely that the          lengthdependence of potentiation described here is due          to lengthdependent differences in regulatory light chain          phosphorylation          The data available in this study cannot discern the          possible mechanisms that are operating to result in a          lengthdependence of P           t P           t  However the observations in this          paper clearly demonstrate that this lengthdependence is          operative at the sarcomere level and P           t P           t decreases as sarcomere length          increases whether it is studied after high frequency          tetanic contraction or after low frequency staircase          stimulation These observations are consistent with the          proposed mechanism by which light chain phosphorylation          enhances developed tension It has been proposed that          light chain phosphorylation causes individual          crossbridges to swing out from the myosin backbone              thereby bringing the actin binding site of the          crossbridge in close proximity to the actin filament          This would increase the probability of crossbridge          binding to actin resulting in a greater number of          crossbridges exerting force during the twitch          contraction This mechanism is apparently ineffective          when the myofilaments are in close proximity as would be          the case at a long sarcomere length There is no need to          invoke a different explanation for posttetanic          potentiation than for staircase                            Methods                  Muscle preparation          The animals were deeply anaesthetized with an          intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbitol  mgkg           The right hindlimb was shaved and an incision was made          along the surface of the hindlimb The tibialis anterior          muscle was removed to expose the extensor digitorum          longus EDL muscle The EDL muscle was then transferred          to a dissecting chamber through which Krebs Henseleit          solution NaCl  mM KCl  mM NaH            PO              mM MgCl              mM CaCl              mM NaHCO              mM Dextrose  mM flowed          This solution was bubbled continuously with  O            and  CO            pH   temperature  C          Experiments were performed with small fiber bundles          approximately  to  fibers  mm long of the EDL          muscle Care was taken to clear the fibers from          connective tissue as much as possible After dissection          the tendons of the dissected fibers were gripped with          small pieces of Tshaped aluminum foil as close to the          ends of the fibers as possible The bundle of fibers was          then transferred to an experimental chamber with          continuous superfusion of the same solution as in the          dissection chamber One tendon clip was attached to a          force transducer hook and the other to a Cambridge motor          arm model B allowing the fiber bundle to be          suspended horizontally and adjusted to a specific          sarcomere length as desired during the experiment                          Sarcomere length measurements          The sarcomere length was measured by laser diffraction          technique A  mW HeNe laser Model  Uniphase          Manteca California with a beam diameter of  mm was          directed through the experimental chamber perpendicular          to the long axis of the muscle fibers The sarcomere          length was established in a clear region of the bundle          close to the force transducer This region was chosen          because in most experiments it was not possible to obtain          a clear diffraction pattern in all regions of the fiber          due to adherent damaged fibers andor connective          tissue          The position and intensity distribution of the          firstorder diffraction pattern was monitored by a          photodiode array which was scanned electronically every           ms The diffraction pattern was collected in a X          objective lens NA  Nikon and reflected through an          access port in the microscope The transmitted laser          light was projected via a telescopic lens and three          cylindrical lenses onto a photodiode array RLA          Reticon Corp Sunnyvale California An amplifier was          used to produce an analog signal the voltage of which          was proportional to the sarcomere length based on the          median intensity profile of the firstorder diffraction          pattern     The system was calibrated before every          experiment with a test grating  m          Muscle bundles were adjusted to the desired length          with the servo Cambridge motor during experiments Muscle          tension and median sarcomere length were displayed on the          computer screen during the experiments Muscle force was          measured with a semiconductor strain gauge transducer          ENTRAN Intertechnology Inc Calgary connected to an          amplifier in a halfbridge configuration Stimulation          Grass S Grass Instruments was with supramaximal           V square pulses  ms duration through two          platinum wires in the experimental chamber parallel to          the muscle fibers          Muscle bundles were divided into two groups one for          the establishment of the forcelength relation during          submaximal and maximal stimulation and the other for          measurement of staircase and posttetanic potentiation          Muscles were first studied at C and then at C A           min equilibration period was allowed at each          temperature          In the first group of fiber bundles tetanic          contractions  Hz stimulation rate  ms          duration were elicited at sarcomere lengths that were          changed in steps of  m to  m with  min rest          between contractions Sometimes during the course of the          experiments the muscle bundles were set at a reference          sarcomere length where maximal force was obtained to          verify absence of fatigue andor damage in the          preparation In all cases the force was not decreased          when compared to previous contractions recorded at this          same reference length indicating that fatigue or damage          did not occur in these experiments          In the second group of fibers each fiber bundle was          used to assess either staircase  Hz for  s or          posttetanic response  Hz for  s When staircase          was induced sarcomere length was set and then the          stimulation was applied Three to four sarcomere lengths          were tested in each preparation  min intervals between          each period of repetitive stimulation The first P           t  and last P           t  contraction in each series were          collected  Hz analogue to digital conversion for          assessment of the effects of repetitive stimulation P           t P           t  The sarcomere length was always          the same after the  s of stimulation as it had been          prior to the stimulation During the  minute intervals          between stimulation control twitch contractions were          elicited to verify absence of force decline due to          fatigue andor fiber damage          To assess the lengthdependence of posttetanic          response twitch contractions at  s intervals were          obtained at a variety of sarcomere lengths both prior to          P           t  and following P           t  a tetanic contraction which was          elicited at optimal length the length which gave the          strongest tetanic contraction The first twitch          contraction was obtained  s after the tetanic          contraction and the subsequent twitches were collected          with  s intervals These procedures follow closely what          was done by Moore  Persechini     who have          shown that at room temperature regulatory light chain          phosphorylation and P           t P           t following a tetanic contraction          return to baseline very slowly at room temperature                            Author contributions        Author DER contributed in the design of the experiments        and was primarily responsible for conducting the        experiments
