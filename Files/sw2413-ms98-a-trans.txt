        okay do you have you noticed any new um trends in politics   well the one i think is interesting is the California Los Angeles police chief who says he wants to resign and did you hear yesterday that Mayor Bradley said that uh he should   oh really no i didnt hear that   think it i think whats interesting is that uh uh the political activists Jesse Jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating i find it interesting that uh outsiders would bother to go in how do how do you feel about people like Jesse Jackson getting involved   um i think sometimes its good for people outside they get a different perspective uh perspective on an issue and stuff so yeah i dont see any problem with outsiders going in and getting a little bit involved i think though that it should still be uh sort of up to the majority in the area i dont know on something like that they wouldnt really vote on it or anything though     what do you think Gates should resign     probably so just because they were under his authority and he obviously failed somewhere along the line   well well speaking of that kind of issue have you kept up with John Wiley Price   yeah   what do you think of him   oh um i think hes got good intentions but im not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right   hes an interesting person i was talking to someone who said that uh for all his obvious uh attention to efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the uh i guess hes on the County uh oh Board of Supervisors or i think  and that that that uh at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker   right uhhuh   and is really quite agreeable uh uh and that the stuff we see in the you know in the media is uh well hes really just trying to make a political statement i i find that an interesting element of politics that we dont that that most people would not know that John Wiley Price apparently is a is a you know course hes got in this this deal over racism and uh you know name calling and all this but apparently hes a a worker uh you may disagree with him but i i i find this whole what do you think of this uh fourteen one and ten four one in Dallas   oh i think that they should go ahead and go to the uh fourteen one i to me its just fair you know and equal it seem like every area should have an equal voice   i agree with you but did you see the map they drew up on uh on how they were gonna divide up the districts   no   it was it was the strangest im im not sure it was gerrymandered but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff i i i guess im a little cynical of the of the power base i i i and i dont quite understand why the power base uh doesnt uh why they dont go with fourteen one i you know i and you know the it seems to me that what happened in the in the election that a lot of the people they said particularly the the uh i think its Hispanics dont vote because they dont think that they have any affect and its i i guess i am disappointed with Dallas in that uh the fourteen one it   yeah   i dont know you can you can disagree with Al Lipscomb and uh whats whats the ladys name   Diane Ragsdale   yeah you can disagree with uh what theyre doing and what theyre saying but in reality i think theyre theyre trying to represent their constituents   yeah   and i think Dallas is doing itself a disservice i think they ought to get on with something important   yeah they really make themselves look bad and i dont know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one   yeah and i but i think even i even those people are its like Pauken and Box and these people i think its i find it interesting that everybodys so busy politicking that the question is did we get anything good done its like this whole school issue are are you involved in the schools at all public school   no huhuh   this whole thing down there where theyre theyre trying to um uh you know devote all our money and raise our taxes and better schools and and it all seems you know everybodys trying to oneupmanship on everybody else so   yeah yeah it   i i have got to run to a meeting its good talking to you i dont think weve gone our our ten minutes but i think weve weve talked long enough so   okay was okay good talking to you bye   okay good night
