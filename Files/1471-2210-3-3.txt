                    Background        Carbenoxolone the succinyl ester of glycyrrhetinic acid            is now used in clinical treatment of ulcer diseases            It has some pharmacological properties such as the        inhibition of hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase HSD            and inhibition of gap junctional intercellular        communication     Electrotonic synaptic communication        between neurons via gap junctions GJs is increasingly        recognized as an important synchronizing mechanism in the        brain The pathogenesis of abnormal neuronal synchrony        underlying seizures formerly thought to be based mainly on        the chemical synaptic transmission now includes a role of        gap junctional communication This concept has been        strengthened by evidence from several in vitro models in        which pharmacological manipulations of gap junctional        communication predictably affect the generation of        seizures blockers diminishing seizure and enhancers        increasing the seizures     GJ channels can contribute        to the prolongation of epileptiform discharges            In in vitro studies carbenoxolone abolished the        generation of full or partial ectopic spike generation by        AP in the CA          region of rat hippocampal slices            Also carbenoxolone depresses spontaneous epileptiform        activity in the CA          region of rat hippocampal slices            Carbenoxolone appears to cross the blood brain barrier        about one hour after an intraperitoneal injection in rats        as there was the inhibition of hydroxysteroid        dehydrogenase in multiple brain regions     It andor        its congener glycyrrehetinic acid may also enter the eyes        of humans Ingestion of licorice has been reported to cause        transient visual loss     a possible consequence of        retinal gap junction blockade        Thus we considered the possible anticonvulsant effect        of carbenoxolone in animal seizure models                    Results        In pentylenetetrazole PTZ model ED values of        diazepam and carbenoxolone were  mgkg  CL           and  mgkg  CL           respectively        In PTZ model carbenoxolone increased the latency of        seizures and decreased the duration of seizures dose        dependently Table         In maximal electroshock MES model carbenoxolone         mgkg decreased the duration of tonic seizures This        effect was not statistically significant in the lower doses        of carbenoxolone This agent could not completely protect        the mice against mortality in a dose of  mgkg Table                In the potentiation of pentobarbitone sleep test        carbenoxolone significantly increased the sleeping time in        mice at doses of   and  mgkg compared to        controls dose dependently Table  Also carbenoxolone in        doses of   and  mgkg decreased the latency        compared to controls dose dependently and this effect was        statistically significant Table         In the traction test carbenoxolone did not induce a        muscle relaxant activity significantly up to a dose of         mgkg Carbenoxolone  mgkg showed muscle relaxant        activity compared to normal saline and this effect was        more than diazepam in a dose of  mgkg Table         In accelerod performances carbenoxolone in the first        trial in doses of   and  mgkg showed a decline        in motor function relative to normal saline  mlkg        Table  The second trial carbenoxolone in doses of         and  mgkg decreased the riding time on rotarod compare        to normal saline Table                     Discussion        Present results indicate that carbenoxolone has        anticonvulsant activities in PTZ and MES models        Agents affecting the PTZ model can inhibit petit mal        seizure     Thus carbenoxolone may have activity on        this kind of seizure Carbenoxolone also showed activity        against MES This implies that carbenoxolone may have        efficacy in grand mal seizure            Less is known about the effects of carbenoxolone on GJs        although it has been proposed that glycyrrhetinic acid to        which carbenoxolone is related binds directly to connexin        molecules causing a conformational change leading to a        closure of the junction     Modeling studies indicate        that neuronal synchronization can be mediated by low        densities of GJs either between dendrites as long as these        dendrites are excitable     or between the axons of        pyramidal cells     Furthermore the electrotonic        coupling could be promoted during epileptogenesis                    Optical imaging of neural activity evoked by electrical        stimulation in the cultured rat suprachiasmatic nucleus        SCN revealed that the spread of depolarization was        inhibited by gap junction blockers halothane octanol but        not by a blocker of voltagedepended Na channels        Depolarization propagation was also inhibited by muscimol        a GABA         A receptor agonist in a dose dependent        manner and inhibition was reversed by bicuculline a GABA         A receptor antagonist This indicated        that the propagation of depolarization between SCN cells        was inhibited by GABA         A receptor activation There were two        possible explanations for this result First GABA might        affect the permeability of gap junction channels Secondly        muscimol might increase the chloride conductance        independent of gap junctions and might cause a decrease in        the spread of depolarization Furthermore muscimol        inhibited dyetransfer between neurons in the SCN culture        in a dosedependent fashion so that GABA might have        reduced gap junction communication between SCN neurons via        the GABAA receptor     In that study they could not        clarify how the activation of a GABAA receptor and        subsequent increase in chloride conductance impact gap        junctions In studies it has been reported that increases        in intracellular Ca or decreases in intracellular pH can        uncouple cells     So they suggest that a        participation of the GABA receptors in the regulation of Ca        concentration or intracellular pH could explain the        uncoupling effect of muscimol As a matter of fact it was        suggested that the gap junction coupling state between        neurons in SCN is not static but dynamically regulated by        the GABA         A receptor system     Also in vitro        guineapig brain preparation prolonged seizurelike        activity elicited using a brief application of bicuculline        was abolished by the GJ channel blockers octanol and        glycyrrhetinic acid as well as by intracellular        acidification            It is suggested that carbenoxolone by blocking GJ        channels inhibits both the induction and duration of        epilepsy in the in vivo models of seizures From previous        evidences we speculate that carbenoxolone by closing GJ        channels possibly directly or via the GABAergic system        inhibits the spread of depolarization waves in the CNS and        peripheral organs These could explain the anticonvulsant        muscle relaxant and hypnotic effects of carbenoxolone But        further experiments need to establish this hypothesis        At anticonvulsant doses carbenoxolone produced a        hypnotic effect in the pentobarbitone sleep test and motor        impairment in the rotarod test but only at a dose of         mgkg which had anticonvulsant effect did carbenoxolone        show muscle relaxant activity in the traction test        In the potentiation of pentobarbitone sleep test        carbenoxolone significantly showed sedative effect        Glycyrrhetinic acid is an aglycone saponin extracted from        licorice root    and saponines have hypnotic effects            Carbenoxolone is also the succinyl ester of        glycyrrhetinic acid Thus this can explain the sedative        effect of carbenoxolone        In the muscle coordination test carbenoxolone showed a        muscle relaxant effect Synchronized firing is a widespread        phenomenon in the mammalian brain     including the        motor cortex     respiratory motor neurons            and limb motor neurons      These studies have        demonstrated the presence of gap junctions in many levels        of the motor system in both motor neurons and in premotor        pattern generating circuits Further gap junction coupling        GJC has brought about robust coordination patterns even        in the absence of chemical synapses and has been shown to        mediate synchronization of neurons during motor behaviors                   On the other hand as yet there is no information about        the effects of carbenoxolone in the muscle tissues        therefore the possibility exists that these channels may        be in muscles and synchronize the firing between muscle        cells Carbenoxolone by blocking these channels causes        motor impairment However a demonstration of whether these        channels are in fact capable of mediating electrical        transmission requires physiological experiments        Thus we conclude that carbenoxolone has anticonvulsant        muscle relaxant and hypnotic effects in the in vivo models        possibly via blocking GJ channels The exact mechanism of        these effects needs further investigation                    Materials and Methods                  Chemicals          Carbenoxolone pentylenetetrazole and pentobarbitone          were
