        hi   hi uh as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i uh took on a painting project in my bathroom and i had wallpaper up i had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that and it took me all weekend because uh the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down and that had to dry and then the spackling had to dry a day and then the painting took another day   you didnt try we rewallpapering you just uh   no i i just painted   did you use a textured paint or   uh no actually the wall behind the paper was smooth so i just used a like a semigloss   um   and   well did you get good results   well no not really i need to it it looks so bad you can see where those spackling marks were i need to uh either paper back over it or do something   yeah but just didnt it didnt it didnt cover it   yeah it covered the spots pretty good but it didnt excuse me it didnt uh uh it just didnt look as smooth as i wanted it to   well we did a uh we moved oh last August and were getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to ive forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said oh you can get by and i forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark   uhhuh   well more or less after about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable but it kept the the dark it was uh just a real dark uh wood grain type paneling   uhhuh   and uh it was smooth and uh and we would we put this stuff on and and it supposedly textured it or did something to it and but because of the the dark behind it was really hard to cover and   was it like a primer   yeah it was something like that although we sort of when we got through i wished we hadnt done it because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it and we were painting it and trying to do uh you know make it and it it really was you know the advice they give you is uh the job was considerably tougher than we thought   yeah   uh particularly when you try to i was talking to somebody else who who had a lot of wood paneling and uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot paneling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something   oh my goodness thats an awful lot   have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted   not inside  now uh when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it that was one of the requirements from you know FHA   yeah   that the house be painted before we bought it and it was fairly reasonable we have a brick house but all the trim   yeah   around the house was uh if i remember right it was like uh five hundred dollars   oh thats quite reasonable   yeah yeah so that wasnt too bad   um the problem is have you have you tried matching paint lately   no i havent   my wife we we built a shed over the long way actually it took  this is not on the topic but i did finish it but my wife went to the uh Home Depot i think it was and and took a uh a copy took a piece of brick   uhhuh   and she wanted to paint the shed its a its a wooden shed uh and she took it and theyve got this machine that matches the color of paint   uhhuh   and uh they got and uh and in fact she put some right back she got they mixed uh a gallon of it and uh its just remarkable how close it will match the paint uh and it does it uh oh electronically some something magic   oh so they did do a good job   yeah you know they but its electronic   yeah   uh you put your sample under this thing and it looks at it and and uh and determines the and it its really remarkable uh the problem they had and then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim   uhhuh   and uh but they didnt didnt occur to them that um that they could have taken a sample   uhhuh   um from i forgotten this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something but anyway its its remarkable thats one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the you know you want this you want this to look like this and you want that to look like that and of course if its all white youre all right but when you start getting into colors have you had problems getting colors to match   uhhuh yeah yeah as a matter of fact uh what weve got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a uh a blue and the blue even so many years two years later or so it doesnt match   um   you know   so   its the very same type of paint and everything   gosh   so   so you so whats your whats the solution then   oh i have no idea i repainted the whole thing   oh my well at least youll get very good at it right   yeah   you could go back and and paint the whole thing over thats uh this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting because it uh it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do ill just do a little bit here and a little that   yeah yeah   although the uh its uh it we almost one day we painted the house to uh we painted we painted the whole inside and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim im trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they dont do that in the newer houses now we dont the uh mold everything is white in a new house everything is white   yeah thats right white yeah thats what were trying to get ours to look like   oh good luck  we wound up selling the house actually i i dont know whether it made actually it does its interesting that the white um   yeah   makes the rooms look bigger one of the in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames i dont know what you call that that actually that are along the walls you know up a couple of feet   uhhuh uhhuh   and my wife painted those the insides of those dark blue   oh i see   and uh it makes the room look remarkably smaller   huh she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what color   the trim is still white   okay white   the the molding but by and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive but it makes the room look smaller which is uh   uhhuh yeah yeah   uh which is it explains why they why they have everything white but i you wouldnt think that i well   yeah yeah   maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff but   well uh what about the lighting did it make a big difference   uh not particularly because the house has so many windows uh it has the the the living room has four uh good size windows   oh uhhuh   and uh well of course at night but with the we have we have we have a soccer field thats um oh about a hundred yards from our house   uhhuh   and the lights shine right at our house its kind of we didnt know that when we bought the house but   so that uh you get some the color doesnt really matter for because you have that light   yeah we have a lot of light yeah and well it it it um well its just uh i think its just the the the dark blue to about three feet and then above that we left it white so anyway it didnt change but the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away it didnt it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic were   I see uhhuh   were really on to that that the masking is you have to do that very very carefully   and it takes a long time   thats right you can work yourself to death well im sorry to hear your color didnt come out so good over the weekend   yeah really no kidding   its kind of frustrating   it is a lot of work a lot of work   well ive got to go to a meeting its been good talking to you   nice talking to you thanks a lot bye   okay goodbye
