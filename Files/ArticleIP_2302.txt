                                 Leak Soup            Since leaks became a bigissue in the Clinton sex scandal the whole affair has taken on a surrealAlice in Wonderland quality For the past several days the press hasbeen trying simultaneously to report stories derived from anonymous leaksreport on the phenomenon of these leaks andin the editorial pagesexpressan opinion about the propriety of the leaks If the definition of mediaunfairness is the press behaving as prosecutor judge and jury then thedefinition of media absurdity is the way the press is now acting as prosecutorjudge and defendant            Weslipped down the rabbit hole Feb  when the New York Times reportedthat the presidents secretary Betty Currie had while testifying to a grandjury contradicted Clintons sworn testimony about his relationship with MonicaLewinsky According to the Times story which was attributed to lawyersfamiliar with her account Clinton summoned Currie to the White House SundayJan  the day after he was deposed by lawyers for Paula Jones These sourcestold the Times that Clinton rhetorically asked Currie We Clinton andLewinsky were never alone right According to the same sources Currie hashanded over to the independent counsel gifts from the president to Lewinskythat Lewinsky had given Currie            If as various White House spokesmen and the presidentsprivate lawyer David Kendall have charged the source of this leak was theoffice of the independent counsel it is a serious offense Disclosinginformation from a grandjury proceeding violates the federal rules of criminalprocedure and would subject attorneys in Starrs office to contempt charges andpossibly jail time Starr himself could be fired by the attorney generalwhoif she isnt worried about setting in motion an infinite regression could namean independent counsel to investigate the independent counsel            There isno telling for certain where the Currie leak came from It might have sprungfrom Starrs office from Curries lawyer in which case it would not beillegal or from Clintons team which could have found out about Curriestestimony from her lawyer A preponderance of evidence however points in thedirection of Starr Here are the reasons             The Times account was spun formaximum harm to Clinton The catchup story in late editions of that samemornings Washington                Post presented roughly the same facts in aless damning way By casting Clintons question to Currie as rhetorical theTimes  source implied that he was asking Currie to lie to back up hisversion of events If not rhetorical the same question would have no suchconspiratorial connotation It might indicate only that Clinton was trying torefresh his recollection In fact this has been the defense offered by thepresidents lawyers and spokesmen since the Currie story broke Theres noreason anyone sympathetic to Clinton would have included that righteven ifClinton had said it            Thedisclosure was timed for maximum damage to Clinton At the moment it brokeLewinsky was facing an imminent deadline for striking an immunity deal withStarrs office Like several previous leaks some of them subsequently castinto doubt the Currie story contained what looked a lot like a message fromStarr to his reluctant witness I have other evidence against you and Clintonso youd better cut a deal quick Even if the Clinton side wanted to get thisdamaging revelation out in order to spare itself pain later it would have hadevery reason to hold back until Lewinsky and Starr concluded theirnegotiations             The story quoted a White House spokesmansaying pointblank that the leak was false Curries lawyer LawrenceWeschler also said it was false that Clinton had tried to influence Currie Ifthe leak did come from Curries lawyer or from the Clinton legal team theTimes was a willful party to a gross deception Its almost impossibleto believe the New York Times would mislead its readers by allowing asource to plant a story and deny planting it in the same news article            The sameday the Times story came out Kendall rattled off a page letter toStarr denouncing it and other leaks Starr fired back a defensive responseEveryone spent the weekend debating who was right This left the Timesand to a lesser extent other news organizations in the screwy position inwhich they remain The paper had to report on the debate about where its leakhad come from But its goal was not the usual one of news reporting which isto find the truth The Times  after all knows the truth here It knowswho its own sources are But in this case it has granted its own version ofimmunity to an act of potential lawbreaking for the sake of gatheringinformation about other potential misdeeds much as a prosecutor such as Starrmight do            A few days later the Timeseditorialized The Presidents lawyer David Kendall and this weeksdesignated spinner Paul Begala cannot prove their sweeping televisedassertions that Mr Starr has illegally leaked grand jury testimony If he didthe Federal court that supervises him and the Attorney General who has thepower to fire him have the resources to deal with prosecutorial misconductHold it right there The Times knows whether Kendall and Begala arecorrect or not But it doesnt want to say so it hides behind the legalisticformula that Kendall and Begala cannot prove their allegations And if theTimes thinks that such leaks are prosecutorial misconduct why does itparticipate in them            Is there any way out of thismorass Its tempting to say that reporters shouldnt accept leaks unless thebias of the source can be indicated But thats probably not realistic Theprice of getting the story is often a promise of full anonymity So long astheres competitive pressure in the press sources will use the outlet thataffords them the greatest protection            What the press can do iscover leaking more aggressively The Times cant very well sendreporters snooping around after colleagues in the same newsroom But theres noethical stricture against reporters who arent getting spoonfed by Starrpursuing the story of how and why and to whom the independent counsels officeis leaking Howard Kurtz the media reporter of the Washington Post does this a bit from time to time For a story on the Currie leaks heinterviewed Michael Oreskes the Times Washington bureau chief Oreskesdeclined to tell him of course who the Times  sources were Instead ofleaving it there the Post should dig a little deeper A reporter has anobligation to protect his sources He doesnt have to protect anybody elsesSo why hasnt                   Slate                outed the leakers on Starrs staff andelsewhere Because I havent been able to establish who they are Anyone whoknows please feel free to leak it to me
