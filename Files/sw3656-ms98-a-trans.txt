        now then are you there okay     yeah im here   so theyre recording everything now   alrighty   but you tell me the crime is rampant out there   its really bad out here we just had a freeway shooting about three blocks from our house       and on New Years Eve you know how its supposed to be bringing in the new year and everything the with the neighborhood we have around here it was automatic gunfire going off instead of fire works   yes um well thats what we have had here in Dallas for oh for the past year we lost so many people due to crime this past year so what do you think is the solution to any of this   well personally ive got two kids and personally id like to see them teach something about it like in schools not make it mandatory but an optional thing you know ways to avoid situations   do you think drugs have any have   i think it has a lot to do with it   do you think thats the majority of our crime   um well id say about half   well i think here in Dallas weve got uh its greater than that i think you know like ninety percent of our crime is um connected with the the drug scene because we   most   beg your pardon go ahead   most of our crime around here is uh its gang related gang violence gangs fighting gangs and i think thats what really scares me because i mean around here if you like if you wear red   yeah   one gang will take offense to it   okay   and if you wear black the other gang will take offense to it so you have to wear you know something neutral like blue in order not to get bothered around here i mean people get bothered at the grocery stores and everything its getting pretty bad   you mean in their clothing they okay   yeah   well i did im not aware of that being part of our problem its just that uh  seems like these kids or older people that um need the drug need the money for the drugs and then theyre shooting and we have we had a little boy in west uh well its west of here was riding in the car with his mother and father on New Years Eve night and someone fired into the car there were three children in the backseat and the little boy that was in the uh an infant seat was dead they did the the mother and father did not even realize   oh no   that there had been ah i mean they thought fire crackers and that sort of thing   oh yeah   and when they arrived where they were to have had celebrated New Years they found this baby dead and the bullet hole directly behind the drivers seat   oh   now this is something that my Lord somethings got to give someone has to do something   i know and its the innocent people that are paying for it its not even the people that are doing it that are paying for it its the innocent ones that are dying from it and its not fair   well thats right yes no way can we um  anyway i pray that you have a good New Year i hope its a safe New Year for you and have what about this isnt part of the conversation but have you had any rain out there   oh weve had a lot of it out here   okay thats what i understand California needs but   yeah it it we do need it and theres been an awful lot of it   well i mean  when you live in Texas you accept it when it comes   yeah   and dont complain about it   i guess you guys had a pretty good storm a while back though   oh i still have an apartment that has furniture up on bricks because of the rain umhum and i live in a a nice part of Dallas but um   oh really   anyway if the if the criminals and do not come around here im going to be extremely fortunate umhum   yeah my my husband and i are thinking about moving because weve got two little boys and its just getting so bad around here that im afraid to even let them go out and play i mean its its really bad with the gangs and everything   you mean this is not occur after after sundown its during the day too   the majority of it is at night but like the shootings and stuff on the freeways are done in broad daylight nobody will say anything because everybodys afraid   are
