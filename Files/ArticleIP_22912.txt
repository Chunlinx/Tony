                                 The Freedom Trap            It occurred to me whilelaboring to write this column and make a bit of money to support my familythat it would do wonders for my stifled creativity to drive somewhere tropicalsip singlebarrel bourbon and have sex with a tawny barmaid Of course when Iwas at liberty to do all that I didnt Instead Id think if I could onlymeet a woman of substance and put down roots Id be less anxious about earthlyimpermanence and be really poised to cultivate my creativity  By anotsostrange coincidence this conflict is prominent in lots of recentmovies among them A Walk on the Moon  Metroland  and AmongGiants  which explore the natural impulse to settle down vs the equallynatural impulse to be wild and freethe yearning for permanence vs theclaustrophobic dread of monogamy            No dilemma causes menand women to fantasize so intensely about splitting themselves in two andtaking both roads And none provides more fodder for melancholy middleagedcomedy from the heavyweight musings of Milan Kundera in The UnbearableLightness of Being to the fluffy screwball machinations of Forces ofNature  In the latter currently the most popular movie in the country thefilmmakers strain to bring together free spirit Sandra Bullock and affiancedfuddyduddy Ben Affleck Then they do a bizarre aboutface and deliver a paeanto the bliss of domesticity That ending satisfies no one but you canappreciate the filmmakers lack of options Kundera resolves the conflict byhurtling his lovers pickup down an incline and crushing their bodies to apulp            Its worth remembering that Kunderas sexual parablesunfold against a backdrop of totalitarian repression whereas our own grapplewith a more confusing legacy the counterculture of the s and s Set in A Walk on the Moon devises a deliciously resonant dual setting aCatskills summer community to which middleclass Jews from the city migrate toswim and eat and play mahjongg and the gathering hippies at nearby WoodstockThe proximity of New World s hedonism puts a sort of lunar spell on PearlDiane Lane a yearold mother of two whose own summer of love wascruelly brief She got pregnant at  and promptly married the babys fatherMarty Liev Schreibernow a TV repairman whos stuck in the city fixingbroken sets in time for Neil Armstrongs moon walkand settled into a life oflooking after kids and chopping vegetables So lets see hot weather freelove in the breeze an antiestablishment pubescent daughter Anna Paquinand an absent husband Into this sexually tremulous milieu comes ViggoMortensen one of the vandriving peddlers who make regular trips to thecompound to sell shmattes to bargainhungry Jewish ladies A rangypurringly diffident blond gentile with blue eyes and a cleft chin he watchesas Pearl slips on a tiedyed Tshirt then leans his lips toward her barethroatand bites off the dangling price tag One can hardly blame Pearl forsaying Family shmamily            The elements in A Walkon the Moon  which is directed by the actor Tony Goldwyn the bad guy inGhost  and written by Pamela Gray feel miraculously right Graysscript seems meticulously worked out right down to setting the moonwalkagainst Pearl in her own libidinal orbit But if the writing is tidy itsnever glibit has too much texture for glibness I think back with pleasure onthe shared fascination of Marty and his young son over how many minutes ittakes him to drive from the city to the Catskills every week the bubblynonchalance of the Catskills women and the presence in the margins of OrthodoxJews who find it increasingly difficult to coexist with Purple Hazeskinnydippers and womens lib            Diane Lanes performance puts her in the company of thebest young actresses alive Her Pearl is at an age when you can see in her skinthe last traces of girlish pliancy but also where the cares have begun to leavea residue Alone in her kitchen with her cutting board she seems to besmelling her own faint overripeness when Mortensen holds his stare a beat toolong her body bends toward his as if it knows on a cellular level that thisway lies nourishment Lane and Mortensen have an extrasensory rapporttheymagnetize each other When you see them at Woodstock its through the aghasteyes of her daughter who thought of herself as a groover until she caught aglimpse of Mom in a most unmomlike state of sexual ecstasyDionysicallypickled            This kind of picture hasone of two thrusts It either sides with the suffocated housewife who likeIbsens Nora strives to break free of a repressive patriarchal hold or itdemonizes a culture that tempts men and women to put their own gratificationbefore their responsibilities as parents A Walk on the Moon leans tothe side of family values but scapegoats no oneneither the decent butinsensitive Marty nor the opportunistic salesman Even the moralistic mystic ofa grandmother Lilian Tovah Feldshuh cant forestall Pearls floweringLilian embodies the cultures eternal wisdom but also its antediluvian follyGreeting the news of her granddaughters first menses she blurts Mazeltov  and then slaps the childa tradition evidently meant to celebratethe beginning of reproductive life while reinforcing a girls sense of shameover the fact that shes now unclean A culture so stern would drive mostpeople into the tiedyed bosom of salesman even if he didnt look like ViggoMortensen            He might for instance resemble Lee Ross who plays themilitantly nonconformist Toni buddy of Chris Christian Bale inMetroland  based on an early novel by Julian Barnes The time is After a fiveyear absence Toni visits Chris at his suburban London row houseHes there to deride him for having a genteel wife Marion Emily Watson ababy daughter and a job snapping pictures for an ad agencyand to remind himthat once in the s they shared an ambition to escape such soulquashinghomogeneity            Tonis point would be more pressing if he werentsuch an unpalatable poster boy for freedompasty with dissipation with thinpurplish lips Plus hes an unmistakable sponge But Chris and his missus arehaving an arid patch sexually speaking so Tonis exhortations prompt headyflashbacks to less confining times Chris days as an arty photographer inParis when he learned how to make love to les                femmes from alusciously softthighed coquette called Annick Elsa Zylberstein But thatidyll was cut short when he met Marion Torn between French freespiritednessand the gnawing English sense that he ought to set about structuring a lifethe yearold Chris driftedmore or less by defaultinto the Englishwomansarms                           Metroland  whilepoky and schematic is full of disconcertingly sharp talk between loversbefore during and after sex And while its true that you cant pack as muchpsychological detail into a movie as you can into a novel director PhilipSaville and screenwriter Adrian Hodges bring out the yeasty subtext of even themost brittle encounters The suspense is in waiting to hear how characters willphrase what youve already read in their faces The movies triumph is thecasting of Watson in an unusually selfpossessed role I found her prim littleMona Lisa smirk and teasingly buttonedup demeanor almost maddeninglysexymore alluring by miles than the smearymouthed French sexpot Bale awonderfully sensitive actor who here looks like Watson with an Adams applecan only stare openmouthed helpless knowing shes his destiny and not evenmuch minding that it will take him back to Metroland Is it unfair to skew thecase for a life of suburban domesticity this way Watson is such a diabolicalminx that she makes the prospect of a life amid those metros and under thosegray skies more seductive than an endless luau I wish I could tell you forsure that the happy ending isnt meant to be ironic but thats not how itfelt to this aspiring suburbanite            In Among Giants  another English romance in whichfreedom and security play footsie the rover is a woman an Australianclimbah named Gerry Rachel Griffiths who joins up with a cowboylike crew ofdaredevil painters led by Pete Postlethwaites Raythey have  miles ofmammoth electric towers to coat in a mere three months The director SamMiller goes in for Lewis Hinelike images of men high in the air at oncedwarfed and exalted with synthesized strings to provide a touch of foggymysticism Much of Among Giants affords an agreeable blend of the grittyand the synthetic and the two main actors are a treat You love it up heredont you says Griffiths whose character is starting to fall for the olderforeman Oh Im king up here lass says Postlethwaite looking moreleathery and Asiatic than ever like the mummified fossil of some early manGriffiths who played a free spirit in Muriels Wedding  and thesimpy Hilary du Pr in last years Hilary                and Jackie  has a largenose and receding chin and looks quite homely from one or two angles But fromthe only angles that matter shes beautiful and her Gerry has a dartingintelligence to boot            Theres no reason Gerry and Ray couldnt have madea lifelong adventure of itscaling rocks romping naked through abandonedfactories gazing in awe at big rigs But the screenwriter Simon Beaufoy The Full Monty  has a thing about bringing macho men down to earthwith a thud Last time the deflation was funny and it worked this time the badvibes make the whole picture wither If any couple could have synthesized theimpulses to rove and stay put its this one but Beaufoy throws in the towelat the point where the husbands and wives of A Walk on the                Moonand Metroland are just getting warmed up
