                                 Whos the Airhead Here                        Dear Dinesh            Well lets not worry too much about our happy state ofagreement Im sure well find something to argue aboutprobably beginningtoday            It will not surprise you Im sure that I have neverbeen a great admirer of Ronald Reagan although it may surprise you that Ifeel as you do that he is one of the most important presidents of the th century and that he displayed a certaingenius for leadership that whatever his other limitations helped make hispresidency enormously successful and influential Morris seems to sense thatand at times to concede it but he is so preoccupied with Reagans unremarkablepersonal opaqueness that he doesnt really convey the power of his personalityadequately or fairly And I think you are right that his own selfconsciousdisplays of erudition which include his very mediocre poetry lead him toevaluations of Reagan that are both condescending and politically naive            I confess that I have only today worked my way throughthe last chapters of Morris book and what strikes me is that it actually getsworse as it moves farther away from its unconventional literary techniques Theautobiographical elements are less intrusive in the chapters on thegovernorship and the presidency but Morris limitations as a historian andbiographer are much more glaringly on displayas you also note You and I willundoubtedly be alarmed by different examples of these weaknesses But let megive several illustrations of a kind of historical simplemindedness that is inmany ways as bad as or worse than the simplemindedness he sometimesattributes to Reagan            Here for example is Morris riff on theextraordinarily complicated year history of the modern American welfarestate Under the  Social Security Act a family on welfare wasreclassified as selfsupporting the moment Pop was hired  Wives thusabandoned when husbands left home to preserve welfare benefits found itprofitable to go on having babiesby whomeverin order to notch up the familyincome This problem remained contained he says until the s when theNew Deal idea of benefits as emergency help to be applied for reluctantlyand granted responsibly became the Great Society concept of entitlements Ive left out only a few sentences of this passage and have not I thinkaltered its meaning in doing so It is hard to know where to begin to critiquethis monumentally ignorant description of the welfare system There is noevidence that ADC in the s or long after caused husbands and fathers toabandon their wives and no evidence at all to support the insulting statementthat women went on having babies by whomever in order to increase theirvery meager welfare payments Even in the s and beyond there is very littleevidence to support the argument that AFDC is responsible for illegitimatebirths The Great Society did nothing to change the definition of entitlementsunder Social Security although it did of course add new onesMedicare andMedicaid Morris footnotes cite only a few stray magazine articles a book onNixons welfare reform efforts that makes none of the claims that Morris doesand significantly Charles Murrays LosingGround             The last chapters of the book are filled with thesecasual simplistic and uninformed observations about American public policyMorris claims for example that the New Deal launched a year effort toforce the distribution of wealth downward In fact there was virtually nodownward distribution of wealth during the New Deal or in the  years afterWorld War IIand only a modest downward distribution during World War IIcaused not by taxation but by economic growth and rising wages Nor did anypresident advocate or attempt to produce downward distribution of wealth evenDemocrats Kennedy and Johnson included explicitly rejected that as a socialgoal            Even more astonishing is his flippant dismissal ofReagans economic programa dismissal visible in the very scant attention hegives it in this page book and in his remarks at several points about howbored he was to hear Reagan talk about it I dont think much of Reaganseconomic policies although I concede that some good things flowed from thembut whatever one thinks of them they do mark an extraordinarily importantmoment in American history Morris cant be bothered with them When Reaganreturns to his tax program in an interview Morris tells us that my heartsank and I mentally deducted  minutes from the time remaining In fact itseems there were many things about Reagans life and career that Morrisconsidered too boring to attend to There is almost nothing in this book aboutReagans campaigns and an astonishing passage on Page  perhaps explainswhy Morris describes sitting in the Oval Office interviewing Reagan in January Whether this is the yearold real Morris or the yearoldfictional one is not clear He reads him a passage from Lord David Cecilsfamous biography of Lord Melbournea favorite of Anglophiles the worldoverand asks for Reagans response The president begins talking about someearly presidential campaigning in  and Morris let my Sony do thelistening Fortunately I had several photocopied pages of Cecils biography inmy folder and read them with surreptitious enjoyment while Dutch retraced hissteps to the  Republican convention The great clock ticked on an on Ihave a similar sensation reading Morris book            More tomorrowAlan
