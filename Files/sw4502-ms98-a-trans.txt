        all right so i guess were all right um i dont know what the laws are up in uh New York whats the law up in New York for capital punishment   like it yeah well Governor Mario the uh holy one  up here Mario Cuomo has been against capital punishment since he hit office here id say six years ago hes     umhum   hes for the concept of um uh life in prison without parole and every single year up in here in New York state the uh government the state assembly gets together and tries to pass a death penalty bill and every year he vetos it  and upsets people     gets sort of repetitious   yeah he upsets people up here um every time he does it i dont what it is down in Florida these days   its legal down here um i i know theyve done a few most of the time theyll get real close and then theyll pardon him or it hardly ever gets to that point uh i dont think theyve done one in a long time but i know its legal and i know one just about happened recently but it never went through so they try but you know very few actually go   yeah Mario up here is claiming that um the reason why hes against capital punishment is because to send these  things through the court system   umhum   on appeal then another appeal then another appeal ends up costing the taxpayers more than just putting the guy away for the rest of his life with no chance of parole so you know if it if it comes down to a money issue   yeah   i you know in that case then im all for putting them behind bars as long as theres no chance of parole but you know what its like when they   yeah theres always those loopholes   yeah they fill the court there the jails up and suddenly let them go and theyre back on the street we had this murder up here um Art Shawcross up in Rochester killed nineteen prostitutes up here   ooh   and he was let out on parole from up in uh um Watertown and   was that was that on purpose or was that a a snafu     uh he was just well actually he it was on purpose i guess   uhhuh   he was uh he was a real psycho though and uh as a matter of fact it this happened under Cuomos watch so the Bush administration was thinking if Cuomo is going to run for President they were gonna do instead of   yeah that was his dirt huh   yeah instead of Willie Horton now we have the Art Shawcross deal you know       so so yeah i dont know what your feelings are about it being in Florida where youve had it before   yeah um well i can i can vouch for the fact that the uh the appeals will go through and go through and go through and yeah it drags on for about forever you know i guess im about your your opinion of it i have nothing against it philosophically in terms of if youre absolutely sure i mean uh uh i i would feel that you better make sure its one of those cases that has virtually no possibility of no you know you you pretty i mean supposedly you get through the courts youre not supposed to have any reasonable doubts anyway but i guess it would have to be one of those extremes in the first place but theres enough of them but i ive also heard that that these things cost so much in the end that uh that it really doesnt save you any money if its a money thing and as a deterrent thing i dont really think uh personally i dont feel that capital punishment punishment as a deterrent is a is a big deal i dont think that really works that much   yeah well of course you know we have New York City up here im in being in Rochester were kind of   yeah   they consider us more in Canada than in New York State area       but uh up here you know we have we dont have too many serious problems with crime but i know in New York City it was a real its a big deal they would like to have it back   yeah   and uh  i think its gonna boil down to changing the governor if they really wanna put it through   yeah   uh theyre building more prisons up here to try and put people in Attica is not too far away from where we are and thats at capacity and of course you know New York City is just packed with criminals that have done everything     right its   so i you know i dont where its going to go to in the end i just think that um i i i agree with you im not really that terribly against it as long as it looks like its going to work and reduce the court load and   yeah   the like     oh down here its not all peaceful either though i dont if youve been following any of this stuff course we had the big snafu right now with the the Mets thing but there have been a lot of uh a lot of things going on down here all the Gainesville murders   yeah yeah i we heard that yeah   course i dont think theyve they that then actually down here theres been more more publicity going on on police police screw ups and and uh beatings and everything than than actual murders and uh the Gainesville with the Gainesville picking up people seemingly
