              have you done a lot of camping recently   no i havent been camping since i was about sixteen   oh okay   but uh my family used to have a popup trailer and wed go camping to a lot of different places we spent two weeks in Bastrop Texas once   oh yeah uh wheres that   its near Austin   oh okay im not that much familiar with Texas weve been my family has been everywhere but mostly in Texas on the way to someplace else weve had oh gosh weve   umhum   ive camped in a in a in a back of a van van then we got then we got a popup camper and then we got a trailer now theyve got now theyve got a big motor home so they they still do a whole lot of camping   have you ever been camping in any of the big national parks   oh gosh yes uh  oh Yellowstone about four years ago four or five years ago and um oh we did my family when i was younger we went that was just you know what we did in the summers was go to the from you know national park to national park we had a lot of fun   when i go camping i dont i dont like to rough it i like to have some a little bit of electricity electricity and a little bit of running water   yes me too     im not really into this going and sitting in a tent for a few days with nothing   oh no no  ive done it but its not fun  you dont want to do it for like three weeks at a time thats for sure   God i have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer theyre both geologists and they load up their truck with their tent and they go to New Mexico and they just find places to camp and go looking for rocks and   ooh no  no   doesnt sound like a lot of fun to me uh my friend said that the last time they went uh she just got tired of the tent and it was cold at night and she got tired of eating out of cans and so they stayed in a hotel one night   oh yeah     just for fun   shaking the scorpions out of their shoes   no kidding no kidding gosh thats what the the the bugs i dont like the bugs   oh me neither me neither the the mosquitoes just keep you up all night   yeah the one good nice thing i remember about camping with my parents is they had a big hammock and they would always find a couple of a campsite with a couple of good trees to hang it in between and i could just lay in that hammock for hours   yeah yeah that thats nice   yeah   when my family when my family camps were the the only time youre at the camper is when you want to sleep  otherwise youre just going constantly you know in all the in all the National Parks and stuff   oh hum   we camped at the lets see we camped down at at Galveston two or three years ago and that that was that was fun except that they uh were having a lot of problems with dead fish on the shore and they were and the and the smell of that was kind of gross but   we stayed in Galveston Island State Park once but if a storm blew in and it was just horrible and the sand was blowing up our camp the little camping area was pretty near the shore   oh how awful umhum oh yeah   and there were some pretty big dunes before the the camping area and the sand was all blowing up and couldnt even go out of the camper the wind was blowing so hard because youd get sand in your eyes   oh thats miserable   yeah it was pretty bad   yeah i had   yeah pretty bad but we had a good time in our camper we usually we usually took box games and things to do in case it rained and they my parents always let us take a couple of friends so we always had a good time   yeah yeah its its you its you you always when you when theres kids youve always got to have other stuff to do because its always gonna rain sometime  and then your parents parents they drive the parents nuts   yeah yeah and yeah well children arent easily entertained by just enjoying the nature   oh i know i wish id appreciated i wish id appreciated it more you uh when i was when we were camping so extensively you when we when we were younger   yeah   now i wish i could go back to those places yeah the time and ive got got a child and another one on the way so  i wish i had time my my our popup camper just sits in the garage and collects dust unfortunately     oh gosh it makes it a little my fiance and i one day would like to own a big motor home mainly because hes a football hes a college football coach and were gonna have to travel a lot   uhhuh yeah   and itd be nice if we had a big ole motor home and that way i could load up the rest of the wives and go to wherever the football game is and have someplace to sleep without spending big money for a hotel and and park it outside of the stadium and have a good ole time   yeah thats true plus its nice to have your own stuff there yeah plus you get eating out is expensive is so expensive and   umhum that is nice no kidding it really is   so it it it its a it can be really handy to have a camper just   um   because my our family lives in Missouri and uh when we take trips home we take our popup with us in good weather and stay overnight at a state park or something so we dont have to rent a hotel room and thats   oh yeah   thats nice you know paying five or six dollars instead of forty   yeah no kidding   yeah well what else   well       i think thats just pretty much it weve been on here awhile   okay   well its been nice talking to you   nice talking to you too bye     byebye
