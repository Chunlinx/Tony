                                 Henry Errin            The congressional election aftermath produces the days two lead storiesUSAToday  the Washington Post  and the Los AngelesTimes go with Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hydes submission toPresident Clinton of a list of  questions about his conduct in mattersLewinsky The move which once upon a time would have been seen as dynamite isnow widely viewed as a popgun in the hands of chastened Republicans lookingfor an impeachment exit strategy that wont shoot them in the other foot Andaccording to the New York Timeslead the electoral shove has come to putsch as various Republican Housemembers maneuver to topple Newt Gingrich An inside Washington story theWP honors inside            The papers report that the questions Hyde sent to the White House focus moreon President Clintons conduct after attention was directed towards hispossible relationship with Monica Lewinsky than on the relationship itself TheLAT reports that Hydes cover letter asks Clinton to respond in writingand under oath by signing an attached affidavit The questions range fromasking whether Clinton took an oath to defend the Constitution to whether heever gave Lewinsky cigars All the papers either quote or describe some of thequestions but the NYT  fulfilling its tradition of supplying primarysources whenever possible runs the entire list of them in a separate article Even thougheverybodys story makes it clear that Hyde was asking Clinton to admitor deny the details in the list unlike the other papers theWP s headline House Panel Asks Clinton to Admit Lying Under Oathmakes it seem that Clinton was left without a choice            Hyde yesterday also announced his revised plans for substantially downsizedimpeachment hearings His main witness will be Kenneth Starr who will becalled November th The LAT says the two developments taken togetherraise the likelihood that Starrs case against Clinton could be disposed ofsoon The papers somehow keep straight faces while they pass along two ofHydes whoppers about all this  The new shape of the hearings has nothing todo with the election results and  Hes calling Starr because Hes someoneeverybody wants to hear from            The NYT reports that Louisiana congressman Robert Livingston has in recent days been conducting atelephone campaign that could lead to him running against Gingrich for HouseSpeaker In addition the Times quotes one congressman saying there aresix Republican members besides himself who have flatly decided not to vote forGingrichno small matter given the GOPs reduced edge of  seats The HouseRepublicans the paper explains will cast secret ballots for Speaker onNovember th with the full House voting on the matter in January            The majors all front the news that scientists at the University of Wisconsinand Johns Hopkins are about to publish reports of separate successful experiments in which cells culled from the veryearly stages of a human embryo have in a test tube been grown intoundifferentiated cells that could be used to grow various kinds of humantissue The breakthrough is thought to pave the way for implanting cellsdeveloped to have certain healthy properties into a patient as a way oftreating disease or defects The WP and the NYT bring to the foreethical questions the new science is sure to raise issues of geneticengineering and harvesting embryos            Everybody reports that the Bureau of Labor Statistics accidentallyprematurely posted on its web site its information about the number of jobscreated last month A surfing analyst shared the inside scoop with his clientsthereby roiling the financial markets for a few hours The Wall Street Journal sees a trend reminding readers thatjust last Monday the ABC News web site accidentally disseminated false testelection results But the paper also takes note of a model of Internetsecurity the dissemination of the Starr report            The USAT front section cover story examines a classic example ofunintended consequences The profusion of designer and customized licenseplates may delight car owners but its frustrating police who say thesome special plates make identifying cars much harder than it used to beThe paper mentions a case in which a robbery victim remembered the getaway carsported a tag with mountains on it which would have ordinarily have been agreat tipexcept that  states now have plates like that And dont forgetthe paper points out about Kansas where the counties not the state issuethe license plates meaning that any given sequence of letters and numberscould be shared by  vehicles            The WP s Al Kamen reports that once again civilian politicaljunkies who sent him their election predictions did a far better job than
