        okay what do you usually wear to work   well uh i am basically retired now i was a member i was in education and in administration so basically i wore   uhhuh uhhuh   dresses and uh heels and i was never one uh because my work often took me into court uh never was one that got uh accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work   uhhuh uhhuh   but that was just me i know many people are comfortable very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants uh it i guess i was just old enough not to uh be very comfortable in it how about you   uhhuh well i work at TI and they dont really have uh dress code so to speak there its pretty lax about um you know we you can pretty much wear whatever you want to and i wear anything from jeans when im feeling really casual to uh suits and dresses when im meeting with a customer or i i teach training classes   oh   and so when im teaching a class obviously i wear a suit or dress so   umhum   it it uh definitely fluctuates mainly with what im going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is and when its raining im more likely to wear jeans and and when its really cold im more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing     umhum   um but it just really depends on the weather and my mood and then you know obviously when im doing anything that im in front of people or or making presentations teaching whatever im going to dress up more   yes and i think that does make a difference because when you do have to be in front of people uh i think you the the tendency there is to wear dresses and suits and and uh more classical style of clothing   uhhuh uhhuh   what about the miniskirt   there are a few people every now and then that wear those to work there pretty strict about that though um ive never worn i just wouldnt i mean even to well jeans arent exactly professional but for some reason a mini skirt is to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans just because its maybe its just because of the sexist views and everything but you just feel like youre youre being showing too much leg i dont know i wouldnt want to wear a mini skirt to work i have seen a few people do it though but they they werent overly short and they werent overly revealing they were pretty much in good taste but um for me i just     umhum   for me i just i just couldnt wouldnt want to do that   well there are miniskirts and there are miniskirts there are some that are really short and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee and again it depends upon the size the shape of the person   yeah uhhuh thats what ive seen uhhuh   as well as the shape of the persons legs   uhhuh   now i also uh even though i retired from education i uh i do modeling and i teach at a modeling agency here   uhhuh   and uh so when we are doing wardrobing and we have uh two two hour classes in wardrobe we do discuss a great deal the miniskirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job   uhhuh   uh even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through uh grandmothers   uhhuh   in my class and uh when i always try to emphasize the clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad   uhhuh   because maybe they those are not the clothes that are the most uh appealing to you or the most uh complimentary to you   right   but uh the miniskirt many times will evoke comments you dont really want   right   and and then uh then youre in the situation where youre very unhappy   uhhuh well i feel like too on the job when you know theres men around and some of the managers are men you just you know you dont want them looking at your legs  necessarily and uh to me i just wouldnt feel comfortable in that at work   thats right well i i uh i have to agree with that even when they was very very popular in the early sixties uh i uh   uhhuh   uh again maybe because i was at the school there were still many teachers who wore miniskirts uh we had no regulation against it and a lot of the kids did of course and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers   uhhuh right     because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those miniskirts   right   and so i think uh uh of course now i go the other extreme i do not like to see in the corporate areas uh all the women dressed like men   uhhuh   with the suits and uh white shirts and ties and what have you so that they all look exactly the same   uhhuh   uh i dont like that i dont i think there should be individuality in dressing   uhhuh even with the very tailored look of a suit sometimes i like to have something a little just a little something thats feminine   yes   not you know you dont want to over do it but just a little a touch of it just to say yes i am a woman but i can be professional too   right well i and i dont think that you have to be manish and extremely tailored to to look professional   right uhhuh   i think that you you make of that what you wish and you can go the opposite direction and uh overdo all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you which dont belong in the uh at least in my opinion in the workplace uh but that that you can have a classical look without a lot of a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine because that was one thing i always fought against i started out as a physical education teacher   right uhhuh uhhuh   so i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or mannish uh and people would never ever guess that i was phys ed and um and that pleased me   right uhhuh   uh and uh so then i of course just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work and uh and i find even even at home here now i i will wear blue jeans or ill wear shorts and what have you uh and be very comfortable but when i go out somewhere then uh unless i have a pair of dress slacks i dont usually wear a lot of blue jeans   uhhuh   i have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how and so uh uh i just feel that uh you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort   uhhuh uhhuh   but uh there are certain norms that companies should be able to uh put out as guidelines for their employees   right thats what i one thing i like about TI is that they arent overly strict about what you wear and they dont you know your boss doesnt come up to you and say now remember tomorrow you have a meeting so youd better wear a suit i mean they they leave it up to you and your judgment to to use good judgment and dress tastefully and dress for whatever occasion you may have     right yes   the only real restrictions they have are uh no halter tops and no shorts even the long walking short of the squirts the the split skirts anything that that could be considered shorts they dont allow and they dont allow um   yes yes thats good   and they dont allow uh any sweat any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar or you know anything like that on it but   yeah umhum   other than that its pretty pretty lax and i think thats good because it does allow people to be individual and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day or you know if you want to be comfortable and casual you can and sometimes i think you   yes   may be more productive if youre comfortable with what your wearing and can be be feel more relaxed whereas uh   right   sometimes when your in the suit and feel kind of almost stiff and youre not you know maybe you dont uh cant get as comfortable to sit down and you know like when im writing training material i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day   right right   so thats i think that is good that theyre like that i do know theres a lot of companies that are very strict about what the employees wear and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and you know no variation and i dont i dont quite agree with that   yeah yeah well i dont either unfortunately i dont have to work in those companies  but uh i i uh   right   did have a group come over from one of the banks over the childrens hospital where i was volunteering and uh they were doing a presentation and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly alike men and women they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or slacks or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie i mean you could hardly tell the women from the men except for the lengths of the pants   uh right   and one was a skirt and one was a pant and uh and i think thats sad because that doesnt allow for any individuality   yeah uhhuh   thats uh can stifle creativity   right i agree   so   well it i guess weve talked probably long enough nice talking to you too i enjoyed it byebye   i guess so well its been nice talking with you uhhuh byebye
