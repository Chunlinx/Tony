                                 Property Is Theft            When your neighbor installsa burglar alarm thoughtful burglars are encouraged to choose a differenttargetlike your house for example Its rather as if your neighborhad hired an exterminator to drive all the vermin next door On the other handif your neighbor installs video cameras that monitor the street in front ofboth your houses he might be doing you a favor So the spillover effects ofselfprotection can be either good or bad            Considerthe different ways that people selfprotect against car theft Devices likealarm systems and the Club have a social upside Their proliferation mightmake car theft so unprofitable that potential thieves would decide to seek moreuseful employment though on the other hand its possible that theyll seekemployment as say arsonists or killers for hire But those same devices havea social downside They encourage thieves to prey more heavily on those whohavent bought one From a social viewpoint if the total number of thefts doesnot change then the expenditure on alarm systems is pure waste            For a much lower cost you can install fakeselfprotectionsay a little blinking red light that looks like its attachedto an alarm system or a cheap piece of foam rubber that looks from a distancelike the heavy metal Club Here again youre imposing a cost on your neighborsIf these devices become common the value of the real thing is diluted            That point was driven home tome the last time I shopped for a car Acura offered a security system asmandatory equipment Toyota allowed you to buy a car without a security systemYou could then go out and install your own system for considerably less thanwhat Acura was implicitly charging            But Idecided that Acuras systemeven at a much higher pricewas the better dealProfessional car thieves know that the security system is mandatory onan Acura and therefore know that my blinking red light is for real With theToyota even if I do install a real security system thieves might suspect meof trying to fool them and smash my windows to find out            Theres another kind of security systemavailable only in a few cities The Lojack is a hidden radio transmitter thatcan be activated after your car is stolen to lead police to the thief orbetter yet to the chop shop that employs the thief The transmitter is hiddenrandomly within the car so thieves cannot easily find it and deactivateit            The Lojack is completelyhidden Theres no way to look at a car and know whether it has a Lojackinstalled So unlike say the Club a Lojack will never prevent any particularcar from being stolen it will only increase the chance of its being recoveredBut from a social point of view the Lojack has the huge advantage ofhelping your neighbors rather than hurting them The Club convincesthieves to steal someone elses car instead the Lojack convinces thieves notto steal            And it does so withremarkable effectiveness Economists Ian Ayres and Steven Levitt have examinedthe effects of the Lojack in about a dozen cities over the past  years itsfirst introduction was in Boston in  Their task wasnt easy because justas the prevalence of the Lojack affects autotheft rates so autotheft ratesaffect the prevalence of the Lojackfirst because consumers buy more securityequipment when theft rates are high and second because regulators behavedifferently when thefts are high            But aftersorting all this out Ayres and Levitt found that the Lojack has anastoundingly large effect on autotheft rates It turns out that a  percentincrease in Lojack sales can reduce autotheft rates by  percent or moreWhats happening to all those car thieves Are they moving to other cities orare they becoming house burglars or are they turning into socially usefulcitizens Ayres and Levitt examined these difficult questions also and theirbottomline conclusion is that the Lojack really does prevent a lot ofcrime rather than just moving it to other venues            In fact although it costs only about  a year to have aLojack Ayres and Levitt estimate that each individual Lojack prevents about a year in losses due to theft In most cases that  benefitaccrues not to the Lojack owner but to strangers            By the criteria thateconomists usually employ this suggests that Lojacks should be heavilysubsidized just as visible security systemslike my neighbors home burglaralarm or the Clubshould be taxed When youre doing something that makesstrangers better off you should be encouraged to do more of it            If we all used the sameinsurance company you might expect that company to supply the appropriatesubsidy As long as your Lojack reduces the number of insurance claims thecompany should be willing to pay you to install it But with multiple insurancecompanies that doesnt work so well A company that insures only  percent ofthe populace will reap only  percent of the Lojacks benefits and so willundersubsidize them Worse yet large insurance discounts are illegal in manystates            The media have recently paida lot of attention to research on other kinds of selfprotection most notablythe work of John Lott and David Mustard on concealed handguns But the Lojackresearch is in many ways more informative because the authors were able to doa thorough job of distinguishing between benefits to the purchaser of aLojack and benefits to the community at large That discrepancy is the sort ofthing that leads markets to failin this case by providing too many Clubs andnot enough Lojacks
