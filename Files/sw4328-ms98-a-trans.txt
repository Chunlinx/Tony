        community ill start we have a lot of uh we weve started doing some and uh in in uh we live in a suburb of Chicago       recycling has become somewhat in vogue weve always had recycling centers around where you can take in newspapers and bottles and things and put them in the right bin but its totally voluntary and basically only the ecologically minded would go to such pains places because its its a drive out of your way to take things to these but recently we started a program i think is getting encourages a lot more participation which is uh you have to now pay for each trash bag that that the garbage man picks up you have to pay a dollar and a half and we uh you have to buy a sticker uh and it costs a dollar and a half and you have to put the sticker on your trash bag and if you dont have that sticker on there then the garbage man wont pick it up now thats that thats for regular trash if you have recyclable trash   i would   like newspapers or right now its limited to i think the newspapers and plastic bottles plastic milk bottles then theyll pick that up for free so theres the motivation basically your regular garbage you have to pay to get picked up and recyclable stuff if you put it in a recyclable bin or recyclable uh container they they give you one of these then that that doesnt cost anything so that encourages people to participate   well thats makes sense ours seems really crazy because well weve had the places all the shopping centers i mean the local shopping centers where theres a grocery store and         a you know drug store and so on have bins around where you can leave papers or aluminum cans that type of thing for uh oh the Kiwanis or some sort of groups pick them up and make money for their causes and those are fairly popular and work fairly well   uhhuh   and you can also take your own stuff to a recycling center and you know get the few pennies you get for the papers or cans i know some people who do that but to me that too much trouble for the few cents the uh so i just drop it off at the local place when i go to the store and let them you know some good agency make some money off of it what little they get and uh that works for me but now as i understand it from reading the paper the system seems totally backwards   right   uh they are starting a thing where all of our garbage bills are going up like a dollar and a half a month   uhhuh   and thats because they will give us containers you know certain colors of bins and stuff to put cans and papers and so on in that all makes sense but if you dont want to recycle you can say i dont want to recycle and save a dollar and a half a month   oh no   which the theory is that if you dont want to recycle with the city who actually has a private contractor do it uh if you dont recycle with the city then youre going to take it yourself and you know make your money off of your paper and cans somehow it seems to me like people will just say i dont want to pay the buck and a half and ill throw it in the garbage so   so like somebody messed up   it sounds to me like its messed up but theyve had   a strategic miscalculation on their part   i guess so well have to see what happens theyre just supposed to start distributing these blue plastic containers for cans and bottles and different kind different colors for different things uh   so its totally voluntary even if you pay your dollar and a half you dont you you can still put everything in the trash   you still could so it doesnt make a lot of sense to me and i think i understand it pretty well from both the paper and TV and well see what happens       uh   any idea how many people are going to do it are going to do it   oh supposedly the majority are   okay   its pretty ecologically conscious here   so some of the people will go along with it anyway   oh i think so plus a lot of people will probably just pay the buck and a half and not even notice the difference or care   yeah   but uh it seems strange now at the the university where i work its uh strange too because they have places you can leave cans and some campus organization recycles them   well   and uh there is a campus recycling bins not bins but like i work in a library   yes   and there are barrels where we can recycle newspapers and different types of things but theyre in staff areas but we have wanted to have specially marked trash cans next to all the copy machines
