contentcan be shuffled as easily as it can be transmitted Encryption puts viscosityright back into the fluid digital pipeline Curiously most of the propertyabolitionists seem to like this homebrew form of copyright Theres a strongeconomic rejoinder too as Bob Wright pointed out on these screens not long ago Mostpeople wont steal digital content if buying actually remains cheaper andeasier as it probably will But the free the bits view of things isnt justinconsistent or unfinished Its an analysis that hasnt progressed beyond thePampers stage of political theory            Twentyyears ago the Supreme Court announced that lawmakers couldnt ban abortions inthe first trimester of pregnancy but could ban them in the third Aconstitutional line is crossed Justice Blackmun reasoned when a fetus becomesviable outside the womb By that logic the constitutional right retreatswith every advance in neonatal medicine When medics learn how to incubate atesttube baby for the whole nine months the abortion right ought logically todisappear Except that it wont Logical consistency has nothing to do withit            Its a safe political prediction that the legalrights in intellectual property arent going to be abolished however badlybits may want to be free Even Hollywoods softielefties go all hard andcapitalist when it comes to intellectual property Jack Valenti Hollywoodslead flack in Washington spent the early s trying to kill the new videocassette recorder which he was sure would be used mostly to pirate hisclients movies Valenti didnt succeed but only because the VCR ended updelivering huge profits to the movie moguls Far more people use VCRs to rentmovies than to steal them            But people couldsteal movies if they felt like it The endofproperty cybersages argue thatthe law may say what it likes but the law doesnt matter any moreTechnological might makes right People with the machines will copy if theyplease and lawyers shouldnt try to stop them Unless of course thoselawyers work for Wired  which is very actively defending its owntrademark            But thispremise is also wrong The first point to recognize is that copyright is just acommercial form of privacy law Indeed for some its the only kind of privacythey still own Madonna can no longer stop you from gazing at her breastsCopyright at least makes you pay for the pleasure            So weve done breasts and weve done abortion lets moveon to the rest of your private life LexisNexis recently caused an uproar whenit offered to help personal biographical stuff on its way to freedom through adatabase PTrak accessible at  a pop The Social Security numbers in thedatabase were removed  days after its introduction technology trumped bypopular protest            Information wanting to be free doesnt seem so appealing when it includesdetails about all your own flesh and frailtiescredit history shoppinghabits records of where youve been what you asked for and what you tookYour modem doesnt know the difference between information called propertyand information called privacy And privacycloak of night stocking maskand any digital equivalentis all that separates the thief from the law Theharder it is to maintain privacy the easier it is to catch thieves Its nouse responding that the law itself protects privacy better than copyrightprotects a Spielberg movie If youre a technological determinist there is noprivacy law not in cyberspace            Which means that the easier it gets to stealfrom Spielberg the easier it gets for his lawyers to come after you Truetechnology empowers millions of potential copyright violators But Spielbergdoesnt have to catch them all Spot enforcement wellpublicized with blueflashing lights is what maintains speed limits on the highway            If youreenough of a pirate to be worth bothering about Spielbergs lawyers will getyou And the law will then seize your property like your Pentium Pro yourISDN card and your Jaz drive That is what has got thecyberlibertarians so agitated Do you see the irony They arent reallyproperty anarchistsquite the opposite in fact They reject the new propertybecause it threatens their absolute control of the old My highspeed modem ismine so your intellectual property must be mine too If I really own my modemthen I must have an unqualified right to dial up anywhere any time and suckin whatever is out there

Imagine no possessionsantiproperty zealots all miss the most fundamental point Property ispolitically neutral Sure property is the capitalists tool But thefeminists too And the libertarians The woman who wants an abortion saysits her uterus not Pat Robertsons The rancher says its hisland not the governmentprotected wolfs Your supposed constitutional rightto get an abortion or smoke dope or ride a Harley without a helmet allemerged from the Fourth Amendmentwritten originally to protect housespapers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures Whetheryoure talking about land abortion or environmental protection youinevitably drift into the rhetoric of property            Property is an endlesssuccession of bubbles in space or cyberspace with different people claimingan endless variety of interests in them Property is a bottle of champagne orthe name of the label or the whole concept of effervescent wine or perhapsjust wine in your bloodstream while you drive home in your Buick Control ofeach little bit of turf physical or virtual can always be made a bit moreora bit lesspersonal and private Politicians prosecutors judges andlitigators decide often one case at a time The deciding never ends becausepeople and the things they value change Technology will never end the tug ofwar            The only prognosis thatscertainly wrong is that all boundarysetting law will just somehow disappearbecause the Workers of the World have united or because information wants tobe free
