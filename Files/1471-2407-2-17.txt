                    Background        It has been suggested that solid tumours can not grow        beyond  cells without inducing the formation of new        blood vessels tumour angiogenesis     This blood        vessel formation requires proliferation of endothelial        cells cell migration and the lysis of the different        components of the matrix collagen elastin fibronectin        by several proteases One of great importance urokinase        uPA and its high affinity receptor the GPIanchored        membrane CD uPAR is critical in tumour progression and        its level of expression is correlated with poor prognosis        of various cancers such as prostate     breast            colon     ovarian     gastric     brain            and lung cancer     Urokinase uPA and its main        product plasmin belong to the very early proteases             that activate the metalloprotease MMP cascade and        therefore control cell motility tissue remodelling and the        activation of various angiogenic factors VEGF TGF Most        of these proteases eg uPA are localised at the tumour        site through receptors that are highly expressed on the        surface of activated endothelial cells and tumour cells A        high level of uPAR at the invasive edge of the tumour        concentrates uPA where neoangiogenesis occurs            generating the full activation of the MMP cascade            Furthermore various cellular migrations proceed upon the        transient attachment of the uPAR to matrix components eg        vitronectin     and uPA as well as plasmin activate        angiogenic factors such as VEGF HGF FGFs and TGF                     The inhibitors of the matrix lysis can be divided in two        categories the synthetic inhibitors and the endogenous        ones Most of the synthetic inhibitors are competitive        inhibitors of the metalloproteases mimicking the        substrate of the enzymes marismatat and derivatives The        endogenous inhibitors eg endostatin angiostatin        thrombospondin differ in their angiostatic activity from        synthetic inhibitors since they appear to also block        endothelial cell proliferation andor migration In this        paper we described the antitumour effects of a hybrid        protein consisting of the Amino Terminal Fragment linked        to Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor ATFBPTI        delivered by gene therapy with adenoviral vector        ATF is the Nterminal part of the uPA residues         that binds to the uPA receptor uPAR and thus inhibits the        formation of the uPAuPAR complex Systemic and local        delivery of an adenovirus encoding ATF have been shown to        inhibit the growth of primary tumour implants as well as of        tumour metastasis in different animal models      In        the ATFBPTI chimeric protein ATF has two functions         the anti uPA effect with its known angiostatic activity and         delivery of BPTI at the tumour site due to        overexpression of uPAR on tumour and endothelial cells        The ATF is species specific between the human and the mouse           and is not specific between the mouse and the rat        The murinised version of ATFBPTI differs by four amino        acids from the human version It was shown to bind to the        rat receptor and to inhibit plasmin activity in a rat model            BPTI commercialised as aprotinin is a serine        protease inhibitor prepared from bovine lung tissue which        dose dependently inhibits human trypsin plasmin and        kallikrein Aprotinin acts in a number of interrelated ways        to provide an antifibrinolytic effect Thus aprotinin is        mainly used in the clinic as antihaemorrhagic agent in        extracorporal circulation valve replacement coronary        bypass for preventing postoperative haemorrhage and as        anti protease in acute pancreatitis BPTI has been used        systemically in a few animal tumour models and showed        antitumour effects in a mouse hepatoma lung carcinoma        and mammary carcinoma       and in a fibrosarcoma        of the hamster     However BPTI was not further        developed as a systemic anti tumour agent probably because        of its anti fibrinolytic property that might preclude its        use in cancer patients Its linkage to ATF is expected to        ameliorate or reduce that side effect        In this study the tumour growth inhibiting effect of        ATFBPTI gene transfer was investigated and compared to        endostatin and ATF The adenoviral vector was administered        intravenously which leads to the ATFBPTI production and        secretion by the liver or by intra tumoral injection In        the latter case the protein is mostly produced by        transduced tumour cells Two transplantable rat bronchial        carcinomas growing either as subcutaneous implants or as        lung metastasis were employed as targets Levels of        ATFBPTI in the plasma and in tissues were determined and        the association with tumour responses is described                    Methods                  Animals          Pathogenfree inbred male WagRij and Brown Norway          rats weighing  to  gr were purchased from Harlan          The Netherlands All animals were fed ad libitum with          laboratory chow and water and were kept under standard          laboratory conditions For assay of plasma hEndostatin          and mhATFBPTI rats were anaesthetised with isoflurane          and bled by tail vein puncture and the blood was          collected in EDTA containing tubes All animal procedures          were performed in accordance with the official guidelines          after obtaining permission of the animal welfare          committee                          ATFBPTI cloning          The plasmid encoding the ATFBPTI pAB was provided          by P Quax TNOPG Leiden The ATF plasmid was          constructed by deleting the DNA sequences encoding amino          acids  to  of the urokinase cDNA plasmid Then a          DNA fragment encoding the amino acids residues  of          the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor BPTI was cloned          into the ATF plasmid resulting in a plasmid encoding the          ATF the BPTI and the  Cterminal amino acids of          urokinase including the stop codon After sequence          confirmation the ATFBPTI cDNA was cloned into the          recombinant adenovirus Ad shuttle vector Adapt The          murinised ATFBPTI mhAB plasmid was constructed by an          identical procedure using the Tyr Arg uPA          mutant cDNA as starting sequence                              Adenoviral vectors          Recombinant adenovirus vectors were generated in          PERC cells by homologous recombination between an          Adapter plasmid pAdapt and the E deleted Ad  DNA          plasmid as described elsewhere     The expression          cassette contains a CMV promoter and SV poly A signal          As a result of the absence of sequence overlap between          the Adapt plasmid and the Ad E sequences integrated          into the genome of PERC the vector stocks used in this          study does not contain replicative competent adenovirus          RCA              The Ad Adapt mhAB encodes for a murinised form of the          human ATFBPTI     In this construct the mhAB is          preceded by the native secretion signal peptide of the          human urokinase The human endostatin coding sequence          InvivoGen CA USA was cloned in the Ad Adapt shuttle          vector The encoded endostatin corresponds to the           residue of the human endostatin described by OReilly et          al  with an intact Nterminus HSHRDFQ          preceded by the secretion signal peptide of the human          IL The AdAdaptLuc and the AdAdaptLacZ are          recombinant adenoviral vectors in which the E region of          Ad is retained and the gene of interest luciferase or          LacZ replaces the E region The Ad Adapt empty is          identical to Ad Adapt mhAB except that it does not encode          any transgene          All vectors were produced on PERC using standard          procedures     Infectious units iu were determined          by end point cytopathogenic effect CPE assay on           cells     Viral particles were determined by HPLC              The particle to infectious unit ratio was always          lower than                           Elisa and activity analysis          An mhATFBPTI ELISA was developed by P Quax et al              using a monoclonal antibody specific for the ATF          as the capture antibody and a polyclonal antibody          directed against BPTI as the detector antibody As a          standard we used urokinase or mhATFBPTI The biologic          activity of the mhATFBPTI was tested in vitro in a          plasmin inhibition assay using the chromogenic substrate          S Chromogenix Mlndahl Sweden Diluted samples of          Ad Adapt mhAB infected A cells medium were incubated          for  min at room temperature with  pmoll plasmin          S was then added and after  hours incubation at  C          the A            was measured to determine the          conversion of the chromogenic substrate Controls          consisted of plasmin solution incubated with buffer or          with  KIU ml aprotinin          The human endostatin activity was tested in the human          umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC proliferation          assay In short HeLa cells were incubated for  days          with the Ad Adapt human endostatin and the medium was          collected Fibroblast growth factor bFGFstimulated          HUVEC in  wells plate were incubated for  days with          hEndostatin infection medium The proliferation of the          HUVEC cell was determined by measuring the incorporation          of BrdU Levels of human endostatin in rat plasma was          determined with a human enzymelinked immunoabsorbent          assay ELISA kit InvivoGen CA USA according to the          manufacturers procedure                          Tumour models          The L tumour is a bronchial squamous carcinoma that          originated in a WagRij rat after intrapulmonary          implantation of an iodine seed     L          adenocarcinoma was induced in Brown Norway rats by local          irradiation of the thorax     Both tumours are also          adapted to cell culture and give rise to tumours with the          same histological characteristics as the original          tumours These two carcinomas were serially passaged in          syngeneic rats for more than  passages The CC          tumour is a dimethylhydrazineinduced moderately          differentiated colon adenocarcinoma exhibiting weak          immunogenicity     The tumour is transplantable in          syngeneic WagRij rats The subcutaneously growing tumour          has a low microvascular density of    n            and a volume doubling time of  days   n   For          the experiments the tumours were established in the          flank of rats by implanting small pieces      mm          of tumour tissue subcutaneously as described before                       The size of the subcutaneous tumours was measured in          three dimensions at regular intervals using a Vernier          calliper The volume of the tumours was calculated from          the three tumour dimensions measures a b c with the          formula V  abc The doubling time of the different          tumours was calculated between volume of  and  mm                    Microvascular density MVD in the L L and CC          tumours was determined as follows When the tumours          reached the size of      mm the animals were          sacrificed and frozen sections through the middle of the          tumours were prepared We used an antimouse CD          antibody American Diagnostica that cross reacts with          rat CD to stain specifically the endothelial cells          that can then be easily selected by the image analyser          software Qwin The software allowed us to quantify the          surface of the selected endothelial cells and to relate          it to the surface of nonnecrotic tumour tissue The end          value is the surface of all endothelial cells as          percentage of the surface of nonnecrotic tissue the          microvascular density          The global process including cell infection and          protein production is commonly called in the literature          adenoviral permissiveness The in vitro permissiveness of          the different cell lines to adenovirus was determined by          infection of the cells by graded MOI of Ad Adapt          Luciferase The Luciferase activity was measured in the          supernatant of the cell culture lysate after  days of          culture and expressed in RLU  milligram of protein The          in vivo permissiveness of the tumours was assessed by          analysing the lysate of the whole tumour without any          surrounding tissue  days after injection of the Ad          Adapt Luc Adenoviral vector was administered in a volume          of  L to      mm tumours          For the metastases model the L and L cell lines          were cultured in Dulbeccos modified Eagles medium          DMEM supplemented with  FBS When the cells reached           of confluence they were trypsinised washed and          resuspended in PBS  L tumour cells or  L          tumour cells  ml were injected into the tail vein of          the syngeneic rat The animals were sacrificed after           days L bearing Brown Norway and  days L bearing          WagRij the lungs fixed in Bouin solution and the          nodules on the surface were counted The first          experiments in which animals were not treated showed          that all animals developed multiple metastases in the          lungs The average number of nodules counted on the lung          surface was  in WagRij and  in Brown Norway rats          The volume doubling time of the metastases in the lung          was extrapolated from the volumes determined at two time          points The volume at  days for the L and at           days for the L was determined by measuring the size          of microscopic metastasis on lung sections  metastases          per rat  rats per tumour model The final volume of          the nodules on the lung surface was assessed on day           for the L and day  for the L

        whole organs were dissected out frozen in liquid          nitrogen and stored at  Organs were homogenised in          phosphate buffered saline pH  using a blender To lyse          the cells DTT SIGMA The Netherlands  mM and Triton          x  Merck The Netherlands were added After          centrifugation at  rpm for  min  l of the          supernatant was added to  l of luciferase assay          substrate Promega The Netherlands Relative light          units RLU were determined for  s using a luminometer          Lumat  Wallac Belgium The amount of protein in          the extracts was determined using a commercial kit          BioRad laboratories The Netherlands based on the          Coomasie brilliant blue G binding assay developed by          Bradford     The level of luciferase activity in the          tissue homogenates was expressed in RLU  mg protein The          background level of this assay is  RLUmg protein          and was defined by measuring luciferase activity in          organs of non treated rats                          mhATFBPTI determination in tissues          Rats were sacrificed by an overdose of isoflurane and          the blood was flushed out by cutting the vena cava and          injecting  ml PBS into the right ventricle The whole          organs or tumours were dissected out and weighted frozen          in liquid nitrogen and stored at  C Tissue and organs          were homogenised in phosphate buffer pH  using a          blender To prepare a cell lysate DTT SIGMA The          Netherlands  mM and Triton x  Merck The          Netherlands were added After centrifugation at           rpm for  min the ELISA was performed on  dilution          of the supernatant Total protein in the extracts was          determined as described above The concentration of          mhATFBPTI was expressed in ng  g tissue The background          level of this assay is   ng  g tissue and was          defined by measuring the mhATFBPTI in organs of rats          treated with the empty vector                          LacZ expression assay          Fortyeight hours after AdAdaptLacZ administration          rats were sacrificed and organs were removed and cut in           mm sections Sections were fixed in  phosphate          buffered formalin pH  for  min at room temperature          and incubated overnight in  M sucrose at C The          samples were subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen Ten          micron thick frozen sections were prepared and stained          with bromochloroindolylgalactopyranoside          Xgal solution Molecular Probes The Netherlands          overnight at  C Finally sections were counterstained          with HematoxylinPhloxinSafran                          Statistical analysis          Survival time until tumour size of  ml was analysed          by log range analysis of KaplanMeier curves Analysis of          variance ANOVA was used to analyse the differences in          tumour growth delay Scheffes test was employed to          analyse the difference between the numbers of metastases          between plasma concentrations and between MVDs                            Results                  Tumour characteristics          Carcinomas of the lung were chosen as it is the most          frequent tumour in the cancer population Several          vascularisation phenotypes can be observed in the          different histological type of lung cancer Therefore a          bronchial squamous cell carcinoma and an adenocarcinoma          with different microvascular density MVD were selected          to assess the inhibition effect of the ATFBPTI The          growth characteristics of the tumours are listed in Table           The L adenocarcinoma grows roughly fold faster          than the squamous cell carcinoma L This difference of          growth rate holds for in vitro culture of the cells as          well as for subcutaneous tumours and lung metastasis          Probably related to the growth rate the vascularisation          of the L tumours was significantly higher p            Scheffetest than that of the L tumours The          distribution of endothelial cells in each of the tumour          is homogeneous in the viable part of the tumour However          the L tumour develops a necrotic area with no vessels          in the centre of the tumour mass as it grows above               mm          The in vitro permissiveness to Ad of the cultured          cell line showed that the L carcinoma had a  log          higher permissiveness than the L tumour Fig A These          characteristics are preserved in vivo when using the          luciferase as well as the LacZ marker gene delivered in               mm tumours Luciferase activity  days          after intra tumoral injection of  iu Ad Adapt Luc          was  log higher in the L tumours than in the L          adenocarcinoma Fig B The luciferase activity in          various organs of the WagRij rats is about the          background level and  to  log higher in those of the          Brown Norway rats Our interpretation is that a          significant proportion of the vector escapes into the          circulation and reaches the liver and spleen because the          L tumour cells are poorly infected by the adenovirus          These observations were corroborated by the results of          the intratumoral injection of the Galactosidase          encoding adenovirus Histological examination  days          after administration of  iu Ad Adapt LacZ showed          that the L tumour preparations were almost completely          blue whereas the L tumours showed few blue cells around          the needle track Fig  This inhomogeneous distribution          is not specific for the L tumour as it was also          observed in the L tumours when injecting a lower dose          of virus data not shown                          In vitro activity of mhATFBPTI and          hEndostatin          To assess the functionality of the vectors the          biological activities of the encoded transgenes were          tested in vitro As depicted in Fig A the mhATFBPTI          expressed in the supernatant of Ad Adapt mhAB infected          A cells was able to inhibit  of the plasmin          activity at a picomolar concentration mol wt  kD          Furthermore mhATFBPTI was shown to inhibit plasmin          activity at the cell surface of rat aortic smooth muscle          cells RASMC expressing rat urokinase receptor                       The biologic activity of the endostatin encoded in the          adenoviral vector was determined through the bFGF          simulated HUVEC proliferation assay A linear dose          response relationship between endostatin concentration          and percentage of inhibition of HUVEC proliferation could          be demonstrated Fig B The ED of endostatin           ng  ml was in the range of published data              Further the angiostatic and antitumoral activities of          the human endostatin has been demonstrated in different          rat models                                Secretion of mhATFBPTI and hEndostatin in          animals          Brown Norway rats were injected intravenously with          different doses of Ad Adapt mhAB from  to iu and          the concentration of mhATFBPTI was assessed in the          plasma at various time points postinfection The          detection limits of the ELISA in plasma is around  ng           ml The results depicted in Fig  show a linear dose          response with a maximum level of  ng  ml obtained          when  iu Ad Adapt mhAB was injected intravenously A          linear dose response relationship was also observed in          both rat strains after iv injection of graded doses           iu to  iu of vectors encoding the marker genes          luciferase and LacZ data not shown In the WagRij rats          the plasma levels of mhATFBPTI were  times lower Fig          A after the same vector dose The plateau concentration          after intravenous injection of  iu Ad Adapt mhAB was          around  ng ml plasma In both rat strains the plasma          levels reached a plateau after  days and remained          constant for at least  month The levels of ATF in the          plasma were similar to those of the ATFBPTI in the Brown          Norway as well as in the WagRij rats Fig B          The human Endostatin was measured in the plasma of          animals that received  iu Ad Adapt hEndostatin          intravenously Fig C The concentrations of endostatin          were much higher than those of mhATFBPTI The levels          reached a plateau around  g  ml in the Brown Norway          rats and around  g  ml in the WagRij rats Otherwise          the kinetics were roughly similar to those of mhATFBPTI          with a plateau lasting for a month and one log lower          levels in the WagRij than in the Brown Norway rats                          Effects of systemic administration of Ad mhAB on          tumour growth          The purpose of these experiments was to investigate          the response to angiostatic gene therapy of the two          selected lung tumours with different characteristics          Firstly we investigated the effects of systemic delivery          of mhATFBPTI on the growth of subcutaneous tumour          implants          Brown Norway rats bearing L tumours were treated          with intravenous injections of Ad Adapt mhATFBPTI daily          for  consecutive days As depicted in Fig  three          different doses of vector were compared and a significant          inhibition of the tumour growth p   ANOVA was          observed with the  highest doses  iu and            iu Seven days after the viral injection the plasma          concentrations of mhATFBPTI were about  ng  ml and           ng  ml respectively which is slightly higher than          the levels obtained after a single injection In          contrast treatment of such tumours with a low dose of          adenoviral vector  iu that induced lower plasma          levels of mhATFBPTI of  ng  ml did not significantly          inhibit tumour growth Thus it appears that the anti          tumour activity of mhATFBPTI is dependant on its          systemic concentration Higher doses could not be          achieved without inducing unacceptable liver toxicity as          manifested by a severe inflammatory infiltrate and          vacuolisation of the hepatocytes Therefore  iu was          the maximal accepted dose for these experiments          In a second experiment Ad Adapt mhAB and Ad Adapt          hEndostatin were compared Fig  L tumour pieces          were implanted subcutaneously on day  and  iu of          each vector were injected iv in a single dose on day           The treatment with Ad Adapt mhAB caused a significant          inhibition p   ANOVA of the growth of the          L tumours as compared to the Ad Adapt empty or Ad Adapt          mhATF treated animals Fig A The human endostatin          which plasma level was around  g  ml  days after          vector injection showed a slight but not significant          effect p   ANOVA on tumour growth compared to          the empty vector The mhATFBPTI effect was achieved with          a plasma level of mhATFBPTI of about  ng  ml between          day  and  after the virus injection It is required by          Dutch law to sacrifice animals when the tumour volume has          surpassed  ml That intervention precluded the          continuation of the growth curves after the time point at          which the first animal is sacrificed Therefore the          animals with a tumours volume under  ml were plotted on          a Kaplan Meier analysis graph The result showed a          significant p   rank test improvement in          time to sacrifice showing an Ad Adapt mhAB specific          protective effect In the control group the rats n            reached the limiting size after  to  days whereas in          the Ad AB treated group n   the rats had tumours          above  ml after  to days Mean time to sacrifice          was prolonged by  days Fig B          To complete the study the same treatment protocol was          applied to WagRij rats bearing the slowly growing and          poorly vascularised L adenocarcinoma A single dose of           iu of the different vectors was injected iv on day           Fig C The plateau concentration of mhATF          mhATFBPTI and endostatin were low around  ngml for          the  first and around  gml for the last          respectively No significant inhibition of the tumour          growth was observed in either the mhATFBPTI the mhATF          or the endostatin groups as compared to the empty vector          group We concluded that the plasma levels of our          therapeutic agents were too low to induce any response in          this model In an attempt to improve this issue we          studied direct injection of our vectors into the          tumour                          Intratumoral Ad Adapt mhAB administration delays          tumour growth in L          Adenoviralmediated delivery of the mhATFBPTI          directly at the tumour site was studied in the L lung          carcinoma implanted subcutaneously into WagRij rats           days after implantation one intratumoral virus injection           iu in  ml PBS per day for  consecutive days          was performed and tumour growth monitored Seven days          after the beginning of the treatment a significant p            ANOVA delay of tumour growth was seen in          the Ad Adapt mhAB injected group Fig A The          mhATFBPTI plasma levels were under the detection limit          of the ELISA          In contrast local delivery of the vector to the very          low permissive L tumour did not lead to any significant          tumour growth inhibition by Ad Adapt mhAB Fig B                          Local concentration of mhATFBPTI          The results of the systemic administration in the          Brown Norway suggested a correlation between the plasma          concentration of mhATFBPTI and the tumour response The          concentrations of mhATFBPTI were measured in the plasma          and in the tumour at  and  days after intravenous or          intratumoral injection of the mhATFBPTI vector Table           The systemic delivery of  iu Ad Adapt mhAB in L          bearing Brown Norway rats resulted in a concentration of          mhATFBPTI in the tumour of about  g  g tumour          This intratumoral level was maintained for at least           weeks and is  times higher than the plasma level This          suggests that mhATFBPTI concentrates in the tumour The          concentration of mhATFBPTI in the L tumours after          intravenous delivery of the vector was much lower around             ng  g tumour but as in the Brown Norway rats           time higher than the plasma concentration          The local delivery of the transgene in the tumour          resulted in a low concentration of ATFBPTI in the L          tumour    ng  g tumour and high concentration in          the L tumours    g  g tumour This was          expected from the  log higher permissiveness to          adenoviral infection of the L compared to the L          tumours                          Effect of mhATFBPTI on lung metastasis          In the subcutaneous tumour model the majority of the          tumour cells implanted die and the surviving cells grow          in the fibrous interstitial tissue of the skin The          subsequent angiogenesis give rise to one small artery          that will vascularise the whole tumour This probably          does not reflect accurately the clinical situation where          a primary carcinoma cell grows in a highly vascularised          epithelium The angiogenesis in nonsmallcell lung          carcinomas in patients shows four different patterns of          vascularisation basal diffuse papillary and alveolar              The basal and the diffuse are the most frequent          patterns found in squamous carcinomas and adenocarcinomas          respectively Both are accompanied by a destruction of          the normal lung parenchyma and the production of newly          formed vessels Our lung metastasis models in the rat          also represent these two main patterns the L          adenocarcinoma shows a diffuse architecture and the L          squamous cell carcinoma grows with a basal histological          architecture Further characterisation showed that the          growth rate of the lung metastases is roughly similar to          that of subcutaneous implants the difference between L          and L being maintained at both locations Table           The protective effect of systemic administration of Ad          Adapt mhAB was assessed by treating the animals with a          single iv dose of Ad Adapt mhAB or Ad Adapt hEndostatin          or with Ad Adapt Empty as negative control virus The          treatment was administered when the micro metastasis were          a few hundreds cells large as observed in nottreated          rats This size was reached at  days after injection of          the L tumour cells and after  days in the L model          The animals were sacrificed when the lung nodules were          expected to be  mm diameter in the control group As          depicted in Fig Athe L metastasisbearing rats          responded to treatment with Ad Adapt mhAB with a more          than  reduction in the number of metastases          Macroscopic inspection of the lung surface and          microscopic examination of lung sections gave similar          responses It is also noteworthy that treatment with the          endostatin vector which results in a much higher level          of the angiostatic protein  g  ml does not          significantly reduce the number of metastases In          contrast the L lung metastasis were not significantly          influenced by either the Ad Adapt mhATFBPTI or the Ad          Adapt mhATF treatments Fig B          Surprisingly the systemic administration of Ad Adapt          mhATFBPTI does inhibit the growth of L lung          metastases but not of the L metastases In view of the          high permissiveness of the L tumour cells it seemed          possible that the lung metastases were transfected with          the mhATFBPTI gene Therefore the permissiveness of the          lung micrometastasis was estimated by determining the          galactosidase and luciferase activity  and  days          after the iv injection of  iu Ad Adapt LacZ or Ad          Adapt Luc into animals bearing L or L micrometastasis          in the lungs The results were however essentially          negative The luciferase activity was under the          background level in all cases and the sections of the          frozen lungs showed no tumour cell stained for the          galactosidase in either L or L metastasis bearing          animals data not shown  animals per group Thus it          seems that the metastases are not actively contributing          to the levels of mhATFBPTI in the lungs and the          concentration in the metastases should be similar to the          concentration in the lung parenchyma all the blood being          washed out Therefore the concentration of mhATFBPTI          in the lung of the two rat strains was determined The          results depicted on Table show that the mhATFBPTI          concentration is significantly higher p            Scheffes test in the WagRij rats than in the Brown          Norway rats and is not influenced by the presence of          metastasis The WagRij rats concentrate the mhATFBPTI          in the lung parenchyma about  fold reaching          therapeutic levels In contrast the same systemic          treatment has no effect on the L tumour growing          subcutaneously and this can be explained by the fact          that tumour does not concentrate the mhATFBPTI          sufficiently                          Influence of the tumour mass on the anti tumour          activity of mhATFBPTI          Radio and chemotherapy are usually expected to be          less effective on large tumour mass than on small          tumours In contrast it was shown that certain          antiangiogenic compounds eg Combrestatin act the          other way around namely that they are more active on          large tumours  cm  than on small tumours           cm  The supposed explanation of this peculiar volume           response relationship is based on the concept that the          requirement for new vessels increases with the size of          the tumour     Nevertheless this is not a general          rule for angiostatics Various compounds such as          endostatin metallo proteinase MMP inhibitors and          TNP do not inhibit the tumour growth when its size is          too large Thus large tumours that are richly          vascularised might be more sensitive to angiostatic          therapy In order to investigate this issue in the case          of ATFBPTI two subcutaneous tumours with difference          vascular density were treated at different time points          figure and  In the highly vascularised L as well          as in the poorly vascularised CC tumours ATFBPTI          could significantly inhibit the growth of the tumours          when they were around  mm at the time of treatment          In contrast when the tumours reached a volume of           mm the treatment had no more influence on the tumour          growth The receptor of ATFBPTI uPAR is known to be          principally present at the outer edge of the tumour mass          and as the volume increases the proportion of uPAR in          the tumour will decrease Thus it was expected that          large tumour mass were insensitive to the treatment In          this extent ATFBPTI is similar to the MMPs inhibitors          in that their best indication would probably be for          treatment of residual disease or small metastases                            Discussion        Agents that inhibit the growth of new vessels in the        tumours include a wide range of different compounds Most        of them are not toxic for endothelial cells but impair the        dynamic process of cell proliferation migration and matrix        remodelling Thus these agents are mostly effective on the        formation of new vessels and not on the preexisting        vasculature Accordingly such therapy is not expected to        cause a dramatic shrinkage of an established tumour It        appears from the different clinical trials with endostatin        thalidomide the synthetic inhibitors of MMPs and the        different antiVEGFs that angiostatics though slightly        effective in advanced diseases are more likely indicated        in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy and as an        adjuvant therapy to treat small tumour masses in        particular local minimal residual disease or        micrometastasis In whatever situation long term systemic        delivery is considered to be the treatment of choice        Therefore gene transfer may offer an advantage The        potential of adenovirus based vectors to infect the liver        cells after intravenous injection makes them suitable        vectors for establishing a prolonged systemic delivery of        the encoded protein However our findings so far show that        the achievable plasma levels of mhATFBPTI are limited by        adenoviral damage to the liver To circumvent this        limitation direct injection of the vector in the tumour        was employed in an attempt to achieve higher intra tumoral        levels of the therapeutic protein        High levels of mhATFBPTI were achieved in the        permissive L tumour by local delivery of the vector and        subsequently a significant inhibition of tumour growth was        obtained The WagRij rat liver is poorly permissive to the        adenoviral infection and accordingly systemic        administration of the vector induces low plasma levels of        mhATFBPTI  ng  ml Consequently the intra        tumoral concentration though  times higher than the        plasma levels was not high enough to inhibit its growth        In contrast the L lung metastasis in the WagRij did        respond to the intravenous administration of the vector        encoding mhATFBPTI though the resulting plasma level was        low It was observed that the mhATFBPTI accumulated in the        lung parenchyma independently of the presence of        metastasis up to a concentration of about  ng  g This        fully explains the therapeutic response observed in this        lung metastasis model        In contrast the L adenocarcinoma cells have a low        permissiveness to the adenovirus Consequently in case of        direct intra tumoral delivery of the vector the tumour        concentrations reached were low  ng  g and tumour        responses were not observed However the Brown Norway rat        liver is  times more permissive to the adenovirus and        produced high levels of the vectorencoded protein        Additionally the tumour tissue concentrates  to  fold        the mhATFBPTI from the plasma resulting in high intra        tumoral levels Using graded doses of Ad Adapt mhAB a        linear relation was observed between the dose and the        plasma level as well as between the dose and the tumour        growth delay It appeared that a significant tumour        response could be obtained when the intra tumoral        concentration of mhATFBPTI was above  ng  g of tissue        In contrast at the same plasma levels that inhibited the        growth of the subcutaneous L could not induce any        response on the metastasis in the lungs The tissue        concentration of mhATFBPTI in the lung of the Brown Norway        rats was apparently too low  ng  g for eliciting        a decrease in the number of metastasis                    Conclusion        The tumour growth inhibition in both poorly and highly        vascularised L and L tumours was achieved only when the        concentration of mhATFBPTI in the tumoral mass or in the        surrounding tissue reached a value of at least  to         ng  g In contrast mhATF and the human endostatin even at        higher molecular plasma concentration than the mhATFBPTI        did not achieve any significant inhibition of tumour growth        as in established subcutaneous tumours as well as in        micrometastasis in the lungs Other investigators reported        that at those concentrations endostatin and ATF induced        responses of tumours and metastases in mice      The        absence of a response in our tumour model might be due to a        lower sensitivity to angiostatic agents In that case our        results suggest that ATFBPTI is a more potent agent than        endostatin or ATF                    List of
