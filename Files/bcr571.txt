                    Introduction        The clinical outcome is generally positive for patients        with nodenegative breast carcinoma ie those patients        without detectable metastases in the lymph nodes who have        been treated with surgery or with surgery and radiation        therapy The disease spreads in about  of the patients        however and their lives are at risk of death              Genetic tests capable of identifying patients at risk for        metastatic spread andor better treatment targeted to        eradicate metastatic tumor deposits could have a dramatic        impact on the overall survival of these patients        The construction of a panel of molecular genetic markers        for identifying the  lymph nodenegative mammary        carcinomas that are prone to develop metastases    would        be valuable in indicating those cases in need of early        aggressive therapy There would also be considerable        benefit to the  of women with mammary carcinomas who are        not likely to metastasize by sparing them the physical        mental and financial costs of the treatment In addition        further knowledge of the genetic mechanisms that play an        important role in metastasis could ultimately lead to the        development of improved therapeutic procedures        The evidence for the role of gene alterations in        promoting metastasis in general and in mammary carcinomas        in particular is still accumulating It is probable        however that like tumorigenicity suppressor genes and        oncogenes many more genes involved in metastasis remain to        be discovered since the process is complex involving a        large number of pathways     Most of the known genetic        mechanisms involved in the progression of a tumor to the        metastatic state involve the loss of function of genes that        prevent cells from becoming invasive These are similar to        tumorigenicity suppressor genes whose loss of wildtype        growth regulatory function leads to unregulated or        malignant growth Similarly the wildtype metastasis        suppressor genes regulate the cells mobility and its        response to environmental messages presumably keeping most        cells localized and differentiated Mutation or complete        loss deletion of the wildtype counterpart of any such        gene in a malignant cell may make that cell more motile        invasive or metastatic In particular mutations of genes        regulating cell adhesion molecules have been reported to be        metastasisfostering alterations        In human        breast cancers several other genes have been found to be        associated with metastasis namely         nm              KAI              mta             KiSS             PTENMMAC     and         BRMS            Representational difference analysis RDA a DNA        subtractive hybridization method     was used in the        present study to test the working hypothesis that to        achieve the metastatic state primary mammary carcinoma        cells must acquire genetic changes in addition to those        changes that led to transformation With the RDA method        DNA from normal cells was compared with that of the        metastatic cells of the same patient The recovered        differential sequences were then mapped on human        chromosomes and used to screen DNA samples from normal        primary and metastatic cells of five additional ductal        mammary carcinoma patients to determine whether these        sequences were consistently associated with metastasis                    Materials and methods                  Tissue samples and cell lines          Normal breast tissue and lymph nodes with metastatic          cells of a yearold patient C with ductal          mammary carcinoma were provided by the Cooperative Human          Tissue Network Additional matched normal primary and          metastatic tissue samples were collected from four          patients patient  C patient  CH          patient  C and patient  C from the          Cooperative Human Tissue Network and from one patient          patient  DS from the Surgical Pathology          Department of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and          Montefiore Medical Center The DNA samples from mammary          carcinoma cell lines HCC HCC HCC and          HCC and matched normal cell lines were received          from Dr R Parson of Columbia University New York          USA                          Isolation of cells from biopsy samples by single          cell microdissection          Single cell microdissection SCM was performed on          hematoxylin and eosinstained tissue sections of positive          lymph nodes from the ductal breast cancer patient samples              In the present method of SCM a Zeiss axiovert          phase contrast photomicroscope fitted with a television          monitor and a Narashige mechanical microdissector was          used A glass micropipette was used to draw up individual          cells after dissection          Tumor cells were identified in the microscope and          using the tip of a glass micropipette attached to a          syringe they were dissected out without disturbing the          surrounding tissue and were then drawn into the pipette          After five to  cells were collected in the tip it was          broken off and dropped into a sterile eppendorf tube          Approximately  metastatic tumor cells were          collected in this manner for RDA experiments The SCM          method was used to isolate tumor cells for the RDA          experiment because lasercapture microdissection LCM          equipment was initially not available                          Isolation of cells from biopsy samples by          LCM          LCM    was used for isolating tumor cells from          primary and metastatic tissue samples of additional          patients for screening candidate metastasisassociated          DNA sequences MADS by PCR After many tumor cells have          been captured on the LCM cap it is then placed on a           l PCR tube containing ATL lysis buffer Qiagen Inc          Valencia CA USA and the DNA is extracted                          DNA extraction          About  g DNA was isolated from approximately           cells microdissected from metastatic tumor and normal          glandular and stromal breast tissue samples using a          modified method of DNA extraction from archival tissues          Briefly the microdissected cell pellet was incubated          overnight in lysis buffer Qiagen Inc with proteinaseK          at C Glycogen carrier was added to the cell lysate          and DNA was extracted using a phenolchloroformisoamyl          alcohol mixture followed by ethanol precipitation                                       RDA and characterization of differential          products          The RDA procedure was basically as described by          Lisitsyn and coworkers     using the           Bgl II representation The          metastatic cancer cell DNA was used as the driver and          the DNA from the normal cells was the tester Three          rounds of hybridization were performed to subtract the          common sequences The primers used for representation and          hybridization steps of RDA are presented in Table  DNA          from the differential bands lost in metastasis was          cloned using the TA cloning system pCR Invitrogen          Co Carlsbad CA USA Clones were selected at random          and used as  PdCTP Amersham Biosciences Corp          Piscataway NY USA probes on dot blots or Southern          blots containing amplicon DNA from the original normal          and metastatic cells to verify whether these sequences          are actually present in the normal cell DNA sample and          missing in the metastatic cell DNA samples Positive          clones showing signals in normal cell DNA and missing in          metastatic cell DNA were sequenced A homology search          was performed using the National Center for Biotechnology          Information National Institutes for Health USA NCBI          Blast program and physical mapping                          Radiation hybrid mapping          Radiation hybrid mapping was used to localize the MADS          on human chromosomes using highresolution GeneBridge           radiation hybrid panels Research Genetics Inc          Carlsbad CA USA Based on the sequences of          differential products isolated from RDA experiments           pairs of PCR primers were designed for  groups of          candidate gene sequences Based on the PCR results          chromosome localization of these sequences was determined          using the Whitehead InstituteMIT databases                              Fluorescence in situhybridization of MADSIX          Chromosome preparations were made from          phytohemagglutininstimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte          cultures from normal individuals The slides were fixed          in methanolacetic acid and were airdried The probes          used for fluorescence           in situ hybridization FISH were          the Spectrum Green labeled centromere of  Vysis          Downers Grove IL USA and the Spectrum Green labeled           kb sized MADSIX sequence Primers were designed from the          BAC clone NCBI NIH USA RP containing the          MADSIX sequence to obtain a  kb sized PCR product          encompassing the MADSIX region Table           The  kb DNA fragment was run on a  gel isolated          from gel and eluted in water and was labeled with          Spectrum Green using the nick translation method          following the manufacturers instructions Vysis          Threedayold slides were denatured in  formamide           SSC sodium citratechloride solution at C The          dehydrated and airdried slides were used for          hybridization according to published methods with some          modifications      The slides were counterstained          with diamidinophenylindole dihydrochloride          Molecular Probes Eugene OR USA and images were          captured on the Nikon E using the Quips Pathvysion          system Applied Imaging Santa Clara CA USA                            Results                  Isolation of candidate MADS          RDA was performed with the DNA recovered by SCM from          normal cells and from metastatic cells in the lymph nodes          of a patient with ductal mammary carcinoma Since the          objective was to isolate sequences that are lost in the          progression of cells from normal to metastasis we          focused on the products of RDA in which the metastatic          cell DNA was used as the driver and the normal cell DNA          was the tester          As shown in Fig  RDA differential products were          isolated and DNA was extracted from each of the five          bands obtained from the loss side of the third round of          hybridization and DNA from each band was cloned          separately One hundred clones from each DNA band were          saved and a subset of  clones  clones from each          differential product was selected randomly for further          characterization These  clones were probed labeled          with  PdCTP on dot blots containing normal cell DNA          and metastatic cell DNA It was found that  clones          hybridized only with the normal cell DNA and did not          hybridize with DNA from the metastatic cells Fig a          The remaining clones hybridized with both normal cell DNA          and the metastatic cell DNA This may have been due to          incomplete subtraction Of the  clones that hybridized          only with the DNA of the normal cells  were selected          and tested further by Southern blotting to verify the RDA          results None of these clones hybridized with the DNA of          the metastatic cells and all were detected in normal          cells Fig b                          Sequencing and homology search of candidate          MADS          RDA derived  clones that were sequenced and those          with identical sequences were grouped Ten unique          candidate MADS were thus identified The sequence          homologies found by searching the nucleotide databases of          these MADS are presented in Table  The search revealed          that these MADS have homology with sequences on          chromosome  MADSIII chromosome  MADSI          chromosome  MADSVII and MADSVIII chromosome           MADSVI chromosome  MADSIX chromosome           MADSX chromosome  MADSV and chromosome           MADSII Nine of these MADS have about  homology          to known human DNA sequences and the remaining MADSIV          was found to be novel having no homology with the          sequences in the gene banks                          Radiation hybrid mapping of MADS          We used the GeneBridge  Radiation Hybrid panel          Research Genetics Inc to localize these  MADS on          human chromosomes For this physical mapping and also to          be able to use these sequences to screen additional          patient samples primer pairs were designed for each          sequence and tested by PCR on a positive control human          genomic DNA and on two negative controls Chinese          hamster genomic DNA and no template Of the  MADS          tested only five MADSIV MADSVII MADSVIII MADSIX          and MADSX were successfully mapped to specific human          chromosomes Table  Of these five MADS MADSIV did          not show any match with gene bank sequences and therefore          appeared to be a novel DNA sequence The chromosome          localizations for MADSVII MADSVIII MADSIX and MADSX          obtained by physical mapping and by homology search data          were in agreement                          Further characterization of MADSIX          While the homology results of MADSIX revealed that it          has  homology with the sequence on chromosome q          BACAC the radiation hybrid mapping showed          that MADSIX is localized to a cR interval between          markers D and DS corresponding to human          chromosome  band q     To confirm that MADSIX          is not an artifact and is actually a human DNA sequence          located on chromosome q we used the sequence as a          fluorescence           in situ hybridization probe on          human metaphase chromosomes Based on the sequence of the          BAC clone NCBI RP encompassing MADSIX a  kb          DNA fragment containing MADSIX was generated by PCR To          localize MADSIX cytologically we labeled the  kb sized          MADSIX with Spectrum Green Vysis and hybridized on          normal human metaphase chromosomes Figure shows that          the MADSIX probe was hybridized on the q region The          Spectrum Green labeled centromere of chromosome  Vysis          was used as a control          To determine whether MADSIX is indeed associated with          metastasis DNA was screened from cells recovered with          the LCM method from normal primary and metastatic tissue          samples from five additional patients Because MADSIX          was mapped to chromosome q we also wanted to          determine whether it was located in the region          encompassing a wellknown metastasisassociated gene           PTEN              First DNA samples from these five patients were          screened by PCR using primers designed for MADSIX and           PTEN  MADSIX showed PCR          amplification in normal cell DNA samples of all the five          patients but the intensities of the PCR bands were less          in the primary tumor cell DNA samples and were totally          undetectable in the metastatic cell DNA of patients  and           Fig  The           PTEN gene on the contrary was          detected without any difference in the intensity of PCR          bands in the DNA samples of normal cells primary tumor          cells and metastatic lymph node cells of all five          patients          Second MADSIX and           PTEN were screened in four breast          tumor cell lines HCC HCC HCC and          HCC and matched normal DNA The first three tumor          cell lines had known losses in specific chromosomal          regions and the fourth had loss of homozygosity of the           PTEN gene PCR screening of MADSIX          and           PTEN showed that MADSIX is present          in all four tumor cell lines but           PTEN is only present in cell lines          HCC HCC and HCC and is missing in          HCC Fig                             Discussion        Reports show a statistically significant increase in        loss of heterozygosity events involving unknown genes on        chromosome q     on chromosome q    and on        chromosome q     in metastatic breast cancers        Measuring loss of heterozygosity OConnell         et al     found that the        majority of lymph nodenegative primary breast tumors did        not amplify a region linked to DS and DS while        lymph nodepositive breast tumors retained heterozygosity        for these markers These data could imply the existence of        metastasis promoting genes in that region or        alternatively the observed molecular changes may be used        as a marker of metastatic propensity            In the present investigation we used RDA in an attempt        to identify genetic alterations related to breast cancer        metastasis by comparing normal cell DNA and metastatic cell        DNA of a ductal breast carcinoma patient Ten unique        candidate MADS were identified and the sequence homologies        found by searching the gene bank of these MADS are        presented in Table  The search revealed  homology        to known human gene sequences for nine of these MADS but        MADSIV was found to be novel having no homology with the        sequences in the gene banks Further characterization of        MADSIX revealed interesting information on the genes and        sequence tagged sites STS markers surrounding it Within        a range of  Mb of MADSIX we noticed two         CDC genes cell division cycle         protein isoform  and isoform  and two splice variants        of the         ZWINT gene without known exact        function In the range of  kb there are nine STS        markers RH SHGC SHGC AFMXD        SHGC SHGC SHGC STSG and        SHGC        Physical and cytological mapping of MADSIX confirmed        that it is located at q Screening of MADSIX on DNA        samples from five more sets of normal primary and matched        metastatic tumor samples Fig  revealed that MADSIX is        lost in the transition from normal cells to primary cells        to metastasis cells in two of five cases three of six        cases if the case used in the RDA assay is included PCR        screening of         PTEN on these five patient samples        and screening of MADSIX and         PTEN on a breast carcinoma cell line        that had loss of homozygosity of the         PTEN gene revealed that MADSIX is        neither a part of the         PTEN gene or localized in the        homozygous loss region of chromosome q encompassing the         PTEN gene These findings together        strongly suggest that MADSIX is a candidate marker for a        novel metastasis suppressor gene Additional archival cases        are being screened to determine whether MADSIX is a        reliable marker for metastasis in ductal breast        cancers                    Competing interests        None
