                                 Promise Keepers  NOW             On Oct  hundreds ofthousands of Promise Keepers assembled in Washington DC to praise Jesusrepent their sins and pledge to take charge of their families and communitiesNearby protesters from the National Organization for Women chanted Racistsexist antigay Bornagain bigots go away Usually the media sympathizewith this particular criticism of conservative Christians but not this timeHow did the Promise Keepers succeed where the religious right has often failedBy framing old stereotypes in new ways                            Control vsresponsibility NOWs chief rap on PK is that it tells men to takeleadership at home This connotes unequal power a nono among rightsbasedliberals and feminists But leadership has two sides PK plays down the poweraspect and plays up the opposite aspect male responsibility for domestictasks This drives a wedge between communitarian and rightsbased liberalsisolating NOW from its usual allies            PK alsoargues that the biblical as opposed to secular meaning of leadershipis service and that the Bible while instructing wives to submit to theirhusbands also instructs husbands to submit to their wives This has led to thebizarre spectacle of scriptural debates on TV chat shows in which PK spokesmenand NOW president Patricia Ireland argue chapter and verse PK wins not byrefuting Irelands exegesis but by displaying subtlety in its ownby arguingfor example that a true leader recognizes his wifes talents and takes theinitiative to help them flourish The viewer comes away persuaded that PK ismuch more openminded than the Christian Coalition Conversely by showing noflexibility Ireland comes across as though shes against the missionaryposition                            Misogyny vs masculinity Criticsaccuse PK leaders of crusading against the feminization of man True theygoad men to action by accusing them of acting like sissies But they also teachthat masculinity lies in moral strength not in money power or stoicism Theypreach vulnerability humility contrition intimacy sharing weepingtenderness and surrender They deride machismo Humility they say includesletting your wife pay the bills if God gave her better math skills than you andletting her pursue the professional dreams God planted in her Which explainswhy Ted Koppel has compared PK founder Bill McCartney a former football coachto Alan Alda                           Segregation vs selfhelp As with Louis Farrakhans Million Man March twoyears ago feminists have assailed PKs exclusion of women But McCartneyfrustrates this criticism by differing from Farrakhan in two ways He has maderacial inclusion a central project of PK and he has stipulated that gendersegregation must be a temporary means toward integrating and reconciling thesexes            McCartneys rationale for temporarysegregation draws heavily on liberal themes Men he argues have beenculturally uprooted and stripped of their identity They need space to protectand repair themselves This argument combines the religious rights standarddefensive posture were not imposing our values were just protecting themfrom assault with liberal gender protectionism eg girls should be educatedseparately from boys so as to free them from cultural pressure andmulticulturalism men must preserve their unique masculine culture            Accordingto Coach McCartney women dominate church attendance and have their ownChristian support groups whereas PK is mens only refuge Men wont open upand cry in womens presence because its not safe They need the company ofbuddies to assure them of their masculinity so that they can break down withoutfeeling like sissies This message has induced some liberal pundits to call thePromise Keepers pathetic thereby undermining NOWs portrayal of them asdangerous bullies                            Materialism vs idealism In politicspractical benefits usually beat principle Most women feel less oppressed bytheir husbands pretensions to authority than by the work that falls to thembecause of their husbands neglect PK leaders have won over many women andassuaged feminist pundits by addressing the latter problem Be first to thedryer they tell men Turn off the television and empty the dishwasher Theyinstruct fathers to spend more time with their kids and to forswear adulteryabandonment and domestic abuse PK routinely embarrasses feminist critics byproducing testimony from women who love the way PK has transformed theirhusbands behavior                           Condemnation vs compassion Opponents make much ado of PKs injunctionsagainst abortion and homosexuality Ireland has lambasted McCartney forspeaking at Operation Rescue rallies years ago and for promoting a Coloradoballot measure that would have restricted laws protecting gay rights Usuallythe media view these positions as mean but PK leaders take a softer approachThey never speak of gays as an organized threat And when asked abouthomosexuality they always subsume it in a general rule against extramaritalsex                            Reproach vs repentance For decadesfeminists have criticized moral conservatives who blame women for untimelypregnancies and abortions Now along comes PK to blame men Instead ofadvocating legislation against abortion PK instructs men to stop having sexoutside marriage and to stop pressuring their wives and girlfriends to haveabortions To critics who construe this as an attack on abortion rights PKsdefenders paraphrase the liberal slogan that NOW famously applied to abortionIf you dont like Promise Keepers dont marry one            ThePromise Keepers talk far less about abortion and homosexuality than theircritics and the media do Theyre more interested in spiritualselfflagellation and renewal Their ventures into social topics focus onalcohol drugs domestic violence adultery divorce illegitimacy crime andurban decay                            Puppets vs persons NOW accuses PK ofbeing too friendly with the bad boys of the religious right media mogul JamesDobson who gave PK its initial seed money and promotes it on his radionetwork Pat Robertson who promotes PK on television and Gary Bauer whoheads the Dobsonbacked Family Research Council PK denies engaging inpolitics with these men but Ireland says PK is acting as theirreligiousright marketing tool            Far fromprotecting PKs reputation the boys keep trying to get inside its blouse PKPresident Randy Phillips urged men at the Washington assembly to set asidepolitics and focus on God but Operation Rescue and the FRC showed up todistribute pamphlets The FRC invited the men to sign petitions for thePartialBirth Abortion Ban thereby adding their names to its politicaldatabase Others who have signed up for PK have subsequently turned up onRepublican mailing lists                            Imperialism vs enlightenment Even ifPK isnt in bed with the religious right many liberals predict that itscommitment to restore traditional morality will inevitably draw it intorightwing politics The groups military culture plays into this indictmentas do Coach McCartneys hideous sports metaphors Men he says have droppedthe ball They need a halftime pep talk and a new game plan They mustdefend morality like offensive linemen protecting the quarterback Many ofthe groups speakers and supporters are prone to using Christian war metaphorsbattleground army of God civil war of values This kind of talk spooksmost folks            PKspokesmen emphatically deny a political agenda They describe the group as arevival movement aimed at changing hearts not a reform movement aimed atchanging laws They point out that they postponed the Washington assembly from to  to avoid getting embroiled in last years election Unlike theChristian Coalition they dont keep a membership list and they expect todisband when God decides that PKs revival mission is complete            In this dispute tone matters more than content PK needsto show less of its macho side and more of its sensitive side So its leadershave begun to play down the war metaphors They have turned the other cheek toNOWs attacks In Washington they asked the assembled men to pray for thecountrys political leaders instead of judging them They have also instructedthe Promise Keepers to seek civic assignments from their local pastors notfrom the movements elite We stop short of prescribing what that agendashould be because its beyond our competence says PKs vice president            By projecting this kind ofhumility PK puts its critics in the posture of aggressors Irelandshairtrigger charges of intolerance have backfired convincing the media thatNOW is intolerant Ireland persistently denounces PK for excluding anyone whois not Christianroughly equivalent to denouncing a synagogue for confiningits membership to Jews NOWs objections to the PK lifestyle have prompted somejournalists to question where NOW gets off secondguessing women who embracethat lifestyle            By now its clear who haswon the war Many feminists including the president of the MsFoundation have expressed sympathy for the Promise Keepers and an interest incoaxing them toward gender equality rather than opposing them NOWs vicepresident in retreat says NOW was only trying to educate people that PKisnt purely benign Ireland complains that PK spokesmen won the war becausetheyre slick like Ralph Reed Actually they won because they arent Theyadmit ignorance and error They answer nowin questions They listen tocriticism and openly contemplate changing their ways If they were sellinganything but integrity theyd be a disaster
