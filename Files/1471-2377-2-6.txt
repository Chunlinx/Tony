                    Background        Patients with Alzheimers disease experience a        progressive cognitive loss leading to increasingly shorter        periods during which they can safely be left alone and to        dependence on their caregivers for help with the activities        of daily life         The MiniMental State        Examination MMSE    is commonly used in clinical        practice to assess cognition whereas in research the        cognitive part of the Alzheimers Disease Assessment Scale        ADAScog    predominates There is therefore        interest in how cognitive function observed for patients in        clinical trials compares with the results from clinical        practice and the likely effects on patients wider        functioning            In this study we investigated the relationship of        patients cognitive function to dependence on caregivers        before the patients reach a severe stage of the disease        Cognitive function was assessed with both the ADAScog and        the MMSE Our analyses employed three different definitions        of dependence In one approach caregivers assessed the        number of hours of supervision patients required each day        in another patients were assigned a level of dependence        based on their care needs     and in the third        caregivers were asked questions about the patients ability        to independently perform activities of daily living that        had been attempted in the preceding two weeks            In a clinical setting MMSE scores are frequently        available and conversions of cognitive scale scores from        one to the other have been proposed      One aspect        of this study evaluates whether it is reasonable to convert        MMSE to ADAScog and predict dependence based on the        converted score The reasonableness of doing this is judged        based on how similar the results are to what would be        obtained if a subjects actual ADAScog score were        known                    Methods                  Data sources          Data were obtained on  patients diagnosed with          mildtomoderate Alzheimers disease studied in two          randomised clinical trials of galantamine Reminyl                This is a posthoc analysis employing data          obtained from patients baseline visits before they          began treatment in the trials All patients enrolled in          these trials were diagnosed with Alzheimers disease          according to NINCDSADRDA classification     The          patients had a mildtomoderate disease MMSE scores           with a history of cognitive decline gradual          onset and progressive disease over a period of at least          six months Cognitive function was assessed using both          the ADAScog and MMSE scales Caregivers of the patients          included in these analyses agreed to participate in the          trial                          Dependence          Dependence was measured using three definitions          derived from the hours of supervision needed from a          caregiver the amount of care needed and the patients          ability to carry out the activities of daily life          The caregivers were asked to assess whether the          patient required hour supervision and if this was not          considered necessary caregivers reported the number of          hours the patient could be left alone each day From          these data the amount of supervision time required by a          patient during the course of a day was derived Patients          were considered to have become dependent on caregivers if          the caregivers reported that they required more than          twelve hours of supervision each day          Patients care needs were recorded using an instrument          that was developed and validated specifically to assess          dependency of patients with Alzheimers disease              This dependence scale was designed to assess levels of          need and therefore the care expected to be required as a          result of the loss of cognitive and functional skills          typically observed in patients with Alzheimers disease          Each caregiver was asked thirteen questions about the          type of care the patient required Depending on the          responses patients were assigned to one of six levels of          dependency with level zero representing independence and          level five the highest level of dependence Items in          level three and above indicate that patients need          supervision and assistance with common tasks for example          they need to be watched when awake or escorted when          outside or accompanied when bathing and eating Patients          assigned to dependency levels of three or higher were          considered to be dependent          The Disability Assessment for Dementia DAD scale was          also completed by the caregivers     This instrument          was developed and validated to measure the functional          disability of patients with Alzheimers disease          Caregivers answered questions about the patients ability          to independently perform both instrumental and basic          activities of daily living that had been attempted in the          preceding two weeks The proportion of DAD activities          successfully completed out of those attempted is then          determined and reported as a percentage                          Analyses          Analyses were conducted separately for each measure of          dependence In addition to the two measures of cognitive          functioning age gender time since onset of cognitive          problems use of antipsychotic medication presence of          extrapyramidal symptoms and living situation were          considered as potential predictors Since the MMSE and          ADAScog are correlated separate models were constructed          for each of the outcomes using each cognitive scale          alone          The relation of the two dichotomous dependence          outcomes  hours supervision and dependence          level to potential predictors including cognitive          function was investigated initially in bivariate          analyses For continuous predictors such as MMSE and          ADAScog scores linearity in the log of the odds of the          outcomes was verified over subintervals of the          predictors For categorical predictors such as gender          the odds ratio was computed and tested for significance          The significant predictors were retained and included in          a logistic regression model to estimate the odds ratio          for being defined as dependent and to measure the effect          of cognitive function adjusting for other factors A          stepwise forward procedure was used to identify the most          important predictors          Due to a skewed spread of DAD scores over its range a          transformation was required to normalize the          distribution Since the DAD is scored as a proportion          the recommended transformation is arcsin square root          DAD The relation of the transformed DAD scores to the          predictors was determined using correlation coefficients          ttests and ANOVAs Predictors were retained in two          multivariate regression models to investigate the          relation of the transformed DAD score to either MMSE or          ADAScog score and other determinants A stepwise forward          procedure was used to identify statistically significant          predictors          We then used these models to investigate how well MMSE          values converted to ADAScog predict dependence compared          to predictions based on the actual ADAScog values after          adjusting for other factors The MMSE scores were          converted linearly to ADAScog values a decrease of           MMSE  an increase of  ADAScog points or ADAScog           MMSE For each patient the DAD score was then          predicted based on the actual and converted ADAScog          scores The difference between the two predictions was          used as the measure of agreement The predicted DAD          scores were then compared to each other                            Results        The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of        the  patients included in these analyses are        summarized in Table  Two patients were excluded from the        analyses because their MMSE score was reported as zero On        average caregivers reported that their patients required        about  hours of supervision each day SD  There was        considerable variation in the responses as  N          were reported to require no supervision while  N          were felt to require hour supervision Approximately        twothirds required more than  hours of supervision and        their mean ADAScog MMSE and DAD scores were        significantly worse than those of patients who were deemed        less dependent        Overall  of patients were assigned to the dependent        care levels    and their mean DAD score was        significantly lower than that of those who were less        dependent  vs  ttest p          Antipsychotic medication was prescribed to  of the        patients and they too had DAD scores lower than patients        not prescribed antipsychotic medication  vs         ttest pvalue   Far fewer patients overall had        extrapyramidal symptoms however among those that did the        mean DAD score was lower than for those without symptoms         vs  ttest pvalue         The odds ratio for both categorical measures of        dependence was significantly higher with worse cognitive        impairment increasing with each detrimental point change        in ADAScog or MMSE score adjusting for age gender and        use of antipsychotic medication Table  For the MMSE        model a onepoint difference was associated with an        increase in the adjusted odds for requiring  hours        supervision per day of   CI  and for dependence        level    of   CI  A onepoint        difference of the ADAScog score was associated with an        increase in the adjusted odds for requiring  hours        supervision per day of   CI  and for dependence        level    of   CI  after adjusting for age        gender and use of antipsychotic medication        For predictions of dependence based on transformed        scores from the DAD two separate models were developed One        model was based on the ADAScog and the second on the MMSE        Table  In each case the cognitive score was found to        be a strong predictor of dependence No significant        interaction was present        Disability predicted directly using the actual ADAScog        scores and other patient characteristics was compared to        prediction based on ADAScog scores converted from MMSE        scores adjusting for other patient characteristics Figure        shows a summary of these predictions For MMSE scores        ranging from  to  we calculated the average predicted        DAD using the actual ADAScog scores with standard        deviation the corresponding values for the predictions        with converted values are also shown There was a close        agreement between the average predictions For example our        sample contained  subjects with baseline MMSE score of         the average ADAScog score for these patients was         which is reasonably close to the converted value of         The average DAD score predicted from the actual ADAScog        scores was  with a standard deviation of  The        average of predictions made with converted scores and other        patients characteristics was  SD   for a        difference of  Similarly the average difference in        predictions for other MMSE scores were also reasonably        small ranging from  to  equivalent to less than        a single activity on the DAD                    Discussion        The loss of a patients ability to independently perform        daily activities is an important aspect of Alzheimers for        patients and their families and for health care        decisionmakers Our study has demonstrated that relatively        small degrees of loss of cognitive skills in patients at        the mildtomoderate stages of the disease leads to an        increased risk of losing the ability to live independently        In our study of patients recruited for clinical trials at        the mildtomoderate stage  already required more than         hours of supervision per day This is consistent with        other studies which have shown that sometimes a dependent        stage is reached quite early in the disease when        caregivers decide that the patients can no longer be left        alone safely              A threepoint difference in MMSE score was associated        with an increase in the adjusted odds of requiring more        than  hours of supervision of  at the time of the        assessment and if dependence is measured as level three or        higher the odds increase by  even after adjusting for        age gender and use of antipsychotic medication Similarly        a point difference in ADAScog score is associated with        an increase in the adjusted odds for requiring more than         hours of supervision of  and  for having a        dependence level greater than two The very comprehensive        measures of dependence collected at the start of these        trials allowed us to evaluate the association of dependence        with a patients cognitive functioning at that point in        time It is important to note that since this is a        crosssectional study we could not investigate the extent        to which decreases or improvements in cognitive function        would be associated with changes in dependence over        time        Behavioral disturbances are common amongst patients with        Alzheimers disease    and antipsychotic medications        were prescribed for about onequarter of the patients in        our study Antipsychotic medication use was also        consistently found to be a predictor of having an increased        risk of disability regardless of how dependence was        measured This is consistent with other studies which        found that patients using antipsychotic agents    or        displaying psychotic symptoms       are more        likely to experience a faster functional decline Very few        patients in our study had extrapyramidal symptoms it is        therefore difficult to interpret their meaning with        certainty Other published studies however have linked        these symptoms with greater functional decline                     One limitation of this study is that these data were        collected from patients enrolled in clinical trials and        therefore our sample may not be representative of patients        routinely treated in clinical practice Nevertheless these        data provide a unique opportunity for analyses as        information was collected using both the MMSE and ADAScog        scales and three measures of dependence        Both the instruments used to measure dependence in this        study had been developed and validated specifically for use        in patients with Alzheimers disease      The        dependence scale was designed to assess the care needs of        patients and the DAD scale to measure functional        disability Both instruments were developed to avoid some        of the common problems observed with other measures of        functional decline such as whether certain instrumental        activities of daily living had ever been performed by the        patient     Our results were consistent between the        models as the same predictors of dependence were found to        be important regardless of how dependence was measured        The MMSE is convenient to administer and practical to        use during a routine clinic visit but clinical trials        conducted to study treatments for Alzheimers disease have        primarily used ADAScog as the measure of cognition This        study indicates that it is reasonable to convert MMSE to        ADAScog and predict dependence based on the converted        score Our study suggests that in clinical practice a        conversion that assumes one MMSE point is equivalent to         ADAScog points or ADAScog  MMSE will        yield a reasonably accurate estimate of disability for        patients at the mildtomoderate stages This is also        consistent with the findings in another study ADAScog         MMSE     If its relation to dependence is        the main reason to measure cognition then clinicians can        be reassured about these conversions                    Conclusions        In our study patients who had relatively small degrees        of greater loss of cognitive function whether measured        using either the ADAScog or MMSE did appear to be at        increased risk of being dependent on caregivers        Understanding the relationship between a patients current        cognitive status current therapies and their need for care        may assist clinicians in the management of patients        diagnosed with Alzheimers disease Moreover this        information can facilitate discussions and planning with        caregivers Future studies conducted to evaluate these        relationships longitudinally can further inform our        understanding of the relationship between cognitive        function and dependence
