buying things for which they have noobvious practical need It is a store that knows yuppie materialism is a kindof materialism that thinks of itself as antimaterialistic because yuppiestend to confuse their restless pursuit of Authenticity when purchasing retailgoods with an indifference to material things It is a store that takeseveryday items and buffs them up just enough that they seem like luxury itemsand yet usually keeps prices relatively low It is a store that if youhappen to be an affluent baby boomer understands more about you and the thingsthat give you pleasure than you understand yourself            The typical posture of such an enterprise is thatit is to quote promotional material for REI a popular chain of camping gearstores more than a store It is a community

retailing Trader Joes and RestorationHardware Although they position themselves as practicality stores youdnever visit them to buy more JellO for the kids or a molly bolt to hang a newwarehouse lamp Rather they invite you to question the underlying assumptionsbehind your everyday needs and to reorder those needs            Both stores are somewhat difficult to classify TraderJoes sells food but it isnt really a grocery store The traditional grocerystore handles between  and  items says Trader Joes spokeswomanMichele Gorski We handle between  and  But dont think of it as agourmet shop because

essentially the amusebouches servedup before the main course which is a sleigh bed a leather and cherry bentwoodrecliner or some other hunk of massive retro furniture Restoration Hardwareis a home

stores like Restoration Hardware and Trader Joes Commodify your dissentIn a book of essays with that title the process of turning counterculturerebellion into profitmaking opportunity that does absolutely nothing tochallenge the status quo is described in various settings such as Nike whichused William S Burroughs to sell sneakers and the films of Quentin Tarantinoalways hip but scrupulously contentfree In the case of RestorationHardware and Trader Joes the dissent hence the commodification is a bitmore subtle and has more to do with the harnessing of postgrad hauteur mingledwith a longing for simpler times But in both stores one is similarly invitedto live out vain fantasies about who one is or should be The spell is brokenonly when you leave the store realize that youve just bought  worth ofmerchandise and understand youre just another schmuck consumer
