                what kind of coins do you primarily collect   um basically i my preference is Arab coins   hum   and ancient coins   hum ive got a uh ive got a few i dont know i dont know i dont even know if theyre real but they seem to be very old Greek or Roman coins that somebody gave me as i when i was a kid never done anything with them i still got still got them in a box   umhum   im mostly into uh   American gold and silver dollars and stuff like that   oh very interesting um over the years of course by uh my grandparents used to give me silver dollars so ive got a few of those tucked away but   umhum   um your Greek and Roman coins might you know if if theyre um in good condition might be worth something you might want to drag them out and   i keep meaning to do that everytime i go to a show i keep saying well ill take them with me and let somebody look at them they just they just feel phony you know they feel like theyre made of lead or something and uh they dont have any sort of its its got a its got a like a picture on it   umhum   but theres no uh inscriptions or or dates or anything else   that would be the Greek ones     yeah   okay because i think most the Roman ones have   had something on them   right right so this   yeah it had a it had a had a has a bust of somebody on there but uh no sort of identifying marks or anything   umhum um it the are they silver or   no i dont no theyre not theyre its its too heavy for silver its its more like lead i think fairly soft   bronze oh interesting   yeah i think theyre fakes           did did somebody go over to the Middle East where they could have picked up some fakes pretty easily   probably  i dont know where they got them from they just came up gave me a whole bag of these things   oh umhum   its probably about thirty or forty of them in there   gee thats   yeah they   you might be sitting on a gold mine   wouldnt that be something   right um i dont know a lot about um Greek and Roman although im a member of an organization and that is the the primary interest of some ancient uh Numismatic Society Club   umhum   and so most of the people collect Roman with a few collecting Greek so every now and then we have a program so ive picked up a bit   hum   but um if it if theyre really soft and very early they could be uh i think they call them Lydian coins   huh   and um   gosh all these years ive been thinking they were fakes maybe theyre real     right i dont uh you know i i guess they say that a lot of people in the in the Middle East particularly can pick up fakes   umhum   you know if you go to um uh a fight and then the people say oh look what i just dug out of the ground and they sell you something they made last night   umhum   but um       i think thats fairly recent phenomena probably   sounds like some of the coin dealers i know           now now  theyre supposed to theyre supposed to be licensed and the um above board       right i used to be a coin dealer so i i i know i know those guys you know   oh i see oh and you made your own   yeah i got a whole roll of Krugerrands here would you like to buy i just made them last night       heres a nice uh twenty dollar gold eagle uh just just manufactured in Lebanon last year           was uh was the gold worth i mean was it really gold   yeah that they they are gold theyre just of course the the twenty dollar gold pieces go for coin value not the bullion value   right   and amazingly enough youre youre into Middle Eastern sort of coins the the largest amount of fakes of US gold is made in Lebanon   oh really   yeah   is that uh still still true   yeah still is   wow   yeah thats sort of like a cottage industry industry over there   umhum   uh and and theres some very specific things you can find you can even narrow narrow it down to where it was made i mean people are so aware of these things that there are certain identifying marks on there that would not be on a real one and uh you you can almost tell the area somebody probably even knows the guy who made them   you mean make oh i suppose he he has to protect himself too so that somebody cant say you know when hes selling them that somebody else made it i mean its so that he gets his own profits   yeah well the  yeah coin dealers are supposed to be smart enough not to fall for that gimmick but i i have seen a few of them sell these things       and course you have to you have to be able to prove they they knew it was counterfeit  and thats always very difficult   hum oh i see otherwise the the buyer is responsible i mean responsible   well he can he can usually go back to the dealer but if if its an unscrupulous dealer hell just say hey you know you you had an opportunity to see it you know its yours course you can always turn around and sell it in court and but youd have to go in on a fraud count and that wouldnt   uhhuh   fraud is very difficult to prove   umhum umhum   because you have to you have to show they knowingly did it   right   and thats all hes got to say is well in my in my professional judgment it was a it was a real coin   umhum   so you know its his word against mine   right right     thats one of the reasons i got out of the business there was too many shenanigans going on   oh thats interesting because im more interested in the research and im doing some dye link analyses of of these early coins from the six and seven hundreds and so and so im not into the the buying and selling business   umhum   um it sounds like im wise   yes       yeah nowadays the the the way the uh the market is and the and the way the uh grading systems have changed over the last few years thats primarily what got me out of it they they kept changing the grading systems on coins and you know you go out and buy a very nice silver dollar collection and youve graded it at the current grade and then the next year theyve changed the grading system and now these things are worth a fourth of what you paid for them you know its just it it just got it just got ludicrous after a while   oh umhum umhum   uh what what what the the standards for for an uncirculated silver dollar changed so many times in three years and a lot of people lost lots of money on that course the the persistent dealers will just sit there if they graded them as M S sixty five then by golly theyre M S sixty five i dont care what you say   umhum umhum   and theyll keep them until some fool comes along and buys them   right   at inflated prices   umhum i think thats thats the the hardest thing is that people who dont really know feel sometimes a sometimes for example i know um you know the ancients better but       because its old they figure its got to cost you know thousands of dollars   oh yeah yeah i mean its really its it silly i mean i i i used to have people walk into my shop with um Indian head pennies you know   umhum   and they say wow you know this is really old yeah well its not worth anything ill give you a nickel for it you know   oh       and even even some of the rare coins that a lot of people have never even seen like um like two cent pieces   right right   and things like that those are not those are not even expensive i mean you can pick up very nice ones for eight nine dollars   oh really i didnt know that   oh yeah yeah theyre cheap theyre super cheap um   oh that   several i mean its its it its funny the way the business works because therere so many things that are enormously out priced   umhum   um some some later proof sets because they have a slight error in them are are worth hundreds of dollars you know and and the coins themselves arent worth very much at all face value basically   umhum   uh and then of course the silver coins are more and more being traded for bullion than anything else   umhum   uh you can you can buy bags of silver coins a a bag has a thousand dollars face value in it and its traded for silver   oh   yeah   so basically if if someone isnt really interested in the coins its not some an investment   no its its more of a uh its a commodity purchase really   umhum   uh it is fun though to buy these bags and go through them because you do find some some uh nice coins i mean people who are starting out collections and need to fill holes in their books can fill a whole bunch of them with these uh with these bags   umhum   uh especially you you want to get a mixed bag of course dimes quarters and halves   umhum   uh but you could fill a whole bunch of uh holes with these things i used to i used to advertise buying wheat pennies um id give a dollar a roll which two cents a piece which is basically overpriced   umhum   um but i used to go through i id get loads and loads of these things i ended up one time with about uh about about twelve bags of these things and id gone through all of them and i found a couple of them i found a nineteen O nine VDB   oh   and uh a um a nineteen eleven which is fairly scarce i found several good ones out of there   umhum   peoples giving it to me for two cents i uh thats okay   right   turn around and sell it for fifteen dollars
