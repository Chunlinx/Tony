                hi so do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have   uh actually no because because im in school i i kind of miss out on most of the current events i just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it   do you watch a lot of TV to get the news then   uh i i dont watch a lot of it but thats the only basically thats my only major source of information   um   what about what about you   well i read um i get a bunch of different things i get a newspaper every day and i try to at at least have a few minutes to look through that and i look through uh i get a Newsweek every week which i i pretty much read that cover to cover and i as far as you know that satisfies most of the short term news i get uh dont watch much TV dont have enough time and uh dont listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that you know they might give you a little blurbs like this happened or that happened and thats about all i ever hear of it   yeah   uh but most of my news probably comes from Newsweek and for the longer term i i read um like Scientific American and and uh Readers Digest and some of those other types of magazines   uh   that come out which they the news isnt like immediate what youd generally think of as news but its recent material   and its more in depth   yeah its its more in depth less broad well actually its probably isnt less broad but its just more in depth and uh its its more significant its more just significant information you know its the big events not the little events   yeah   not the fact that there was a big auto accident down at the corner of Broad and Main you know   i know it when theyre just trying to fill in   yes or theyre making making time because they have to fill in an hours worth of news   yeah   um i get kind of bored watching TV actually when i watch the news on TV because   i know i do i do too   it goes so slow and then theres nothing that you know really is like oh so exciting   yeah you may find one little uh news item interesting so you have to wait twenty minutes to to hear about it   yeah that thats about what it ends up being listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something   yeah actually you you mention Newsweek i i i do like uh US News and World Report i dont get to read it as much as i like but thats i think thats a good magazine   yeah i think theyre about the same i you know they they certainly have a very similar uh charter at least in my mind   yeah   and uh uh what what kind of um what kind of news normally interests you i mean what do you what what do you find interesting versus what do you find boring   oh well right now im trying to keep abreast of uh whats going on in Europe you know with all the uh USSRs satellites breaking off and trying to become independent and then you know European community coming together   umhum   thats gonna affect our uh economy quite a bit   i think it will um they they keep claiming its going to have a big influence but weve yet to see it its real short term yet though i mean its only been       three months or something like that since that happened so   oh yeah definitely yeah   but they like to tell us that its going to be important   im im pretty sure it is because uh   i think it is too   once once Europe becomes unified and uh their economy becomes one big economy were gonna be uh kind of hurting   yeah i i think thats a possibility um it we might also be helped though because it itll be easier to do business over there too   yeah definitely   for the companies that already have a presence over there and uh i know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety two so that they would have it when it came time   oh yeah so they have a toehold a good toehold   yep because once youre in there then you can easily expand but getting in after nineteen ninety two is more difficult   yeah because when they first start off theyre going to be highly protectionist so   yes   yeah   and theres already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist even amongst themselves theyre being somewhat protectionist you know   yeah   like England doesnt want to do one thing and and Sweden doesnt want to do other thing and theyre theyve all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet   uhhuh   and some of it i mean is im sure within those peoples minds its quite justified   yeah i i can understand their viewpoint theyre just theyre starting off and their economys a little bit weak so they want to get established before they   umhum before they open up their borders to everyone   compete yeah totally   um what is the um do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that   actually im not really into sports my roommates are so unfortunately i am forced to watch quite a bit of sports           against your will   yeah we have to  fight over the remote control     yeah at least you guys have a remote control       its sometimes better to not have one of those course you can always mislocate it       or misplace it i mean not mislocate it but misplace it and
