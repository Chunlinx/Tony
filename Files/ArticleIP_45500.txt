                                 Chechnya The New Nightmare            MoreFrench slurry the headline over an editorial in the Times of LondonWednesday neatly linked the scandal over what France feeds its cattle withanother mess that has forced the resignation of French Finance MinisterDominique StraussKahn The departure of StraussKahn amid corruption andforgery allegations led the front pages of both French and German newspapersand was described by DieWelt as a disaster for the Socialistled government of Prime MinisterLionel Jospin            Manyother papers agreed The Times editorial said The French politicalfirmament  has abruptly darkened with sinister portents Jospin owes hispopularity in large part to his image as M Propre  a decent man whomarks a break with the permeating sleaze of the long Mitterrand years itsaid But the scandal in which M StraussKahn is embroiled the allegedlyillegal use of MNEF a student health insurance fund to channel illicit fundsto Socialist Party coffers involves a host of M Jospins close collaborators France could be in for a period of weakened indecisive government  Le Figaro ofParis agreed that Jospin would be weakened but in an editorial congratulatedboth StraussKahn on his panache in resigning so quickly and the Frenchpeople on their desire that Latin societies behave more and more likeAngloSaxon ones in demanding responsibility and probity from theirleaders            TheFinancial Times saidin an editorial that with the departure of the eurozones most influentialfinance minister it isnt clear who will provide leadership for the Europeancurrency bloc In an oped piece the FT said that abroad he was themost important symbol of the Jospin governments credibility and itswillingness to modernise the state by reducing the overbearing role of thepublic sector But the International Herald Tribune reported with apparentsurprise that the euro which StraussKahn helped bring into being in Januaryhas hardly moved on the foreign exchange markets Perhaps as a reflection ofFrances relatively smaller economic role Mr StraussKahns exit appeared tocreate little concern and have much less impact internationally than theresignation in March for political reasons of his German Social Democraticcounterpart Oskar Lafontaine            TheBritish newspapers led mainly on what the Times described as anastonishing climbdown by the British government in its Mad Cow trade war withFrance Despite a European Commission finding that British beef is as safe asany in Europe and that France which has been accused of putting humanexcrement in its cattle feed should lift its unilateral ban on it the papersreported that Britain yielded to French demands for further safety checks TheIndependentof London however fronted a gruesome eyewitness report from Ingushetia a tiny republic borderingChechnya where some  Chechen refugees are believed to have fledDescribing the terrible injuries inflicted on some of them by Russias massiveand indiscriminate artillery and air bombardment of towns and villages inChechnya its correspondent Patrick Cockburn wrote that one third of theChechen population numbering about  million people is now in flight Whatis happening is a tragedy equal to anything witnessed in Kosovo or East Timorearlier in the year he claimed            In aneditorial the Independent called the nearsilence of Westernpoliticians on the matter shameful In Oslo yesterday President Clintonexpressed concern diplospeak for doing as little as possible it saidThis donothing policy is lethal Here unlike the situation in Kosovomilitary intervention is neither necessary nor practicable Tough diplomacy andeconomic threats are however essential if the lunacy is to be reversed            In abitter editorial Wednesday the Moscow Times compared Russias behavior in Chechnya withNATOs in Kosovo in which each argued vainly to the other that there could beno military solution Now Kosovo is de facto partitioned Albanians wont letRussian KFOR forces take up their positions Slobodan Milosevic is as mighty asever and the Kosovo Liberation Army has yet to disarm while Russia is weedingout terrorism in Chechnya by herding refugees under carpet bombing it saidAnd wherever one looks there is the illusion of victory President BillClinton and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin play the role of theworlds grave statesmen and their governments sacrifice civilians to thegreater good But the horrors are not exorcised only deferred to futureadministrations            Afterthe controversy
