                    Background        Loss of Fhit protein is among the earliest known events        in the development of a variety of the most common and        lethal human malignancies     Loss of Fhit leads to        cells that are deficient in programmed cell death and that        form tumors in mice while Fhit reexpression in Fhitcancer        cells reduces tumorigenicity and restores programmed cell        death         Infection of         Fhit  mice with viruses that        reexpress Fhit reduce cancer occurrence     apparently        by killing preneoplastic cells that have lost the        wildtype         Fhit allele Human Fhit protein a        member of the Fhit branch of the histidine triad        superfamily of nucleotidebinding proteins binds and        hydrolyzes diadenosine polyphosphates such as ApppA and        AppppA            into AMP plus ADP and ATP        respectively       His which is responsible for        covalent catalysis and more than   fold of rate        enhancement in ApppA hydrolysis        is        nonetheless dispensable for ApppAbinding and tumor        suppression suggesting that Fhit function in tumor        suppression depends on formation of an ES complex             If Fhitsubstrate complexes promote tumor suppression by        stimulating a proapoptotic effector then Fhit inhibitors        that resemble natural substrates may promote Fhit function        Similarly Fhit inhibitors with normative features may        antagonize Fhit function Either class of compounds may be        important in dissecting Fhit cell biology and regulating        apoptosis        Making use of a synthesis strategy to link adenosine                 O phosphates and phosphorothioates        to shortchain polyols     we evaluate four inhibitor        parameters and obtain compounds inhibitory constants for        which are as much as fold lower than natural substrates        Key features of the best candidate agonist compound         b and candidate antagonist compound         b are conservation of the length of        the polyphosphate replacement use of          O phosphorothioadenosyl residues no        replacement for oxygen at the location of the  bridging        oxygen and replacement of carbon for the  phosphorus        Compound         b contains additional negatively        charged substituents that may facilitate Fhit inhibition           while rendering the compound antagonistic to Fhit        function in the cell Covalent structures of AppppA            and compounds         b and         b are provided in Figure                     Results and Discussion        A series of compounds          were synthesized and evaluated for        Fhit inhibition that link two          O phosphorothioadenosyl or AMP        groups with five reagents ranging in size from ethylene        glycol to         meso erythritol Sodium salts of        each compound were titrated into assays of purified Fhit           with  M fluorescent substrate        ApppSdifluorodimethylboraaadiazasindacineylmethylaminoacetyl        ApppBODIPY     and competitive         K         i values were obtained by calculating        the inhibitor concentrationdependence in reduction of         k         cat          K         m apparent for substrate hydrolysis            As shown in Table  inhibitors         b and         b with twocarbon diol linkers were        either only as inhibitory as the natural substrate  or        substantially less so Inhibitor         b with a fourcarbon linker was as        ineffective as         b Inhibitors         a and         a that substitute a central CH          PO          CH          or CH          CHOHCH          for the PO          OPO          of          were as inhibitory as          is a good substrate The        phosphorothioate analogs         b and         b bound approximately  and  times        better to Fhit than           Thus conservation of bondlengths        between adenylate moieties of                    and          is conducive to binding Fhit        Because phosphorothioate analogs of          and          were better inhibitors than the        corresponding phosphates phosphorodithioate analog         c was prepared together with five        additional compounds as phosphates and phosphorothioates        Phosphorodithioate         c was a less effective inhibitor          K         i   nM not shown in Tables than        corresponding phosphate         a and phosphorothioate         b and as demonstrated in Tables and         the phosphorothioate congener of every compound made as        a phosphate and a phosphorothioate had a lower         K         i value The contribution of particular        Pchiral phosphorothioate stereoisomers to inhibition has        not been examined When diadenosine          P          P methylene         P thio         P          P triphosphate    was        crystallized with wildtype and mutant Fhit the        phosphorothioate group was found in the mutant but not        wildtype active site suggesting that phosphorothioate        inhibitors may be slow substrates     Similarly Frey        and coworkers found that Fhit slowly cleaves both R         p and S         p stereoisomers of          m nitrobenzyladenosine          O lthiotriphosphate with modest        and similar beneficial effects on         K         m as compared to the corresponding        phosphate            Given the inhibitor activity of         b the contribution of the oxygen in        the position of the  bridging oxygen of          was examined As can be seen in Table         comparison of         b with         b and         b and of         b with         b indicated that imido or sulfur        substitutions for oxygen reduce enzyme inhibition by an        order of magnitude Derivatives of         b with one or two additional        functionalities on the central carbon were characterized        Analysis of         b indicated that loss of the polar        hydroxyl group reduces inhibitory activity and analysis of         b and         b indicated that nearly isosteric        groups that are nonisoelectronic are not tolerated The        magnitude of these effects was surprising and may be        related to altered conformations upon manganese        coordination Earlier Blackburn and coworkers made        supercharged methanetrisphosphonic acid AppppA analogs        containing a central carbon from which three adenylate or        phosphate moieties are bonded     In work presented        here tripodal inhibitors         a and         a showed respectively micromolar        and submicromolar efficacies while the phosphorothioate        counterparts         b and         b showed  nM efficacy        Derivatives of pentaerythritol tetrapodal compounds          and          were also evaluated for Fhit        inhibition While compound         b containing two phosphorothioylated        branches without adenosine was barely a submicromolar        inhibitor compounds         b and         b which contain respectively three        and four CH          phosphorothioadenosyl groups bonded        to the central carbon were  nM and  nM inhibitors        Thus while the simplest compound         b was initially rendered less        inhibitory by modification because its central hydroxyl was        important for inhibition addition of one or two CH          phosphorothioadenosyl groups restored        inhibition We presume that compounds         b          b and         b with   or  identical CH          phosphorothioadenosyl groups can        present a manganese bound         b like complex to Fhit in a similar        manner On the basis that Fhit binds diadenosine        polyphosphates with one AMP group buried and the other        adenosine solventexposed in a specific conformation            effective tri and tetrapodal inhibitors such as         b b and HCADP             may exist in solution        predominantly in a conformation that resembles Fhitbound        AppppA        On the basis of observations     discussed above        one would expect AppppA with two phosphorothioadenosyl        substituents to be a slow substrate with a relatively low         K         m  However carbon in place of the         phosphorus for example in         b  would make the leaving group the        alkoxide  OCH          CHOHCH          Ophosphorothioadenosyl rather than        thio ATP Presumably because normal Fhit products are        mononucleotides with low p         K         a values the enzyme does not have a        group to protonate an alkoxide leaving group and thus        substitution of carbon for the  phosphorus turns a        substrate into an inhibitor                    Conclusions        Tumor suppression by Fhit is not destroyed by mutation        of the nucleophilic His to Asn a mutation that        specifically reduces         k         cat      Thus evidence suggests        that the proapoptotic function of Fhit depends on formation        of an ES complex If the substratedependent signaling        model is correct then compound         b as a nearly isosteric AppppA analog        with a low         K         i  may promote Fhit signaling in Fhit        cells Compound         b which one would expect to bind        Fhit with bulky phosphorothioate and phosphorothioadenosyl        groups interfering with putative effector binding may        consequently prove to be antagonistic to Fhit function        Ongoing         in vitro studies aim to evaluate the        stereochemistry of phosphorothioyl binding to Fhit while         in vivo studies test the effects of        these compounds on programmed cell death Phosphorothioate        analogs         b and         b that preserve the  bridging        oxygen but substitute carbon for the  phosphorus        achieving  to fold binding advantages over AppppA are        expected to be critical for cell biological        characterization                    Materials and Methods                  Synthesis and Characterization
