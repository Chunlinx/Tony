                                 Did She Know            By FranklinFoer            The Washington Postreported Feb  that Secretary of State Madeleine Albrights parents wereJewish converts to Catholicism and that her grandparents died in the HolocaustAlbright declared This was obviously a major surprise to me I have neverbeen told this Many people find that hard to believe No one criticizesAlbright and her parents refugees twiceover first from Nazism then fromCommunism for how they chose to put their lives back together But there islively debate over Albrights insistence that her Jewish roots are a majorsurprise            Doubters point first tocircumstantial evidence  How could someone as intelligent andwellversed in European history as Albright her PhD work focused oncontemporary Central European politics not have deduced her familys ancestryfrom what we know she knew                           Albrights father JosefKorbel  was a foreignservice officer in the liberal interwarCzechoslovakian government Just after she was born in  he was posted tothe Czech embassy in Belgrade Yugoslavia But he was recalled two years laterwhen the Munich Pact essentially made Czechoslovakia a German province Insteadof going home Korbel moved his family to London to join the Czechgovernmentinexile            After thewar the family returned to Prague and learned Albright says that her threeliving grandparents had died Korbel was briefly the postwar governmentsambassador to Yugoslavia but when Communists ousted the government in the family fled to the United States             Albright knew all this What she did not know until she says is that her parents grew up Jewish and converted toCatholicism only sometime around the outbreak of the war And hergrandparents along with almost all her other relatives died in German deathcamps            Should Albright have intuitedthese omissions The skeptics say her parents story begs obviousquestions             Why did a midlevel Czechdiplomat harbor enough fear of Nazi persecution to uproot his family toEngland Korbel was a liberal but not necessarily prominent or active enoughto worryfor that reason aloneabout getting singled out            Why did three of Albrightsgrandparents and most of her family die during the war Its not clear Albrightever received an explanation The Korbel familys casualties were especiallyincongruous because gentiles generally suffered less during Nazi occupation inCzechoslovakia than in other Central and Eastern European countries            Theresalso Albrights relationship with her Jewish first cousin  who stilllives in Prague The cousin Dagmar Simova has been the medias main source ofinformation about Albrights wartime experience A teenager during the warSimova survived in London living with the Korbels Simova doesnt stronglyidentify as a Jew but has never been under any misapprehension about herethnic identity Also Simova discovered the truth about the wartime atrocitiesalmost immediately afterward including her own parents deaths inAuschwitz            The Korbels and Simova continued to correspondafter the war and Simova met Albright briefly in Prague just after the VelvetRevolution in  For reasons unknown Albright has rejected Simovasattempts to set up more meetings though Simova is her only surviving Czechrelative Did Simova never mention that the family was Jewish when living withthe Korbels or during subsequent sporadic communications Did Albright notwonder why this cousin was living with them in London or what had happened toher parents            Albright says her parentsexpressed vivid recollections of childhood Easter and Christmascelebrations  These recollections may well have been true The elderKorbels came from a small town near the CzechGerman border where Jews werealmost entirely assimilated into secular life hardly practicing and lackingany communal institutions including a synagogue            A second reason someskeptics doubt that Albright could have been blindsided by her own life storyis that since she has risen to prominence  the suggestion that she isJewish has been raised repeatedly Rumors of Albrights Jewish background havebeen circulated ever since she was appointed United Nations ambassador in A December  article in alHayat  an Arab newspaper published inLondon asserted that Albright as a Jew would be a dangerously proIsraelsecretary of state But less tendentious media outlets have also reported onAlbrights ethnic background Multiple stories about it have appeared forexample in major Czech newspapers            The mayorof Letohrad the town where Josef Korbel grew up says he sent Albright threeletters in recent years The letters included recollections of her family andthe clippings from Czech newspapers alleging her Jewish heritage Albright saysthat she received several other similar letters as well But she says theycontained too many factual errors and inconsistencies for her to take themseriously            Over the years other people have come across the factsabout Albrights background that she says she never knew An Israeli officialtold the Post that Czech immigrants to Israel told the government in that Albrights parents had been Jewish Western reporters in Belgrade saythey have encountered people who recall reading press reports from the lates about Albrights family Apparently Josef Korbel was a minor celebrityduring his stints there and his conversion to Catholicism and his parentsdeaths in the Holocaust were reported in the citys papers            According to the New YorkTimes  Albright told White House officials preparing for her confirmationhearings in December that she suspected her grandparents had beenJewish That was a month before the Washington Post story ran
