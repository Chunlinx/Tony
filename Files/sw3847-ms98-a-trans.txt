        okay i pushed it     okay   so what do you do in your lawn do you do it yourself or do you hire someone to do it   uh no weve been doing it ourselves for most of the time uh find that its really a little more economical and we have or i found that i have the time and i kind of enjoyed it over here in Texas i used to live in Arizona and it was very confusing very frustrating because i didnt have the watering system and it was it was just too much work and not enough enjoyment but over here we get enough water automatically you know naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers and so its a lot more rewarding   uhhuh   umhum yeah right uhhuh uhhuh   so   well we do our own out here of there you know mow it ourselves and everything but um our water supply right now is bad we need rain badly   oh  thats right   uh we can water here and Patterson i can water on Tuesdays Thursdays Saturday and Sunday four days a week   umhum is is that enough during the hotter times of the year   so it was this last summer yeah   umhum   uh now if it we dont get some rain they might limit it to not even four times you know   yeah yeah   but um yeah we do our lawn our you know mowing ourselves and everything and i do our planting of bulbs and things for i can have some spring flowers   umhum   and uh   yeah i i find that ive been doing a lot of perennial planting which i never did before and      umhum   and its been real enjoyable although i didnt do any this last fall because our past winters have been so cold um theyd freeze down and by the time they the flowers would   umhum   come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting   oh   so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and and spending too much money on something that was kind of uh more of a problem than it was rewarding so   umhum umhum   um im gonna try to wait now and just do the spring and summer type plantings and see how that   yeah yeah we have quite a few roses i just uh we in fact we just pruned them uh way down and i uh just uh uh had to replace on of them so i just bought that yesterday and uh probably go outside today and plant that   you know feels umhum   but um i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long   yeah those are enjoyable   i even had uh roses on my table for Christmas dinner   oh did you   which was really pretty you know  but um other than the roses i dont have too many flowers i plant gladiolas   umhum   um those are nice   and those are always pretty but they get so tall and they they bend over so fast   uhhuh   you know   yeah yeah i havent done much in in bulbs in fact i received as a Christmas present a a a planter that had bulbs in it that we were supposed to go ahead and water at any time and and after it started to sprout put in sunny window and its it just grew like crazy but i dont have any flowers on it i dont know how long that takes or if theres anything i need to differently but   umhum hum   its just nice and green right now   umhum well is it that one of those Amaryllis   uh no im thinking white narcissus or something like a paper white paper flower or something   no huh oh okay uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and uh so i dont know   do you have a big yard   no not really and in Plano and most of the newer areas of Texas uh they have just the the minimum square footage for lots to where you get a little bit of a backyard we have a pool in our backyard and we did plan it to where we have   umhum   some some play yard last over but its its um you know very small but most of the houses here if you have a pool you dont have anything else in the backyard thats thats about the size of most of them   umhum yeah right right umhum umhum   so um i guess were kind of fortunate everyone looks at that with our yard at our yard with kind of a sense of awe like wow you really got you know some grass back there   um umhum umhum umhum well that makes it nice   and yeah   well its hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool but we dont have one   umhum   you know but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here you know but we just we just have   yeah yeah   dogs and um  and grass and uh you know the cement work  and a little place that we made for a garden   uhhuh uh yeah yeah umhum   so we do have a garden you know   oh do you   its just a small one you know but we  had a lots of tomatoes and uh zucchini   oh   uh its amazing its amazing what you can get out of a little   uhhuh   you know its probably about twenty by i dont know twenty by six something like that and its amazing what you can you know how many plants you can plant in there   yeah yeah   but it was nice a few cucumbers   thats one part of gardening i havent tried yet and i dont think this yard is a very   umhum umhum
