                    Introduction        The study of gene function has been greatly advanced        through the use of transgenic mice Overexpression and        ectopic expression of transgenes as well as the expression        of genetic variants has facilitated the deciphering of        complex cellular processes as well as the generation of        animal models of disease More recently transgenic mice        have also been used to express Cre recombinase to mediate        the conditional deletion of         loxP flanked DNA sequences in        specific cell types         in vivo  Traditional methods for        generating transgenic mice require the availability of well        characterized transcriptional regulatory elements        promoters or enhancers that direct transgene expression in        specific cell types For example         Surfactant protein C regulatory        elements have been used extensively to drive high level        expression of transgenes in the lung             Similarly         Transthyretin regulatory elements        confer expression of transgenes in the liver           Unfortunately the number wellcharacterized        enhancerspromoters available for transgene expression is        limited This is due to the fact that although         in situ hybridization and RNA        blotting techniques can rapidly characterize the expression        patterns of genes the identification of regulatory        elements that control cell typespecific expression in        animals is extremely laborious An additional complication        associated with traditional transgenic approaches is that        the number and genomic location of transgene integration        events is random This can have a significant impact on        both the level and site of transgene expression These        problems can be circumvented however by utilizing        endogenous regulatory elements This can be achieved by        introducing transgenes into defined genomic loci through        homologous recombination in ES cells knockin          While this approach requires knowledge of the gene        expression pattern it does not require any analysis of gene        regulatory elements Such a knockin approach would in        effect significantly increase the repertoire of regulatory        elements available to drive transgene expression Moreover        it ensures that a single copy of the transgene is        introduced into a defined genomic location The        introduction of         LacZ into specific genes during the        generation of knockout mice has demonstrated that such an        approach can be successful    The downside however        is that every individual transgene an investigator wishes        to express must be independently targeted to the chosen        genomic locus This can be tedious especially if the rate        of recombination at the chosen genomic locus is low Here        we describe a simple method that allows transgenes targeted        to a marked genomic locus to be selected with extremely        high efficiency in ES cells This approach is also        appealing because it relies on reconstitution of active        neomycin phosphotransferase activity and so correctly        targeted ES cell clones can be simply selected by growth in        G                    Results        Fig illustrates the overall strategy that we have used        to introduce single copy transgenes into a defined genomic        locus For convenience the procedure can be considered in        three distinct steps First a specific genomic locus is        chosen based on known gene expression data In the example        presented here we chose the         Hnf  locus because Hnf is        expressed throughout the embryonic gut endoderm of the        mouse and our ultimate objective is to assess the function        of transgenes expressed in this tissue             In addition mice lacking a single         Hnf  allele have no observable        phenotype so that introduction of transgenes into this        locus will not inherently affect embryonic development           Once the locus is chosen a targeting vector is        designed to introduce a         pgkloxPNeo cassette that confers        resistance to G in mammalian cells Importantly the         pgk promoter of this cassette is        flanked by         loxP elements so that the promoter        can easily be removed using Cre recombinase In step  a        Creexpression plasmid is transiently introduced into the         pgkloxPNeo targeted ES cells        Cremediated deletion of the         pgk promoter results in the cells        reverting to G sensitivity while retaining the         Neo gene Step  is rapid and        straightforward because Cremediated recombination is        extremely efficient The generation of these Gsensitive        ES cells containing         Neo integrated into the         Hnf  locus form the basis for        targeting transgenes to this locus        In step  a general targeting vector is constructed        that will allow the introduction of transgenes to the         HnfNeo locus The salient features        of such a vector are shown in Fig  A unique         SalI restriction endonuclease site        allows the introduction of coding sequences into this        vector A  splice site and polyadenylation signal has        been incorporated to facilitate proper posttransciptional        processing of transgenes Targeting of transgenes to the         HnfNeo locus is mediated by two        arms of homology The  arm of homology contains        nucleotides  to  of the         Neo coding sequence with an        accompanying         pgk promoter flanked by         loxP elements No G resistant        colonies were obtained when plasmids containing this        truncated         Neo cassette were introduced into        wild type ES cells by electroporation data not shown        This confirmed that deletion of the end of         Neo results in loss of resistance to        G   The  region of homology consisted of  kb        of         Hnf  genomic sequence that extends        into sequences encoding the untranslated  leader region        of         Hnf  mRNA   These sequences        ensure that the site of transcriptional initiation remains        intact after transgenes have been targeted to the         Hnf  locus          To ascertain whether the strategy proposed in Fig was        feasible and to determine the efficiency of such an        approach we attempted to introduce a         lacZ transgene into the         Hnf  locus The genotype of ES cell        clones from each step of the procedure was determined by        Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA Fig  Figs aand        bshow that the genotype of ES cells at each stage of the        procedure could be distinguished by genomic Southern blot        analysis using a single DNA probe probe A to identify a         Hind IIIEcoRV restriction        endonuclease fragment that was specific to each targeted        allele In step we introduced a         pgkloxPNeo cassette into the         Hnf  locus following the procedure        described in materials and methods Fig bshows that probe        A identifies an  kb         Hind IIIEcoRV fragment in wild type        ES cells Targeting of a         pgkloxPNeo cassette to this locus        introduces a unique         EcoRV site that generates a  kb         HindIIIEcoRV fragment also detected        by probe A We obtained four correctly targeted ES cell        clones out of  that were resistant to both G and        gancyclovir Fig b In addition to the data shown in Fig        b the genotype of these colonies was confirmed by        Southern blot using DNA fragments that corresponded to          Hnf  genomic sequences and to         Neo not shown These correctly        targeted ES cell clones were called HnfloxPNeo clones         to indicate that a         pgkloxPNeo cassette had been        introduced into the         Hnf  locus Next a plasmid that        expresses Crerecombinase in mammalian cells was introduced        into HnfloxPNeo ES cells by transient transfection        materials and methods The expression of Cre recombinase        mediated recombination between the         loxP elements that flanked the         pgk promoter Southern blot analysis        fig  shows that deletion of the         pgk promoter in HnfloxPNeo cells        generated a predicted  kb         HindIIIEcoRV fragment that was        detected by probe A Moreover Fig cshows that deletion of        the         pgk promoter resulted in the        HnfloxPNeo cells reverting to Gsensitivity because        the promoter is necessary for         Neo expression The         pgk promoter was deleted from  of        transfected HnfloxPNeo ES cells using the approach        described in materials and methods ES cell lines from        which the         pgk promoter had been deleted were        named HnfpgkNeo to indicate this event        Our ultimate goal is to target a number of different        transgenes to the         Hnf  locus with the aim of        expressing them ectopically throughout the embryonic gut        endoderm To facilitate this we have designed a general        targeting vector that can accommodate and allow expression        of any open reading frame when targeted to the         Hnf  locus in HnfpgkNeo ES        cells There are a number of important features associated        with this vector that are illustrated in Fig  This        plasmid includes a unique         SalI restriction endonuclease        cutsite for insertion of open reading frames followed by        intron and poly A addition sequences for correct        posttranscriptional processing of transgenic RNA The         arm of homology within the targeting vector defines where        the transgene is positioned relative to the         Hnf  locus We maintained the        integrity of the endogenous         Hnf  transcriptional startsite to        ensure bonafide expression of any inserted transgene This        was achieved by using a  arm of homology whose  end lay        within genomic sequences encoding the untranslated leader        of the         Hnf  mRNA Fig    The  arm        of homology consisted of the  end of         Neo coding sequence accompanied by        the         pgk promoter with flanking         loxP elements This         Neo fragment lacked sequences        encoding the last  amino acids of neomycin        phosphotransferase Such truncation of the         Neo gene disrupted its ability to        encode resistance to G confirming the results of Beck         et al data not shown          Therefore ES cells that randomly integrate this targeting        vector would remain sensitive to G In contrast we        predicted that homologous recombination between the        truncated         Neo sequences in the targeting vector        and         Neo sequences within HnfpgkNeo ES        cells would reconstitute expression of active neomycin        phosphotransferase and so confer resistance to G This        in turn implies that following electroporation of this        targeting vector into HnfpgkNeo ES cells  of G        resistant colonies would have undergone homologous        recombination To test this prediction we generated a        targeting vector that contained the         LacZ gene from         Ecoli Homologous recombination        should place expression of this transgene under the control        of         Hnf  transcriptional regulatory        elements This plasmid was introduced into HnfpgkNeo ES        cells by electroporation and fifteen colonies were        collected that were resistant to G The genotype of the        colonies was again ascertained by Southern blot analysis of        genomic DNA Fig  shows that introduction of the         LacZ transgene into the         Hnf  locus was predicted to        generate a  kb         HindIII          EcoRV fragment that interacts with        probe A Fig shows that fifteen out of fifteen ES cell        lines that were resistant to G had undergone homologous        recombination and contained the         LacZ transgene correctly targeted to        the         Hnf  locus These data confirm the        extraordinary efficiency of using this approach to target        transgenes to a marked genomic locus        We predicted that transgenes inserted into the         Hnf  locus would be expressed        throughout the endoderm of the developing gut To determine        if this was true we generated embryos from ES cells        containing LacZ at the         Hnf  locus          HnfLacZ ES cells and stained for        expression of galactosidase Mouse embryos derived solely        from ES cells were generated by tetraploid aggregation as        described previously     A total of  embryos        were produced and all showed the same pattern of        galactosidase expression Fig bshows galactosidase        staining in         HnfLacZ embryos at  days of        embryonic development As expected galactosidase was        expressed throughout the gut liver and at particularly        high levels in the developing stomach Endogenous Hnf is        also expressed in the floorplate of the neural tube as well        as the notochord However expression of galactosidase in                HnfLacZ transgenic embryos was        undetectable in these tissues In generating the         HnfLacZ targeting vector we deleted        all genomic sequences lying  to the first intron of the         Hnf  gene It is likely that this        intron or other untranslated sequences contain regulatory        elements that specifically direct expression of         HnfLacZ in the floorplate of the        neural tube and notochord   Indeed when         LacZ is introduced into exon  in ES        cells leaving the first intron intact expression of        galactosidase is readily detectable in the neuraltube        floorplate and notochord                      Discussion and conclusions        We have described a method that allows transgenes to be        easily targeted to a defined locus in the mouse genome in        ES cells Although this is a multiplestep procedure once        the chosen locus has been targeted using homologous        recombination subsequent manipulations are extremely        efficient Indeed in the final step where the transgene of        interest is targeted to the desired locus we found that         of G resistant ES cell colonies were correctly        targeted Transgenic mice and embryos can be generated from        these ES cells by standard injection into blastocysts and        subsequent breeding of the resulting chimeric mice It is        worth noting however that if germline transmission is the        aim of the experiment it is important to ensure that the        pgkNeo cells generated in step  are germline        competent This is important because each round of clonal        selection increases the likelihood of losing germline        competency of the ES cells        The targeting of transgenes into a given locus has a        number of advantages over traditional methods of generating        transgenic mice Traditionally transgenic mice are        produced by injection of DNA into the male pronucleus of        fertilized mouse eggs A variable number of copies of the        transgene are then integrated into the mouse genome at        random locations The position and number of transgene        copies can have a profound effect on their expression In        some cases expression is repressed or in contrast        undesirably activated at ectopic sites When transgenes are        targeted to a known genomic locus such variation is avoided        and expression of the transgene is significantly more        predictable   Such control over the site and level of        expression is important because variations could have        unpredictable impacts on the phenotype presented by the        transgenic mice        Introduction of single copy transgenes into the         hydroxyphosphoribosyl        transferase HPRT locus has been previously described        by Bronson         et al  This approach successfully        overcomes the problems associated with the integration of        variable copy numbers of transgenes into random genomic        locations However it is only suitable for introduction of        transgenes to the HPRT locus and in addition requires the        availability of HPRTnegative ES cell lines Cremediated        targeting of single copy transgenes to specific genomic        sites that have previously been marked by         loxP elements has also been described        both in somatic cells and more recently in ES cells using a        double         LoxP targeting strategy           Although this approach also results in efficient targeting        to a defined genomic locus it relies on cotransfection of        a Cre expression plasmid along with a         loxP targeting vector that carries        the transgene Hardouin         et al also recently described an        elegant approach to introduce transgenes to loci identified        by gene trapping Here integration of the transgene at the        genetrap locus was again mediated by Cre recombinase and        translation of the transgene was facilitated by an internal        ribosomal entry site IRES   In contrast our        approach relies simply on the reconstitution of resistance        to G and can be used to target transgenes to any genomic        locus        Transgenic mice are often used to examine gene function        through ectopic expression studies This requires the        availability of characterized transcriptional regulatory        elements that are capable of expressing transgenes in the        tissue of choice In addition for developmental studies        the transcriptional regulatory elements have to ensure        transgene expression during the correct developmental time        frame Although the expression patterns of many genes have        been described in detail characterization of promoter and        enhancer elements that control this expression is much more        limited This is partly due to the fact that complex        expression patterns often utilize genomic regulatory        sequences that are positioned many kilobases away from the        gene making them difficult to identify However the        introduction of transgenes into specific loci allows the        utilization of intact endogenous transcription regulatory        sequences which increases the likelihood that the        transgene will be expressed in the expected fashion        Using targeted ES cells also provides the potential of        expressing lethal transgenes This may be important for        examining the effects of expressing gainoffunction or        dominantnegative alleles of a gene product This is        difficult using a conventional approach because of the need        to establish founder mice expressing the transgene        However if a line of transgenic ES cells can be        established then it is possible to generate clonal embryos        directly from these ES cells by aggregating them with        tetraploid embryos Indeed here we have used this approach        to establish that the introduction of a         LacZ transgene into the         Hnf  locus facilitates transgene        expression throughout the developing gut Fig         In sum we have described a method that facilitates the        efficient introduction of transgenes into predefined loci        in the mouse genome By selecting appropriate sequences for        homologous recombination this approach can be tailored        toward any specific genomic locus We therefore believe        that this approach expands the repertoire of tools        available for genetic manipulation in the mouse and will        enhance our ability to address gene function in        mammals                    Materials and Methods                  Plasmids                      Hnf targeting vectorploxPNeoTK            A  bp XhoXba fragment of Hnf genomic DNA            that included exon  and a portion of intron  was used            as the  arm of homology The  arm of homology was            cloned as a  kb Xho fragment of Hnf genomic DNA            A XhoHindIII blunt cassette containing the Tn             neomycin phosphotransferase              Neo gene that could confer            resistance to G and whose expression in mammalian            cells was directed by a             phosphoglycerate kinase              pgk promoter was introduced            into an XbaI blunt site between the Hnf genomic            sequences    The             pgk promoter was flanked by             loxP elements so that it could be            deleted by the action of Cre recombinase The             herpes simplex virus thymidine            kinase              hsvTK  gene whose expression            was also regulated by the             pgk promoter was introduced            adjacent to the Hnf  arm of homology to provide            negative selection in the presence of gancylovir                                Transgene targeting vector pNeo            The transgenetargeting vector used in these            experiments was generated in multiple steps Fig  A            NotIRsrII blunt kb cassette containing the  end            of             Neo coding sequence accompanied            by the             pgk promoter with flanking             loxP elements was introduced into            the SphI site blunt of pNEB New England Biolabs            Deletion of the  cterminal codons of the             Neo gene disrupted its ability to            encode resistance to G data not shown   This            subfragment of             Neo provided the  arm of            homology in the targeting vector A  bp EcoRI            fragment blunt containing an intron from the mouse            protamine gene as well as polyA addition sequences            was isolated from the plasmid pLacF and cloned into the            PmeI site blunt of the preceding plasmid              Finally the  arm of homology was provided by a  kb            Xho I fragment of             Hnf  genomic DNA that was            introduced into a unique Pac site blunt in the            preceding plasmid Importantly this fragment extended            from  genomic DNA into sequences encoding the            untranslated  end of             Hnf  mRNA This cloning            strategy left a unique             Sal I site into which coding            sequences of transgenes could be introduced A NotI            blunt  kb lacZ fragment from pCMVgal Clontech            was ligated into this SalI blunt site to generate a            targeting vector that could be used to introduce             lacZ into the marked             Hnf  locus                                Culture and selection of embryonic stem cell            lines            All ES cell lines were cultured on mitotically            inactivated primary embryonic fibroblasts in ES cell            medium supplemented with recombinant leukemia            inhibitory factor LIF as described elsewhere              Gene targeting was carried out using  g of linear            targeting plasmid This was introduced into               ES cells by electroporation at             voltsfresistance  using a BTX ECM            electroporation system Cells were plated on thirteen             cm tissue culture dishes and grown for two days in            ES cell medium supplemented with LIF Cells containing             Neo were selected by            supplementing the ES cell medium with  gml            Geneticin GGibcoBRL and negative selection            against             Hsvtk gene expression was            achieved by including  M gancyclovir Roche            Recombination between             loxP elements in ES cells was            mediated by introducing a Cre expression plasmid            pHDMCCre provided by Dr Klaus Kaestner  g of            pHDMCCre was introduced into    ES cells
