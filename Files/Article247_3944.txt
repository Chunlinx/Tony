                                 Compassionate Pessimism                        Dear Lisa            I think it is silly to think of a backlash against a woman who has to datesold no more than  copies of any of her books There are a lot of betterthings to put energy into than chopping down the work of a writer who worked atthe trade honorably and industriously for odd years without getting any ofthe recognition many of us believe she richly deserved Why dont her supposeddetractors go beat up on Disney for a while            My attitude toward any backlash is that those of us who love Powell have hernowsome  books in printand those who dont can simply avoid her the waysay that I avoid Allen Ginsberg and Walt Whitman I know people who are deeplymoved by both of these writersand more power to thembut theyre simply notfor me Different strokes and all that The world is full of a number of things            My own obscure favorites include the first books of Honor Tracy Irishbornsatirist who makes Evelyn Waughs work taste like the milk of human kindnessthe dark early writing of Sigrid Undset before her religious conversion whichradically changed her style and the best novels of manners by JohnMarquandall of which are largely unknown to contemporary readersparticularly young ones Who else has created such a splendid unreliablenarrator as Horatio Willing the pompous ass who narrates Marquands TheLate George Apley             I enjoy literary biography but dont think that it is essential to enjoymentof the work Gustav Mahler gave titles to every movement in his minuteSymphony No  then took them all out saying that no work of art was any goodunless it could stand on its own I suppose that is truealthough I confess anoccasional difficulty with important artists whose personalities repel meRousseau and Brecht will do for starters for me they reek oftotalitarianism But would I feel that way if I didnt know their life storiesProbably            Still I do think that Powells personality has had a lot to do withher revival For those of us who love her she seems a wise funnyunpretentious and compassionate friend one blessed with a decidedly wickedsense of humor We like her company She seems smart and civilized She neverlectures us she is never a scold or an uplifter she never exalts somemythical Humanity over the daytoday struggles of ordinary human beings whoare all of course making the same mistakes over and over again As W JacksonBatemy choice for the ultimate literary biographer of our timewrote ofSamuel Johnson Powells work would allow us to construct a vastly pessimisticvision of the human condition And yet we leave her with gratitude and cheerwith the sense that somebody has understood usand much of the timehad a little fun with us too            To sum upPowell may never be for everybody but she is one of thoseartists who will always be very much for some people I dont find her any moredated than Petronius With either author you have but to play around with thesettings and circumstances a little and you have what Mad magazine usedto call the usual gang of idiots gloriously presented with a calm amusedbut unsparing eye May the frolic continue            Its been a pleasure getting to know you in this distinctly s fashionand I look forward to kicking this whole matter around over a bottle of winesome day Good luck in all you doand thanks for what youve already done forDawn Powell            WarmestTim
