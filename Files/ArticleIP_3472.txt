                                 The Usable Past            Sometimesyou read a preface by a writer who doesnt seem to have absorbed the book hepurports to be introducing In his opening remarks for Eyes of the Nation AVisual History of the United States  Librarian of Congress James HBillington strikes a fondly nationalistic note What makes the Americannarrative unique is the ability we have displayed time and again to remedy ourmistakes to adjust to changing circumstances to debate and then move on indirections that seem better for all These words which might be appropriatefor a TimeLife coffeetable volume titled say We                the People seriously misrepresent the downbeat contemplative collaboration of pictureeditor Vincent Virga and historian Alan Brinkley Far from being a celebratorycollection of inspiring American images Eyes of the Nation isinstretches at leasta lavishly illustrated bad trip through  years ofheavyhanded nation building Though its hard to sustain a point of view whenthe goal is to be bestselling and definitive the books reigning mood isprogressive populism tempered by realistic pessimism            After a bit of visualthroatclearing Eyes of the Nation begins in earnest with a drawing ofthe Indian village of Secota on Roanoke Island in what would become NorthCarolina It shows neat rows of corn Ceremonial dancers A centralmarketplace The

rather than chronologically picturingsunflowers rattlesnakes and bison The color plates are pretty the captionsneutral and informative but the metaphorical message is sharp Behold what waslost Chapter  drives home the point Titled The World Turnd Upside Down it opens with an apocalyptic watercolor America AProphecy  by William Blake            Though it resembles astandard highschool history text with chapters on the Civil War immigrationimperial expansion and so on Eyes of the Nation is a book one flipsthrough not a book one views and reads in sequence It speaks through clustersof words and images not through argument and exposition Open to Page  forexample and youll find stills from DW Griffiths Intolerancejuxtaposed with a pencil sketch of the Lincoln Monument and on the facingpage a photograph of a charred and limbless lynched black male surrounded bysmiling whites in coats and ties combine a blackandwhite shot of Dust Bowlfarmers a fertile California tomato field captured by Edward Weston and aTechnicolor Emerald City from The Wizard of Oz  The ironies arentalways as blunt as these but in general it is tension not harmony thatgoverns the arrangements            The richest part of the book is its middleVisually there are just more sparks to strike after the invention of thecamera and the flowering of modern advertising The writing brightens tooBrinkley a highly classconscious historian is better at robber baronsdepressions strikes and grassroots politics than at wars and naturalhistory He knows how to isolate cultural decision pointsthe moment saywhen the populist cause was lost and William Jennings Bryan became a foolandhow to pin down such phantom entities as social conformity between the wars andSouthern agrarian idealism Though Brinkleys sympathies clearly lie with theprogressives he has a knack for portraying reactionaries His Klansmen andredbaiters are people toonot just bigots but also misguided dreamers Andthough hindsight sometimes breeds determinism Brinkley is alert to alternativehistories and paths just barely not taken The book concludes in orthodoxmulticulturalism and a surprisingly bitter estimate of Americas democraticpotential America approached the centurys end as fractured along socialracial ethnic economic gender and regional lines as it had been in all buta few moments in its history with a culture so diverse and so contentious thatit seemed to lack any coherence or shape with declining faith in itsgovernment its leaders and its principal institutions The facing page showsa picture of a brick wall scratched full

Westernmines and Eastern skyscrapers cotton fields and battleships boomtown mainstreets and metropolitan train stations have a strangely desertedSundaymorning feel as if they represented the first day or perhaps the lastof American modernity            The first thing one noticespaging through the book is that objects both natural and manmade lookedlarger and more heroic in those days if only because the people were fewerCall it the age of titanic capitalism Shots of the Flatiron Building underconstruction are weirdly short on human passersby implying that the growthrequired to fill the place is still a hopeful article of faith not yet apractical reality That the American Century was built before the bulk of itstenants had arrived is one of those facts that shouldnt be any surprise butcomes as a revelation nonetheless            Lesys texta filledin timeline that notes such events as the founding of department stores the rise ofbanks and financial institutions and the erection of famous publicmonumentscreates in combination with the pictures a retrospective mood thatisnt nostalgia but a finer more elevated yearning The sadness is not forwhat was or even for what might have
