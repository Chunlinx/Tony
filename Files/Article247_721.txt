  Many readers responded to yesterdays comment here that a USAT storyabout the upcoming congressional elections buried mention of its polling sampleof but  people It has been pointed out to Todays Papers that this isactually a somewhat larger sample than occurs in many newspaper polls and isplenty large to be accurate to within a few percentage points margin of errorFurther in a very interesting letter USAT s director of polling pointsout that although his paper usually delays mentioning the sample size until thelast paragraph or so of a story since USAT doesnt use jumps off thefront page these mentions usually occur much earlier in stories than dosimilar references in papers like the NYT that do jump These are allgood points Todays Papers would suggest two things  putting the sample andmargin of error information in the subheadline instead  Doing a story sometime explaining how nationwide elections can be reliably predicted by talkingto fewer people than you
