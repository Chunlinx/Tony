                uh creates some conversation anyway   yeah yeah so what do you think do you think theyre honest or they in for it themselves or   oh no i i think uh i think theyre honest i i you know there are some exceptions i think for the majority of them are honest and uh i just think in uh especially in the federal government the thing has just become bigger than   uhhuh   both of us all of us and its just too big to handle and uh i think they look uh   yeah   they look a lot fairly incompetent at times and and i just think its i think they mean well they have good intentions and i as you know as far as the topic goes we as far as im concerned theyre basically honest people but uh   uhhuh yeah well i was thinking if they were in for their for their own personal gain theyre probably     oh   they what was that your other line or   oh i dont know what that go ahead go   yeah but theyd probably you know theyd stay in for ten or twelve years maybe but then get out and use those contacts they made and go work as a consultant for some of these private industries that     let me get this other thing here hold on a second   okay sure thing     hello   its still me   okay i dont know what that was       uh no i just think the the uh federal government especially is just so huge i mean problems are so big and uh its so   uhhuh   internationalized that uh i dont know it just i dont know what the solution is but uh i dont think theyre in it for their own personal gain uh   yeah yeah theres actually you know you think you know they get paid what a hundred and hundred and twenty five thousand thats really not all that much compared to   right well   what   considering that they have to live up there i mean the living conditions up there i mean not the conditions but the private cost of living is atrocious and uh   yeah yeah yeah   uh i dont think a lot of them are making uh netting a whole lot of money once they leave up there   no   but uh   oh and i think a lot of them go in with a you know pretty idealist approach that you know they can make some changes and stuff  but i think they get in they all of a sudden find out what the real life is  and   uhhuh right and theyre just one of uh five hundred and thirty five and youre just talking about the Congress and the House of Representatives and the Senate   yeah exactly well you look at even the President you know hes got to fight against all you know the other five hundred thirty five to get anything through anyway so   yeah well i think anytime youve got a a Republican administration and a uh oh a soso senate as far as uh the split between the Democrats and the Republicans and then the democratic uh House uh whoevers in power   uhhuh uhhuh   is going to have their hands full and uh   yeah it doesnt its not really conducive to getting a lot done it sure seems like   no but uh its too bad uh but i think its like a lot of things whether its a company or an organization of some kind or the goverment federal government its uh it gets to be too big and uh it controls uh   uhhuh   you dont have the proper controls in place well then its going to get out of hand and people are going to look silly kind of foolish foolish and silly when theyre uh trying to operate that thing   exactly yeah and like you say its you know the right hand doesnt know what the left hands doing and the do you know even mouth sometimes are doing going the opposite direction so   right i know our state government gets a lot of heck as well down here and uh i dont know about of course about states i dont pay a whole lot of attention to the state government uh weve got a   uhhuh uhhuh   a female governor and she ran against a real clown here a year or so ago and both of them neither there just wasnt a whole lot to pick from   yeah yeah well there was that was a lot of that was public quite uh a public thing i mean we heard a lot about it on national news news that was that Richards wasnt that her name   yeah   right uh Richards uh Ann Richards is the governor she won then Clayton Williams was the guy that ran against her and he was a west Texas uh rancher and so forth   gal that won yeah yeah uhhuh   but uh they were both a couple of clowns   seemed like there was more personal mud mud throwing than anything else if i if i remember the news reports and stuff but   well they they had a good time it was serious business but i think they enjoyed themselves and a lot of people down here just   uhhuh so are they doing any good is she doing any good or   oh not really she i think uh they shes been in office just about a year now and uh   uhhuh   as far as her public uh public opinion surveys i think they give her about a fifty fifty rating she she hasnt uh destroyed the place but the economy down here is in pretty bad shape and she cant do much about that   yeah yeah   but uh shes shes done okay that whos to say how he would have done he hes a business man hes been successful i i   uhhuh   if i had voted i would have voted for him but  shes done all right   uhhuh yeah did we just uh we got our first woman mayor up here in Salt Lake uh just this past election and uh you know they made a big deal of that but shes a business woman and thats what she was really pushing was   um   business mindedness in uh you know in government and stuff and some of those in same business philosophies and it will be interesting to see how she does because   uhhuh yeah   you know shes kind of a selfmade i dont know if shes a millionaire but she you know got her own businesses and stuff but that was her big thing that she was pushing so   um uhhuh she a Republican   uh no shes Democrat   oh yeah   which uh   well you   actually Salt Lake and the county around Salt Lake is quite a bit Democrat so its not really surprising weve had a a a Democratic mayor for quite a few years     um uhhuh   uh the state as a whole is probably more definitely more Republican but   is that right   yeah it will be a lot it will be interesting to see how she does the you know theres shes already stepped on a few toes i think shes making the changes but   uhhuh well shes going to have to do
