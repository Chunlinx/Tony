             had to uh face up to the issue of putting parents in a retirement home   well its a topic that um my husband and i often discuss because um i dont have any grandparents and my mother is deceased so um we think about that often times with my father but theres plenty of other siblings to help out however on my husbands side um he has one sibling who is mentally retarded and um and then his parents and so we wonder you know how were going to make ends meet once theyre gone   uhhuh   um you know my motherinlaw constantly says things like well you know well i wish if one of us goes i wish wed all go like in a car accident so that nobody would help nobody would have to worry about it but uh   yeah   um its a scary issue i think   well ive been very fortunate uh my father uh was very careful in laying plans for his uh latter years     uhhuh   and he was very concerned that uh mother be provided for so he went through a process over a period of about five years deciding where he wanted to be and he made arrangements to sell his house and farm and uh invested in a uh nursing home in Central Virginia   um   and uh moved in there and uh he made that decision on his own and uh he made a good choice he found one that had uh pleasant conditions for for him and mother living together and it had a uh nursing home attached to it   um   and everything sort of worked out very fortuitously because uh they moved into the uh to the retirement home in August and he died in September just just before his uh uh eightieth birthday   wow wow wow   and uh it was fortunate that uh uh he had made those provisions because at that point uh mother had uh Alzheimers disease   um   and her mental faculties were going very rapidly and thats thats something thats very stressful to handle   yes i know   so uh we were very fortunate in having her in the right spot   one um i think thats kind of the ideal situation is to have a combination retirement home nursing home and even you know if they need special care um my husbands grandmother is in a nursing home and i dont think theyve termed what she has as Alzheimers but its you know she reverts a lot back to her childhood and she doesnt know who you are often times often times she does the one thing that she retains as far as her memory is concerned is um hymns   uhhuh   you know religious hymns she can sing them um and remember all the verses but when you talk to her she doesnt know who you are but the home that she is in uh it seems like a nice home but there are a lot of people there that are really bad badly off and they have them all combined together   uhhuh   and so her roommate um is um a person who entered herself into the home because she has really bad arthritis but mentally she is completely there so you know i dont know about that type of situation where you know you have a mixture but there is a home here in Dallas that um its a Methodist home um for the elderly  and uh they have that kind of situation it seems like what you were talking about with your parents retirement home and a nursing home   uhhuh   you know and even a hospital somewhat attached you know for those who need you know really special care and i think that would what be what i would desire if if i had to one of those um thats about   yeah my uh i have uh an aunt whos in a uh home in Charlotte North Carolina and they they had planned on that for a number of years and actually uh made the payment on the condominium or the apartment uh oh fifteen years before they moved in   oh really   and uh so when my aunt finally got to the point her eyesight deteriorated and she could no longer drive and it was getting awkward to get to the store for groceries and things like that   um   and uh she moved in it was only about its walking distance to where she lived  so she retained all her old friends and uh they they look after her and they serve pretty good meals   yeah   um its kind of amazing the disparity that exists between some
