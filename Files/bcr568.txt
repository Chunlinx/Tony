                    Introduction        Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women        from developed countries Axillary lymph node status is        widely accepted as an important parameter for assessing        prognosis in breast cancer patients However recurrence        and death also occur in patients with nodenegative breast        cancer NNBC A recurrence rate of  may be expected        during the first  years after diagnosis Prognostic        factors such as tumour size tumour grading hormone        receptor status age histology ploidy and proliferation        index are used to define subgroups of highrisk NNBC        patients            Despite the availability of        these prognostic markers highrisk NNBC patients cannot be        identified with sufficient accuracy This has led to a        search for new and possibly stronger prognostic markers in        order to define new subgroups and to facilitate        decisionmaking with respect to appropriate therapy                     Numerous reports have described the correlation between        amplification of oncogenes and its impact on the course of        breast cancer disease                                         In a        metaanalysis in which  studies were evaluated            c         myc amplification exhibited        significant but weak associations with tumour grade lymph        node metastasis negative progesterone receptor status and        postmenopausal status Furthermore c         myc amplification was significantly        associated with risk for recurrence and death However        studies in recent years have further shown that the c         myc gene participates in most aspects        of cellular function including replication growth        metabolism differentiation and apoptosis            Amplification of the oncogene         HER          neu has also been shown to be        indicative of poor prognosis in breast cancer Studies        revealed that the prognostic effect of         HER          neu is stronger for survival than for        recurrence          Furthermore increased        HERneu levels in primary tumours were associated with a        poor response to endocrine therapy               A drawback of many studies of oncogenes in human breast        cancer is that usually only one oncogene was evaluated        Based on a series of unselected cases in the present study        we examined the possible influence of the amplification of        the oncogenes c         myc and         HER          neu on diseasefree survival DFS        and overall survival OS Furthermore we studied whether        adjuvant therapies such as chemotherapy and endocrine        treatment or no treatment at all had any impact on DFS and        OS among oncogeneamplified NNBC patients                                        Patients and methods        Among  NNBC patients who had undergone        breastconserving therapy or modified mastectomy combined        with axillary lymphadenectomy of level  and  at least         lymph nodes per patient had been removed c         myc and         HER          neu oncogenes were assessed        prospectively using double differential PCR        Table shows some clinical histological and molecular        parameters The median followup period was  months        Postoperatively the following therapies were administered        in addition to radiotherapy tamoxifen  mgday for         years in  of patients and chemotherapy six cycles of        cyclophosphamide methotrexate fluorouracil CMF or        four cycles of fluorouracil epirubicin cyclophosphamide        FEC in  of patients Of the NNBC patients         did not receive any further systemic therapy        After tissue preparation malignant and normal tissues        were kept fresh and transported to the pathologist UB        The pathologist dissected samples for assessment of        oncogenes and hormone receptors A positive receptor status        was defined as the presence of more than  fmolmg cytosol        protein The histopathological grading was performed        according to the method of Bloom and Richardson            Lymph node sections were stained with haemotoxylin and        eosin immunohistochemical investigations were not        performed The tumour tissues were stored at C and the        DNA was isolated using the Fast Prep System Bio         Savant Savant Instruments Inc Holbrook NY USA Less        than  mg  mg tissue was homogenized using        FastDNA Kit in the Fast Prep Machine After preparing the        DNA the content was measured and the isolated DNA was        stored at C General details for the double        differential PCR technique reproducibility and clinical        significance were described previously        A        cutoff point of more than  average gene copy number        AGCN was considered to be positive for         HER          neu amplification     To        calculate the cutoff point for c         myc amplification all NNBC patients        were subjected to Classification and Regression Trees        CART analysis A cutoff value of  AGCN for c         myc oncogene led to the best        distinction between patients Fig shows the CART analysis        for all c         myc values            Results were evaluated using the SPSS system SPSS GmbH        Software Munich Germany The monoparametric survival        curves were determined using the KaplanMeier method in        order to estimate the impacts of intratumoural c         myc and         HER          neu oncogene amplification on DFS and        OS Statistical deviations were defined using the logrank        test Recurrence of disease was found at the following        locations local          n   contralateral          n   axilla          n   lung          n   brain          n   liver          n   and skin          n   During the period of        observation  patients died In order to derive relevant        information regarding the effects of oncogene amplification        on the course of breast cancer disease the accumulated        values were determined after postoperative periods of         and  months We applied the multivariate Cox model to        enable us to identify independently predictive parameters            Parameters considered included the oncogenes c         myc and         HER          neu  tumour size histopathological        grading oestrogen receptor status and age   or          years         P   was considered        statistically significant                    Results        The prevalence rates for amplification of c         myc and         HER          neu were  and         respectively Coamplification was found in  patients         Table  Among those patients with c         myc amplification five recurrences        were identified   and among those with         HER          neu amplification two recurrences          were identified Among those patients in whom        neither c         myc nor         HER          neu were amplified four recurrences        were found   and among those with        coamplification of both oncogenes two recurrences          were observed Four patients with c         myc amplification   and        three patients with         HER          neu amplification   died        Nine patients who lacked amplification of either oncogene          and two patients with coamplification          died        Using univariate analysis c         myc amplified cancers were        associated with a significantly lower DFS of  as        compared with           P   among c         myc nonamplified breast cancers        Ninetyfive months after diagnosis operation the        estimated DFS of c         myc amplified cancer patients was        only  as compared with  among c         myc nonamplified patients          P   Comparison of        nonamplified cancers with         HER          neu amplified cancers did not reveal        any significant differences with regard to DFS Fig                Multivariate analysis revealed that c         myc amplification and tumour size in        contrast to oestrogen receptor status grading and age        were the only independent parameters impacting on DFS        Table  With regard to OS no independent parameters        were identified among the prognostic markers referred to        above        Regarding various adjuvant systemic therapies such as        chemotherapy CMF FEC and endocrine therapy tamoxifen        no significant differences were observed with respect to        DFS and OS in c         myc amplified and         HER          neu amplified NNBC patients in        comparison with nonamplified patients However        significantly shorter DFS and OS were observed among c         myc amplified patients who did not        receive systemic adjuvant therapy No corresponding        associations were found among         HER          neu amplified NNBC patients as        compared with nonamplified patients Tables and                     Discussion        Numerous clinical studies have proved axillary lymph        node status to be the dominant factor for prognosis and        prediction of DFS and OS in breast cancer patients The        fact of the matter is that even among NNBC patients         can be expected to progress or even die The advantage        conferred by adjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy was        examined in randomized studies                   Because adjuvant therapies may positively impact on outcome        in only around  the costs of these therapies make their        routine application in all NNBC patients inappropriate            For this reason predictive factors that accurately        define subgroups of NNBC patients who may benefit from        adjuvant systemic therapy would be a great advantage        In the present study the oncogenes c         myc and         HER          neu were examined with regard to        their ability to predict DFS OS and rate of recurrence as        well as mortality All patients were randomly selected from        one department Frauenklinik Klinikum Ibbenbueren        Ibbenbueren Germany C         myc amplification was identified in         and         HER          neu amplification in  Berns and        coworkers      reported amplification of c         myc in  and of         HER          neu in  using a standard southern        blot technique In a selected highrisk cohort of NNBC        patients RouxDosseto         et al     applied the same        method and found prevalence rates for c         myc and         HER          neu amplification of  and         respectively Those oncogenes were assessed in the present        study using a double differential PCR technique               Using this method Brandt         et al     found c         myc to be amplified in  and         HER          neu in  of breast cancers        without consideration of nodal status coamplification of        those oncogenes was present in  In the present study        simultaneous amplification of both oncogenes was observed        in  As in the present investigation RouxDosseto         et al     found that c         myc amplification among NNBC patients        was significantly associated with earlier recurrence in        univariate and multivariate analyses However         HER          neu amplified NNBC patients did not        have the same outcome Accordingly c         myc amplification appears to be an        independent prognostic marker which has greater predictive        power than does oestrogen receptor status and tumour grade        As early as  Berns and coworkers      reported        that patients with c         myc amplified breast cancers had an        unfavourable prognosis        The first study to mention possible prognostic        importance of         HER          neu gene amplification was reported        in  by Slamon         et al      That study included         patients with NNBC and nodepositive breast cancer by        univariate and multivariate analyses it revealed that         HER          neu amplification correlated very        closely with shorter DFS and OS in a subgroup of         nodepositive patients In  in an analysis of         patients Press         et al     found that        amplification of         HER          neu correlated with unfavourable        prognosis with respect to DFS        Attempts by other investigators to confirm these        findings were met with various degrees of success Some        studies claimed that         HER          neu status was an independent        predictive factor in the case of breast cancer whereas        other studies could not confirm this                 It is certainly of great interest to the clinician that        only two out of five studies including more than         patients and with a followup period of at least  years        attributed some prognostic value to         HER          neu amplification among patients with        NNBC         Almost all of the studies that        dealt with         HER          neu status and DFS as well as OS        showed no benefit of this oncogene in the prognosis of NNBC        patients In a survey conducted by Ravdin and Chamness            only one    of  studies concerning        immunohistochemical overexpression of         HER          neu indicated a significant result        with respect to OS in multivariate analysis        In the present study  out of  c         myc amplified patients received        chemotherapy  patients received endocrine therapy and        five patients received no further therapy The greatest        recurrence rates were noted in the group of patients who        received no therapy  and in those who received        chemotherapy  The lowest recurrence rate of  was        seen in patients treated with tamoxifen All patients who        received endocrine therapy          n   were characterized by        positive oestrogen andor progesterone receptor status The        protooncogene c         myc can be upregulated by oestrogen        stimulation of hormonedependent breast cancer cells        Endocrine therapy with the antioestrogen tamoxifen can        mediate the downregulation of c         myc  culminating in cell cycle        arrest     Berns         et al     reported that  of        patients with amplification of c         myc or with coamplification of c         myc and         HER          neu profited from endocrine therapy        C         myc amplified patients affected by        metastatic disease showed a tendency toward longer DFS with        endocrine therapy as compared with shorter DFS following        secondline chemotherapy However the minor rate of        response after chemotherapy did not correlate with OS The        poorer responses to chemotherapy among patients with c         myc amplified tumours in the present        study recurrence rate  may be in agreement with        experimental findings in erythroleukaemia cells that the        degree of cisplatinum resistance correlated directly with        the level of c         myc expression            In the present study  out of          HER          neu amplified patients received        chemotherapy  patients received endocrine therapy and        seven patients received no further therapy In total low        recurrence rates of   and  were found in the        abovementioned therapy groups respectively Table         Compared with nonamplified patients administered the same        therapies no significant differences with regard to DFS        and OS were observed In contrast to that finding c         myc amplified patients not        administered adjuvant systemic therapy exhibited a        significantly shorter DFS and OS than did nonamplified        patients who also received no adjuvant systemic therapy        However the therapy groups analyzed in the present study        are small and therefore we recommend careful        interpretation of the findings        Higher recurrence rates or poor response to endocrine        treatment with tamoxifen in patients with         HER          neu amplified hormone receptor        positive tumours as reported in studies in nodepositive        or metastatic breast cancer       were not        observed in the present study Although deregulated         HER          neu activity can strongly stimulate        cytoplasmic signalling pathways which in turn impinge on        c         myc at multiple levels causing its        deregulated expression     this scenario does not        appear to be active in NNBC because the recurrence rate of         c         myc and         HER          neu coamplified patients was only         However among those patients in whom coamplification of c                myc and         HER          neu was absent the recurrence rate        was lower   Differences in the numbers of        recurrences and deaths can be accounted for by the fact        that some deaths were not related to tumours                    Conclusion        C         myc amplification appears to        represent a prognostic marker with which early recurrence        may be predicted in NNBC patients C         myc amplified NNBC patients who were        not administered adjuvant systemic therapy suffer shorter        DFS and OS C         myc could be used together with the        tumourassociated protease urokinaseplasminogen activator        and its inhibitor ie plasminogen activator inhibitor        after further randomized studies have been conducted to        confirm whether NNBC patients should receive adjuvant        systemic therapy                          Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        AGCN  average gene copy number CART
