                                 Unmitigated Gauls            Fifteen years ago justafter Franois Mitterrand became president of France I attended my firstconference in Paris I cant remember a thing about the conference itselfalthough my impressions of the food and winethis was my first adult visit tothe cityremain vivid The only thing I do remember is a conversation overdinner  canard aux olives  with an adviser to the new government whoexplained its plan to stimulate the economy with public spending while raisingwages and maintaining a strong franc            To theAmericans present this program sounded a bit well inconsistent Wouldnt itwe asked him be a recipe for a balance of payments crisis which dulymaterialized a few months later Thats the trouble with you AngloSaxoneconomistsyoure too wrapped up in your theories You need to adopt ahistorical point of view Some of us did in fact know a little historyWasnt the plan eerily reminiscent of the failed program of Leon Blums government Oh no what we are doing is completely unprecedented            The French have no monopoly on intellectual pretensions oron muddled thinking They may not even be more likely than other people tocombine the two There is however something special about the way the Frenchpolitical class discusses economics In no other advanced country is the eliteso willing to let fine phrases overrule hard thinking to reject the lessons ofexperience in favor of delusions of grandeur            To anAngloSaxon economist Frances current problems do not seem particularlymysterious Jobs in France are like apartments in New York City Those whoprovide them are subject to detailed regulation by a government that is verysolicitous of their occupants A French employer must pay his workers well andprovide generous benefits and it is almost as hard to fire those workers as itis to evict a New York tenant New Yorks protenant policies have producedvery good deals for some people but they have also made it very hard fornewcomers to find a place to live Frances policies have produced nice work ifyou can get it But many people especially the young cant get it And giventhe generosity of unemployment benefits many dont even try            True some problems are easy to diagnose buthard to deal with If George Pataki cant end rent control why should weexpect Jacques Chirac to be able to cure Eurosclerosis But what is mysteriousabout France is that as far as one can tell absolutely nobody of consequenceaccepts the obvious diagnosis On the contrary there seems to be an emergingconsensus that what France needs isguess whatmore regulation Socialistleader Lionel Jospins idea of a proemployment policy is to require employersto pay workers the same money for fewer hoursan idea that was popular withvoters the recent election results would suggest Even conservative PhillipeSeguin regarded as an iconoclast by French standards because he has questionedthe sacred goal of European monetary union thinks that one way to add jobs isto ban selfservice pumps at gas stations            Beyondmore of the same what does the French elite see as the answer to the nationsproblems For more than a decade its members have sought salvation in the ideaof Europethat is a unified European economy under French leadership ofcourse with common regulations and a common currency In such a continentalmarket they imagine France can once again prosper            Now a unified European market is a pretty good idea Thereis even a reasonable case for unifying Europes currenciesalthough there isalso a good case for doing no such thing There is a whole industry ofpeopleEurologistswho make a living by debating that issue But toacknowledge the potential virtues of European economic integration risksmissing the essential fatuousness of the whole project Frances problem isunemployment currently almost  percent Nothing else is even remotely asimportant And whatever a unified market and a common currency may or may notachieve they will do almost nothing to create jobs            Think ofit this way Imagine that several cities all suffering housing shortagesbecause of rent control agree to make it easier for landlords in one city toown buildings in another This is not a bad idea It might even slightlyincrease the supply of apartments But it is not going to get at the heart ofthe problem Yet all the grand schemes for European integration amount to nomore than that            Indeed in practice the dream of European unityhas actually made things worse If you are going to have a common currencyeverything we know suggests you should follow what Berkeleys Barry Eichengreencalls the Nike strategy But instead of just doing it European nations agreedto a sevenyear transition period during which they would be required to meet acomplex set of criteriamainly to reduce their budget deficits while keepingtheir currencies strong            There isnothing wrong with balancing your budget In fact European nations need to dosome serious fiscal housecleaning And as the happy experience of America underBill Clinton has shown it is quite possible to reduce the deficit and increaseemployment at the same time All you need to do is cut interest rates so thatprivate spending takes up the slack But you cant cut interest rates if youare obliged to keep your currency strong So the Maastricht Treaty theblueprint for European currency union ensured that the budgetcutting itrequired would be all pain and no gain Nobody can make a precise estimate buta guess is that without Maastricht France might have an unemployment rate of percent or  percent Not great but a couple of points better thannow            While some French politicians have been willing to say nicethings about budget deficits nobody seems willing to challenge the dogma thatEuropean integration is the answer Even Seguin the iconoclast declares thatthe fight against unemployment is inseparable from the realization of thegrand European design            But let usnot blame French politicians Their inanities only reflect the broader tone ofeconomic debate in a nation prepared to blame its problems on everything butthe obvious causes France say its bestselling authors and most populartalking heads is the victim of globalizationalthough adroit use of red tapehas held imports from lowwage countries to a level far below that in theUnited States or Britain where the unemployment rate is now only half that ofFrance France they say is the victim of savage unrestrainedcapitalismalthough it has the largest government and the smallest privatesector of any large advanced country France they say is the victim ofcurrency speculators whose ravages President Chirac once likened to those ofAIDS            The refusal of the French elite to face up towhat looks like reality to the rest of us may doom the very European dreamsthat have sustained the nations illusions After this last election it isclear that the French will not be willing to submit to serious fiscaldiscipline Will the Germans still be willing to give up their beloved deutschemark in favor of a currency partly managed by France It is equally clear thatFrance will not give up its taste for regulationindeed it will surely try toimpose that taste on its more marketoriented neighbors especially BritainThat will give those neighborsyes even Tony Blairplenty of reason tohesitate before forming a closer European Union            But if it turns out thatChiracs political debacle is the beginning of a much larger disasterthecollapse of the whole vision of European glory that has obsessed France for solongwe can be sure of one thing The French will blame it all on someoneelse
