TOTHE HOSPITAL INPATIENT PROSPECTIVE PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND FISCAL YEAR RATES RIN AHi Costbenefit analysisSection b of the Social Security Act  USC  brequires the Secretary to prepare regulatory impact analyses forany rule that may have a significant impact on the operations of asubstantial number of small rural hospitals An initial analysisto be prepared for a proposed rule is to describe the impact ofthe proposed rule on such hospitals and include the mattersrequired under  USC   The final analysis to be preparedfor a final rule must include with respect to small ruralhospitals the matters required under  USC   The HealthCare Financing Administration HCFA determined that the proposedrule would affect a substantial number of small rural hospitalsand that the effects on some could be significant HCFA alsodetermined that the rule could have a significant impact on otherclasses of hospitals as well Therefore as discussed below HCFAprepared combined regulatory impactregulatory flexibility analysesin connection with the ruleHCFA did not prepare an additional analysis under ExecutiveOrder ii Actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and Initial analysisHCFA included the full text of its combined initial regulatoryimpactregulatory flexibility analysis analysis as an appendix tothe May   proposed rule See  Fed Reg  Inresponse to our inquiry HCFA staff explained that it did notsubmit a copy of the analysis to SBA However in HCFAs view itspublication of the full text of the analysis with the proposed rulesatisfied theHCFA considers all hospitals to be small entities for purposesof the Regulatory Flexibility ActGAOOGCsubmission requirement We have learned that some agenciesfollow this practice without objection from SBAAs required by  USC  b and  the analysiscoupled with the summary in the preamble explains the reasons andobjectives as well as legal bases for the proposed rule Sectiond of the Social Security Act  USC  wwdgenerally provides for a system of payment for the operating costsof hospital inpatient services under Medicare Part A based onprospectively set rates In addition under section g of theSocial Security Act  USC  wwg capitalrelated costsfor those hospitals whose operating costs are paid under aprospective payment system are also to be paid based onprospectively set rates In response to directives contained inthese sections and HCFAs experience the rule adjusts variouselements associated with hospital costs  Fed Reg at According to the analysis the changes are designed tofurther the objectives of the prospective payment system whilemaintaining the financial viability of the hospital industry andensuring access to high quality health care for Medicarebeneficiaries  Fed Reg at Consistent with section b the analysis describes andestimates the number of small entities to which the rule willapply The rule will apply to  percent of the generalshortterm acute care hospitals that participate in the Medicareprogram or  hospitals all of which are considered smallentities by HCFA Of the  hospitals  are rural Theanalysis describes and illustrates the impact of the rule onvarious types of rural and urban hospitalsAs discussed below the proposed rule would modify an existingreporting requirement applicable to all hospitals serving Medicarebeneficiaries HCFA did not discuss the proposed change in itsanalysis but in the preamble to the proposed rule Thus HCFAalso satisfied its responsibility under  USC  bFinally with respect to sections b and c theanalysis does not identify any federal rules that duplicateoverlap or conflict with the proposed rule or any significantregulatory alternatives Since according to HCFA all hospitalssubject to the rule are small entities it would be difficult tominimize the impact of the rule on such entities within theconstraints of the Medicare program As discussedThe objectives of the prospective payment system are toencourage hospitals to operate efficiently while ensuring thatthey are compensated for legitimate costs  Fed Reg atUnder  USC  a agencies may perform the analysesrequired by sections  and  in conjunction with or as part ofany other agenda or analysis required by other law if such otheranalysis satisfies the provisions of these sectionsPage  GAOOGCbelow HCFA addressed comments on various elements of theproposed rule throughout the preamble to the final ruleFinal analysisConsistent with  USC   HCFA included the full text ofits final analysis as an appendix to the final rule  Fed Reg  As in the case of the initial analysis HCFAsummarized the need for the rule in the preamble  Fed Reg at In the final analysis HCFA replaced the Objectivessection with a discussion of changes to the initial analysis See Fed Reg at With respect to section a the analysis issued with thefinal rule states that HCFA received no comments on the methodologyused in its initial analysis  Fed Reg at  It also statesthat any differences between the two analyses resulted from HCFAsuse of more recent or more complete hospital data  Fed Regat The analysis describes and estimates the number of smallentities to which the rule will apply as required by sectiona See  Fed Reg at  The analysis indicates thatthe rule will apply to  rather than  generalshortterm acute care hospitals Id The analysis indicates adecrease of four rural hospitals and an increase of three urbanhospitals for a net decrease of one  Fed Reg at  Thefinal analysis also describes the rules impact on covered entitiesand like the earlier analysis specifically distinguishes betweenurban and rural hospitalsHCFA did not discuss its proposed modification of an existingreporting requirement in the analysis as described in sectiona but in the preamble Also like the earlier analysisthe final analysis does not discuss steps taken to minimize theeconomic impact of the rule on hospitals under section aSince HCFA did not discuss regulatory alternatives in the earlieranalysis it did not describe the reasons for its approach in thefinal analysisSections  and Section  permits agencies in complying with sections  and to provide either a quantifiable or numerical description ofthe effects of a rule or more general descriptive statements ifquantification is not practicable or reliable The analyses issuedwith the proposed and final rules provide quantifiable descriptionsof the rules impact on covered entities including ruralhospitals See eg  Fed Reg at  describing percentchanges in payments per case due to changes in the prospectivepayment system for operating costsPage  GAOOGCFinally section a requires that agencies ensure that smallentities are given an opportunity to participate in a rulemakingthrough the reasonable use of techniques such as those enumeratedAs discussed HCFA published the full text of its initial analysisas an appendix to the proposed rule and invited comments from smallentities HCFA staff has advised that it did not take any otheractions specifically designed to ensure participation by smallentities including rural hospitals in this rulemaking HoweverHCFA staff also pointed out that in carrying out itsresponsibilities under the Medicare program HCFA maintains anappropriate ongoing working relationship with industryofficialsiii Actions relevant to sections  of the UnfundedMandates Reform Act of  USC  Since the rule does not impose a federal intergovernmental orprivate sector mandate as defined in the Unfunded Mandates ReformAct of  sections   and  of the act are inapplicableSimilarly section  of the act is inapplicable because the rulewill not significantly affect small governmentsiv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts andExecutive OrdersAdministrative Procedure Act  USC   et seqWith the exception of the matter discussed below HCFApromulgated the changes to the Medicare prospective payment systemsunder the notice and comment procedures of  USC   andsection b of the Social Security Act  USC  hhbThe proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on May  HCFA stated that it would consider comments received by July  The final rule was published on August   HCFAreceived  timely pieces of correspondence containing comments onthe proposed rule See  Fed Reg at  Those comments arediscussed throughout the preamble to the final ruleIn the final rule HCFA revised certain regulations pertainingto the costs of graduate medical education programs to conform to arecently enacted statute The agencys  appropriation requiresthat for certain purposes the Federal Government deem accreditedany postgraduate physician training program that would beaccredited but for the accrediting agencys reliance upon anaccreditation standard that requires an entity to perform aninduced abortion or require provide or refer for training in theperformance of induced abortions or make arrangements for suchtraining    See Section d of Pub L No  April Section b provides that with exceptions not pertinenthere before issuing any final rule the Secretary shall providefor notice of the proposed regulation in the Federal Register and acomment period of at least  daysPage  GAOOGCHCFA found that notice and comment procedures were unnecessarywith respect to this regulatory change since it did not involve anexercise of agency discretion See  Fed Reg at Accordingly HCFA did not follow notice and comment procedures withrespect to this provision See  USC  bB  USC hhbCPaperwork Reduction Act  USC  The rule modifies an existing requirement applicable to allhospitals that provide services to Medicare beneficiaries Atpresent hospitals are required to distribute a statement entitledAn Important Message from Medicare to patients at or about thetime of admission Under the modified requirement hospitals wouldbe required to distribute the statement during the course of thehospital stay rather than at admission  Fed Reg at The preambles to the proposed and final rules discussthis modification to the reporting requirement explaining thereasons for the change and providing a burden estimate  FedReg at    Fed Reg at  HCFA solicited and evaluated comments on its modification to thereporting requirement See  Fed Reg at  HCFAdeclined to accept the one commenters suggestion that it requiremass distribution of the Important Message from Medicare tobeneficiaries while they are healthy and do not have plans to behospitalized See  Fed Reg at HCFA submitted its proposed modification of this Medicarereporting requirement to the Office of Management and Budget OMBon July   OMB has not yet approved the modification and thepreambles to the proposed and final rules state that themodification will not be effective until it is approved by OMB Fed Reg at   Fed Reg at Statutory Authorization for the ruleBoth the proposed and final rule cite the Secretarys broadauthority to promulgate regulations necessary for the efficientadministration of the Medicare program See  Fed Reg at  citing primarily sections  and of the Social Security Act  USC   and hhThe statement advises patients of their rights to be fullyinformed about decisions affecting their coverage or payment andabout their appeal rights should they be notified that Medicarewill no longer cover their care  Fed Reg at As discussed above both sections impose specific proceduralrequirements applicable to the rulemaking at issue herePage  GAOOGCIn addition the preambles and appendices to the proposed andfinal rules cite numerous statutory provisions associated withparticular aspects of the rule For example section dCof the Social Security Act  USC  wwdC requiresthe Secretary to annually adjust the weights and classificationsfor the diagnosis related groups to which Medicare beneficiarieshospital stays may be assigned  Fed Reg at  SectiondE of the Social Security Act  USC wwdE requires that as part of the methodology fordetermining hospital payments the Secretary annually makeadjustments for area differences in hospital wage levels by afactor reflecting the relative wage level for hospitals in aparticular geographic area compared to a national average  FedReg at  See also section gA of the SocialSecurity Act  USC  wwgA providing for thepayment of hospitals capital costs under a prospective paymentsystem established by the Secretary  Fed Reg at Executive Order The Office of Management and Budget OMB reviewed the rule asan economically significant regulatory action under Executive Order HCFA staff advised that after submission of the rule to OMBHCFA made changes to its discussion of the rules effective datewhich OMB also approvedIn its submission HCFA did not identify any other statute orexecutive order imposing procedural requirements
