          okay have you ever served as a juror   never ive never been served on the jury never been called up in a jury although some of my friends have been jurors   uhhuh i never have either   you havent huh if you were uh what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers   well i think its a good idea i think our justice system needs a major overhaul and im not sure what needs to be done to fix it but i think theyve got a lot of problems   i think the major thing they need to  correct is how long it takes something to get to jury and to get to trial   true   and i dont know if thats just a pure volumes number or or what but uh sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and theyre too easily swayed by their emotion   yeah i think thats true   hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides       TV shows   yeah do you would you prefer all trials by a judge   no i think there are certain things that uh the jury can determine as far as uh guilty or not guilty but as far as the affixing affixing affixing of punishment and fines and things of that nature i dont know if that is best left up to the jury to decide to award you know two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing you know its true that you know this may be sad and all that thing but uh the jury i think is best in most cases suited for determination of guilt and innocence but not the award of of penalties and fines and punishment   yeah i would agree with that i think youre right i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well its only going to cost the insurance company and   umhum thats true but uh i do like the idea of the jury being the the the people who decide in the matter of uh if its a jail term versus life and death   uhhuh   you know the death penalty and such   if they give them all the information i dont know when it comes to sentencing phase i guess they tell them if a guy if the person has a previous record and stuff   uhhuh   sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jurys not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave and   right   the judge decides whether or not they should hear it   yeah uh it it its kind of difficult and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let uh some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in in jail   right   although you still hear about those occasionally   yeah do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury   um i dont know i you know i heard a very interesting and maybe its just the TV show or movie i was watching they were going through a trial and i think it was like on one of the the documentary TV shows where they ask for the the verdict by the jury   uhhuh   and they went by each one saying guilty or innocent guilty or innocent   uhhuh   and they took it more as just like a majority   oh   so i i   some of them disagree i mean some of them said one way and some the other   exactly but they took you know whatever the majority was so i didnt know if that was just something for drama or thats truly the way it is i always thought it had to be unanimous   i think it does have to be unanimous   but uh rather interesting   i know they can poll a jury make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was but i thought that they all had to agree or else they it was a hung jury   uhhuh i did i did also   and yeah i think i dont know how i feel about that i think maybe uh majority might be sufficient     uhhuh   its hard to say though i   what about in international trials do you think they should have a jury there i think that would be kind of interesting   oh yeah i hadnt thought about international trials at all   i guess the the problem with that is theres no true authority in any kind of international verdicts   right   like you know the old day with the rack we theyre going to say okay youre guilty and you have to pay Kuwait four million dollars well whose going to really make them   yeah   nobody   yeah   so but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of you know  people from different countries uh in as international law also   yeah i think maybe theyd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average Joe off the street   umhum   for something like that because of the cultural differences   right   things like that   i dont know how what it would take to be come up with a true perfect system or if one exists but   yeah what about uniform sentencing   uh is that the crime and its already  false due to some chart and determine the punishment or   right yeah like if youre convicted of a certain crime you automatically get so many years its not a discretionary thing   umhum  i think there should be a core minimum that they get but uh       i guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum things of that nature   yeah   i   i wish that when they sentence someone if theyre going to sentence him to five years then make him serve five years   yeah that serves a kind of if theyre i guess uh if you sentence someone to life life is only forty nine years something like that   you know yeah i   and i guess youre eligible after twenty seven for parole even though youre in for life   yeah and sometimes those people are are young enough they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble   yeah although i guess its your you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time   yeah i dont believe that very often happens   no because uh inside the jail there i dont think theres no real rehabilitation it just   i dont think so either In fact i think they end up worse because the conditions are so bad   yes its another war zone   yeah   but who knows   i think i think maybe they ought to just be punished with some some kind of real punishment like hard labor for a shorter length of time you know actually make them do something thats not pleasant   i agree get them out there   and do it and get it over with and get back in the you know world and not spend so much time sitting around letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them and   sure they should have them go out and doing stuff cleaning up or picking up dirt or weeds or who knows what something for the for the state since the state is paying for them they should get some kind of kind of work out of them   yeah yeah something besides license plates and tiddlywinks   exactly   yeah   trading their lives for cigarettes   yeah   those kinds of things well good   well i think that covers it   i think so   it was nice talking to you   nice talking to you also   um bye   have a wonderful Easter   you too  bye   bye
