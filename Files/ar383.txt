                    Introduction        BALBc mice immunized with human cartilage proteoglycan        PG aggrecan develop arthritis             Autoantibody production precedes the first clinical        symptoms of arthritis   While these antiPG        autoantibodies alone do not transfer arthritis        autoantibodies significantly hasten the onset of disease        and cause PG to be released from the cartilage           B cells proliferate and differentiate into        immunoglobulinsecreting plasma cells under the influence        of a combination of cytokines derived from T cells          IL a T helper Th cytokine regulates the switch from        IgMD to IgG and IgE in activated B cells           However the         in vivo dependency on IL for the        IgG response is controversial     The Th        cytokine IFN is important         in vitro and         in vivo for enhancement of IgGa        secretion    Th and Th cytokines also function to        crossregulate Ig isotypes For example IFN antagonizes        ILinduced IgG responses at the level of IgG        transcription    whereas IL has the ability to        suppress IFNdriven IgGa responses          We have previously shown that PGspecific antibodies        increase the severity of arthritis and that PGinduced        arthritis is a Thtype disease dominated by IFN   We        therefore were interested in finding out how IFN and IL        regulate isotype expression of the PGspecific antibodies        and if an autoantibody isotype contributes to the severity        of disease                    Materials and methods                  Animals          BALBc and IFNdeficient mice were purchased from          the Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME USA BALBc          heterozygous and homozygous nude mice were obtained from          the National Cancer Institute Frederick MD USA          Breeding pairs of BALBc ILdeficient mice were          obtained from Klinische Forschergruppe fr Rheumatologie          Freiburg Germany CDdeficient BALBc mice were          purchased from Taconic Germantown NY USA                          Preparation of cartilage PG monomer aggrecan and          immunization          Human cartilage was obtained during jointreplacement          surgery and highdensity PG was prepared as described          elsewhere    Female BALBc mice wildtype or gene          deficient were injected intraperitoneally on days            and  with  g of human cartilage PG measured as          protein in adjuvant as described elsewhere                                       Measurement of immunoglobulin isotypes          Enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISA was used to          measure isotypespecific antibodies in serial dilutions           to  of sera ELISA plates were coated          with either  g human PG or  g mouse PG as          described elsewhere    PGspecific IgG isotypes          were detected with peroxidaselabeled rabbit antimouse          IgG or IgGa Zymed Laboratories San Francisco CA          USA IgG and IgGa myeloma proteins were used for a          standard curve                          Assessment of cytokine production by spleen cells          in vitro          Spleens were obtained  week after the third injection          with PG as described elsewhere   Cells were          stimulated in the presence or absence of PG  gml          and a capture ELISA was used to measure the released          cytokines IFN IL and IL                            Assessment of arthritis          The severity of arthritis in each paw was graded          according to an established scoring system    as          follows  normal  mild erythema andor swelling          usually in one or two toes  moderate erythema andor          swelling of the paw  more diffuse erythema  severe          erythema and swelling affecting the entire paw maximum          score for the four paws   Inflammation and joint          swelling were recorded twice a week by the same          individual in a blinded manner                          Statistical analysis          The MannWhitney           U test was used to compare          nonparametric data for statistical significance           P values less than  were          considered significant                            Results                  PGspecific IgG isotype dominates despite a higher          ratio of IFN to IL          BALBc mice immunized with human PG generated a          PGspecific IgG isotype response which was significantly          higher than the PGspecific IgGa isotype Fig a          However when the production of Th and Th cytokines was          measured from splenocytes of animals immunized with PG          IFN was produced at a significantly higher          concentration than either IL or IL Fig a These          results reveal a dichotomy between the isotype of the          PGspecific antibody response IgG and the secretion of          IFN The discrepancy could be reconciled if the          PGspecific IgG response is independent of T cells          We therefore assessed the PGspecific response in          heterozygous and homozygous nude mice and in          CDdeficient mice Whereas heterozygous nude mice          generated essentially the same antibody response to PG as          wildtype mice Fig b no or very little antiPG          antibody was detected in homozygous nude or          CDdeficient mice Fig b These results show that          the human and murine PGspecific antibody responses are          dependent on the interaction between T cells and B          cells                          IL and IFN regulation of the PGspecific          IgGIgGa isotype response          To find out if the PGspecific IgG response is          dependent on IL we immunized ILdeficient mice with          PG and measured the PGspecific IgG and IgGa isotypes          Whereas the IgG response to human PG was unaffected          Fig a the loss of IL significantly reduced the          IgG response to mouse PG in ILdeficient mice Fig          b The most striking observation however was the          dramatic increase in PGspecific IgGa response in IL          deficient mice There was a sixfold increase in the IgGa          response in the absence of IL Fig ab These          results show that the PGspecific IgG response was          marginally dependent on IL whereas endogenous IL          dramatically suppressed the PGspecific IgGa          response          To find out if IFN induced a PGspecific IgGa          response           in vivo the PGspecific IgGa          response was examined in IFNdeficient mice The IgGa          antibody responses to both human and mouse PGs were lower          in these mice than in wildtype mice Fig ab These          results show that the PGspecific IgGa response was          dependent on IFN If IFN concentrations regulated          IgG reduction in IFN should be permissive for IgG          in IFNdeficient mice however there was no increase          in IgG response to either human or mouse PG Fig          ab                          Arthritis is associated with an increase in          IgGa          We studied the induction of arthritis in mice          deficient in IL and IFN to find out if there is a          correlation between the isotype of the antibody and          disease In wildtype and IL deficient mice paw          swelling began    days after the last injection          with PG whereas in the IFNdeficient mice swelling          began much later at    days Table  The          incidences of arthritis in wildtype and ILdeficient          mice were much higher than in the PGimmunized          IFNdeficient mice and the arthritis score was          significantly higher in the ILdeficient than in the          wildtype animals Table  In IFNdeficient mice not          only was the proportion of animals with arthritis lower          than in the other groups but also their reduced          susceptibility was further mirrored in the significantly          less severe paw swelling Table  These data show that          endogenous cytokine concentrations dramatically affect          both the onset and the severity of inflammation                            Discussion        Because PGinduced arthritis is dominated by IFN it        is considered to be a Thtype disease           Paradoxically we observed higher concentrations of the        IgG isotype than of the IgGa isotype To resolve this        apparent paradox we examined the antiPG responses in        cytokinedeficient animals We found that in the absence of        IL the PGspecific IgG isotype was only minimally        affected These         in vivo experiments are very        different from those describing a dramatic         in vitro effect of IL on IgG        induction    but are similar to other studies that        showed partial elimination of IgG         in vivo either using neutralizing        antibodies to IL or blocking the IL receptor with        antibodies      One possibility was that the        large carbohydrate content of PG might have a promoting        interaction with B cells in a mitogenlike manner thus        permitting production of IgG However nude mice and        CDdeficient mice did not generate a PGspecific IgG        response and such a response was also independent of IFN        Taken together these results are in contrast to the        ILdictated IgG switch response Rather they suggest        that the PGspecific IgG response at least in BALBc        mice may be regulated         in vivo by other        asyetunidentified cytokines             In contrast to IgG the expression of IgGa isotype        showed a strong inverse correlation with the concentration        of endogenous IL In the absence of IL the IgGa        response was six times greater than in wildtype mice This        finding demonstrates that IL plays a critical role in        regulating the PGspecific IgGa response The role of this        cytokine in the suppression of IgGa         in vivo has not been well studied        The IgGa response was only minimally enhanced after         in vivo treatment with antiIL        antibody   but it was increased in immunized        ILdeficient mice   Since there is no evidence that        IL directly inhibits IgGa transcription in B cells this        cytokine very likely suppresses the IFN response either        directly or indirectly Indeed the significant reduction        of the PGspecific IgGa response in the absence of IFN        suggests that the response is controlled by this        interferon        We have found that the development of PGspecific        antibodies correlates with the development of arthritis        and that PGspecific autoantibodies increase the severity        of disease We show here that mice deficient in IL        develop arthritis that is significantly more severe than in        wildtype animals The pathogenic role of IgGa antibody        was also described in a model of autoimmune hemolytic        anemia   however these IgGa autoantibodies were not        pathogenic in mice that are deficient in Fc receptor III          These two observations taken together suggest the        possibility that the IgGa PGspecific autoantibodies        elicit a pathogenic effect through an Fcreceptormediated        mechanism        PGinduced arthritis is considered a Thtype disease        characterized by a higher ratio of IFN to IL   Our        finding that treatment with IL inhibits IFN suggests        that IL could mediate a shift from a Th to a Th        response         in vivo   In addition to the        effects of IL on antibody production this cytokine        inhibits Th responses including IFN and macrophage        production of proinflammatory cytokines    An        increase in inflammatory cytokine production in        ILdeficient mice may also contribute to exacerbation of        PGinduced arthritis In adjuvant arthritis which may not        be dependent on antibodies disease is increased in the        absence of IL   This finding suggests that IL        inhibits adjuvant arthritis by its antiinflammatory        properties and not by an alteration in isotype expression        Paradoxically in collageninduced arthritis CIA disease        is suppressed in ILdeficient mice   CIA is also        different from PGinduced arthritis in regard to IFN In        CIA and some other organspecific autoimmune diseases        IFN functions in a protective role so that in        IFNdeficient mice disease is exacerbated           Whether the difference between PGinduced arthritis and CIA        is due to the autoantigen or to genetic differences in        mouse strains is not clear at present                    Conclusion        Th and Th cytokines regulate PGspecific autoantibody        IgG isotypes and susceptibility to arthritis In the        absence of IL the production of PGspecific IgGa        isotype was dramatically enhanced and disease was        significantly more severe IL may exert its effect        through IFN since in IFNdeficient mice both the        PGspecific IgGa response and arthritis were suppressed        The correlation between PGspecific autoantibody isotype        and development of arthritis suggests a pathological role        for IgGa isotype in disease                    Abbreviations        CIA  collageninduced arthritis ELISA  enzymelinked        immunosorbent assay Th  T helper PG  proteoglycan IFN
