          well ill tell you why i feel so i feel strongly about this topic i dont know a whole lot about the immigration laws but i do know that in the where i live and i teach school there are so many Orientals that have come here and theres a lot of Mexican people too which is not neither here nor there but the fact is that all the Orientals that are here are very affluent uh very wise in money matters and have taken have taken over a lot of businesses and have really kind its kind of scary because theyre so bright theyre all the kids that i have that are Oriental are really far above the American kids and they and the the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up and money is their main goal and its kind it really is kind of scary because theres theres just oodles of them and you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by Orientals and its kind its kind of scares me not that i dont want them here and not that i dont appreciate the fact that you know that they have rights too but  on the other hand you feel like almost theyre theyre invading us to the point where theyre going to take over   right actually my son once said that that perhaps um what we should do is is buy a little square of land some place in the Midwest and and that might be the solution   i think probably thats a good idea because i lived in Iowa for about for about ten years before i came here and i was born in Ohio     uhhuh   so it it really and there is there are a lot of Mexican people here because were so close to the border and and they are wonderful people and and im not you know i dont want to deny them their rights just that you you feel like when you   umhum   were born and raised here and you worked real very hard to make this country what it is uh it scares you when you feel like somebodys taking over and a lot of these people plan one day to go back you know to to Vietnam or to you know Taiwan or wherever theyre from and take with them a lot of American dollars plus a lot of power in American companies companies companies and its kind of scary  and you know i dont know i dont know the immigration laws that uh that well and i do not and in fact i dont know them at all i dont know how many   umhum umhum   people they allow in the United States per year or if theres even a i dont even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore do you know anything about that   umhum no i dont i dont know i lived in the Middle East for sometime and i i do believe there must have been some sort of quota system because uh i know a lot of people that were in a sense not qualified is the wrong word but certainly were deserving to come and it seemed to take them a long time or or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come   umhum yeah   and so i would guess that you know there are quotas for different places   i would think so too it   uh you know i i i think theres something about being able to to claim um imminent danger or im not sure what the terminology is maybe political   uhhuh uhhuh   asylum yeah there there you go you got the term and maybe thats an an issue with a a lot of people i dont know   asylum of some sort umhum   but yeah i i guess i havent been in a situation where its its been threatening to to me uh   well well i teach in the suburb of Dallas and and uh my kids go to school in another suburb of Dallas and uh with very very good school systems and theyre considered you know one of the top three in the state both of them you know and it seems like a lot of the Orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools   umhum umhum   and theyre head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here and the kids in this area are very bright and come from you know parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and and uh very interested in their education but uh i think in the last year im not if im not mistaken in four of the six high schools the graduating class valedictorian and salutatorian were uh almost half or more Oriental   umhum umhum   and you know theyre just extremely bright kids and also they value learning   i was going to say im not sure i i would guess that its not that they are any brighter but they just maybe work harder or   well i i think things come easy for them too but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the United States i dont they uh dont want to work for anything they want it to come to them but and be there but they dont want to work hard and these kids work really hard and and they have   right right maybe but maybe part of thats the problem that here weve weve let this value slip   yeah i know i agree with that i agree with that   and they need to have some competition   but what i see is you the competition is there but instead of meeting the challenge theyre starting to resent them and its causing you know i think some some problems   umhum well thats too bad   it really is it because we see a lot of racial problems in Dallas the Dallas area anyway especially in Dallas and its mainly Black and and and Hispanic   umhum umhum umhum umhum   but uh there is some there has been some resentment with Orientals in the Black community because theyve started businesses there and the Blacks resent them coming in and taking their money and theres been some violence because of it   oh thats really sad   it is its it is very sad so you know i really i ive ive always prided myself on not being prejudice and being   umhum   you know um welcoming welcoming everyone that wants to come here and even when i was younger when when i was in college i was a member of the NAACP because i lived up north and i was very into that the human rights part of everything   umhum umhum   but i ive ive become very cynical in the last three four years living in Texas   umhum well and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change maybe the uh you know the there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to to allow for adequate melting into the society   umhum umhum well and exactly thats exactly true plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time two two three four maybe five years and then go back and pick our brains which is wonderful and take all that back with them and and uh plus a lot of American dollars but in in the long run maybe thats going to make a better world too you know you just dont know   right right exactly   and and yet you know with uh with uh theres somebody on my other line but im going to ignore that um   oh   anyway i just you you kind of you dont you really dont know what to do and and i dont i want my kids to have values where theyre accepting and so forth and both of my children   umhum   are really tolerant more tolerant of Blacks and Hispanics Hispanics than they are of the Orientals for some reason they feel you know like theyve taken over they feel like uh you know theyre taking some of the   hum   the rewards that they should have and and i really dont want that to happen but but its happening   right right right right   and i think a lot of their friends feel the same way too so   umhum umhum   and i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i  hi  i really do wish i i knew more about immigration laws because i have no idea any more because theyve changed a great deal   right i would i would suspect that they have well i guess um i dont have much  much more to contribute to the topic   yeah i dont i dont really either i wish i knew more and probably if i did i might be a little bit more uh tolerant   yeah umhum   perhaps and i and even if i i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from you dont know any of that and you feel you know you cant put yourself in their shoes or really understand them unless   umhum right   and for some reason Orientals are very uh my good friend calls them pushy but i call them very that they know what they want and they go get it and in stores and so forth   umhum goal directed   well pardon me  yeah but in stores and things sometimes they can be very impolite because they can they get in front of you or they   goal directle oh i see   um they take something that you had in mind to get before you did you know just going for it they take it quickly and uh they dont think anything of that and i dont you know thats makes people resentful too and   umhum sure sure   and yet they have they have a right to be here and i know that but its it sometimes its gets touchy   umhum umhum umhum   so and im sure its a lot different youre from Maryland you said what part of Maryland are you from   yes up in the Gaithersburg area   oh okay my sister used to live there in that area and i im sure that its a lot different there uh its a lot different in Iowa than in Iowa than it is here   umhum well no i think i think there as i recall in my sons class there were were an awful an awful lot of minorities minorities yeah and uh of all of all varieties and   is that right   with the same uh you know some of the some of the same problems that youve mentioned but um i dont know i guess i wasnt involved enough to to um really stop to think about it   umhum well i you know since i teach i see that see it and and i feel and i love the example that most of these children and give the our American children and yet you know i can see why some of the parents are fearful that are fearful too and and its a kind of a touchy situation   umhum umhum umhum   and i wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened but it doesnt happen that way all the time   exactly exactly right right   so anyway it was good to talk to to you too and have a good trip in California all right well thank you byebye   well it was good talking to you and i hope okay and have a good weekend all righty byebye
