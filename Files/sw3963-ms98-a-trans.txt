        im ready     okay have you returned anything lately   uh no i havent the only thing i had to i had to return was a table top but that was like three years ago of a dining room table that i got   hm   it was marked on the top of it so all they did was replace it   uh   but as far as um lawn mowers ive bought lawn mowers in the last three and a half years   umhum   and theyve been working fine my hedgers working fine my weedeaters working fine i havent really had to return anything you know except that table top that was marked   umhum hm now okay wait wait a there was a topic talking about returning lawn equipment or was it anything   no i said anything   oh okay       now okay um well i uh i returned a camera recently i i bought a little uh Minolta camera   oh you did uhhuh   and uh the auto focus was inconsistent sometimes it would focus and sometimes it wouldnt   huh   so uh after my second roll of film i i took two rolls before i got decided uh because i changed the first roll out before i had the first one developed   umhum   and after i got the first roll back i knew the camera wasnt it so i uh i took it back and returned it but most i dont know i havent had to return a lot of stuff   umhum well did did they give you any back any problem or they just give you a new one or what   well i took it back and i figured it was i dont know something like an auto focus i dont know i figured something inherent in the camera design or something   um   so i  because my dad has a has an auto focus camera and it works great and hes never had any problems in fact hes hes had a couple of them and this is a like a little small one you know and the new smaller cameras are like all mass produced and stuff   yeah right   so theyre not uh i think theyre more uh i would think there theres better quality control on those things you know just because theyre small and stamped and theres not very sophisticated   uhhuh   so i guess not call it quality control but you know since theyre so generic they wouldnt uh theres you know   umhum   i i my dad has a big sophisticated camera and it always takes good pictures so i just said well hell with it ill just go out and get a nice camera   yeah right umhum   but uh so i took it back and uh i bought a i bought a more expensive camera but you know i think when uh when i was in college i was always buying like just cheap stuff stuff that would make do and thats the kind of stuff i took back because you bring it home and youre like oh well this sucks you know   umhum umhum umhum yeah if you go and buy something really good usually it is its good you know   oh umhum umhum   and you dont ever anyhow ive havent ever had any problems in returning anything   yeah   that ive bought that i feel that you know was worth the money that you pay for it   umhum yeah and i think uh the way i was raised my parents always uh used to buy stuff that had a good quality name on it and you know they knew the quality of it before they bought it   umhum   so i dont know and i kind of do the same thing i guess so i havent had to return a lot if i had had to return it its more because i realize i didnt need it or you know not because its defective     umhum   but uh more because uh you know i have the option to take it back and i really didnt need it you know   umhum umhum   rather than you know something being broken   umhum umhum   but thats thats the only thing ive returned recently   yeah i ive been really lucky knock on wood you know like i say that i havent had to return anything except this this table when it came out   umhum   the top of it was marked and so all i did was replace the top of it you know   hm did they send you a new one or did they actually give you a new one at the store   they they gave me well no i didnt go to the store and get it they you know got with the manufacturer and then when it came in then they brought it out and then just took this table top off and replaced it with the other table top   umhum umhum yeah because i bought some furniture where the top was scratched and uh i just wrote a letter to the manufacturer well they they had a warranty sheet saying if you have any damage send this in   umhum umhum   so i sent it in and uh you know i didnt really think much the table like i said the table was just scratched on the top and uh   umhum   i didnt really it didnt really bother me because it was kind of small   umhum   but i went ahead and sent something in and uh three or four weeks later they sent me a brand new table top       and it came by truck   umhum   and uh i like it was probably more expensive to ship this thing than it cost me for the table top itself because uh it was eighty five dollars for shipping and the whole it was a like a computer table you know made with just like uh uh what do they call pressed board or whatever just pressed particle board   oh really uhhuh yeah with or with a veneer top or something like that probably yeah   right and uh the tole table was only like a hundred and ten bucks   uhhuh   and they spent eighty five dollars shipping this top back to me   oh for crying out loud   so i was kind of surprised i figured you know i sent that in maybe they would send me something back saying you know uh do you want to exchange it or bring it in or send it back or something like that   umhum umhum   but uh i couldnt believe they sent actually sent a brand new one and they no calls no letters nothing they just sent it to me   just sent it to you thats weird  youd think that they would have wrote a letter or at least a telephone call you know telling you that this is what was happening you know   yeah yeah definitely yeah yeah uh umhum umhum yeah but   but um you know but um   oh well but id say thats a kind of a short topic this time   yeah i was just i was just trying to think of um what else have i bought the only other thing that when we moved in this house it was a new house and the grate where you have your fireplace   umhum right
