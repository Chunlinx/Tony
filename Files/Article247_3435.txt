                                 Oldies but Goodies                        Dear Chris            Yes I loved the anecdote about Bob Dylans mishearing I cant hide as Iget high And youre right about how easy it is to get caught up in the soundand supply your own meanings Rock can be almost pure Keatsian negativecapability For weeks in  I thought the big Tears for Fears song wasEverybody Wants To Live Alone And for a good two decadesuntil about sixmonths ago in factI listened to one of my favorite Tom Waits songs I WishI Was in New Orleans In the Ninth Ward thinking the Ninth Ward was a wingof Bellevue rather than a neighborhood in New Orleans All this time Iknew what the Ninth Ward wasand the song is about New OrleansBut my Will to Narrative as Nietzsche might have called it was stronger thanmy ear            My favorite such story often told in the drugdimmed dorm rooms of myyouth was that Ralf Hutter of Kraftwerk wrote Wir fahren fahren fahrenauf der Autobahn after mishearing the Beach Boys Fun Fun Fun as Shellhave fahren fahren fahren till her daddy takes her TBird away Ihave always assumed it to be totally apocryphal On the other hand it makesperfect sense            The Dylan anecdote reminds me that the book is chockablock with excellenttidbitssome familiar most notand it would be unfair to let the week passwithout sharing a few favorites                           Carl Perkins wrote Blue Suede Shoes never having seen the word suede inprint Blue Swaed Shoes he called it               Listen to the mere stage names of the overproduced Liverpudlian rock studswho preceded the Beatles Tommy Steele Marty Wilde Billy Fury RoryStorm               Dick Clark had no particular interest in the rock he was promoting or inmusic whatsoever When shortly before appearing on Edward R MurrowsPerson to Person  he was told that Murrow would want to ask about arecord collection he had to borrow one He didnt have a recordcollection                        Im still trying to figure out what Miller means when he talks about rock asa force for nostalgia Im convinced that this is largely a personal projectTheres much in the elegiac tone of this book that reminds me of PhilipLarkins collection All What Jazz Larkin to whom jazz meanteverything you could hear in wardepleted Oxfordbasically Kid Ory and BixBeiderbecke and King Oliverwas turned loose as contemporary jazzcritic for the Daily Telegraph a quartercentury later having notlistened to any jazz in the interim He heard a lot of Mingus and Coltrane andMonk and threw up his hands as if to say Whats this crap            While Miller cant write like Larkin his nostalgia project is a moreresponsible one He gives us a history of the term oldies but goodies andmentions In the Still of the Night scarcely noticed when it came out in but by  a staple of the oldies circuit In my own life I remember AlGreen as a serious but secondary musician in the mids if the airtime onoldies stations is any indication of his ultimate stature hes one of thegiants Similarly I remember that on the Pretenders debut album Talk of theTown and Stop Your Sobbing got the most playbut only on alternativestations The album didnt have any hits Today no matter what town yourelistening to the Classic Rock station in its Brass in Pocketmaybe theedgiest least mainstream thing on the whole albumthat gets all theairplay            Ahem  after writing that sentence I looked in a rock reference book andfound that Brass in Pocket hit No  stateside But I think Ill leave itas evidence that its my memory thats failing Perhaps rock history islike retrospective politics If you poll people on how they voted in  percent say they backed Kennedy even though Nixon got  percent of the voteAnd if you ask people what they were listening to in the midtolate stheyll tell you Oh you know  a lot of Velvet Underground a lot ofHendrix            But I dont believe it            BestChris
