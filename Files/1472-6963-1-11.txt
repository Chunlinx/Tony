                    Background        Over  million elderly Americans are enrolled in the        Medicare health insurance program Since  the Health        Care Financing Administration has offered a managed care        option with capitated payment to Medicare enrollees        Currently nearly  of Medicare enrollees are members of        managed care plans nationwide           The economic incentives of capitated payment have raised        concerns that managed care organizations that use        capitation might limit provision of effective services as a        way of trimming costs       Public concerns about        restriction of service in managed care organizations have        led to proposed legislation for a patients bill of        rights    once again being considered in the US        Senate    It is becoming clear however that managed        care is not a single entity and that a wide range of        economic incentives and disincentives may be created in        various forms of managed care    each likely to have        different kinds of influence on clinician behavior             The proximity of risk to the clinician or clinician        group has an especially strong effect on behavior           Systems maintained by managed care organizations to assist        clinicians in providing quality care also differ widely        and may strongly influence performance        Although reduced access to care is a theoretical risk of        capitated payment relatively few studies have addressed        whether this concern is borne out in practice Perhaps        because of the variation in managed care arrangements the        results of studies have been mixed    If managed care        presents barriers to access to effective care the elderly        would be especially vulnerable because they have a higher        burden of illness than the rest of the population We        therefore created indicators in several domains for which        it was known that care improved outcomes We then used        these indicators to compare health care received by elderly        Medicare beneficiaries in three kinds of payment        arrangements a capitated staffmodel health maintenance        organization HMO and a partially capitated groupmodel        HMO both parts of the same managed care organization and        in feeforservice FFS care in the same geographic        area                    Methods                  Study site                      Staff model HMO            The Staff Model division of HPHC provided primary            carebased multispecialty care The organization has            cared for aged Medicare patients in risk and other            commercial plans since the mids All primary care            providers were salaried and there were no specific            economic incentives ie no bonuses of any kind for            individual providers during the study period            Information on all ambulatory services including            visits diagnoses procedures and tests was maintained            electronically for all members as part of an Automated            Medical Record System AMRS    These data have            been used in previous studies      The Staff            Model HMO contracted with area hospitals for inpatient            services For hospitalization and other outside            utilization the HMO maintains claims data using ICD            codes this data structure contains up to six diagnoses            and up to  surgical procedures per claim                                Group model HMO            The Group Model division of HPHC included  medical            groups in  that contracted with the HMO on a            nonexclusive basis ie they were exclusive with            regard to other managed care plans but not with            respect to indemnity insurance Most were primary care            groups but a small number were multispecialty groups            Payment of groups was based on various forms of            capitation the most common arrangement was for groups            to be capitated for both primary and specialty            outpatient care and for hospitalization risk to be            shared in a wider pool Capitation rates and details            such as losslimit provisions varied from group to            group Almost all groups comprised between  and             physicians            Data from the Group Model were obtained from claims            that were submitted to the HMO to document care for            calculations pertinent to losslimit provisions even            though payments were not based on the claims            themselves Data files contained information on            services provided in the offices of the primary care            clinicians on outpatient services not provided by the            primary care provider ie referrals and on            hospitalizations Diagnoses and procedures were coded            using ICD and CPT codes            Demographic and insurance coverage information on            members in the study were obtained from HMO enrollment            files                                Feeforservice            Medicare beneficiaries were included in this study            if they were age  and older as of January              had both Part A and B coverage for at least             consecutive months during  and  were not            enrolled in an HMO during these  consecutive months            and resided within the HMO catchment area see            below            We matched Medicare members enrolled in the HMO with            those in feeforservice by area of residence First            we constructed a list of the zip codes in which            eligible HMO members resided during the study period            We constructed a list of Medicare feeforservice            beneficiaries residing in the comparison area            consisting of all contiguous zip codes in which at            least one HMO Medicare beneficiary resided The            resulting sample included  people            Data for the feeforservice sample were obtained            from an enrollment file for demographic information            the MedPAR Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file            for hospitalization claim data Part B            physiciansupplier claims file and Hospital Outpatient            Department claims file                                    Performance indicators          We developed performance measures that met several or          all of the following criteria the disease or condition          was relatively common and potentially severe a clinical          service that could affect the health outcome of the          patient was identifiable the performance of the          indicated service depended in part on the role of a          physician or health system and not only on the patient          service performance was potentially subject to financial          incentives it was possible from other research to assume          that the indicated service would on average improve          outcome and data to construct the indicator were          currently or potentially available          Our indicators assessed access to health care in three          domains Table             preventive care including services          that provide future not current benefit            diagnosisspecific care examining          treatment for acute conditions or episodes of disease          and            chronic disease care including          secondary prevention The selection of preventive care          indicators was guided by the generic applicability of          these maneuvers in this age group making it unnecessary          to define a special population for whom the procedure          would be indicated The indicators of timely followup          after hospitalization diagnosisspecific care were          selected based on the seriousness of the medical          conditions    the time interval between hospital          discharge and outpatient visit were determined by a panel          of physicians          A panel of national experts in access to quality          health care convened by the Health Care Financing          Administration in March of  suggested additions to          our original indicator set We then selected those that          best met the structured evaluation criteria including at          least two indicators in each of the domains Table shows          the indicators organized by domains More complete          definitions of inclusion criteria and coding including          specific AMRS ICD and CPT codes used have been          published elsewhere    and are summarized in          Additional fileIndicator Definitions                          Statistical analyses          We compared the three samples by age category using          the chisquare test For annual indicators we averaged          utilization rates for  and  the denominators          were individuals eligible for each calendar year We          calculated rates in three age strata age            and  years and older We also calculated ageadjusted          rates standardized to the feeforservice sample          Analyses were performed using SAS    We conducted          twoway comparisons of ageadjusted rates across the          three samples Staff Model Group Model and          feeforservice using the chisquare test                            Results        Demographic characteristics of the study subjects are        shown in Table  The FFS population in the region under        study was older than the nationwide Medicare population        and a slightly larger proportion was female  versus         p   Those enrolled in the HMO were younger        than both the geographically matched feeforservice        sample and Medicare enrollees in the US as a whole p          and they were less likely to be female p                Ageadjusted rates of breast cancer screening with        mammography were substantially higher in the two HMO        settings than under feeforservice insurance Table         Mammography screening rates in the Staff Model were nearly        double those in the FFS sample The proportion of Medicare        enrollees who saw a clinician within a oneyear period        Annual visit rate Table  was greater than  in all        three groups however this rate was significantly higher        in the Staff Model HMO  than the feeforservice        sample p          Proportion with follow up by either a primary care        physician or cardiologist within  days of hospital        discharge after myocardial infarction Table  was similar        in the two managed care divisions and in both cases        higher than under feeforservice insurance  and  in        the Staff and Group Model respectively compared to  in        FFS p   Follow up within  days after        hospitalization for depression was highest in the Group        Model HMO although small sample size limited our ability        to find statistically significant differences p                 Care of chronic diseases is summarized in Table         Screening rates for diabetic retinopathy were higher in        both divisions of the managed care organization than in the        feeforservice sample The proportion of diabetics with         or more visits was  higher in managed care than in        feeforservice  and  in the Staff and Group Model        respectively versus  in FFS p                      Discussion        We developed a set of indicators of access to effective        care for elderly people insured by Medicare designed to fit        varying clinical settings insurance structures and data        systems In general performance in both the Staff and        Group Model divisions of the managed care plan studied was        equivalent to or better than that in the feeforservice        sector Other investigators have devised administrative        claimsbased indicators     and chart reviewbased        indicators for hospitals    and ambulatory care sites           in efforts to compare hospital performance or health        plan performance In contrast we explored the feasibility        of using data elements available in an automated outpatient        medical record which are increasingly prevalent in        addition to those available in claims databases The        indicators we selected overlap with those chosen to be        included in the Health Plan Employer Data and Information        Set HEDIS for the Medicare population released in         which also evaluates breast cancer screening and retinal        screening for diabetics           Previous studies comparing performance indicators across        insurance types have found inconsistent results HMO        performance on preventive services is consistently higher        than in FFS settings      On the other hand some        studies findings have raised a concern that vulnerable        populations such as the chronically ill    and the        elderly    fare less well in HMOs than in FFS care In        the Medicare population data to support concern about        worse outcomes of care in HMOs has come from a national        telephone survey about persistence of symptoms           In numerous other investigations however care for the        Medicare population provided by HMOs has been shown to be        comparable to that in FFS No differences between HMO and        FFS samples were found in studies of care for colon cancer             breast cancer     prostate cancer           cardiovascular disease    rheumatoid arthritis           congestive heart failure    hypertension    acute        myocardial infarction    acute appendicitis           and stroke    One study found that functional status        did not decline faster among Medicare recipients enrolled        in HMOs versus those in FFS    Our findings are        consonant with these previous studies for example a        higher rate of mammography screening as seen in our managed        care population could explain the trend to earlier stage        breast cancers seen in California among HMO enrollees        compared to FFS        While most of previous        work focussed on specific disease entities we studied the        general Medicare population and measured indicators        applicable to all enrollees as well as indicators focussed        on specific diseasepopulations        There are few studies of the effect of managed care        structure eg Group vs Staff vs IPA models on        indicators of quality care     These models differ        both in the extent to which financial risk is attached to        individual providers and also the degree to which        providers are effectively formed into an organized system        of care For example some of the differences seen in our        study between the Group and Staff Model were probably due        to organizational processes and systems in place in the        Staff Model such as physician reminder systems for        preventive services leading to higher rates of breast        cancer screening        This study has several strengths We included a large        number of Medicare enrollees covered by the health plan        studied and the universe of feeforservice Medicare        enrollees in the same geographic region Matching by region        reduces the variation that may have affected some previous        comparisons of FFS and HMO populations in which national        samples were used    This method also automatically        accounts for any spillover effect of managed care        practices onto feefor service practice wherein        costsaving techniques are applied widely by providers        even to those with feeforservice insurance in a market        with high penetration of managed care insurance    In        contrast to studies that focus on inpatient data in part        because of their ready availability    our focus on        outpatient care is highly relevant to comparisons of        managed care with feeforservice care    in terms of        ambulatory practices that may prevent hospitalizations Our        work on the time period  follows the transformations        in managed care in  and thus can been seen as an        update to previous studies of the topic           Our study also has limitations People enrolling in        managed care organizations may be systematically different        from those choosing feeforservice arrangements           For example patients who are sicker or more disabled may        not enroll    or may differentially choose to leave        managed care    Those who do enroll could be more        aggressive in seeking care We know that a smaller        proportion of HMO enrollees were over the age of  years        compared to the matched feeforservice sample        Differential enrollment could influence our results if        patients with higher degrees of comorbid conditions        preferentially enrolled in the feefor service system and        did not participate in cancer screening or secondary        diabetic prevention because of their other illnesses           In addition the annual visit rate could potentially be        overestimated in the HMO population if an influx of new        patients and a new enrollee effect were to cause more        patients to come in for visits than otherwise would        Another potentially important limitation is that different        data systems created for different purposes such as claims        and clinical databases may not provide comparable results        even for strictly defined indicators            The use of performance indicators to compare care        provided in different settings usually requires expensive        data gathering Indicators based on automated data systems        offer partial relief to this problem Our findings related        to staff model and group model HMO types should be        replicated in other settings and extended to other types        of managed care While the staff model HMO share of the        market is shrinking group and network model health        maintenance organizations are experiencing increased        enrollment Our finding of concordance on many indicators        between the Group and Staff Model divisions suggests that a        less tightly organized provider system may perform as well        as a staff model HMO Neither of the HMO divisions studied        resembles an independent practice association IPA model        so our findings may not apply to that form of provider        organization In addition we studied only one managed care        organization one that is well established and exists in a        region of the country with high level access to specialty        services The generalizability of our findings to other        managed care populations is unknown Furthermore the        single HMO studied is a notfor profit organization and        our findings might not be applicable to forprofit        entities                       Conclusions        In conclusion we believe that the indicators we have        tested are feasible to implement in other managed care        systems and could be translated into other electronic        medical record systems Indicators such as these might be        useful for consumers in comparing health plans to one        another such as those participating in MedicareChoice We        found no evidence of any decrement in access to health care        for the elderly Medicare population enrolled in one managed        care plan in this geographic region The low or no cost        supplemental insurance provided by many HMOs may in fact        lower financial barriers to care for lowincome seniors        Our study describes only two models of managed care and        this is a crude classification by current standards Yet to        be studied are the effects of financial incentives on        increasingly smaller units of leverage eg small IPA        model groups and the effectiveness of managed care plans        that use sophisticated information systems to track and        improve care as compared to those that use principally        financial incentives     The latter is crucial to        understanding how best to create a partnership between        providers and health plans that facilitates the provision        of excellent care                    Competing interests        None declared
