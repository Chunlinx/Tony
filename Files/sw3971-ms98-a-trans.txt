              all right   okay so what do you think of the Giants   uh i like the Giants they got uh i probably didnt get into baseball until maybe maybe four three years ago really   yeah   so uh but i i i just like the Giants i dont i dont know why i really got into them i read uh Dave Drevekis book his autobiography and   oh yeah yeah wasnt that something of him   yeah that that was incredible   yeah thats really a really proud of him though the way hes you know   the way he handled that entire situation yeah   yeah really you know   but i just think the Giants have a good team they they got all you know theyre theyre real theyre real balanced out they got real good pitching and they got the hitting to go along with it so   yeah i just dont understand why theyre not right up there on the top you know   yeah they just they need that i think they just need that one one element to push them over the top you know i dont really know what it is but but every team thats thats really good seems you know like the As had they had they just had it all that one year so   umhum yeah um i was mostly an As fan you know i had been to more games at the As than i have in the Giants   yeah   because uh i lived in Oakland you know for some time   yeah   but uh i still like the Giants though you know   yeah if you if youre a fan you got to stay with your team any way you know you good and the bad but   yeah right yeah   its its kind of hard i still well basically the the me and all my friends around here since we dont have anywhere i mean we can go to the Astros or the Rangers teams but since none me or none of me and my friends are really really like either one of those teams so we uh   umhum   about the about the most most baseball we get is either TV or we play it on Nintendo we play RBI baseball on Nintendo so so thats just you know thats small town trying to make it through the   yeah right right   through the lull not being around it really but   yeah yeah right well i prefer baseball uh football over baseball but uh   yeah yeah so do i but baseball is still   yeah its   you got you got to do something when football aint on so   so add hot dogs baseball and apple pie huh   yeah exactly this this is America so   yeah um so what do you thinks gonna happen this year to the teams   uh but uh i dont know its hard to say i havent really really you have to just keep up with everything in the off season its kind of hard to do at least you know you have to read the paper and   i know   Sports Illustrated and everything to keep up with who they traded and who they picked up and and all that but like i say if they can if they can get that one element that they were missing i think the Giants can do it   yeah well the Giants yeah   they just i dont you i dont really know about the As i dont like the As uh matter of fact i cant stand the Oakland As just because they have that you know theyve got their       Jose Canseco and and all the attitude that goes along with that you know the kind of   yeah makes you sick doesnt it   yeah you hear what you hear did you hear what he did he ramming his car wifes car and i i was like yeah see thats just     yes   hes like a little bitty kid huh   yeah hes just a a a little boy with a lot of money so thats just you know but   yeah yeah well i guess the Giants or might move away from San Francisco it sounds like     yeah ive heard ive heard talk about that   you know uh they wont be that far away but San Francisco itll be hurting anyhow   yeah theyre not gonna be happy about it   you know   but i hope they can do good i mean thats just i think theyre a good team that just need that one one little thing to push them over i dont know exactly what it is they got theyre pretty balanced out all the way through it just might be the drive you know more than anything else they just they probably just need something to push them   umhum umhum umhum   because i thats thats the only thing i can see thats holding them back is the ambition to do it or somebody basically maybe they just need everybody to tell them they cant do it maybe thats what you know thats what some teams need look at the Twins going from worst to first so   i know isnt that something you couldnt believe that huh   yeah my roommates a my roommates a Twins fan forever forever so he had his year this year so   yeah i just it   we we got quite preoccupied we we got into that a whole bunch that was a that was a series to remember for sure   uhhuh uhhuh umhum   so i saw all seven games of that so that was definitely worth watching   umhum yeah yeah i couldnt believe that you know i dont uh there was Braves in that chanting that they have that would drive you up a wall   yeah yeah they every every every team with the Indians been doing that now and it and it i cant figure out why ive yet to figure out why theyre all doing that im like it doesnt work its obvious it doesnt work because the you know the Braves     you know God yeah well youre right   the Braves didnt win so uh why why keep on doing something that didnt work but   yeah yeah yeah   i dont know i was i was kind of surprised that  were gonna talk about baseball and i get a womans voice i was i was i was thinking uhhuh i talked to a guy named Vinny last night about fixing your car so     oh really   yeah i got i called got a call the other night about about fixing your automobile up so   umhum umhum   but well baseball baseball its its kind of i dont know its kind of odd that theyd do you pick the topic or does the computer   yeah right no uh they give you a list of things that you want to talk
