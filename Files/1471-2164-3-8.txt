                    Introduction        Homologous DNA recombination is a fundamental process in        the biochemistry of DNA repair and replication which        contributes to the generation of the genetic diversity        critical for natural selection An important step in the        recombination process is the pairing of homologous        doublestranded DNAs followed by the exchange of DNA        strands between the paired molecules Experimental studies        have shown that members of the archetypal RecA family of        recombinases are central to this reaction in all extant        forms of life             Studies in         Escherichia coli have shown that        although RecA is the principle protein involved in pairing        and strand exchange unrelated proteins that have a much        more restrictive phyletic distribution can also promote        similar reactions in a RecA dependent or RecAindependent        manner     These alternative or additional mediators of        homologous recombination include the wellcharacterized        prophage RecT phage  Red and phage P ERF proteins             Similarly in yeast and vertebrates the RAD        protein is involved in the pairing and strand exchange        reaction and can promote recombination in a RAD the        eukaryotic RecA homologdependent or independent manner            The RecT protein works in conjunction with the        RecEnuclease    and was initially described in genetic        studies on the complemention of mutations in the RecBCD        pathway of DNA repair       Biochemically RecT has        been shown to bind singlestranded ss DNA  overhang        regions generated by the RecE nuclease and promote strand        exchange between homologous DNA partners by assisting the        pairing of complementary singlestranded regions             The reaction catalyzed by the RecTRecE system is similar        to that described for the phage  exonuclease exoRed        and the singlestrand annealing protein Red The        similarity between these two systems is further extended by        the observation that the RecTE system can complement        mutations in the  exoRed system      In        eukaryotes RAD protein has been shown to exhibit        properties similar to those of RecT and Red proteins it        binds ssDNA and promotes strand exchange via the pairing of        complementary single strands              In vitro studies on quaternary        structures have shown that the single strand annealing        proteins SSAPs RecT Red ERF and RAD form similar        helical superstructures        This has led to        the proposal that RecT Red ERF and the eukaryotic RAD        function in an analogous fashion and even are structural        homologs            However no sequence or secondary structural        similarities have been noticed between different SSAPs and        current understanding of their evolutionary history and        phyletic range remains poor Here we describe the results        of an indepth sequence analysis of these proteins and        delineate their evolutionary relationships and phyletic        horizon in available genomes We show that in spite of the        functional similarities and the similar quaternary        structures there are three distinct superfamilies of        SSAPs namely the RecTRed RAD and ERF that appear to        be evolutionarily unrelated to each other These        superfamilies show a wide distribution in viral and        cellular genomes but appear to have originally evolved in        large DNA bacteriophages Through an analysis of the        contextual information provided by the predicted operons        in which the SSAPs occur we predict several previously        undetected functional connections of these proteins which        might shed new light on the corresponding DNA        repairrecombination pathways                    Results                  RecT and Red are evolutionarily related and define          a widespread family of DNA recombination proteins          Several lines of evidence including genetic analyses          and similarities in biochemistry and quaternary          structures suggest that the           E coli RecT and phage  Red          proteins are functionally equivalent as mediators of          singlestrand exchange in DNA recombination               However no sequence similarity has been detected between          these proteins leaving their actual evolutionary          relationships unresolved In order to gain a better          understanding of their functions and origins we          undertook a detailed sequence analysis of these two          proteins using iterative sequence profile searches with          the PSIBLAST program with a inclusion threshold of           iterated until convergence Such searches with Red          proteins from different lambdoid bacteriophages as          queries retrieved not only other obvious Red homologs          but also the RecT protein family For example searches          initiated with the Red homolog PF protein Genbank          gi  amino acids  to  from           Borrelia hermsii     detected          the           E coli RecT protein in the           thiteration with significant expectation e values              Subsequent iterations retrieved several more          RecTrelated proteins from diverse sources Further          transitive searches with the proteins detected in the          above searches resulted in the identification of more          divergent homologs such as a protein termed the          enterohemolysin associated protein EHAP from           E coli    and its orthologs in                    Salmonella Fig  An examination          of the pairwise alignments generated by these searches          showed that all these proteins shared a characteristic          set of residues including two highly conserved aromatic          residues at the N and Ctermini respectively and two          consecutive acidic residues near the Cterminus These          observations strongly suggested that RecT and Red along          with several other proteins could be unified into a          single protein superfamily with a core conserved domain          of approximately  amino acid residues          A multiple alignment of all members of the RecTRed          superfamily was generated using the Tcoffee program          followed by adjustments based on the PSIBLAST search          results This alignment was used to predict their          secondary structure using the JPRED and PHD methods          these predictions pointed to an    domain with a core          of five strands and five helices Fig  Some of          the strongest conservation is concentrated in the long          helices and the pattern includes some charged or polar          residues suggesting that they are probably exposed and          participate in the proteinprotein and proteinDNA          interactions that are typical of this superfamily          helices   in Fig  The conserved regularly          spaced hydrophobic residues in the RecTRed superfamily          are predicted to be buried allowing these domains to          assume a globular structure Experimental studies have          shown that the strand transfer reaction mediated by RecT          and its binding to dsDNA are sensitive to Mg          concentrations and it was proposed that the levels of          free Mg could regulate RecT activity     Similarly          Red has been shown to promote single strand annealing in          a Mg dependent manner     In this context the          conservation of the two Cterminal acidic residues in the          majority of members of this superfamily suggests that          these might be involved in the coordination of Mg and          implies that the metal iondependent conformational          switching is likely to be a generic feature of this          family          Phylogenetic analyses of the RecTRed superfamily          using the least squares and maximum likelihood methods          distinguished three distinct groups namely the          RecTlike the Redlike and the EHAPlike families          Fig  Previously the RecT proteins have been known          from very few bacteria and Red has only been detected in           and closely related phages However we showed that the          Red family is widespread in bacteria such as           Borrelia hermsii Xylella Ureaplasma          Listeria Streptococcus pyogenes Mesorhizobium          loti The RecT family is predominantly seen in the          lowGC Grampositive bacteria such as           Bacillus Streptococcus Lactococcus          and Listeria and their phages Fig            E coli and           Legionella pneumophila are the only          two proteobacteria that possess this protein          suggesting that they might have acquired RecT via a          relatively recent horizontal transfer from Grampositive          bacteria The sporadic distribution of the RecT and Red          family proteins in bacterial genomes and their presence          in phages suggest that these proteins ultimately are of          phage origin and have been coopted by the bacterial DNA          recombinationrepair systems Consistent with this          practically all the bacterial members of these families          appear to belong to prophages or their remnants as they          are mostly in the neighborhood of what appear to be          clearly phagederived genes The EHAPlike family is          extremely divergent and represented thus far only in           E coli and the closely related           Salmonella Practically all members          of the RecTRed superfamily are singledomain proteins          showing extended similarity to each other throughout          their globular regions The only exceptions are the           E coli EHAP and the PF protein          encoded in the           Borrelia hermsii circular plasmid          which are fused to Cterminal fragments of the ERF          protein see below                          ERF defines a superfamily of SSAPs that are          evolutionarily distinct from the RecTRed super          family          The ERF protein of phage P is involved in the          circularization of the linear dsDNA phage genome upon          entry into the host cell       Experimental          studies have shown that mutations in ERF are          complemented by Red and that           in vitro ERF adopts quaternary          structures analogous to those of Red and RecT                 However in the comprehensive analysis of the          RecTRed superfamily no statistically significant          similarity could be detected between these proteins and          the ERF proteins To explore the evolutionary affinities          of the ERF domains we carried out a sequence profile          analysis as described above for the RecT case using          transitive PSIBLAST analysis As a result of these          searches homologs of ERF encoded in several bacterial          and phage genomes from diverse taxa were identified The          alignments generated in these searches consistently          pointed to a region of approximately  amino acids that          is conserved in all these proteins with a characteristic          motif of the form GuXXoYhp  YXhXXhh where G is          glycine Ytyrosine u is a tiny residue hhydrophobic          p is a polar residue o is an alcohol residue  is a          basic residue and X is any residue Fig  This          suggested that ERF was the prototype of a family of          conserved bacterial domains          Secondary structure prediction based on the multiple          alignment of the ERF domain suggests a globular             fold with five helices and three or four strands Fig           The abovementioned motif that is typical of this          family is associated with helix  of this domain given          the presence of conserved basic residues it may be          critical for DNAbinding and strandtransfer activity of          the ERFlike proteins Additionally in the loop between          helices  and  of the ERF domain there is a universally          conserved acidic motif of the form DXD Analogous to the          RecT superfamily this acidic dyad might coordinate a          divalent cation and undergo a conformational change          dependent on metalbinding However the average size of          the core domains the patterns of conserved residues and          the predicted secondary structures of the RecTRed and          ERF domains show no correspondence to each other          implying that there is no direct evolutionary link          between these protein groups          ERF homologs are encoded by the genomes of several          temperate phages of Grampositive bacteria and          proteobacteria additionally we detected members of          this superfamily in           Listeria and in all the circular          plasmids and one linear plasmid of           Borrelia burgdorferi Fig           Thus like the RecTRed superfamily the ERF family is          likely to have emerged in the temperate phages and was          disseminated to the           Borrelia circular plasmids and some          bacterial genomes via prophages                          Detection of bacterial homologs of RAD and          identification of an aberrant HhH domain in these          proteins          The bakers yeast protein RAD and its paralog RAD          define a small family of proteins thus far represented in          fungi vertebrates and the earlybranching ameboid          eukaryote           Entamoeba histolytica Rad          functions in conjunction with the RecA ortholog the          RAD recombinase in doublestrand break repair and          meiotic recombination     RAD binds ssDNA during          recombination and also shows a quaternary organization          similar to those of RecTRed and ERF               However RADlike proteins showed no detectable          sequence similarity with either the ERF or the          RecTRedlike proteins Sequence searches initiated with          the conserved globular region of the eukaryotic RAD          proteins readily detected their homologs from other          eukaryotes and at convergence also retrieved from the          database certain bacterial proteins such as DR from           Deinococcus and CAC from           Clostridium respectively with          borderlike statistical significance e   These          bacterial proteins form a small family that is          additionally represented in           Salmonella paratyphi A the          temperate bacteriophage u of           Lactococcus lactis ORFencoded          protein and a Shiga toxinconverting phage from           E coli  Iterative profile          searches initiated with CAC from           Clostridium acetobutylicum and its           S paratyphi A ortholog          correspondingly retrieved           S cerevisiae RAD and its          eukaryotic homologs with borderline evalues at          convergence  The alignment between these          bacterial proteins and the eukaryotic Rad homologs was          colinear throughout the entire length of their shared          globular region and the Gibbs sampling procedure detected          two motifs of greater than  residues with a          probability of chance occurrence in these proteins less          than  Fig  In addition to the similar          conservation pattern separate secondary structure          predictions for both the eukaryotic RAD family and          their potential bacterial homologs showed a complete          concordance of the predicted structural elements between          RAD and the bacterial proteins strongly suggesting          that they all belong to a single homologous superfamily          hereinafter the RAD superfamily          The secondary structure predictions showed that the          Rad superfamily proteins adopt a structure with          interspersed helices and strands Fig           Additionally fold predictions using DPSSM          Evalue corresponding to a  confidence in the          prediction and the hybrid fold method Zscore            predicted the presence of a potential HelixhairpinHelix          HhH fold in members of the RAD superfamily The HhH          domain is a small nucleic acidbinding module comprised          of two helices joined by a central loop hairpin which          functions as the DNAbinding moiety of numerous repair          and recombination proteins      Two HhH modules          are predicted in the core conserved domain of the RAD          family the first one bounded by the predicted helices           and  and the second one bounded by helices  and           Fig  Although these predicted HhH modules are very          divergent in sequence from the typical versions the          hairpin in both HhH modules of the RAD family proteins          is bounded by small residues typically glycine this          conforms to the signature motif characteristic of the          classical HhH modules      However in the case of          the RAD superfamily the predicted HhH modules appear to          have been welded into a large globular superstructure          that maintained its evolutionary distinctness over time          The conservation pattern and predicted structural          elements of the RAD superfamily are distinct from those          predicted for the ERF and RecTRed superfamilies Fig             supporting the lack of a direct evolutionary          relationship between these proteins          The RAD superfamily shows a sporadic phyletic          distribution and even in the crowngroup eukaryotes          might have been secondarily lost in certain lineages          such as plants nematodes and insects The sporadic          distribution of this family among phylogenetically          distant bacteria along with its presence in several          prophages suggests that like the RecTRed and ERF          superfamilies at least the bacterial RADproteins          might be of predominantly phage origin The core of the          eukaryotic recombination system appears to have been          inherited from the system present in the common ancestor          shared with the archaea     However RAD is thus          far absent in all archaeal genomes and is restricted to a          single orthologous group in the eukaryotes     Thus          it appears plausible that eukaryotic RAD was ultimately          derived through lateral transfer either from a bacterial          genome or directly from a viral source at a point at          least predating the divergence of the crown group          eukaryotes and           Entamoeba                           Contextual information from gene neighborhoods          provides details regarding functional interactions of the          SSAPs with DNA recombination pathways          The clustering of functionally related genes in          prokaryotic genomes into cotranscribed and coregulated          units operons often allows functional assignments          through the principle of guilt by association                Generally genes whose products physically          interact to form a complex or are involved in successive          steps in a biochemical pathway form operons that are          conserved over large evolutionary distances     On          previous occasions we have used gene neighborhoods or          operons to predict novel DNA repair complexes and their          components     Accordingly a similar approach was          applied to the three families of SSAPs RecTRed ERF          Rad to shed light on their functional links          Notably the genes encoding the three evolutionarily          distinct SSAPs cooccurred with similar sets of DNA          repairrecombinationrelated proteins Figs   In at          least one case each of them was found adjacent to the          gene for the singlestrandbinding protein SSB an          OBfold protein that binds ssDNA Figs   This          association ties in with the function of the SSAPs in          singlestrand annealing suggesting that they closely          interact with SSB It has been suggested in the case of          RecT that it may compete with SSB for binding single          strand overhangs and thereby make them available for the          annealing process     Similar interactions between          other SSAPs and SSB that probably coats the ssDNA          generated by nucleases appear likely Genes for SSAPs          from all the  distinct superfamilies may also occur          adjacent to or in the vicinity of genes encoding          nucleases or Holliday junction resolvases HJRs Genes          for RecTRed superfamily proteins are associated with          genes encoding a type exonuclease LE of the type II          restriction enzyme fold RecE which also might be a          divergent member of this fold and a nuclease of the          Endonuclease VII EndoVII fold     Fig  The          ERF superfamily genes are associated with a RusA          superfamily nucleaseHJR and EndoVII fold nucleases Fig               Furthermore the           Borrelia plasmids that encode ERF          also almost always additionally encode a type          exonuclease even if it is not the adjacent gene In a          single instance in the Grampositive bacterium           Ruminococcus albus the gene          encoding a RAD superfamily protein occurs adjacent to a          gene for a type exonuclease These nucleases probably          contribute to the repair process in which SSAPs are          involved by providing the initial break in the dsDNA          andor in digesting the nicked target to generate          ssDNA          The RecT and Red family proteins often cooccur with          the SbcC gene that encodes an ABC ATPase with a large          coiledcoil segment These proteins are known to          cooperate with SbcD nuclease of the calcineurinlike          phosphoesterase superfamily and to degrade dsDNA in the             direction generating ssDNA      It seems          likely that RecTRed proteins at least in certain          cases function in conjunction with the SbcCDpathway by          utilizing the singlestranded regions generated by the          SbcCD nuclease Additionally several genes whose          functions are less clear tend to cooccur with the genes          coding for the SSAPs These include DNA          methyltransferases and the primosomal protein DnaD from          lowGC Grampositive bacteria    that cooccur with          both ERF and RecT superfamily members Figs   The          poorly characterized phageor prophagespecific genes          that are frequently observed in these neighborhoods          include ORF            Streptococcus          thermophilus bacteriophage  ORF ORFa            Staphylococcus aureus temperate          phage SLT and ORF bacteriophage  Figs            Secondary structure predictions indicate a high          helical content for these proteins It is likely that          these helical proteins are phage innovations that could          function as adaptors in the recombination pathway either          as accessory proteinprotein interacting domains or as          DNAbinding domains                          Evidence for convergent operon evolution and in          situ nonorthologous displacement of genes in operons          encoding SSAPs          A superposition of the gene neighborhood information          upon the phylogenetic trees for the SSAP superfamilies          provides insights into the evolutionary processes that          led to the emergence of the operons that include the SSAP          genes As discussed above the RecTRed superfamily          clearly splits into three distinct families Fig  The          phylogenetic tree shows that SbcC cooccurs with the SSAP          once within Redfamily and once within the RecTfamily          An examination of the tree and the respective gene          neighborhoods suggests that independent juxtaposition of          SbcC with Redlike and RecTlike genes on two separate          occasions is the most parsimonious explanation The          alternative explanation namely that the gene coding for          the common ancestor of the Red and RecT already          cooccurred with the           sbcC gene is far less likely          because it would require over  independent losses of          this apparently functionally advantageous organization          in different bacterial and bacteriophage lineages          Likewise the observation that in one or more cases          genes encoding each of the SSAPs cooccur in the same          predicted operon with SSB or a type exonuclease          suggests that similar operon structures may also emerge          independently in evolution Thus the same or analogous          operon organizations may emerge convergently on multiple          occasions probably due to the selective pressure arising          from the strong interactions between the SSAPs and their          functional partners such as SbcC SSB and LE          The distribution of the gene neighborhoods in which a          member of the RecT superfamily occurs next to the RecE on          the phylogenetic tree of the RecTRed superfamily          indicates that the RecERecT combination was probably the          ancestral state for at least the RecT and EHAP families          Fig  This implies that on at least two occasions          the gene for  endonuclease displaced the functionally          analogous           recE gene and became the adjacent          gene to RecT Fig  That this displacement might have          occurred by           in situ insertion of a          nonorthologous gene is suggested by the detection on          three separate occasions of unusual remnants of          preexisting genes The RecTRed superfamily members          namely EHAP from the enterobacteria and PF from           Borrelia hermsii contain a small          Cterminal fragment of the core conserved domain of the          ERF superfamily which is located Cterminal of their           bona fide RecTRed domains These          fragments of the ERF protein are closely related to other          ERF domains from related organisms and are unlikely to          fold into the native conformation characteristic of the          fulllength ERF domain For example the ERF fragment          fused to the EHAP RecTRed domain is closely related to          the P phage ERF domain This suggests that in each of          these cases a RecT superfamily gene was inserted in frame          into a preexisting ERF gene leaving behind only a          nonfunctional fragment of it Fig  In a very similar          case the bacterial RADlike protein from a Shiga toxin          encoding temperate phage is fused to an extreme          Cterminal fragment that is nearly identical to the          Cterminal most portion of the P ERF protein In this          case it appears that the preexisting ERF gene was          displaced through the insertion of a bacterial RADlike          gene Interestingly and in the same vein the RecT          proteins from           Bacillus species contain a short          Cterminal acidic module that is missing in other RecT          proteins but is highly similar to the Cterminal region          of SSBs particularly those from Grampositive bacteria          data not shown This suggests that at some stage in          their evolution the           Bacillus recT gene protein has          recombined with the gene coding for SSB which might even          have resulted in a functional replacement of an SSB with          an SSAP          Thus it appears likely that functionally equivalent          genes may displace their analogs in operons via insertion          into the same position                            Conclusions        We show that functionally similar SSAPs belong to at        least three evolutionarily distinct superfamilies We unify        the Red and RecT proteins and their homologs which have        not been reported as being related at the sequence level        into a single superfamily supporting the notion that these        proteins share a similar mechanism of action The second        superfamily typified by the ERF proteins is predominantly        found in bacteriophages and is also present on all circular        plasmids from         Borrelia suggesting a role in the        recombination of these plasmids The third superfamily        typified by the yeast RAD protein and previously detected        only in eukaryotes was shown to include bacterial and        phage homologs and to contain a modified HhH domain By        comparing the gene neighborhoods of the SSAPs we show that        the predicted operons that include the SSAP genes evolve        according to the LEGO principle In these operons the        SSAP genes are linked to the genes for various DNAses and        DNA repair related proteins such as SSB and SbcC which        implies functional connections between the encoded        proteins Evidence is presented of convergent emergence of        similar SSAPencoding operons in different lineages and of         in situ nonorthologous displacement        of functionally similar genes in these operons                    Materials and Methods        Sequence searches of the nonredundant NR and the
