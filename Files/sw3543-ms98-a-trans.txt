               so Utah   yes   that thats thats the state that got was famous when they executed somebody Gary Gilmore by firing squad as i recall   Gary Gilmore yeah thats right and we still have a death penalty   umhum   some a gentleman uh that was one of the hifi murderers just had his conviction overturned well appealed again i guess we have the longest uh running inmates for death row too   umhum   and then we had another guy uh Ronald Lafferty that thought God told him to kill his sisterinlaw   yeah   he just got a a new trial because the judge felt that he was incompetent   umhum   uh how do you feel about the death penalty   well i you you know until recently ive been sort of could go either way you know it it sort of doesnt much you know didnt it wasnt a strong issue um i guess it still isnt a strong issue but i must say i find it very silly the way politicians are running around creating more and more capital crimes um instead of dealing with real you know the real problems theyre you know theyre theyre theyre getting votes presumably by   oh   um i assume theyre doing it for that reason   well im sure sure thats their   by by by saying well this doing this this particular crime in this particular way is a capital crime now   well i kind of agree agree with terrorism i think those guys should be done away with thats       one of the worst crimes in my book and uh drug dealing hm thats close but uh terrorism definitely and uh selling out your country   umhum it its not its not enough just to lock them up forever   uh no its got to be something that is gonna cost them because we never lock anybody up forever   um not often   not very often at all weve got these guys in New York that uh im sure you heard about the ones that killed ah the gentleman that came from Utah to watch the tennis people   yep yep   and i guess they got convicted the four of   umhum   uh uh murder   right   so youve come to a definite opinion on it now   well i ive uh it it it it seems like its gone gotten carried away um and i i do find it hard to draw know where to draw a line and so if i had to draw a line id say just no capital punishment i mean i dont i dont see i dont see that it accomplishes a whole lot whereas i do think that convicting people and and incarcerating them for a long time if that could be improved upon that would have more impact i think   yeah you kind of hate to   no what what about the argument where where somebody who is committing  one capital crime chooses to commit a a more serious capital crime i mean murder um because that one at least you might escape from because his victim you know his witnesses will be gone doesnt this doesnt this encourage   you mean uh violence   uh more serious doesnt doesnt this encourage you know i mean doesnt this encourage murder in order to wipe out the   the witnesses   the witnesses   well maybe it would uh i kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment uh as it is i think that people who uh infringe on other peoples rights uh and screw up their whole lives with rape uh child molesting uh terrorism just a theres just like five things that i think they ought to be snuffed for but im im for it for certain reasons   yeah umhum   and i think that things like rape uh you cant get over uh takes a lifetime   i see so so if if William Kennedy Smith had been found guilty you believe he should have been uh executed   um if it was   a six person jury couldve decided either way of course   yeah if it was itd probably have to be a pattern you know we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out do the same thing and go back and uh if theyre habitual like three times caught for rape or child molesting then snuff them   umhum well but there the problems that they just been let out of jail   good pardon   the problem there is that theyve been let out jail if theyve been thrice convicted they should have been kept in longer   yeah but we dont seem to keep them long enough and then they learn such bad things in jail that isnt a place of rehabilitation   yeah well yeah thats thats for sure   yeah its a tough question isnt it on whether at what point do they become so detrimental to society that society cant afford to keep them around to keep giving them chances   umhum yeah   hm  lets see so the other questions that they wanted was whether the place that we live in uh compares to how we feel whats the laws there in DC   i actually dont
