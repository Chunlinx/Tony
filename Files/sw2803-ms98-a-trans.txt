                okay um i think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service because it it seems like and im im thinking of the community of community of people that are in jail now i think that maybe if if if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done because they would they understand people more they understand helping people more they understand the plight of people   thats true umhum i agree with you in the sense that uh i think that its important for people to uh also share give something of themselves   right   and uh i think that theres too much in the in uh a way of like selfgratification today   umhum umhum   and theres not enough sharing   umhum i would think that for like people that are just filthy filthy rich   uhhuh   i think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they can see and im im speaking about people that are like born rich   yeah uhhuh   and thats all they know and im thinking that community service would help them uh just get a feel of what else is out there how other people are living you know if they were to work in in uh uh   yeah   i dont know in a soup kitchen or something they would understand how other people live   yeah uhhuh   and uh you know on the same note if poor if poorer people  uh were working to to serve the community i dont know they probably have a better perspective of of i dont know just life itself   yeah and i think the Peace Corps is great too because uh it you go to different countries and you see   umhum   uh you know in fact i saw an interview on TV the other night with uh Patrick Swayze and hes making a movie in   umhum   i think its uh Calcutta or either India somewhere where its a its a very poor poor country   umhum umhum   and he said that people in the West he said since being there and i guess hes been there about six months he said that his whole idea of whats important has changed   umhum um   and he said that people have no idea he said of of what human sacrifice is you know since being there hes hes learned to what it is to be poor and have nothing and yet those people have uh such uh a happy   umhum demeanor yeah umhum   uh yeah in in other words they dont dwell on on what they dont have they dwell on what they do have and theyre happy with each other type of thing   right thats great   and he said that out here he said that when he comes back he knows that it its just completely changed his life   umhum and i i think that that you know this on the same note being he was exposed to that and maybe he wasnt before and now he sees and i think that anybody that works   right exactly   in the in some kind of service or for the community or something they can see you know you dont see what you dont you cant know what you dont see   uhhuh exactly right   you know so and you have to experience some things you know a lot of people know that people that other people are poor   yeah   but you they dont know what poor is   right   unless they actually see it and you know help or something   uhhuh well i i know that it that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of uh you know helping them learn how to survive how to plant how to find water and ive seen so many uh   umhum umhum   extraordinary things on TV that people have done   umhum   working in the Peace Corps and how you know uh the people or the community they worked in is so much better   umhum   its like one person can make a difference   right   and i i really believe that they can in something like that   theres something i ive really been skeptical of you know when you watch television youll see the service announcement for children in other countries   uhhuh   and if you want to send like you know fifty cents a day   yes   or something like that and you can help a child   uhhuh   its i dont know i guess its just me but i dont know whether to trust that or not i mean there are so many scams and things going on you know i would love to help somebody   i know and how do you yeah   you know but i just i cant bring myself to trust   right   this this company whos trying to do this or whatever it is   uhhuh   you know just because people are so i dont know just today people are just so money hungry that i think they would do anything   i know its true it really is its the sad life i think today its um   and so i mean you dont know what they umhum   its it its not like it used to be even in in the years of my growing up i mean im fifty three years old and i have seen a town change from a town to a city   umhum umhum umhum   and its uh people you know grow from a small town to a large town   umhum   and you would think that more people would be better you know share more do more you know be more community oriented and all but if they just get more uh   umhum right   unto themselves kind of   yeah more selfcentered um   right and and its not the sharing of uh a neighbor to a neighbor   umhum umhum   and  we would go out and not even lock our doors   umhum   and not even worry about it   but you cant do that today   but today i mean you know its like you wouldnt even think of doing that   umhum   if you dont have bars on the window youre not even safe you know   yeah even when when i first moved to Dallas from New York it seemed like Dallas was so open you know everybody left their doors open you just run in the store you leave your car running   uhhuh yeah yeah   you know and this was only uh well i guess it has been awhile its been almost ten years since i moved here and its amazing now now how much its changed i mean i dont go out i dont go outsid e at night you know   yeah in Dallas they i was going to say because i i heard uh in fact i was talking to someone from Dallas uh just last week they was saying that uh in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for TI and she had gone over seas to Tokyo   umhum umhum   and she asked them there if there was some anywhere that she shouldnt go because she was alone you know being a girl from another country and everything   umhum umhum   and she said they thought for a few seconds and they said uh no theres nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid they said to her that even if she left her purse   hum   on the subway   umhum   okay that she would have that purse returned to her this is how confident they were okay with nothing missing   wow wow   okay this is a foreign country   better umhum   and you would think you know uh being uh an American or whatever you know a foreigner there that that would be all the more reason that theyd take advantage of you   umhum um oh God that would be the exact opposite here i mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it   okay and she told me she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in in and around Dallas   umhum umhum   and thats where she was from   umhum that is sad   she said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone   yeah yeah that thats a big thats a big thing with me i live in a one bedroom im single   you know she had there are certain uhhuh   and ive i could live in an apartment i live in Waco okay and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments   oh yeah yeah   and i live i dont make a lot of money but i live in the high price apartments simply because i feel safe here   yeah   and i pay im paying probably the hundred or hundred and fifty dollars more than i would be paying somewhere else but i wouldnt be able to sleep at night and that to me is worth the extra money for me to be you know i feel very safe where i am   yeah yeah yeah   you know instead of   and that thats why i think if people were more exposed to   umhum   uh especially uh young kids getting out of high school   umhum   i mean at one time they would go into the service to have the same exposure and you know uh to further their worldliness so to speak   umhum right   and go to see uh foreign countries that they would not necessarily be able to afford to see it was like they said join the Navy to see the world type of thing you know   umhum right right   but nowadays they dont do that anymore its not uh a thing uh a lot of young men dont even uh   umhum   have the desire to go into the service   yeah they dont even consider it   or to uh you know do something for someone else   umhum yeah and it   and i dont know i i attributed i think a lot of that to women working   to   you know to mothers not being at home   yes yes i was talking to someone yesterday about that and we were saying that the basic uh the the basic family is is disrupted these days   the bonding process yep it very definitely is   and so i think you know before the father would work and the mother you know would stay home and having that mother there that base i think was a big part of of family big part of   thats right   of what you know your your uh youngsters thought about what they did you know   yep and the thing is like i think a man can afford to support a woman but the woman affords the luxuries   umhum   in in other words like anyone can live on a certain income no matter what it is you have to   umhum right right   so to speak okay it its whats important to you   umhum   now a family i i think that like girls today have children and six weeks later theyre back to work   umhum right   they dont even have a bonding with that child they dont ever ever see the   umhum   its its the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child the first like say six years of life   umhum umhum   so much happens in that period of time   when i called   and i mean once the childs in school if you had a job from say nine to three   umhum   big deal i mean theyre theyre in school youre at work thats great but its kids that come home and dont have a mother there or the kids are at home in the morning and the   right right
