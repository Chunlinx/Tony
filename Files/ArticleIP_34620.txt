                                  Sins of the Tongue            During the Flytrap scandal last year traditionalChristian values were often invokedbut only those concerning sex What no onetalked about was that from the Middle Ages through the Reformation eraChristian moral theology both Catholic and Protestant has upheld otherprinciples relevant to Flytrap above all that nemo tenetur detegereturpitudinem suam  That does not translate as thou shalt not lie withinterns nor lie about it thereafter It means no one is compelled to revealhis own secret sin A corollary holds that no oneincluding judges andprosecutorshas a moral right to compel another person to disclose his privateshameful acts As the eminent Puritan theologian William Ames wrote inConscience and the Cases Thereof  He whose offence is hidden has as yet right to preserve his fame that it should not rashly be laid openNeither is it the part of a judge to search into hidden faults            You may not agree with this principle but it wasthe churchs position for centuries According to medieval canon law privateand shameful acts the sorts of things a penitent whispers to his priest lieoutside the jurisdiction of public tribunals Moreover both Catholic andProtestant writers argued against compelling people to answer specificincriminating questions under oathbecause Ames explains it is againstnature to expect that any man should betray or defame himself Even thisstiff old Puritan never supposes that it is only weak unprincipled men who lieunder such circumstances To put someone on oath and then ask if he hasmasturbated or committed adultery both mortal sins according to traditionalChristian ethics is merely to give occasion of horrid perjuries The RomanCatholic jurist Julius Clarus says much the same adding as daily experienceteaches            Traditional Christianmorality even supports President Clintons slippery answers to prosecutorsquestions It was precisely to give witnesses and defendants a way out of theperjury trap that theologians distinguished between a lie and a misleading orequivocal statement Henry Mason an Anglican priest writing in the early th century points out that in traditional Protestant and Catholicethics if there be just cause for concealing of a truth one may use words ina less known and common signification and in another meaning than it islikely the hearers will understand them Like say using sex in a sensethat excludes fellatio though thats not an example that Mason gives            Traditional Christian moral theology does not view attemptsto hide ones private sins and shame as grave offenses What it does view as afundamental violation of Christian charity is detractio  disclosinganother human beings private failings and weaknesses in order to ruin his goodname or otherwise bring him into discredit According to the SummaTheologica of Thomas Aquinas to harm someone this way is a mortalsineven if the allegations are truesince defamation is not a distortion ofthe truth but the destruction of a reputation Or as Ames puts it he istruly a detractor who revealeth a true sin of another mans  spoiling themans reputation to the intent to hurt him            Aquinas considereddetractio more seriously wicked than theft because reputation is morevaluable than riches Citing St Augustine some penitential manuals classifyit as a type of homicide while others make it a sin against the Holy Spiritand thus unforgivable The Protestant Ames takes an equally hard line Theunjust revealing a secret hath in it oftentimes the pernicious violations oftrust friendship and honesty and is therefore not only in the commonesteem of men but in the Scripture also reckoned amongst the most odioussins            To be sure there are times when one has a moral right andduty to reveal damaging information about another person As Ames notes everycitizen is bound to notify the authorities of faults which do eitherimmediately hurt the public good  or which hurt heavily any innocent Buthe adds as long as the fault itself is not pernicious to others  thencharity and justice require that setting aside accusation we contentourselves with private correction            In other words the release of the Starr report oneyear ago this week was by traditional Christian standards the big sin ofFlytrap Disclosing every last humiliating detail of Clintons sex lifeoccupies the dead center of what traditional Christianity means by sinand isperhaps even more deeply wrong than either committing or concealing adulteryIf as many said Flytrap reflects the erosion of traditional Christian valuesit is not because a man committed adultery and lied about itwhich is nothingnew The evidence of eroding Christian values is that compelling a man topublicize his hidden faults and punishing him for not cooperating in his owndisgrace are no longer considered by many to be sins at all
