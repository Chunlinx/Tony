                    Background        Plasma membrane microparticles MP of endothelial        origin have been identified in normal human blood             and increased counts of MP carrying endothelial antigens        were documented in the blood of patients with lupus        anticoagulant     acute coronary syndrome            thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura    or in patients        with exacerbated multiple sclerosis     Similarly to        blood platelets endothelial cells release MP which express        phosphatidylserine PS on their surface PSexposing MP in        blood appear to act as the catalytic surface for assembly        of the prothrombinase complex     Although circulating        MP of various cellular origin in patient with sepsis were        reported to be procoagulant through multiple mechanisms             in healthy individuals they may have an anticoagulant        function by promoting the generation of low amounts of        thrombin that activate protein C            The process of membrane vesiculation and MPrelease in        platelets has been shown to require a calpaindependent        dissociation of membrane proteins from the submembrane        cytoskeleton and most likely involves intracellular        signaling by platelet protein kinases     Besides        platelets stimulated by various agonists such as thrombin        with collagen or the complement complex Cb      a        release of PScontaining membrane MP was demonstrated in        other cell types such as endotoxinstimulated monocytes            polymorphonuclear leucocytes stimulated with the        chemotactic peptide FMLP    or apoptotic Tlymphocytes            The normal restriction of PS to the inner surface        of the plasma membrane becomes perturbed in apoptotic cells             When exposed PS is a determinant for phagocyte        recognition of cells to be cleared Plasma membrane        blebbing and MPrelease are generally accepted as typical        signs of cell apoptosis            In addition to a possible pathophysiological role of        circulating MP analysis of MP derived from endothelial        cells may be a valuable diagnostic marker of vessel wall        injury The phospholipidbinding protein annexin V has a        high affinity for PS    and is utilized in MP detection        in blood and in cell supernatants     Since very little        is known about the mechanism of MPrelease from endothelial        cell it is difficult to judge the type and extent of        endothelial injury represented by increased plasma counts        of endothelial MP We used flow cytometry to study the        release of annexin Vbinding membrane microparticles from        cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cell HUVEC        stimulated by various agonists We further focused our        study on MPrelease from HUVEC after proapoptotic        stimulation with the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin        CPT Since CPT analogues become one of the most promising        new classes of antineoplastic agents introduced into the        clinic in recent years     activity of camptothecin on        endothelial cells may be of great interest                    Results                  With the exception of high concentration of          ionophore A rapid stimulation of HUVEC with various          agonists did not result in a release of annexin Vbinding          microparticles          Flow cytometry analysis of HUVEC culture supernatant          demonstrated that a  min treatment with  M ionophore          A caused the release of low counts of annexin          Vbinding MP Fig A Similar shorttime activation of          HUVEC with phorbol myristate acetate PMA  gmL          human thrombin receptor activating peptide TRAP           molL human thrombin THR  NIH UnitmL human          tissue plasminogen activator TPA  kUmL or human          angiotensin II AGTII  molL did not cause any          significant increase in MPrelease Fig A All of the          agonists applied induced morphological changes in HUVEC          seen by phase contrast light microscopy which confirmed          the cellular activation not shown                          Proapoptotic but not proinflammatory stimulation          induced a release of annexin Vbinding microparticles          from HUVEC          MP count increased overnight in the media of          unstimulated cell culture but this was not enhanced by          TNF  U mL or by LPS  gmL However when          cells were activated with TNF in the presence of          cycloheximide  gmL to promote apoptosis     a          dramatic increase in MP count was observed as compared          to TNF or cycloheximide treatment alone Fig B          Similarly induction of apoptosis with  M CPT a          topoisomerase I inhibitor     led to a release of          annexin Vbinding MP which was prevented by ZVAD ZVAD          also inhibited a release of MP from unstimulated cells          which probably represents spontaneous apoptosis of          cultured HUVEC Fig B                          MPrelease did not correlate with the level of cell          apoptosis in HUVEC stimulated with camptothecin          Phase contrast microscopy showed that HUVEC culture          treated for  hrs with  M CPT Fig C lost          confluence with about  cells remaining adherent          The level of apoptosis of adherent cells was assessed by          using TUNEL and annexin VFITC propidium iodide assays          Fig  Approximately one third of the remaining          adherent cells showed annexin Vbinding Fig B and          DNAfragmentation TUNELpositivity Fig C          Interestingly a ten times lower concentration of CPT           nM also induced significant MPrelease after only           hrs of treatment Fig A and after  hrs  nM          camptothecin induced MPrelease comparable to  M CPT          treatment but without any significant increase in          annexin Vbinding to the cells or DNAfragmentation Fig          BC The cell culture was still confluent Fig B          with about  lower cell density as compared with           DMSO treated HUVEC Fig A This result indicates          that MPrelease is not related to cell desquamation To          investigate whether maturation of the cell culture          influences the degree of MPrelease from HUVEC in          response to CPT we compared MPrelease from subconfluent          HUVEC  of confluence at  hrs in culture HUVEC          reaching confluence at  hrs in culture and overgrown          HUVEC at  hrs in culture Our results showed that          MPrelease in response to CPT declined with culture          maturation There was also a change of the sensitivity of          overgrown HUVEC to CPT treatment in confluent  hrs old          culture resulting in the higher concentration of CPT           M releasing higher levels of MP Fig  In growing          culture at  hrs  nM CPT caused even higher          MPrelease than  M CPT In confluent HUVEC  hrs old          the MPrelease induced by  nM and  M CPT was not          significantly different Fig                           Endothelial antigens CD  and CD  were both          expressed on living cells apoptotic bodies and other          cell fragments in CPT treated HUVEC culture but CD           was absent on  of annexin Vbinding membrane          microparticles          Using flow cytometry in SSC vs FSC plot we gated          homogeneous population of single living cells G on Fig          A which appeared negative in propidium iodide staining          Fig B Living cells from control cultures as well as          from cultures treated with CPT were strongly positive for          both antigens CD  and CD  Fig C Expression of          CD on endothelial cells was not influenced by  hrs          incubation with nM or M CPT as compared with control          cells incubated with  DMSO Expression of CD was          only slightly decreased on CPT treated cells Cell          fragments   m in size as compared with standard          beads were gated separately G on Fig A Larger cell          fragments appeared positive in propidium iodide staining          Fig B All analyzed cell fragments were positive for          CD and also expressed CD  Fig D Comparison of          areas under the different peaks on the histogram Fig          CD indicates that the portion of cell fragments          corresponding to apoptotic bodies and necrotic cells was          significantly higher in culture treated with  M CPT as          compared to culture treated with  nM CPT or with           DMSO alone In a separate protocol we analyzed the          expression of CD  and CD  on membrane MP Comparison          of FSC values of standard beads and analyzed MP showed          that  of annexin Vbinding MP released from HUVEC were            m in size range    m Analyzed MP were          free of nucleic acids as they were not stained with          propidium iodide not shown Doublelabeling flow          cytometry assay showed that all annexin Vbinding          membrane MP expressed CD but only approximately  of          these expressed CD  Fig                             Discussion        Our previous study demonstrated that cultured HUVEC        released annexin Vbinding membrane MP in response to        proapoptotic stimulation with CPT     In the present        study we investigated whether endothelial cells release        membrane MP after rapid stimulation with Ca mobilizing        agents or after overnight stimulation with proinflammatory        agents TNF and LPS or only after induction of apoptosis        Our negative results with thrombin TRAP PMA TPA and        AGTII indicate that rapid Ca mobilization despite        dramatic morphological changes of the cells does not        result in MPrelease from HUVEC Fig A The only report        showing MPrelease after rapid stimulation with a        physiologic agonist is the study by Hamilton         et al     that demonstrated        MPrelease from HUVEC with the complement complex Cb        This membraneattack complex may destabilize cell membrane        by generating pores in phospholipid bilayer We observed        MPrelease from HUVEC after shorttime treatment only with        high concentrations  M of A In this experiment        a direct destabilizing effect of the Ca ionophore A        on cell membrane resulting in MP formation is also likely        Another question is relation of plasma membrane blebbing        and MPrelease One study documented peroxideinduced        membrane blebbing after a short time stimulation of        endothelial cells     Although MPrelease was not        investigated authors showed micrographs of stimulated        cells with membrane blebs of about  m in diameter Size        of majority of MP produced in our experiments is less than        m This difference indicates that the mechanism of        MPrelease may be different from membrane blebbing visually        observed on cells by conventional light microscopy        We did not find any significant MPrelease from HUVEC        after overnight stimulation with TNF Fig B although        stimulation of the HUVEC culture was confirmed by        upregulation of CD  on cell surface not shown In        comparison Combes         et al     recorded a four fold        increase in MP count in HUVEC culture stimulated overnight        with TNF when compared to control cells These discrepant        results may stem from differences in HUVEC culture        conditions and the flow cytometric assay In our study the        proapoptotic stimulation was the only efficient way to        release membrane MP from HUVEC Since MPrelease from        endothelial cells after proapoptotic stimulation was not        studied before we focused on its characterization We used        CPT an inhibitor of topoisomerase I that is a well        defined apoptogenic agent belonging to a promising class of        antineoplastic drugs     In contrast to more        physiological stimuli ie oxidative stress induction of        apoptosis by CPT is less complex and thus is a better model        for study of MPrelease phenomenon Our results showed that        the growth stage of HUVEC culture influenced MP release in        response to CPT Fig  It is difficult to understand why         nM CPT caused higher MPrelease than  M CPT in        subconfluent HUVEC This difference is small and may be        influenced by error of analysis It is evident however        that cell culture maturation increased resistance to        camptothecin treatment This may be related to decreased        DNA synthesis in mature confluent HUVEC        Size distribution of annexin Vbinding MP released from        HUVEC after proapoptotic stimulation was similar to that of        endothelial MP found in blood     The small size and        the absence of nucleic acids indicate that the analyzed MP        are different from apoptotic bodies formed in the terminal        stage of apoptosis Our finding of CD CD and        CDCD populations of MP Fig  suggests that HUVEC        can release different types of annexin Vbinding MP with        respect to their antigen expression This observation        cautions against the use of a single antigen for detection        of endothelial MP in blood The presence of CD on all        annexin Vbinding MP corresponds to the high expression of        this glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored glycoprotein on        endothelial cells The homodimeric transmembrane        glycoprotein CD  endoglin is relatively specific for        endothelial cells and is abundant with more than         copies per cell on HUVEC     It is not clear however        why they are CDpositive MP that express CD and some        that do not Fig  Although CD  was shown to be an        endothelial cell proliferation marker     its        expression was only slightly decreased on CPT treated cells        Fig C and was stable on overgrown confluent HUVEC up to         hrs in culture not shown We also found this antigen        on cell fragments including apoptotic bodies Fig D        Since CD is a protein with an important complement        regulatory function and CD is a component of the        receptor for TGF there may be functional andor        diagnostic differences in the MP populations        It is generally accepted that appearance of PS on the        outside of the plasma membrane is an early sign of        apoptosis in many cell types after different treatments            Chan         et al    showed that exposure of        PS on the cell surface preceded DNA strand breaks in        apoptosis of different cell lines Cell membrane        vesiculation and release of MP is considered to belong to        the execution stage of apoptosis where the fate of the cell        is sealed To our surprise in CPT treated HUVEC the        MPrelease did not correlate with the extent cell        desquamation and apoptosis or remaining adherent cells        characterized by PS exposure on the cell membrane and        DNAfragmentation TUNEL Fig  In contrast Aupeix         et al     reported that the        release of PScontaining MP was proportional to hypodiploid        DNA in THP and U cells stimulated by various        apoptotic agents Our experiments with  nM CPT treated        HUVEC indicate that annexin Vbinding MP may be released        from adherent cells at initial phase of apoptosis before        exposure of PS on cell surface or DNA fragmentation Cell        desquamation and massive formation of apoptotic bodies seen        after  M CPT treatment did not further enhance the        MPrelease Fig  thus supporting the hypothesis that        annexin Vbinding MPrelease takes place in the initial        phase of apoptosis The essential step in plasma membrane        destabilization and MPrelease very likely is a        caspasedependent sphingomyelin hydrolysis which leads to        the production of ceramide       It is possible        however that sphingomyelin hydrolysis and MPrelease may        be a consequence of the action of initiator caspases or        other ZVAD sensitive proteases rather than only executioner        caspases       Our study was performed in HUVEC        culture which may have particular properties in respect of        MP release when compared with endothelial cells from other        organs Our finding that the PS is not exposed on the cells        treated with low concentration of CPT while they release        PScontaining MP may suggests that these cells release MP        to remove PS from the cell surface as a protective        mechanism that may counteract proapoptotic stimulation in        the lifedeath decision process                    Conclusions        Our results demonstrate that HUVEC release different        populations of annexin Vbinding membrane MP in response to        proapoptotic stimulation We showed that rapid stimulation        of HUVEC with thrombin PMA TPA or AGT II or overnight        stimulation with TNF or LPS does not induce release of        annexin Vbinding membrane MP Release of MP after        treatment with camptothecin very likely occurs at early        stage prior to a point of no return in apoptosis This        phenomenon may represent a physiologic repair process        rather then be a part of apoptotic cell death                    Materials and

Quantum          TM beads Flow Cytometry Standards San Juan PR were          run each day as a separate sample to standardize          fluorescence readings                          Flow cytometry analysis of endothelial cell          membrane microparticles          MP were analyzed in a separate protocol    using a          modified method of Combes et al     Annexin          VFITCpositive MP were gated in a SSC vs fluorescence          logarithmic plot For MP quantitation TruCount beads          from Becton Dickinson San Diego CA were used in each          sample as an internal standard TruCount beads were gated          in a SSC vs FSC logarithmic plot and analysis was          stopped when  beads were counted MP count released          by  cells was calculated for each sample TetraSpeck          fluorescent microsphere standards of    and           m in diameter from Molecular Probes Eugene OR          were used to estimate MP size based on comparison of FSC          values Antigen expression on MP was analyzed by          doublelabeling with annexin VFITC and PEconjugated          Mabs The annexin VFITCpositive MP were gated and          their binding of PElabeled Mabs was evaluated in SSC vs          PE  fluorescence logarithmic plots                            Abbreviations        AGTII angiotensin II BSA bovine serum albumin CHX
