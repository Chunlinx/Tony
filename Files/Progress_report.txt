programs units and officesprimarily OPP and the StatePlanning Team with some statistical and reporting assistance fromOIMin terms of meeting the goals and objectives of your strategicplanning document Strategic Directions I would like to put this report in its proper perspective Weare all acutely aware that our civil legal services delivery systemis strained to the breaking point Legal services programsnationally have been battered by economic pressures and escalatingdemand Our grantees now estimate that they currently turn awayfour out of every five lowincome individuals who are seekingcritical legal assistance Courts are witnessing an unprecedentedincrease in the number of people who enter the justice system todaylacking legal representation and who are consequently forced torepresent themselves in complex and complicated legal proceedingsOur communities are experiencing unrelenting pressures asunresolved civil legal problems result in homelessness loss ofselfsufficiency and growing crime rates Despite the hard work andthe advancements of the last thirty years economic and socialinequality coupled with racial and genderbased discriminationcontinues to be the central reality of our clients lives The factthat we are now seeing second and third generation lowincomepeople walk through our doors and sit in our waiting rooms is abrutal reminder that the realization of justice for many Americansremains more an aspiration than a factLSC and our grantees live and work in a world that is marked bycontinual challenges and crises That is the bad news The goodnews however can be found in reports like this one Reports thatdemonstrate that there are many people both within LSC and ourgrantee programs and outside of our federallyfunded structure whocare deeply about issues related to equal justice and who haverefused to take our many crises lying down People like the staffat the legal services programs in New Jersey Maryland WashingtonTexas Missouri California and Indiana who are actively andcontinuously engaged in reassessing their delivery practices andpolicies to meet emerging and unmet needs People like those legalservices heroes in Arkansas Illinois Florida and Alabama who haveworked closely and in partnership with LSC to expand access to andenhance resources for legal services providers and their clientsPeople like my legal services friends in Iowa Ohio VirginiaArizona and Kentucky who have devoted years of their lives to thelegal services movement People like yourselves who in this era ofdiminishing resources and escalating need have devoted time andenergy to strengthening legal services and helping to makeessential changes in that way we practice legal services so that wecan ensure that the phrase justice for all is not relegated to asexy slogan on a tshirt or a bannerThis report demonstrates that our grantees and the broader equaljustice community are doing great things for clients and are doingit more efficiently and effectively with fewer resources But forme it demonstrates another very important point It shows that asmall group of committed individuals the fourteen lawyers and fivenonlawyers

implementation of state plans Threegrants in Texas helped with merger issues through integration ofdisparate systems Grants made to Arkansas and Virginia aided incoordination of case management systems and building systems forstatewide client intakeTwentyeight grants targeted statewide web sites whichencompass not only all of the LSC programs in a state but otherstate justice community partnersFive national technology grants were made to assist states withthe implementation of other technology grants and technologyplanning These national grants are described in detail belowAmong them wereA grant to support for implementation and contentmanagement of statewide web sitesA grant to link technical expertise from other programsto technology grantees at no cost to granteesA grant to create a web site to provide information ontechnology for all LSC programsCommitment Technology and Pro Se initiative grants to beawarded by LSC AchievementsNinetyfive Technology Initiative Grant TIG requestswere received from  states and territories for a total of million Fiftyfive grants were awarded with  million allottedfor TIG  Twentyeight states received grants for statewidewebsites  for technology projects being undertaken on astatewide basis including three for statewide intake systemsFive grants with a national scope were awarded see belowA TIG conference was held in Chicago in October to introducethis years grantees to the national support system that LSC hasdeveloped with the assistance of numerous grantees These fivenational support grants will give our grantees more resources thanthey have ever had available to them for developing pro se toolsfor clients The first two LSTech and LegalMeetings will beavailable to all LSC grantees not just TIG recipientsIn the first national system Legal Services of SouthernMichigan is creating a national web site wwwlstechorg withresources on legal services technology They will be workingclosely with NTAP so that grantees with questions can log onto theweb site and request assistance from NTAP Other partners on thisgrant are the University of Michigan providing servers and NLADAproviding content and technical assistanceThe next grant is for a national legal services virtualconferencing center to be coordinated by Gulf Coast Legal Servicesin Houston Using WebEx hosting services our grantees will be ableto meet electronically via the web Grantees can convene technologytrainings state planning sessions and advocates meetings Thesite that will facilitate this project iswwwlegalmeetingsorgA third national

availability and theapplication process took place at the National Equal JusticeConference the Southeastern Project Directors Association meetingthe Indiana Access to Justice Conference and Virginias technologyplanning meetingCommitment Working with grantees LSC has developed anddisseminated replicable models for the effective and efficient useof technology AchievementsWith TIG  grants were made for two statewide website templates The theory behind these templates was to create astructure that could be replicated by other states with all of thefunctionality but at a fraction of the cost In TIG  thesetemplates will be used in  states The cost to implement thetechnology portion is only  of the each grant  Theremainder will be used to coordinate content This is a goodexample of how LSCs coordinating efforts can result in largesavings to our programs from replicationAnother tool being used for replication is the nationalgrant for the technology web site LSTech described above Onthis site any program can find details on all of the technologygrants and avoid the expense and effort of creating new projectsfor their states There will be technical information on satelliteInternet access video systems telephone and a host of othersubjectsLSC cosponsored a case management system conference inconjunction with the Equal Justice Conference and participated in asession on how to help advocates and staff use the technology toolsthey already haveStaff regularly confer with National Center for State CourtsState Justice Institute the Open Society Institute and JusticeManagement

doing itsown intake Their case management systems will be running on anapplications service provider ASP This means that no softwarewill be needed to access their system opening up the ability to dointake from any computer with Internet access This will help themexpand intake such as allowing pro bono attorneys to do intakefrom their officesThrough our planning efforts LSC is seeing many mergersof programs To help with these mergers LSC made severaltechnology grants to help programs combine multiple informationsystems into one integrated system Examples of these are the threegrants to each of the new programs in TexasAs well as making new grants staff continue to monitorthe TIG projects from last year The Minnesota and Ohio grants todevelop web templates are being used as models for this yearsstatewide web site grants The Orange County ICAN project wassuccessfully completed and is being expanded with additional moniesthis year This project working with the Courts districtattorneys office and libraries placed selfhelp kiosks inseveral locations in Orange County The project has been so helpfulto clients and the courts that the Court system is examining theproject to see if it should be implement statewide Hawaiis videoproject is completed and operational This project is used toconnect offices in the other islands to the main LASH office inHonolulu This allows them to do followups on their pro se clinicsto insure they continue with the high success rates LSC is sharingwhat has been learned about the project with other interestedprograms DNAs satellites are providing high speed Internet accessto all of their offices Before many offices had to dial longdistance numbers to connect at very slow speeds They areinstalling their pro se kiosks and designing the web site that willallow persons throughout their service area to obtain selfhelpinformation in their native tonguesCommitment State Technology Planning Manual developed

TIG  conferencein Chicago and soon we will have a timetable for itscompletionUse of Program OversightCommitment Develop methods to assess program quality to ensurethat case handling staff are well trained and that the legal workamong programs is coordinated and of high quality AchievementsLSC uses three primary tools to assure quality in theprograms that it representsThe competition processQuality review visits andProvision of support and technical assistance to itsrecipientsIn  the Corporation again used the competitionprocess to review programs assure quality LSCs competitioncriteria have been refined to ensure that LSC recipients respondand adhere to performance standards that result in effective legalservices for lowincome people An extensive guide has beendeveloped for evaluations that considers each criterion andprovides reviewers with standards against which to judge fundingapplicationsIn  LSC created a protocol for onsite programsreviews published as a Program Review Guide It is a referencetool for staff and consultants in reviewing programs and to draftreports and recommendations based on the reviews Program reviewsare one way to monitor program development solve problems andestablish new strategies for expanding access and enhancingquality Among other resources the Guide contains a sample letterintroducing the program to the

work and suggestions forconducting personal interviews The implementation of the programreview process is discussed in the next sectionLSC engages in other efforts to increase quality LSCpersonnel are frequently asked by grantees for assistance withvarious aspects of running a successful program LSC can be a linkbetween the person making the request and otherprograms that have addressed the same concern In  LSCbegan to systematize this effort by creating the InformationManagement Project The projects purpose is to obtain andpublicize information on model practices programs and systems Astaff member is engaged fulltime in launching this effortOther activities that support increasing program qualityundertaken in  areProducing Draft Characteristics on Intake Advice andReferral System LSC

ofactivities such as pro se work community legal education andanalyzing client problems for referral to other resources Programshave been counting matters since July   LSCs first reporton this activity is due in March of The  Grant Activity Report GAR cycle including CaseService Reports CSRs and the allied SelfInspection process hasbeen successfully completedThe results of the SelfInspection show a great improvement inthe accuracy of CSR submissions with the error rate reduced from an  error rate for  CSRs to a  error rate for CSRs With this reduction in error rate the CSRs now meet thestandard of substantial accuracy which was the objective when LSCinitiated the SelfInspection process in The total cases reported to LSC for  are While this total is nominally a slight reduction from the reported for  it is actually an increase because LSC had toadjust the  total downward to  cases to take account ofthe high error rate With the great improvement in the accuracy for LSC can return to using the reported figures without anyadjustmentCommitment Performance standards will include criteria forensuring that grantees have effective administrative systems inplace and that clients receive quality assistance LSC will provideregular feedback to programs and applicants on the quality of theirapplications AchievementsLSC has developed performance guidelines for
