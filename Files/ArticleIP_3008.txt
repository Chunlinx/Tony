                                 Monkey Business            It was a bit weird readingand thinking about Englands young literary phenom Will Self just as Dianasdeath and its aftermath were flooding the airwaves Newscasters spoke of theFlower Revolution of the possibility that England might at last stop clingingto ancient protocol and allow its citizens to display the normal range of humanemotion But as I read Great Apes it occurred to me that stifflippedreserve hasnt been the sole enemy of emotionally demonstrative Englishdogooders Other hallowed traditions are just as allergic totouchifeelinessconsider the countrys fascination with turds Generations ofBritons have reveled in scatological humor poop features quite prominently insome of their great literature even In Gullivers Travels  the heroclosely observes insect droppings and the stinking evacuations of cows whilethe horrible Yahoos pelt him with their dung These passages are funny butalso deadly serious Shit is made to stand for mans essential viciousness hisbrotherhood with base animals And mans brotherhood with base animals wouldseem to point to the futility of Dianastyle attempts at emotionalcommunion            Self haslong declared his admiration for Jonathan Swift and in Great Apes hemakes the homage explicit Selfs hero Simon Dykes starts out as a successfulbut disillusioned painter living in contemporary London Simons milieu is themuchhyped Swinging Londonthe city in the throes of afashionartisticmusicalculinary renaissance that has made the covers ofNewsweek and Vanity Fair  Self thankfully is less of a boosterHis London is more like a cesspool Simon goes out to nightclubs where hetakes unholy quantities of drugs and sneaks off to have sex with his hotvacant girlfriend this is as sickening to him as two skeletons copulating ina wardrobe As for the art world Simon is so bored by its worthless wannabesthat while talking to them he disassociates turning one womans anatomyinside out sockwise imagining what life looks like from up inside herbutt            Its a convincingly icky portrait so were relieved whenSelf picks Simon up and sends him on a Swiftian journey One morning Simonwakes up to find that his girlfriend a petite blonde has turned into a beastthat walks on its knuckles Worse Simons concern at this turn of events isinterpreted as insanity Hes hospitalized by chimp paramedics and held forobservation by a trendy controversial chimp psychiatrist named Dr BusnerSlowly via grunting and sign language his furry new caretakers explain thatSimon is a chimp that he has been a chimp all along and that his humanity hasbeen an illusion Moreover chimps are the civilized ones while humansslowclumsy embarrassingly hairlessare a primitive joke            To help uspicture these tony chimps Selfs publisher has helpfully supplied cover artshowing a lowbrowed largenostriled male creature The face has an obviouslysimian castyet the creature sports a tweed coat and spectacles and parts hissilver hair on the side he bears a distinct resemblance to the late GeorgeBurns Its a mesmerizingly gross notion and for a while Self dazzles us withthe ramifications Selfs cleverest invention is probably the chimps languageThey convey words to each other by signing and touching each others fur andthey add emotional inflection with grunts like eucheuch irritable andhooograa friendly inclusive Another feature of chimp land is thatmonogamy has flown out the window When a female goes into heat she thrusts outher swelling and any male in sight from the sweet old local minister toDad is invited to partake As for the males they all want to be the alphathe top dog Every encounter is either a challenge or a sniveling suckup            Self has the chimps spray shit get crumbs ofit stuck in their fur and in the case of one odious academic drink itwhichmore than meets the fecal humor quota for  But pretty soon Selfsimagination begins to sputter He gives us dexterous word painting like thisdescription of a decrepit hospital in which the ghosts of patients longdeparted recline on skeletal neststeads and the broken spirits of long gonejunior doctors toetap mournfully over the linoleum He gives us elaboratedescriptions of chimp London which looks much the same as human London only afew sizes smaller Self its surprising to discover is a painstaking realistAnd much of what he describes is dully familiar There is a chimp Noam Chomskyand a chimp Liam Gallagher and upperclass chimps read The                NewYorker             Critics often praise Selfscerebral rigor his sharp satiric grip on our foiblesand Great Apesdoes occasionally gesture in this direction He inverts intellectual historytracing  th century European chimps fascination with savagehumansSwifts Yahoos being a prime exampleand the delusional arrogance withwhich Western Civilization  had projected itself towards divinity on theupescalator of the Chain of Being He also pokes fun at evolutionarybiologists who so confidently ascribe all our behavior to genetic programmingBut these ideas arent developed they remain on the level of rhetoric As forinsight into any character other than Simons here are a few of Selfs pearlswhich he delivers with the Idontreallymeanit yesIdo exhibitionism of aHoward Stern There are Jewish chimps with big nasal bridges The females inthe novel tend to be dumb and nymphomaniac and one is an especially miserablelaughable fool There are also blackfurred monkeys or bonoboshugecreatures who excel at sports and love to have sex and to dance            Swift was just as mercilessof course So why is he timeless while Selfs sendups of PC already seemdated as if hed jotted them down in a fit of childish pique in  I wonderif its that Swift for all his pessimism was deeply engaged in the events ofhis day He was a WhigturnedferventTory an activist cleric a staunchdefender of the Anglican Church Much of the power of his bilious attacks comesfrom a righteous Christian sense of sin Self strains to carry on thetradition but the world has changed since  He preserves Swifts ragewithout his certainty His attacks seem less illuminating than pointlesstheyre out of it and unnecessarily cruel A little like the Royal Family itoccurred to me the other day It will be interesting to see what happens if theFlower Revolution extends to English literature
