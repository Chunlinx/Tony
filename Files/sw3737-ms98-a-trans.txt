                 Mark i was wondering if you had any uh what do what do you like to do in your spare time   uh i like to play my guitar a lot and uh i i do a little bit of uh wood working out in the garage a lot   really have you had lessons guitar lessons   uh not really very formal i i took uh some classical guitar lessons from my church once but they werent very good   umhum   and uh so i didnt really learn much from that i i generally learn how to play songs just by ear i i listen to it and and figure it out myself and then go from there   huh well have you ever wanted to play in a band   yeah i was i was in several bands when i was some what younger and then i just kind of got tired of it because they were all a little pig headed and       self centered didnt care about anybody else but themselves   well and bad hours too   yeah yeah that too   huh  well i um i like to play the piano i mean i like to dabble in it i dont play very well but uh i wouldnt say that was a hobby so much as um   yeah   i usually you know i do some crafts and things but mostly out of necessity like if its Christmas time or a birthday or uh we bought a house not too long ago and i needed some decorations and things for the walls and so ive done some   yeah yeah   um crafts and things to hang up but i dont do it i dont think so much out of enjoyment now do you do your woodworking for enjoyment   yeah um yeah i i usually do my wood working for stuff that i want and for just so that i dont have to you know its its cheaper to to build it yourself than it is to go out and buy it from a furniture store   umhum   so i i i do it for monetary and personal enjoyment its its its its an accomplishment to finish something that you that you made by yourself   yeah thats true is is it one of those uh things that you have to have expensive equipment for   um it really depends on what youre making uh if if youre making a piece of furniture yeah youd generally need a a good you know table saw and everything uh   umhum   if its just some little old knickknack or something you can usually get away with a like a hand held saw or something like that   umhum hum   but uh its a its a lot of fun you just you have to be careful so you dont like go lopping your fingers off or anything   sounds like it   my my dads gotten into the to the the wood working stuff here lately and hes trying to make a a uh jewelry box for my grandmother for Christmas and uh   uhhuh uhhuh   he didnt get it finished because he kept screwing up the lid for it but uh he uh he doesnt know all the the safety rules and everything so i had to kind of keep him from taking off a finger or two and theres a couple of things hes done that ive like near had nearly had a heart attack over         its like Dad youre doing it wrong   thats awful   youre gonna hurt yourself yeah but uh   thats pretty funny well i uh since my kids started to school um they have to have costumes it seems like every little bit they have like a pirate day and a Pilgrim feast and things and so ive done some   yeah and Halloween and   right so ive done some sewing and things but uh you know to meet the demands of all these costumes but um and i enjoy it in a way but um it seems like we keep busy you know at work and at school and i volunteer a lot of places so that in my spare time i like to rest  and read   yeah yeah i i work i work out of the i work at a Renaissance festival down in Waxahachie and uh   uhhuh   i have to make my own costume for that out there and uh   hum   it uh tries your patience sometimes because the the patterns arent always the best things in the world they they draw you a pattern on a on a a piece of paper and youre supposed to like you know figure out all the dimensions and everything yourself and   uhhuh yeah   kind of helps if you can either get somebody else to do it or find somebody else that already has a good pattern and just copy it   well and theres a lot of people that enjoy sewing   yeah like my mom sew has sewn for years and years and years and years and years   hum but i have um you know done some knitting and some other crafts like that but not um   yeah   you know not so much because its all so expensive to go and collect all of the material and then the tools you need   yeah yeah one one one thing that is a lot of fun is to do calligraphy   uhhuh i like that   i i took a couple classes in when i was in high school and stuff like that its its a lot of fun and its fairly inexpensive you go out and get you two dollar pen that lasts forever and   umhum and its right and its functional so that youre always needing you know its nice to do your Christmas cards   yeah you can do it yourself do your Christmas cards and invitations and things like that   yeah sounds good   or even something you just wanna frame and stick on your wall   yep thats right we have enjoyed that seems like um weve done a lot too well has it has it been snowing that way wherever you are   uh i i live in Richardson just outside of Dallas it snowed snowed just   umhum
