        about you but i dont do whole lot     uh i dont do a whole lot mostly i you know build stuff around the house uh kinds of things uh   oh yeah yeah what what have you done   thats um not too much put some chairs and cabinets and stuff back together and you know some book shelves and you know junk like that a little rack to hold the maps and you know mail stuff you know the uh stamps and all that kind of junk in to go hang in the kitchen   yeah right well thats cool i used to do quite a bit when i was a little kid but um recently i havent done much at all i i did uh i a while back i started refurbishing a piano weve had in our in our family for a long time its an old antique upright   oh   and uh kind of started to do some work with and stuff   sounds like a big project   uh yeah it is and i really havent had time to do much with it um its a nice piano but its just uh its like uh like the intro said if you had more time and more tools you know       but uh other than that i i havent done a whole lot i did kind of make a coffee table out of a piano bench which was interesting   uhhuh   um and that worked out pretty well i actually gave that to a friend of mine since i really didnt have much use for it but uh so you you got your house then  work out   uh no were renting a townhouse       um so were just and i just kind of had to have some kind of piddling to do all the time   sure is that what you consider a hobby then for you   excuse me   would that would you consider that a hobby then   um i guess sort of it mainly just you know ive all kind of have something all the time   yeah yeah for me i dont know its my brother is a is a contractor and he actually does quite a bit of carpentry and wood work   uhhuh   so i dont see him very often but last time i did we did some stuff he uh he had a job where hes putting in tongue and grooves slaps for a a ceiling actually and so i i helped him do some of that and uh   uhhuh   and like that but aside from that im a im a student at the University of Central Florida   uhhuh oh that sounds good   aside from my classes i dont do a lot of uh        of woodworking per say ive got a lot of other hobbies but not necessarily that so   yeah i i guess its kind of depends what your how loose your definition of woodworking is most of the stuff i do is not you know carving or anything like that its mostly you know sawing stuff you know gluing putting things together that sort of stuff   right i actually would like to do more of it though i kind of get into it its its fun to get started on something you know and and actually have a project that youre working on you know   yeah its a lot of fun to have something that youre doing and uh you know its when youre done with it there something there too   right you youve actually created something and had input into it   yeah   and also its it i dont know i dont know about you but its kind of neat to see something that you can create out wood you know its like woe   yeah  uhhuh   didnt know you could do that but uh and also some of the the little tools and and techniques that that carpenters use um my girlfriends father is also is also a contractor in terms of carpentry and stuff   umhum   and hed made her bed and i was actually taking a look at it and some of the stuff uh you could see the techniques that he used to reinforce uh the braces and things like that theyre really pretty ingenious and i hadnt seen them anywhere else there were some some um timing Bruce slots there and some things some particular methods that hed used um which were kind of neat and hes Vietnamese so im wondering if if maybe the cultural difference made a made a difference in the way he worked at   yeah   um i didnt ask him about it but i   could be uh and seems like of uh stuff that people make with wood you know up until a couple of hundred years ago you didnt have a a abundance of iron or steel to join them together with   right yeah they had to kind of use some uh some different renovative kind of techniques to do that with   yeah   where do you where do you live again   uh the Washington DC area   okay so im thinking thats primarily pine trees for the most part in that area   uh not too bad its about i guess half and a half pine trees and various hard woods of you know   im thinking if you were to do something what kind of wood would you most likely use over there and i guess uh really you can get any any wood thats available but im thinking in terms of cost pine pine would probably be cheapest there   yeah yeah pine or possibly oak maybe but pine definitely   yeah oak is a lot better i think   yeah yeah making  pine seems hardly worth it because its so soft yeah yeah   its real soft and and kind of pliable and thats thats not real good but uh   its easy to work with but usually it doesnt last because it comes apart   yeah i used to live in a before i moved up to Minneapolis i i lived in a a duplex in Orlando and uh that had some work that had to be done with it some of the the door frames and things and uh i did a little bit of that and that was kind of interesting too kind of fun   umhum   but uh for the most part down there its its once again its pine or oak
