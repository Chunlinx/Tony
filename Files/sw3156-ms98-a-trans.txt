        it seems to be a a topic thats gonna probably take about a generation to uh catch on it seems or maybe a generation to two       and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up but it does seem to be a lot of habits to break i um wasnt raised as a kid on it but my kids are and so they they tended to wanna grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do and we were doing all right there until uh the price dropped out  and they werent worth anything anymore   umhum   and we it took us um almost a year to get a garbage sack full we just dont drink that many so as far as at home use uh well pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of Dr Pepper or something and and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in uh at the time it was still oh about forty or fifty cents a pound and we came out with about a dollar       it just really wasnt worth it  yeah so they they realized you know well of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old that wasnt uh that was a big deal but   and a lot of hassle all year round and cans laying yeah   we decided it wasnt worth us keeping it and then um TI started keeping up with uh cans there so occasionally ill bring whatever ive got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there at least it gets back into the system but um as far as a habit at the house uh i havent started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up have yall got the individual containers yet   no i read in the paper this week where maybe i dont know if it was was i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time   hm   but i it it should be starting i would stay probably in the next month if if everything goes that uh im not sure all what were gonna have to do whether we have three separate containers i really dont understand that part on what theyve told you to separate everything   right yeah it seemed like uh if if i recall its been a long time theyre way behind schedule on that particular part of it they were fine on the green big green containers but uh seems like they said they were just gonna have a bin   umhum   and all sorts different types would go in there and then that they would sort it as as needed it it seemed that there was at the time anyway the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly   oh well   and that at at the collection sites where everythings clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it happen to do it pretty well uh those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting but when it comes down to just general purpose trash that all the houses um the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than   umhum   than having a household try it but i i dont know that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire weeks worth of trash for a house   well itd get messy too   yeah yeah   i i i know other places when they recycle they have to like wash out their glass jars and whatnot   right   and uh which were not in the habit of doing i was brought up uh you know long time ago that   thats true   they didnt even have cans they had bottles and youd return them to the the grocery store and youd get your money back and that that was all well and good and they dont seem still be doing that if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass but   right   i guess this day and age they dont   yeah       they dont do that we live next to a set of railroad tracks and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash you know break them but   umhum   uh they werent that successful so there were a lot of bottles to be returned and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted for the day and   umhum yeah and they uh people i i think kids dont appreciate maybe the value of money that its so little that they dont care they can get more somewhere else uh for a good many   yeah just a little bit of begging will   right theyre the the nickels the dimes or what i suppose it might be quarter and fifty cent pieces in these days that they would get they the kids just dont seem to to care that that much about a small amount of money   right well i wonder if   but now we we did buy a can crusher and we are crushing cans and when we buy the soda when its on sale for ninety nine cents so i would say in the last three years weve probably used a lot more cans than ever before um it was just easier   yeah   to do that than to open a large  liter bottle and then have it go flat   right yep   so thats the main reason were we sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles   where do you take your cans   well as you say it takes a while to build it up since weve had the crusher all summer we  i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we havent taken oh i think the kids when we were on vacation they said they did take them to a a recycling place probably at one of the libraries
