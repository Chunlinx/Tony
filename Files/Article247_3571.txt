                                 Broad Brushes and Sticky Enthusiasm                        Groan groan If I had a buck for each tired reference to cornfed Midwesternvirtue in the Chicago books Id buy us a retrochic jaunt to NiagaraFalls            But how would you write an introduction to such a vast topic for sucha vast readership Because of Englishs universalityand the prohibitivelyhigh cost of printing books in onecountry languages such as Danish andHebrewthese guides are used by folks of every imaginable age and nationalityThey have to appeal to Swedish grandmothers Indonesian teenagers and touristsfrom the hinterlands of New Jersey I bet the specialized guidesthe ones forchildren vegetarians gays Jews runners ethnic food buffs and so onarebetterwritten because they dont have to cast such ridiculously wide netsover subject and audience            What really irks me about the writing is its relentlessly upbeat tone Mybooks coat every museum park and hotel with a sticky layer of enthusiasmmaking the entire city uniformly and unrecognizably wonderful Flipping throughmy seven guidebooks I found not a single negative restaurant review I justcant trust anyone whos this nice            And I shouldnt Michael Jordans Restaurant which screams tourist trapso loudly that it should be carrying a camera gets rave reviews Fodorsrecommends its highquality steaks and touts Michaels rather frequentappearances and Frommers calls the food surprisingly good But the Chicagoedition of the Zagats guideswhich unlike any of the guidebooks werecovering relies on actual reader feedbackgives the restaurant astomachturning food rating of  out of a possible  and laughs that itmight be deserted if it were named for anyone else             Which brings us to a dirty industry secret Guidebook writers unlike traveljournalists are allowed to accept free meals and lodging Actually sincetheir publishing houses generally dont provide food and hotel costs they mustrely on complimentary dinners and stays which means that they notify theestablishment ahead of time that theyre coming to write a review Can youimagine the succulent steak the impeccable service the free pair of AirJordans to which the Fodors writer was probably treated at Michael JordansEven Lonely Planet the least fawning of my books coughs that its writers donot accept discounts or payments in exchange for positive coverage Ah sothey cant auction off good reviews to the highest bidder But writers canstill accept said discounts no            Discounts or no Lonely Planet is proving to be my most trusted guide Thissurprised me generally Im a big believer in matching the guidebook to thedestination and I probably would have chosen Lonely Planet to wander realjungles instead of urban ones But the book is far more practical than anyother dishing out such goodies as city bus routes the best food stands atMidway airport names and programs of favorite local radio personalities andeven the phone number of an notoriously aggressive cartowing agency Its theone book to provide more than a quick mention of the riots at the Democratic Convention or to explain how redlining segregated the city by raceLonely Planet is also the only guide with a discernible sense of humor Onsnowstorm cleanup it comments Any Chicago politician can tell you that snowis a substance sent by God to ruin political careers and because of that eachand every delicate little flake that falls on the city is seen as an invader tobe eradicated whatever the cost            The guidebooktodestination theory is why I was so harsh yesterday onFrommers shoddy survey of Chicago architecture and for the record its adifference of  pages not five and  times the amount of detailArchitecture is arguably Chicagos greatest offering both to tourists and toAmerican life in general This city has pioneered two landscapealteratingmethods of construction the balloon frame and the skyscraper fostered twodistinct schools of design and nurtured talents such as Frank Lloyd Wright andLudwig Mies van der Rohe I agree that true pilgrims will purchase anarchitecturespecific guide But by failing to devote much extra copy or careto the subject Frommers demonstated that it churns out guidebooks accordingto a set formula regardless of what is unique about its subject destinationsTravel is all about distinctiveness but I bet that the table of contents forthe Chicago book is depressingly identical to that of the Philadelphia andToronto guides            I second your call for New Yorkers to appreciate our tourists not tomention the riches they bring the city Of course we are defending ourselveshere since Americans are generally considered to be the most obnoxiousvisitors on earth I like the theory espoused in the s by the Britishessayist Clive James He said that American tourists werent actually any ruderor cruder than those from other countries Rather its that internationaltravel used to be a luxury reserved for the rich and ultramannered and ourswas the first nation wealthy enough to export our middle class            Now the middle class has been traveling for decades Air travel is aneveryday activity entire cable channels are devoted to travel and we buyenough guidebooks to support everdeepening niche titles Doesnt this suggestthat tourists are simply getting better at going places and that its time todispense with the stereotype that tourists are uncouth unchic and generallyunbearable
