                were supposed to talk about the Middle East crisis and should we be involved and uh whats it going to cost us in the long run   okay okay   are you ready   i guess so     the Middle East crisis should we be there   oh dear thats a hard one thats really hard for me because uh you know i really i have a son thats sixteen and i think you know eventually you know hell be of of drafting age and i think gosh do i want him to go and yet im proud to be an American and i know that we have a a country that you know people would give anything to live in a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they dont have and yet i dont know whether id be willing to give his life for for this country and yet and yet i know that i that and i i when i was in school it was always the tired the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism but im not sure that that thats the reason anymore i mean not sure that communism is is as strong as it once was and im not sure that that thats the reason why were like we were in Vietnam supposedly so   well you realize why we were in the Middle East why we invaded Iraq why we were in Saudi why we attacked Kuwait and we were why we are still fighting Iraq   well with the well its because of oil isnt it   no i really believe its because i think it has something to do with oil dont get me wrong   umhum   but Saddam is Saddam is a madman   oh yes i agree with that   anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people   oh yeah well yeah hes uh a bad person very definitely yeah   and obviously that has something to do with it   oh sure sure   and and if you know i can see that he was in Kuwait   umhum   Kuwait was the non aggressor   umhum umhum   and the Saudis are our allies we have several treaties and several alliances with the Saudis that range back for probably forty years   yeah many years   you know theyve been our friends through thick and thin   umhum   they were at the Saudi border   well umhum   and ready to storm into Saudi shouldnt we try and help our friends   certainly but what at at what cost you know thats the uh the thing it came out it came out wonderfully supposedly i mean everything is and we won   what did we lose forty one Americans lives   yeah and that thats wonderful but what if if that wasnt the case what if we would have lost thousands of young men would that would it have been too much of a price to pay for that i dont know see and i think there are a lot of things that we dont know but   oh of course our government is full of liars thieves and crooks   the American people oh sure well and theres a lot that we   and thats our own fault because we elected them   yeah i think thats true but i think theres a lot that we the public doesnt need to know i think theres some things we shouldnt know just for national national security sake and i you know i think if we did know i think there would be a lot more chaos than there is because i dont i dont think people could handle it so i think there are things that we should not know the masses shouldnt know but i also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too   you know its uh i went on jury duty here not long back   umhum   and uh one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if if you could believe a lawyer or if a lawyers reputation was so tainted that he couldnt be believed   umhum   and one guy being selected snickered and couldnt keep his head up you know and   umhum   the guy said well can you share it with us what you what you find so funny he says well i already told you my sons a lawyer he said that when he graduated the day after his bar examine there in Houston   umhum umhum   he told him dad you know how to tell when a lawyers lying to you his lips are moving   oh my gosh  oh   and ninety percent of all politicians are lawyers   oh i have a lawyer background yeah have a law background youre right   so by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars the fact that they take our money and dont do what we think is right makes them thieves   yeah thats true  yeah thats true   so whats it going to cost us in the long run there in Saudi are we going to lose more lives there   see and i dont know i dont know i cant tell the future thats what scares me so much about it i mean i thought the war was going to go on and on i really was surprised when it ended so quickly and   well we hit them with more in one month than we used in three years the last three years of Vietnam   i know yeah   and whenever you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume   umhum umhum   theres nothing they can do about it   right   you know its not like we threw eight aircraft over there all by ourselves and said this is wrong   umhum umhum   we were there the Brits were there the French were there this is with UN backing   um right umhum   and to some level even Russia was behind us   umhum right they were   so honestly if there is was a well perceived war world wide this was it   oh sure sure   but what i cant understand is then many of the Kuwaiti youth didnt fight wouldnt fight   umhum   its okay for us to go expend our youths   umhum   lives like so much water in the desert   yeah yeah   and its not their job to fight for their own land   yeah that is very  its very strange uh and yet you know see thats another thing that thats difficult for Americans their culture is so much different than ours that you know ive heard from many people that we could not even begin begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours and um they just dont think the same way we do their culture is completely different and almost opposite   and really from all i can indicate from all indications the Iraqi beliefs if you will are more similar to our own   umhum       yeah thats true   and the Kuwaitis arent even helping rebuild their own country the Kuwaiti young wont rebuild anything they wont work   huh i didnt realize that   yeah it was on the news last night   oh my word   the uh US Army is doing it all   hum yeah  see and thats another question you have to ask is this our job is are we should we still be there even you know i dont know the answers to that those questions i think theyre tough and i think you know its i dont know that anybody knows the answers i think they know what they believe but im not sure they really are one hundred percent sure   well they talked to uh one Kuwaiti woman yesterday   umhum   and her biggest concern in life was that she couldnt get a housekeeper   youre kidding thats unreal   and do you have a housekeeper   no no and dont plan on having one either ever so   well i wouldnt mind having one   oh id love to have one but you know   but you know id like to uh make sure that i have a job tomorrow first   sure sure thats right thats right     it it astound you realize that the Kuwaiti government gives every Kuwaiti man woman and child money   uh no i wasnt i didnt wasnt aware of that no   for nothing   for doing nothing yeah   for nothing for for for doing nothing for sitting on there keisters   umhum umhum   ooh that ought to give their programming trouble shouldnt it       uh they do nothing they hand them money each year and theyre part of
