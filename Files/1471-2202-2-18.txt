                    Background        Febrile seizures are the most prevalent type of seizures        experienced by children affecting up to  of the worlds        population     Although most febrile seizures are        benign and do not require treatment they are distressing        to parents and in a few circumstances can increase the        risk of subsequent epilepsy     In clinical practice        therapy for febrile seizures presently is unsatisfactory        since clinical data are insufficient to document efficacy        of most antiepileptic drugs     The most commonly used        drug phenobarbital has significant deleterious effects on        learning and behavior        A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of        febrile seizures might lead to new strategies of prevention        or treatment     Recent work has identified several        genes associated with familial febrile seizure tendencies              Some of these genes code for ion channels that        govern excitability of nerve tissue We recently published        a study of the characteristic hyperthermic responses        represented as epileptiformlike population spike activity        accompanied by spreading depression SD in a rat        hippocampal slice which may serve as an         in vitro model of febrile seizures            The hyperthermic response was agedependent        occurring almost exclusively in young but not newborn        rats The primary underlying abnormality in this model was        inability of neuronal tissue properly to regulate        extracellular potassium concentrations During heating of        the slice extracellular potassium concentrations rose        transiently from the normal  mM to as high as  mM and        extracellular field potential shitted about  mV negative        a reversible condition known as SD During the early phases        of SD neurons burst synchronously in a pattern analogous        to seizures Since hyperthermic epileptiformlike        population bursts exhibited the frequency of  oscillations         Hz we hypothesized that GABA         A receptorgoverned  oscillations might        underlie the cellular basis of hyperthermic        epileptiformlike population spike activity        The  frequency oscillations  Hz are        characteristic of responses to sensory input measured by        cortical EEG     In the hippocampal slice preparation         oscillations can be evoked by brief high frequency        tetanic stimuli to region CA        The        extracellular field potential response during these        oscillations takes the form of a train of population spikes        in stratum pyramidal at  and   Hz frequencies            Intracellular recordings during  oscillations induced        by tetanic stimulation reveal a slow membrane        depolarization in conjunction with GABA         A receptormediated inhibitory        postsynaptic potentials      This synaptic        inhibitionbased  activity entrains action potential        generation in pyramidal neurons leading to the population        spikes at  band frequencies The specific GABA         A receptor antagonist bicuculline        blocks the  oscillations      an action that can be        modeled by simulated neuronal networks     The  band        oscillations appear to play an important role in generation        of ictal epileptiform activity in hippocampal slices            This study explores the role of  oscillations in        epileptiform activity in the hyperthermic rat hippocampal        slice                    Results                  Hyperthermiainduced epileptiformlike population          spike activity          More than  of slices heated to C showed a          febrileseizure like event represented as initial          epileptiformlike population bursts followed by SDs          Figure Ashows a typical febrile seizurelike event          elicited by heating a hippocampal slice from  to          C The epileptiform discharges demonstrated a          frequency of  Hz Fig B within the  Hz           oscillation range Summary of data from  slices showed          that   of hyperthermic epileptiformlike          population spike activity fired at a frequency range          between  Hz Fig CD with a mean oscillation          frequency of    mean  SE n                            Comparison of posttetanic  oscillation and          hyperthermic population spike activity          Figure shows the comparison between hyperthermic          population spike activity and posttetanic           oscillations In standard artificial cerebrospinal fluid          ACSF a tetanic stimulation at  Hz  sec  mA          for  ms  trains elicited  and  frequency          population spikes visible both with intracellular and          extracellular recordings In the same slice heating to          C  Ab evoked population oscillation very similar to          those of posttetanic  oscillations Power spectrum          analysis of the population of responses among all slices          showed similar frequency peak of hyperthermic and          posttetanic gamma oscillations Fig B Among all          slices hyperthermic oscillations occurred at a frequency          of    Hz mean  SE n   and posttetanic          gamma oscillations at    mean  SE n            These two frequencies do not significantly differ Fig          C                          Effects of high intensity tetanic          stimulation          Results from this and our previous study showed that          the SD always followed hyperthermic bursts     but          tetanic stimulation induced only  oscillations in the          absence of SD Fig  Therefore we investigated          whether highintensity tetanic stimulation could induce           oscillations followed by SD Fig Aillustrates a weak           oscillation of field potential in response to tetanic          stimulation at  mA Tetanic stimulation at  mA          induced a strong  oscillation with a large field burst          amplitude and longlasting depolarization Fig B In           of  tested slices tetanic stimulation at  mA          induced not only prominent  oscillations but also SDs          Fig C These posttetanic depolarizations had          duration and time course very similar to those of          hyperthermic SDs Fig A Ab                          Effects of bicuculline          We utilized the specific GABA           A receptor antagonist bicuculline          methiodide BMI to ascertain whether  oscillations          were dependent upon GABAergic mechanisms The effect of          BMI on the field potential in region CA is shown in Fig           Bathapplied BMI  M changed the single evoked          population spike to multiple spikes in a reversible          manner In the same slice tetanic stimulation delivered          in control artificial cerebrospinal fluid ACSF induced          typical  oscillations and these  oscillations were          abolished by addition of BMI to the perfusate           oscillations recovered partially by  minutes of wash in          ACSF Figure Bshows another case in which high intensity          of tetanic stimulation was applied to elicit           oscillations and SDs Addition of  M BMI reversibly          blocked  oscillations but not the SD          In a second set of experiments using five slices Fig           we examined the effects of BMI on hyperthermic          epileptiformlike population bursts Bathapplication of           M BMI for  min abolished posttetanic           oscillations After several minutes of exposure to BMI          slices demonstrated rhythmic spontaneous bursts of          population spikes Fig B indicating that GABA           A receptors have been blocked by BMI          Under these conditions heating of the slice only evoked          the SD without the initial population spikes Fig          C                          Effects of kynurenic acid and QX           Figure Ashows the effect of the ionotropic glutamate          receptor antagonist kynurenic acid KynA  mM on           oscillations KynA dramatically attenuated evoked          synaptic transmission but failed to prevent          hyperthermiainduced  oscillations and slow SDs          suggesting that excitatory synaptic transmission is not          necessary for hyperthermic  oscillations and SDs In          Fig B  mM QX was incorporated into the recording          electrode The action potentials were blocked by          intracellular QX diffusion Heating the slice to C          elicited a  oscillation followed by a slow SD in the          extracellular field recording However the          intracellularlyrecorded hyperthermic  oscillation          disappeared and was replaced by a smooth depolarization          Fig B                            Discussion                  Gamma oscillations underlie hyperthermic          epileptiformlike population spikes          Gamma oscillations are defined as coherent cortical          oscillations at   Hz band frequency frequencies          in           in vivo and           in vitro models In hippocampal          slice preparations  oscillations can be triggered by          high frequency tetanic stimuli called posttetanic           oscillations        In addition to          posttetanic  oscillations the  oscillations also can          be elicited by metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists          carbacol or free extracellular Mg       In this          study we report that  oscillations can occur in a model          of a clinical disorder namely hyperthermia Hyperthermic          epileptiformlike population spikes occur within the band          of  frequencies  Hz Posttetanic  oscillations          can be mimicked by hyperthermic stimulation in the same          slice Tetanic stimulation at high intensity induces          initial  oscillations followed by a slow SD which          resembles hyperthermic epileptiformlike population          spikes followed by a slow SD Finally both posttetanic           oscillations and hyperthermic epileptiformlike          population spikes were completely blocked by a GABA           A receptor antagonist BMI This          experimental evidence suggests that the GABA           A receptorgoverned  oscillations          underlie the hyperthermic population spikes in our           in vitro model system                          Possible mechanisms of hyperthermic           oscillation          Accumulating lines of evidence demonstrate that the          genesis mechanisms for posttetanic  oscillations          involve slow GABA           A receptormediated depolarization          extracellular K elevation and field effects                 The present study showed that these three major          factors also underlie hyperthermic  oscillations As          shown in Fig Aand A the hyperthermic  oscillations          always overlie the slow membrane depolarizations For          posttetanic  oscillations the slow depolarizations          were mediated by tetanic stimulationinduced GABAergic          depolarizing action        This GABAergic          depolarization is attributed to the tetanic          stimulationinduced accumulation of intracellular          chloride    and extracellular potassium     For          hyperthermic  oscillations heating causes a Na K          pump failure     in turn resulting in the          accumulation of intracellular Na and Cl  as well as          extracellular K  finally causing a slow membrane          depolarization In our previous report the extracellular          K indeed elevated dramatically during          hyperthermiainduced epileptiformlike population spikes          and SDs     Field effects further contribute to          posttetanic  oscillations      High Frequency          tetanic stimuli leads to cellular swelling               increasing extracellular resistance According to Ohms          law this increases the voltage deflection recorded for a          given current flowing through this extracellular          resistance Current generated by the active population          travels through the resistances of the extracellular          space and of the nearby inactive cells therefore          producing the extracellular population spikes and          meanwhile depolarizing the inactive cells In this          manner inactive cells are brought closer to threshold          enhancing their opportunity to firing together                The extracellular resistance is the major determinant          of fieldeffect strength     Since the extracellular          volume fraction in CA stradium pyramidal is only           compared with approximately  in CA and granule cells              the CA pyramidal cells are particularly          susceptible to field effects The accumulation of          extracellular K during hyperthermic SDs depolarizes          membrane potential which triggers initial           oscillations Cell swelling reduces the extracellular          space which triggers slow SDs     Fig Aand A          In Fig A after blockade of synaptic transmission by          kynurenic acid  mM heating the slice still induced          oscillation followed by SD suggesting that a          nonsynaptic mechanism local field effect may be          involved in the generation of hyperthermic oscillations          and SDs Figure Bdemonstrated that hyperthermic          oscillations disappear in the presence of an          intracellularly delivered Na channel blocker QX            mM                          Gamma oscillations and seizures          Epileptic activity can result from an imbalance          between glutamatergic excitation and GABAergic          inhibition However this simple balance model has been          challenged by findings that GABAergic transmission          remains effective in some epilepsy models in          epileptogenic human tissue           and          by current findings of the excitatory effects of GABA                Therefore the GABA excitatory effects may          work as a possible ictogenic mechanism under some special          condition such as tetanic stimulation Indeed recently          Khling et al reported that under epileptogenic          condition free Mg in ACSF  band oscillations arise          from GABAergic depolarizations and that this activity may          lead to the generation of ictal discharges     It          has been reported that prolonged periods of           oscillations are associated with temporal lobe seizures          in           in vivo rats     Furthermore          human EEG studies with subdural recording electodes          showed that a  band oscillation could be recorded at the          start of typical seizure activity     In this          respect the hyperthermic  oscillations may also play a          critical role in generation of neuronal epileptiform          activity The extent to which the hyperthermic slice          serves as a model of febrile seizures remains to be          determined If  oscillations do prove to be important in          clinical febrile seizures then future work might          profitably examine the therapeutic potential of mild          disinhibition to disrupt inhibitory GABAmediated          synchrony at the start of ictal activity                            Conclusions        In the         in vitro hippocampal slice        preparation hyperthermiainduced epileptiformlike        population spikes are at  band frequencies and can be        blocked by BMI Therefore the GABA         A receptorgoverned  oscillations        underlie the hyperthermic population spikes in immature        hippocampal slices                    Materials and methods        Experiments were performed on transverse hippocampal        slices prepared from SpragueDawley rats ages  to         days Rats were anesthetized with halothane and        decapitated The brain tissue was removed rapidly and        placed in iced artificial cerebrospinal fluid ACSF Brain        tissue was then glued to a cryotome and a few          transverse slices were cut through the hippocampal        formations Slices were allowed to incubate and recover for        at least an hour in room temperature ACSF comprised of the        following composition mM NaCl  KCl  NaHCO           MgSO           NaH          PO           CaCl           glucose

nylon net at the interface Carbogen  O          plus  CO           was bubbled across the upper surface        of the slice Temperature was regulated by a feedback        circuit accurate to   C Baseline temperature was        C After verification of evoked population spike        stability for three consecutive stimuli over a time course        of  minutes bath temperature setpoint was increased        to C and notation was made of actual temperature        measured by a thermistor probe        Extracellular field potentials were recorded with a        borosilicate glass micropipette pulled to a tip diameter of          filled with  M sodium chloride and with resistance        approximately  M Intracellular recordings were        performed with a pulledglass fine tip micropipette           with resistance approximately  M filled with         M potassium acetate Hyperthermic spreading depressions        SDs were considered to have occurred when all of the        following conditions were met  At least  mV        extracellular negativity  Duration of extracellular        negativity at the halfheight of at least  seconds         Loss of evoked field in CA and recovery of field to at        least  of control amplitude within  minutes of cooling        to baseline temperature Electrophysiological data were        stored on a computer Axon scope and played back on a        laser printer Slow potentials including extracellular        field during SD also were recorded on a continuous        rectilinear chart recorder To measure oscillation        frequency we chose a slice oscillation range beginning at         ms then used the frequency count function of the        Origin program to get average frequency from each slice        Chemicals used in the experiment consisted of bicuculline        methiodide BMI kynurenic acid Sigma St Louis MO and        QX Tocris All animal experiments were in accord with        Institutional animal welfare
