                well Pat what do you wear to work   well it depends on the day  and what i feel like i dont have a      umhum   a real like strict dress code as far as you know suits and everything i can wear pretty much what i want as long as its decent   uhhuh yeah   you know i can wear blue jeans i can wear a dress i can dress up   umhum   so it just depends on the mood im in and where im going you know if i got a customer coming in then ill dress up If not you know hey   yeah my my schedule yeah my schedules pretty similar i um i teach so on the days i teach i teach a couple days a week so whenever i teach i try and wear a tie   blue jeans uhhuh   but uh but thats i wear normally just wear like   well thats all   khaki pants and a shirt and tie i never wear a sport coat thats ridiculous but then most of the time you know then i just have to uh i can wear jeans or   yeah     or just casual clothes i think they i think they frown on shorts and sneakers but i think i could probably get away with jeans and sneakers uh   oh we cant even wear shorts   yeah i could well if i dont have to see students and uh im just in my lab and no one sees me then im probably okay   oh no shorts are no no go here you cant wear shorts you cant wear uh like halters and stuff like that and to me really you cant wear anything thats   umhum yeah uhhuh   uh outside clothing you know like for the summer time and uh in the winter time i guess you can pretty much wear what you want as long as its presentable thats what i consider   right umhum yeah well that makes sense uhhuh   you know just dont get too outrageous here   yeah as long as youre clean and yeah that makes a lot of sense   and not too dressy like you know after five stuff ive never some of them get sort of touchy too so     uhhuh yeah thats true   and uh the women you see you have you cant wear halters or nothing like that i mean at all   umhum   like even if you got a jacket on you got to have a bra on and all that stuff   yeah   which no big deal  to me  so but as far as dress for dressing for work that i dont it doesnt bother me id prefer if we had a uniform   yeah umhum   i really would to save a lot of money if you had a uniform   yeah that would matter that would   because when i while i was in the service and see i had clothes that i could wear whenever i got ready but you had to wear that uniform to work and so you knew what you was going to wear wasnt no what am i going to wear today   umhum yeah and you dont have to worry about fashion and stuff too you know buying nicer clothes and things yeah that makes a lot of sense   nope thats right i wouldnt mind having a uniform people think im crazy but   well you know my mothers a waitress and she has like three uniforms that she sort of wears in rotation and she likes that you know   uhhuh thats right yeah because it it doesnt mess up your clothes either   umhum yeah your your   you know because like at work if something gets on my clothes and ruins it its just ruined   umhum thats right where the the uniform as as a waitress now your uniform really it might be a little expensive when you first buy it but you know thats it doesnt its made of polyester so it doesnt stain like cotton or wool would you know   yeah well see if you work at a fast food because i work at Wendys sometime on the weekends   umhum   and they give you the uniform so it its supplied so you know if it messes up hey its their  uniform they messed it up you only wear it you know to Wendys so if you mess it up at Wendys   yeah umhum yeah umhum   theres no big deal   yeah well that makes sense yeah that makes a lot of sense   but you know uh of course TI im sure if they ever went to uniforms theyre not going to just give them to you   umhum thats something     but now some of the people around here do wear uniforms you know the facility guys or maintenance crew and the truck drivers and all of them have have TI   uhhuh yeah umhum thats probably the people that probably the people that are prone towards getting dirty   yeah the yeah thats what they are too   yeah with the type of job that you have you might be getting dirty either either manual label labor where youll perspire heavily or uh or where youll come in contact with uh oil and things   yeah yeah because theyre always in the high space up you know working on stuff   right umhum yeah   and all i do is i sit at a desk and program but thats not going to get me dirty  so   yeah thats what yeah i find too um if youre a programmer do you get cold does your hows your air conditioning work   well uh mine it works pretty good i have a sweater at work because sometimes it gets chilly and everything you know but uh but the whole buildings like that im not in a clean room or nothing so   umhum yeah umhum oh oh see yeah because my office is really heavily air conditioned because i guess they they keep the air conditioning on all the time where they dont in a lot of the other offices because of the computers and um   umhum yeah well see i just have my the whole building is computerized okay and so its all air conditioned but my my computer is like by my desk and then   right umhum yeah umhum   you go to another cube and then somebody elses but uh the computer rooms now theyre real cold and i dont have to work in one of those   yeah yeah see sometimes my air conditioning gets really cold i think its probably because my office is one of the only ones air conditioned in a   yeah   a large area you know probably probably thats why i get because sometimes boy ill get ill freeze its so cold in there especially when its ninety degrees outside   oh well then yeah its just no matter and seems like it kicks in extra hard   right yeah and blows on my legs man one time i left i thought i was going to i thought i was going to freeze the one day i wore shorts to the office because i was just going to be in my lab and i wanted to be comfortable because i thought the air conditioning would be all turned off you know and jeez if it wasnt the air conditioner wasnt blowing it wasnt fifty five degrees yeah   umhum cold huh i think the reason why we cant wear shorts is because then the women and the men would be in competition   thats true a lo t of those nice looking legs yeah   see and then you guys couldnt work   yeah i was just laughing its funny that um we get clothing you know because uh im im in graduate school i only work part time and my wife   uhhuh   we recently we decided wed buy a sewing machine because that would be a good investment you know and we could make clothes and save money so shes made me shorts   uhhuh   well of course you know she makes shorts and she says here i made you shorts and theyre uh theyre a nice material nice checkered plaid material here but but she didnt put a fly in them  you know the pattern she bought didnt have a fly so its like well theyre fine for her but uh you know theyre just everyday summer shorts you know but theres no fly     yeah yeah you kidding me those are real good for men to wear so   yeah theyre not for a guy that really changes your the whole way you do your day  so i was laughing i thought that was funny you know because well i i was up at the office and everybody says oh jeez those new shorts they i think they were laughing because they are sort of a wild   thats right   color you know but i was just crossing through to get my mail and stuff   umhum now my boss now he he golfs every weekend   uhhuh   so hes got different outfits       and he cracks me up with these color codes   yeah   the uh his aqua colors and i tell him see only people like you on the golf course wears them colors  thats the only place you could probably wear it you know     thats probably true without being laughed at uhhuh yeah im not ive never i laugh at the wardrobe my fatherinlaw wears golf clothes and its the only time he puts on those funny clothes yeah he doesnt wear those in the back yard or casually around   yeah uhhuh now oh yeah yep no just when they go to play golf   just when they go to play golf they wear those funny clothes hats true   now i think IBM now IBM has a strict dress code when i uh i went to apply for them before i came here and they men they used to have to they have to wear white shirts i dont care what their job is they have to wear a suit   umhum umhum yeah   and see to me thats ridiculous because youre working with all that xerox machines and stuff like that all that black ink huhuh no give me a break dude no i think them them people should be able to wear blue jeans   umhum yeah umhum   you know because that stuff gets really bad   yeah but they have that dress code i i you know i also know um EDS   yeah   uh EDS i have some friends that interviewed with EDS and uh you know they interviewed while they were in college so they didnt really have a suit with them and the woman said to them well your second interview would be   they have a dress uhhuh   here but  oh and on that day i would say wear a suit because i guess they just had on a sport coat and the one guy even had like um a gel in his hair you know his hair was sort of slicked back   uhhuh yeah   you know which is popular with the kids and and she says oh and you know uh i wouldnt put the gel in my hair you know in other words youre to borrow a suit two or three piece suit   yeah   with no gel in your hair you know and that would she made it pretty clear during the interview you know the the first interview how they were supposed to dress for the second interview you know   yeah God   so i thought that was really funny too you know   i dont think that should be your hair i mean yeah i guess so because some people do get wild with their hair   umhum umhum   you know with these haircuts now  some of these haircuts boy i tell you i       i dont know   i dont think my hair has probably changed in ten years   its funny because my son is fifteen   umhum   and hes into this fading crap you know   he hes into what     the fade like it looks like no hair uh   uh oh really     wait a minute and so he has hair though he can i can only let him fade it a little bit   uhhuh   i tell him hes got to have hair all over or none one or the other you know youre not going to be going around with nine hundred ninety nine parts in your head and peoples names carved in your head and       no no  huhuh  and not going no where with me hes not   yeah i see them i see the kids with the the things cutting their hair all the time     i told him no no humum we cant have that       im not one of them liberated parents i guess i dont know     well thats you know my dad was the same way i thought it was really funny back in the nineteen seventies my brother came home with cowboy boots on while was growing up in Pittsburgh and my dad called my brother Tex for about the next four weeks   yeah uhhuh   you know and other than calling him Tex he barely talked to him because he was so angry he was wearing cowboy boots   well down here thats no big deal   yeah i thought it was just so funny you know my dad were not in Texas       it was very funny you know and all that over a pair of cowboy boots and it was finally my mother convinced him she you know the cowboy boots give you about uh an inch lift you know they sort of have a heavier heel   yeah   and she and were all short the whole familys short so she said well Sam if he wears cowboys that gives him another inch and it just may be
