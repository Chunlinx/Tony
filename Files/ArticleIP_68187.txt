estimates that between  million and  million peoplewere killed by Communist regimes What causes more of a stir is the booksassertion that given the nature and the magnitude of the crimes committed inits name communism was fully the equal of Nazism as one of the supreme evilsof our century and the question it raises of whether the history of thetwentieth century hasnt given us objective and final proof  that human natureitself is fallen and twisted at its core Scammell Click here toread about the books reception when it was published in France
