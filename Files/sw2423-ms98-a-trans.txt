        so do you have any hobbies     well right at the present time nothing real special i kind of like gardening and im kind of into camping and you know vacationing that sort of thing i dont have any real serious   yeah uh im an avid gardener um   oh okay i think youre   um i consider that a hobby i dont know they were like suggesting like handcraft things which i guess thats a really true true hobby   umhum yeah   i i i think anything that you enjoy um it doesnt really have to matter i mean it could be working on cars could be your hobby really   yeah well yeah i kind of enjoy doing that a little bit too   well did i   no i i guess if you make money at it it becomes a vocation then   yeah well i dont know i told my husband i said you go out some to work on the car its not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong i says you go pay to have someone do it   yeah   because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something   i guess as far north as you are if you like gardening youve still got a couple months to go havent you   oh yeah um well right now we um start our seeds inside   uhhuh oh yeah thats right you would yeah   well start them inside and uh   in cold frames or whatever the   yeah well we usually start them right in the house my sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck and   umhum   and the wind a wind storm come and knock it down but shes had really good luck i mean it next month well actually it if you if you start it in a couple weeks   huh   and you can get your plants outside pretty much the end of May you can leave them outside you might put them in the ground just the first week of June   uhhuh yeah   but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of May      yeah ive ive lived in in Texas and New Mexico most of my life but i did once i spent one winter in North Dakota   oh   and i i remember that it was on into May before it really started warming up   yeah well well we live we live really close to Lake Champlain which is in the Champlain Valley so were a little were about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts so   and uh oh yeah okay because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit yeah   yeah we are a little lucky well my brother lives ten miles from here and he gets frost and his crop gets killed   youre at yeah youre right across the uh lake from what Plattsburgh   yep from Plattsburgh Air Force Base   oh yeah yeah       yeah i had i had a cousin that was stationed there   but um   Plattsburgh for a while he he remembers lots of snow   yeah Plattsburghs kind of a its uh its uh depressed economically   oh really oh   when you go across the lake um i dont know why we have so much going for us i really dont im just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at Digital and theyve never had well theyve had layoffs recently but when we got hired here no no never any layoffs never never     yeah   and now were looking at serious i i mean im a technician when they start getting rid of technicians   yeah yeah well im im working for TI Texas Instruments down here     well i interviewed with them but i didnt want to go to Texas   oh yeah oh   even though my um mothers people are from Georgia   oh yeah   yeah well i guess we have to get back to hobbies since   yeah were getting to where straying i guess yeah   stick on the subject well interesting thing that i do is with gardening uh my sister grows flowers that you can dry   umhum   and you can make flower uh dried flower arrangements and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun and we made some really nice Christmas wreaths with uh dried red flowers and dried white flowers and uh eucalyptus   hum yeah   you you know what eucalyptus is its   yeah yeah the they sell uh its sold in the hobby stores and nurseries its got a kind of a peculiar smell to it but   yeah its got a smell yeah at first im like oh how why do people like this but it it is kind of a nice smell after a while people put them in   yeah i didnt realize what it was for a while id walk into a room where some of that and id wonder what is that you know and then one day i i realized that it was eucalyptus     yeah its its its like a fad thing i i dont know its ive never heard of it in the last five years ive used so much of it that   yes yeah   i hate to   thats the stuff that koala bears eat in Australia or something   yeah it is   maybe thats why theyre         so slow i guess theyre stoned on the stuff or something   yeah it it looks really potent potent stuff   yeah   but uh its yeah i think its the greatest stuff in the world though its jeez they i make all kinds of things with it we make all kinds of things just with dried flowers i i almost want to start a business doing it but i dont i im so uh timid when it comes to starting a business     yeah thats thats a big step yeah   yeah it is especially with the being in on the creative aspect aspect on the crafty end   yeah uh   you know after a while you make some stuff then you start looking at it go boy this this is kind of ugly       but i know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby um he does it believe it or not i wouldnt imagine why but to get out of the house away from his wife   um hum   because hes a seasonal worker he works in the construction and up here its almost a pattern i mean you see your fathers do it then their sons do it what they do is they work construction then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter   yeah   and uh this guy was going nuts and his uh son built him a garage and got him some uh oh i dont know what the equipments called but planes and thi ngs   umhum shapes and planes and   and set set him up and he he makes all kinds of furniture for um his kids and he makes uh uh like little kids furniture   routers   he gets right into it and uh   there was a program on TV down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little       little companies of one and two guys you know up there especially this particular one i think was in Maine and New Hampshire where out in the just kind of out in these little towns theyd be i n they may be the same kind of people youre talking about you know theyve theyve got twelve weeks to do something and they theyre making furniture and just you know things like that during the winter and then they go off and do other things during the summer   yeah its a its a really good thing   so yeah yeah yeah   yeah because its keeping him sane and plus its keeping his marriage so and and plus hes getting on in his years now hes hes not that old but hes getting   yeah yeah   to the point where he needed an extra boost to to do something like that and uh its really its its uh hard work i couldnt imagine taking lumber raw lumber and trying to make something out of it he dowels   yeah that would be really tough you know like say the   he dowels everything and its all got to line up  and uh i dont think he goofs too much i dont to see too much scrap around   oh man yeah yeah yeah thats thats something now our temperatures down here were starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties and uh so and uh so as far as you know planting outdoor stuff matter of fact tonight i just got through i was planting some some trees out back tonight and uh   God im envious   this is uh its really nice out tonight almost hated to come in   is it going to be is it going to be really dry it are you plant are no i always plant trees in the fall i dont know why so the the cold weather can kill them   yeah these were uh trees that that wintered   but i guess   i dont dont know where they came from they come out of nurseries mostly in Missouri and places like that and they come down here and theyll sit in the nurseries here and theyll go ahead and and uh leaf out so what im planting or actually transplanting is a tree thats or trees that are already leafed out   oh thats good i guess they they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall um   yeah mostly i think in a place where its really cold they do it in the fall let them winter   yeah   yeah through the fall but uh down here well its done both ways it it just kind of depends on what youre what youre planting but uh all the shrubs and   yeah and uh when you have time to do it   yeah   my sister does uh flower gardens she gets right into it   uhhuh   she spends lots of money on them and i guess a lot of people do do do that they landscape their whole house with flower gardens shes got like   yeah   just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and bulch bark uh tree bark all over her lawn      yeah flowers during the summer down here the the normal kind of flowers theres very few of them thatll really do well everything does real well here in the spring until about oh first part of June and then the real the heat sets in   it gets it   and June July August are you know most of the those kind of plants just are just barely staying alive let alone make flowers   do you have a lot of shade trees around your house or is it   uh were in a relatively new area were kind of out of uh the natural tree area were kind of up on a on a higher on a slope   so you dont have a lot of tree coverage   so we dont have where we are right now there are very few trees this was this was this was pasture land but down the down the hill here a little ways there are parks that are look like jungles you know theyre really   because going going to make yeah see um where uh where my uh well my grandmother passed away but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees and they just shade everything   umhum now where is this   uh its in Georgia its yeah its right outside of Macon and and its just a i like the way that i like the way that idea of the south is   in Georgia yeah yeah   but when i think of Texas i think of nothing but no trees and just grass   well i tell you what now see East Texas theres two parts of Texas East Texas and North Texas Atlanta and Dallas are almost identical in every way weather and everything   yeah   the two cities are very very identical so if you were familiar with Atlanta   so its that dry heat   uh uh well no its its uh not dry at all it its humid   well where is it is it Houston wasnt it Houstons humid   Houston Houston is awful     yeah   Houston is really humid now   its humid
