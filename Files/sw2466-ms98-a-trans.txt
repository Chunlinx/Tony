        okay     okay that made a nice ugly sound   yeah your name is Lynn Linda okay   so Linda uhhuh so it sounds like you like to read   yeah i i read quite a bit i probably dont read as much as i would like to   i dont read as much as i would like to either im im a single mom but i ive always loved reading what do you like to read   uhhuh um well um im a  im a counselor a therapist by trade so most of my books are um i guess what youd call selfimprovement type of books   oh well thats what ive been reading lately a lot of um my interests switch around dramatically i used to read just mainly fiction fiction and now i like like a said ive read a lot of self self help books   uhhuh what kind of things have you read   oh i read all kinds of things for um helping people uh survive a divorce uh The Road Less Traveled was probably one of my favorites have you read that   umhum umhum i i havent gotten through it yet   you havent   no   okay well what would you recommend      um as as far as dealing with divorce   oh im im kind of getting that one past me but a good self help book   good self help well um probably the best one that i i know of and i work with all the time is called Search for Significance   yeah um that sounds good   its by Robert Magee and its one that that we use in our work uh its probably one youd find in in like a Christian book store um   uhhuh   i dont know what the chains are down there maybe in the mall family book store something like that   uhhuh im writing it down that does sound thats sound really good um what kind of counseling do you do or should we stay on the topic of books   um probably should stay on the topic but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that i read  i um   umhum   a therapist for Rossa its a Christian treatment organization   oh   and because of that i see i work with adolescents specifically so i i see a lot of kids with with various problems right now some of the things im working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse so a lot of the books ive been reading uh have to do with with helping them get through uh those issues   oh i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves theyre at a bad stage anyway and then to have to deal with sexual abuse would be terrible as a teen   umhum   thats uh boy uh that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that   well sometimes its rewarding and and sometimes its a struggle   oh im sure im sure um what other is is that just the only type of reading youve been doing or do you have you read any good novels lately   um  i guess i ive got so many books like that that i need to read its its hard for me to do a lot of uh reading yeah reading just for enjoyment   just joy reading yeah i i i hear you there thats for sure   in fact   um i guess the last book book ive read um my oldest daughter   uhhuh   uh had to read Lost Horizons for her English class and i just realized i had never read it growing up so i just finished reading that  for enjoyment   umhum hum thats neat   and it was it was good um she shes not didnt enjoy it much so i didnt get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her but uh i thought it was real interesting   yeah ive always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college um because i enjoyed some of those stories so much but i never seem to have the time to do that kind of reading   umhum umhum i know yeah um im trying to think of some of my other favorite books but uh i i keep lists i must have a list of oh two hundred three hundred books that i want to read it just like oh i want to read that and i write it down oh   uhhuh yeah ive got a a stack next to my bed  i i tend to get a a little bit of ways in a book and then i i get distracted and or have to start on another one and   so do i   its pretty tough to keep up with i was trying to think of of of ive got a copy of The Road Less Traveled but i was trying to think theres another Scott Pack book that ive got that i had read so i was   uh he he also wrote People of the Lie and   yeah thats the one i was thinking of   yeah i i bought that one and i didnt get into involved in that one as well theres another one he wrote that even sounds better and its kind of uh the whole concept of global peace you know its like and communities building communities and uh   umhum   someone just recently said something really neat about that uh i got involved in uh Beginning Experience Weekends and uh it was one of the people from there that uh that said that his latest book and i dont cant recall the name of it is just excellent and his whole idea is we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects and he did uh mention Beginning Experience Weekends as one of the you know one of the places so i have um   hum thats interesting   yeah it it really was a a a real fun books bunch of books that i read uh the beginning of last year were um the author of Jonathan Jonathan Livingston Seagull Seagull i cant think of his name right now pardon me   umhum is it Swift Swift   uh no uh        oh itll itll come to me but he wrote he wrote the Illusions the Illusions Illusions and A Bridge Over Time uh   uhhuh   A Bridge to Forever those are really really mind expanding books his concepts are so different than what i would have ever dreamed of   hum   i cant think of what his name is right right off the bat though but uh they they they were fun they were real just books for fun   umhum      have you been involved on the switchboard long   um not very long i i really just started   uhhuh how did you get involved   my wife has been working for TI   oh i see im a former uh a former TIer i just recently quit and so uh i got myself involved in a sales job and right now uh my list of books to be read have to do with uh the art of selling so   oh uhhuh yeah i was just i was just thinking at at Rossa they they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks   uhhuh   just to help us deal with with all the things that we have to deal with so i keep getting stacks of books i need to read and i dont know when im going to get to them all   theres never theres never going to be enough hours in the day even if you took speed reading huh yeah   i dont think so yeah i dont think so   so well im trying to think of what other kind have do you like to read mysteries   yeah a little bit   have do you like Ken Follett   um trying to think   he he writes uh spy novels The Eye of the Needle and uh i ive really ive really have found his books en joyable   uhhuh well i like that kind of stuff i think the last novel i read i read in i guess in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year it was a um his last names Peretti its called Piercing no its called This Present Darkness   um   its uh its kind of unusual book its a lot about uh spiritual warfare and some things like that   oh that sounds interesting it sounds really good       hey you should make yourself a promise that youll youll read one novel in the next six months just just for you you know   umhum   its its so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work or you know self improvement and you kind of forget the fun of reading   yeah thats true   yeah very easily so   well i guess weve covered the topic pretty thoroughly   i think so too oh well thank you for calling and uh ill have to check out that book you told me about okay thank you you take care byebye   yeah it was nice talking to you Linda okay great hope hope you like it umhum you too byebye
