                                 My Personal Trade Deficit            To my vast delight a Barnes Noble superstore has arrived in Pittsford NY about a mile from myhome in the neighboring town of Brighton I shop at Barnes  Noble severaltimes a weekmostly for books sometimes for music occasionally for softwareand nearly always for coffee            My trade deficit withPittsford has grown explosively since Barnes  Noble arrived In otherwords I spend more money in Pittsford than I did before A trade deficit isthe amount you spend in a given place minus the amount you earn there A tradesurplus is just the opposite The amount you earn in a given place minus theamount you spend there I dont earn any income in Pittsford so my tradedeficit is equal to the amount I spend                         Ive been thinking about trade deficits because I picked upthe local newspaper this morning and read an oped piece about the US tradedeficit with Mexico It says that preNAFTA the United States had a tradesurplus with Mexicothe average American earned more in Mexico than hespent there Producing goods for sale to Mexicans counts as earning inMexico buying goods made by Mexicans counts as spending in Mexico Todaythe opposite is true The United States has a trade deficit with Mexico andits growing            Accordingto the oped piece thats proof that the average American was better offwithout NAFTA But the identical logic proves that I was better off withoutBarnes  Noble Not only is the conclusion false its the exact oppositeof the truth When people take advantage of new opportunities to buy thingsthey want it usually makes them happier            The truth is that any change in ourtrade position with respect to Mexicoin either directionis evidence thatfree trade has been good for Americans My neighbor got a job at the new Barnes Noble His trade surplus with Pittsford grew just like my owntrade deficit  In both cases the changes meant that our lives had gotbetter            The sameanalogy illustrates another point Although NAFTAinduced changes in theUSMexican trade deficit are evidence of improvements the actuallevel of the trade deficit means virtually nothing If Barnes Noble had located in the town of Penfield instead of in Pittsford Id have ahigher trade deficit with Penfield a lower trade deficit with Pittsford andmy life would be about the same as it is now            Amore interesting number is my overall tradedeficitthe total of all my spending minus the total of all my earning Myoverall trade deficit was pretty high yesterday I spent  on a livingroomrug and I earned  It was a Sunday and I didnt feel like working Myoverall trade deficit was             Traditionally businessjournalists describe every increase in the overall trade deficit as aworsening According to that tradition I had a very bad day yesterday Butit didnt feel like a bad dayI like my new rug and it wouldhave been inconvenient to put off buying it until a day when I felt likeearning enough to pay for it            When thenations overall trade deficit increases it means that Americans on averageare spending more than they are earning Maybe thats because your neighborsare behaving foolishly maybe its just because they have the good sense torealize that you can sometimes spend more than you earnprovided yourewilling to draw down your savings            In any event foolishly excessive tradesurpluses are a greater danger than foolishly excessive tradedeficits  Thats because excessive trade deficits are selflimiting Ifyou run a trade deficit every year bankruptcy will eventually force you tostop But excessive trade surpluses can go on forever A perpetual tradesurplus is likely to mean youre either working too hard or consuming toolittle either way youre not getting enough enjoyment out of life            Heres the final thing youshould keep in mind when you read about the nations overall trade deficit Thenation is nothing but the sum of individual households But there are limits tohow much you ought to care about what goes on in other peoples householdsEven if you are convinced that the average American spends too much or earnstoo little or spends too little or earns too much its not entirely clearwhy its any of your business As long you have your own household in orderfretting about your neighbors spending habits is a lot like fretting about thecolor of his livingroom rug Maybe lime green was a big mistake but itshis mistake to live with
