                so how do you feel about the metric system   oh i like it i i i have a foreign actually i have more than one foreign automobile and i i i find the uh i find the the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters i was trying to build a shed and they give you these measurements like forty two and three eighths inches and we had to go a little less and trying to figure whats less than three eighths uh   yeah and its i forget how many millimeters so you used the metric   well no what we did was wind up using and you just go you just go down and and you get out the the so many inches and and we just marked a little bit less than that uh which is somewhat awkward but had it been millimeters you could have done i think whats interesting the way engineering people do is they they in essence have gotten around it by by listing uh decimal inches   uh yeah yeah   do you are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that   uh yeah yeah uh i work in metal fab and tenths of inches are are normal and you know metric you know it is broken up in you know the inch is broken up and has been for quite some time for in tenths hundredths thousandths ten thousandths of an inch   well have have you do you are you involved in any other uh metric type things like   yes i am i i have a Suzuki motorcycle and and ive had motorcycles Japanese motorcycles for years and years and the metric system comes easy to me   i think its interesting you went you know when you you go out there and youre looking for a wrench and you want the next size larger ive got i inherited some some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds   but my right   well now that ones fairly easy because thats probably slightly under half an inch but some of them like like twenty seven and and there are some thirty seconds and some of the things that that uh dont translate   yeah yeah transfer yeah to go from from eighths to sixteenths to uh thirty seconds and remember where it falls it   yeah and and youve got to go over there and try it and i suppose you know i need a larger one i need a smaller one i mean obviously you can look at it and say well anyway i think the other thing thats interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we havent i dont know do you do you drink adult beverages   yeah i drink beer   well that have you noticed that um that a lot of the um a lot of   yeah whiskey is in liters   yes   and and the next yeah point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters yeah   its like a fifth like fifths of whiskey i thought was always kind of strange   yeah   whats a fifth of whiskey   yeah i i always wondered about that myself     it was a marketing ploy   and and they had quarts at the same time though   yeah but the idea was is that by with five fifths um they could uh they could uh they could sell five and and um it was  simply a ploy to to get people you know   yeah   to buy to buy more for its uh i find that interesting but its like you know the the the the soda and this kind of things coming in   its liters   one one liter bottles and um i i think its kind of generational although i must admit that that i am not i can im not conversant in saying you know thats three centimeters away i mean or or or   yeah it its like i say i work in a machine shop and uh everythings still inches   yeah and   everythings still fractions of inches or parts or tenths or thousandths or or   yeah its its hard to think though   yes it is a mental thing it is a conversion thing   its like a mill you know we we do uh um well we use a one mill bond wire or one point five mill conductive bond wire on on semiconductor devices   right   and well whats a mill and   yeah yeah but what really annoys me is the way we in the United States have been converting to metric we have a eighty nine Chevy Blazer and before that we had a Horizon uh you know Plymouth Horizon   yeah   and both of them were a mismatch of both American and metric   dont you find that interesting uh that they that  that theyre doing that uh in any field for how why why why pieces could you could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasnt   uh okay the engine itself was mostly metric because it came from Canada   oh okay   and the starter was Bosch American so   the bolts were were English were were English then   yeah yeah it was it was annoying one one half of the starter was you know three bolts on the starter and two of them were American and one of them was metric   now thats strange   and uh you go from the uh water pump up to the radiator and on the water pump it was all metric and and on you know the factory fittings you know the factory uh   yeah uhhuh   screw lock uh   yeah   uh radiator hose clamps   essentially they do that though because if if you look at General Motors the size and and and of course Ford and Chrysler if they all went if they all went metric but in a sense um you know its like when you a measurement though when when you put uh you know one point four three two inches when when youre milling something   yeah   uh you simply set your uh equipment or or you measure or you got your calipers there and and you measure you know you  it to see if its accurate and   right its its not a problem either way like i said my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car   and no yeah   and you go to look at it and you dont know which set to reach in American or metric   yeah   and and youre never quite sure well is that a metric bolt   you get you a pair of metric pliers right  and you beat on it and a metric hammer   right right it it can be annoying and my other concern concern is is the American government going to force us to go   oh i think i dont think so i i think that that uh i think theyve now just taken the attitude that well if it happens if it because it there a lot of things that that uh um like sports you know its a hundred meter   oh absolutely   and uh uh but automobile races if it i dont think theyd ever its still going to be the Indianapolis Five Hundred theyre not going to   yeah yeah theyre not going to change that to meters it will always be   yeah and and it i i dont think it i dont you know i dont think i dont think its particularly bothersome because in reality uh you its like troy ounces in ounces of gold how many ounces of gold you know i was trying i was trying to figure up gold content on something it had has uh gold plated uh header   twelve   and and theyre trying to think of whats a Troy ounce   yeah theres twelve troy ounces to the pound   yeah now that makes you know   yeah and and is that going to change too   well i mean and and then theres a metric ton and then theres a ton but whats a metric ton   uh see i dont remember i i read it   i dont know   and are we still going to maintain drams for perfume   yeah and and then but then the medicine and and some of these other things and and the chemistry in those kinds of areas milliliter   its all metric all ready   yeah and and so um but but when you go to order a drink um you know well you say they they i dont know its uh   and what will a shot be will a shot be an ounce   i dont know and and but you know when you go to the store and and youre trying to figure you know well this box is is uh is is twelve ounces and and this ones uh uh three pounds um and you   and the other ones   yeah   two point one keys and and youre youre lost   thats right and and i dont know i i think that i i think i think the Federal government is going to more or less leave it alone i think theyve got i think there are more pressing problems   oh yeah the economy uh what i was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it uh   yes   a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling personal tools to be able to do his job   yeah but but are are the tools that uh if youre cutting are you talking about cutting equipment or tools for that for set up   uh tools for set up and for measurement uh you got to have a one tenth indicator its a hundred dollars uh five tenths indicator uh usually two one tenth indicators at a hundred dollars each uh five tenths indicator   huh   at about a hundred dollars you got to have uh six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars you got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars uh one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars a two to three for eighty dollars a three to four for eighty dollars   so youve got thousands of dollars or so i mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools   real fast   yes   real real fast edge finders and   but i was thinking about though that that when you actually get to the milling equipment though when it starts turning   well i know because okay your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches   yeah   you know   but when you when you when you simply drilling a hole i mean a real simple thing like gee i need a hole there   what size hole   yeah yeah   as in metric size hole or a or an American sized hole   yeah and and what but the thing is then youve got to with screws and thats the other issue uh the pitch and   yeah yeah well and thread
