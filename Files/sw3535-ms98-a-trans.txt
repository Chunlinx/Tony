                 okay where does she live   uh on Rutherford   Rutherford i dont know that   its um corner of New York  uh just   umhum   west of Mayfield   its oh oh south and okay yeah i know where you i know the area right thats kind of on the other side of town so our kids probably never went to school together or anything   uh oh okay oh theyre theyre little ones   oh well ive got one in college  by now uh   oh  lets see were on government whether we think its honest  or can be   right right  is it possible to have an honest government im beginning to think its not what about you   i i dont think under the way the system is right now it is   i dont either i i think uh even if people have good intentions and i think crime uh power corrupts or something or to a certain extent you know   and ultimate power ultimately returns  corrupts   yeah it seems like um maybe more of them come in with good intentions but its just so enticing and all the corners being cut and the special deals available because theyre in on the know you know   i dont know if theres enough money that you could pay them just you know   love them   x amount of money to keep them honest i just i just dont uh   right i mean you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions you know what i mean little bit little bitty positions and in your own home town and theyll cheat somehow or you know bend the rules use their power so maybe its just mans inner nature   right we had uh here in Oklahoma we had a few years ago a major uh corruption on on our county commissioners and there were several counties uh including the one i was in that lost everyone of their county commissioners and   umhum oh my word   i mean it was to the point of not just losing their job but going to jail   oh wow what were they doing taking some oh no oh gosh yeah right   oh they were taking kickbacks yeah  just a little here and a little there and major amount here and major amount there   right oh   but i think there was something like you know thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail   um  we havent had that big a scandal in Arlington but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records other words theyd go out and have a big lavish dinner and then put somebodys name down that they supposedly had entertained but that person wasnt even anywhere near there you know sometimes they werent even in the same city one of them had had cancer and died and i mean that was our biggest scandal for the last few years i think   uh that thats small scale i dont know you know i really dont know what could be done   i dont i dont either uh to make it totally honest uh i think theres always theres always gonna be some way somebody can cut a corner uh however   uh   the things that have gone on gone on in the last couple of years we cant afford too many of those you know the the HUD mess and the S and L we can almost not afford such terrible corruption   thats right the coverups and   right right i think that uh Reagan and Bush were up to their necks in that Iran Contra thing and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that but uh   i uh i dont know i just uh id like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests i think thats what upsets me worse than that theyre getting a little you know uh on the side that   right umhum umhum   that it seems that when they get up there its its what if i vote your way what itll do for me rather than this is the way my constituents want it   thats right but they stay there umhum right and thisd be for the best for the nation overall  youre right its just a i dont know i guess thats where they stay in uh and they try to stay in office but then they always please the money people too they need money so much because theyre constantly having to run run for office again and   run maybe and then you think if well if it was longer terms then they would never have  try to please the people at home   umhum thats true boy i dont know it is a big problem but i think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now dont you   i dont think that they anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government   i know its really terrible i mean there was a time i mean where i remember when i was real young i just loved Harry Truman i thought he was great oh you know i had some some of them seemed like kind of uh heroic people   well  i wonder if they really were or if we just really didnt know
