                                 Is Harry the Savior of English Literature                        Dear Polly            Thanks for the tip about Sylvia Townsend Warner Ill check the library forKingdoms of Elfin  which sounds marvelously creepy And imagineconfusing a succubus with a lamia Im so ashamed Five points fromGryffindor            I see that the question I lobbed casually in your direction on Monday hasbounced back like a bludger or do I mean a quaffle Im still a novice atQuidditch to knock me off my rhetorical broomstick Why Harry why now Anobvious answer which weve gestured toward in various ways this week is justthat the books are a lot of fun to read Your analysis of their narrativestructure by the way was incisive The sonnet sequence analogy is inspiredWith each book you become newly aware of the tight structural constraintsRowling is working in and freshly amazed at the dazzling variations shemanages Each time for instance Im sure that Snape is the link to Voldemortand each time Im stunned when he turns out to be nothing more than agardenvariety classroom sadist And yet I know Ill fall for this trick againand again and that the moment I dont will be the moment his true evilor hisunsuspected goodnessis revealed Im impressed with how effortlessly Rowlingbalances the genre requirements of predictabilityHarry will prevail theschool year will end Voldemort will be foiled but only temporarilyandsurprise            But as we know a books quality and its success are two different thingsSome of the hype about Harry Potter seems a bit wild Youd think readingnewspaper stories about these books that they had singlehandedly rescuedliteracy in the Englishspeaking world and also bridged the gulf betweenparents and children Talk about magic Nearly every article Ive seen quotes aparent or teacher saying something to the effect of My kid never showed anyinterest in reading until Harry Potter came along with the implication thatthe kid will now trade Pokemon for The Illiad and our civilization willbe saved from the forces of darkness The jacket flap of the British edition ofPrisoner of Azkaban sports a handwritten letter from an yearoldbegging Rowling to write more books Its a bit much really            Adults who have children partake of a great deal of kid culture voluntarilyor not and inevitably develop tastes and interests of their own Im asobsessed with Arthur as I used to be with Seinfeld My wife who is aschoolteacher has developed an insatiable appetite for youngadult historicalfiction quite independent of the professional requirements of keeping up withwhat her students are reading finding new texts to assign and so forth Partof the fun of having or teaching children is the vicarious reliving of onesown childhoodreading the stories aloud that you remember having read to yourenting videotapes of the movies that enchanted you or gave you nightmaresreconnecting with Ernie and Bert            That Rowlings books which are so smart and so bracingly British I thinkyoure right to keep bringing up PL Travers as a reference pointshe andRowling both manage to be at once subversive and starchy anarchic andcommonsensical have resonated with parents is no surprise She quite cannilysets Harrys adventures in an England whose culture and geography are entirelyliterary This is not the England of Tony Blair or Princess Di or Martin Amisbut the England we remember from other childrens books an England somehowperpetually Edwardian notwithstanding certain concessions to modernity liketelephones and coeducation            In an earlier posting you speculated that our enthusiasm for Harry Pottermay arise from our anxiety about technology and its striking this issomething my wife called to my attention after she read the first two bookshow technologically underdeveloped the muggle world is in these books inparticular with respect to information technology No email no faxes notreally any television or movies And of course the wizard world is a world ofartisanal handicraft ancient wisdom and small local businesses Hogwartspupils dont buy their textbooks from Amazoncom or a Barnes  Noblesuperstore but from a quaint old bookshop on Diagon Alley called Flourish andBlotts They dont have email they have owls They dont play Nintendo theypractice spells They do however collect famous wizard trading cards whichmove just as all wizard photographs do But curiously wizard photographyseems to be exclusively black and white            So there is a double nostalgia involved in reading these booksnostalgiafor ones own childhood and nostalgia for the timeless realm of classicchildrens fiction Rowling has cleverly and subtly modernized these realmswith respect to matters like gender equality and multiculturalismnot that shemakes a big fuss about such things Of course this being childrensbookEngland theres still a servant class But though theres plenty of crueltycorporal punishment has fallen from favor The death penalty seems to bereserved for wayward magical beasts            Of course none of this explains why these books have crossed over not onlyfrom children to their parents but also to adults who dont have children Thisseems genuinely unprecedented and it may be one of those inexplicablephenomena the culture likes to toss our way every now and then Our seekerducks the bludger and sprints for the golden snitch Or it may be a symptom ofour present obsession with childhood and childrenthe simultaneous detonationof the postwar baby boom and the fin de sicle baby boom All I knowis I havent had such a purely escapist reading experience in a long time            As much fun as it was to read these books its been even more fundiscussing them with you Im quite dazzled by your insight anderuditionbewitched in fact            All bestTony
