Economic Analysis of a MultiEmissions StrategyPrepared for Senators James M Jeffords and Joseph I LiebermanUS Environmental Protection Agency Office of Air and RadiationOffice of Atmospheric ProgramsOctober  Executive SummaryIn response to a May   request from Senators James MJeffords VT and Joseph I Lieberman CT this report describesthe results of a modeling study done to evaluate the potentialimpacts of reducing nitrogen oxides NOx sulfur dioxide SOmercury Hg and carbon dioxide CO emissions from the USelectric power sector In their request Senators Jeffords andLieberman asked the Environmental Protection Agency to undertake aneconomic assessment of four technologybased scenarios designed toachieve the following emissions caps in the US electric powersector by the year Reduce nitrogen oxides NOx emissions to  percentbelow  levelsReduce sulfur dioxide SO emissions to  percent belowfull implementation of the Phase II requirements under titleIVReduce mercury Hg emissions to  percent below levels andReduce carbon dioxide CO emissions to levelsThe request also specified that EPA should evaluate the cost ofachieving these reductions using four alternative technologyscenariosThe Energy Information Agencys Standard TechnologyScenarioThe Energy Information Agencys High Technology Scenarioincluding technology assumptions with earlier introduction lowercosts higher maximum market potential or higher efficiencies thanthe Standard ScenarioTwo scenarios from Scenarios for a Clean Energy Futurepublished by Oak Ridge National Laboratory National RenewableEnergy Laboratory and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory whichinclude assumptions about changes in consumer behavior additionalresearch and development and voluntary and informationprogramsUnder each scenario the costs of meeting the emissionconstraints are included in the price of electricity Such costsinclude the purchase and installation of emissions controlequipment and the purchase of emissions permits Factors thatmitigate projected cost increases include the availability of morecosteffective energy efficient technologies for both consumersand electricity suppliers EPAs analysis indicates that under theconditions described aboveElectricity prices in  would increase by about  to depending on the technology scenarioCoalfired electric generation would decline by  to by the year Overall costs measured by the decline in householdconsumption of goods and services would be between  and billion annually or  to  of total consumption Under allfour of the policy scenarios evaluated in this assessment grossdomestic product GDP would remain relatively unchanged assacrificed consumption permits higher investment and governmentspending to reduce emissionsOil and gasfired generation would be expected increaseby about  under more restrictive technology assumptions butdecrease by as much as  under scenarios thatembody more optimistic assumptions about energyefficiencydemand and supply technologiesThe combination of increased prices and the availability of moreenergyefficient equipment and appliances are projected to reduceelectricity demand by about  With the combination of higherprices and improved efficiency total expenditures for electricityconsumption in  are projected to increase by about  to depending on the scenarioThe increase in electricity prices and cost of the program aswell as the impact on the fuel mix varies considerably based thetechnology future that is assumed For example the  electricityprice increase the  billion reduction in personal consumptionand the  decline in coal use are all associated with the CleanEnergy Future Advanced Scenario which includes the most optimistictechnology assumptions Likewise the  electricity priceincrease the  billion reduction in personal consumption andthe  decline in coal usage are all associated with EIAsStandard Technology ScenarioEPA was not asked to evaluate the merits of the alternativetechnology scenarios We note however that they are the subjectof considerable controversy The Clean Energy Future scenarios havebeen criticized on several grounds assumed changes in consumerbehavior that are not consistent with historic behavior patternsresults from research and development funding increases that havenot occurred and voluntary and information programs for whichthere is no analytic basis for evaluating the impacts On the otherhand supporters of those scenarios point to economic analysesshowing that the assumed investments can pay for themselves overtime The range of estimates associated with the differenttechnology scenarios highlights the importance of the technologyassumptionsIn conducting the modeling requested by Senators Jeffords andLieberman EPA has assumed that the reductions would be achievedthrough a nationwide capandtrade system similar to the AcidRain program established under the  Amendments to the Clean AirAct together with increasing penetration and performance of energytechnologies In accordance with the Senators request theanalysis also assumes the use of banked allowances made possible byearly emissions reductions achieved in the years  through In practice significant reductions beginning in  would bedifficult to achieve Because of the contribution of those bankedallowances to overall emissions reductions the analysis showsemissions in  above the caps Regardless  emissions aresubstantially reduced from current levels At the end of  asmall pool of banked allowances continues to be available for usein later years The analysis contained in the report covers theyears  through The results provided in this analysis should not be construed asforecasts of actual scenario outcomes Rather they are assessmentsof how the future might unfold compared to a previously definedreference case  given the mix of technology and policy assumptionsembodied in each of the scenarios The results also imply anational commitment that is successful in achieving the level ofemission reductions described within the reportThe economic impacts of the emissions reduction scenarios areevaluated using Argonne National Laboratorys AMIGA model asector computer general equilibrium model of the US economyThe modular design and economywide coverage of the AMIGA modelmakes it a logical choice to analyze alternative technologyscenarios Although it does employ the same plantlevel coverage ofthe electricity sector as the IPM and NEMS models used in otheranalyses the pollution control technology assumptions are notincluded at the same level of detail as the IPM model This may beparticularly relevant for mercury controls where the effectivenessvaries by coal type and may be difficult to model correctlywithout additional detail In addition we note that the AMIGAmodel is relatively new and has not been subject to the same degreeof peerreview and scrutiny as the older IPM and NEMS models Itwould be desirable in future work to establish the comparability ofresults across these models Introduction BackgroundResponding to an earlier Congressional request the EnergyInformation Administration EIA released a detailed studyreviewing the effects of a socalled three pollutant strategy inDecember  Energy Information Administration  The threeemissions in the EIA assessment included nitrogen oxides NOxsulfur dioxide SO and carbon dioxide CO Although acoordinated climate and air quality policy appeared to lower costscompared to a series of separate policy initiatives the EIAassessment indicated significant costs associated with cappingemissionsAt about the same time five of the nations national energylaboratories released an extensive review of some  differentpolicy options that might achieve costeffective reductions of bothair pollutants and carbon dioxide CO emissions The studyScenarios for a Clean Energy Future Interlaboratory Working Group indicated that domestic investments in energyefficient andclean energy supply technologies could achieve substantialreductions in both sets of emissions at a small but net positivebenefit for the economyOn May   Senators James M Jeffords VT and Joseph ILieberman CT sent a letter to EIA and EPA seeking further clarityin the scenarios examined by the December EIA analysis statingthat the analysis appears to unnecessarily limit the market andtechnology opportunities that might significantly affect the costsand benefits of emission reductions In particular the potentialcontributions of demandside efficiency gasfired cogeneration andof renewable energy sources appear to be inadequatelyrepresentedIn responding to this request EPA modeled the combined impactsof both the emissions caps and the advanced technology scenariosspecified by the Senators We are aware that EIA has modeled thecombined impacts but has also modeled the effects of the emissioncaps and the advanced technology scenarios separately Thisapproach provides perhaps a better technique for isolating theactual costs of the emissions caps We have reviewed the EIAanalysis of these separate effects and we believe that they offerinteresting and important insights and that if we had performed thesame kind of analysis we would have seen similar resultsThis report responds to the Senators request The resultsprovided in this analysis should not be construed as forecasts ofactual scenario outcomes Rather they are assessments of how thefuture might unfold compared to a previously defined reference case given a national commitment to achieve the emission reductionsand given the mix of technology and policy assumptions embodied ineach of the scenarios Technology ScenariosIn the letter to Administrator Whitman Senators Jeffords andLieberman asked for an analysis of four different scenariosrequesting that EPA analyze the cost and benefits including allsectors of the economy and impacts on both the supply and demandside of the equation of the following multipollutant emissioncontrol scenarios for the nations electricity generators Wherefeasible this should include power plants both within theconventionally defined electric utility sector as well aselectricity generated by industrial cogenerators and otherindependent power producersThe four scenarios are identified as followsScenario A Standard Technology Scenario Assume standardtechnology characteristics as defined in AEO Further assume astart date of  By  reduce NOx emissions  percent below levels reduce SO emissions to  percent below fullimplementation of the Phase II requirements under title IV reducemercury emissions  percent below  levels and reduce COemissions to  levelsScenario B High Technology Scenario Continue the start date but assume the advanced technology assumptions of boththe supply and demandside perspectives that are referenced inAEO By  reduce NOx emissions  percent below  levelsreduce SO emissions to  percent below full implementation of thePhase II requirements under title IV reduce mercury emissions percent below  levels and reduce CO emissions to levelsScenario C Moderate Clean Energy Future ScenarioContinue the  start date but assume the moderate supply anddemandside policy scenario of the Clean Energy Future CEF studyBy  reduce NOx emissions  percent below  levels reduceSO emissions to  percent below full implementation of the PhaseII requirements under title IV reduce mercury emissions  percentbelow  levels and reduce CO emissions to levelsScenario D Advanced Clean Energy Future ScenarioContinue the  start date but assume the advanced supply anddemandside policy scenario of the Clean Energy Future study By reduce NOx emissions  percent below  levels reduce SOemissions to  percent below full implementation of the Phase IIrequirements under title IV reduce mercury emissions  percentbelow  levels and reduce CO emissions to levelsIn requesting an analysis of these four scenarios the Senaterequest asked for results through  in periods of five yearsor less using the Annual Energy Outlook  AEO as thebaseline MultiEmission TargetsTable  identifies the  emission caps used for each of thefour scenarios The emission cap is defined by a benchmark emissionlevel that is modified by the desired level percentage ofreduction For example the benchmark for the SO emissions cap isthe Phase II requirements of the Clean Air Act Amendments Thattotal  million short tons is reduced by a specific percentage percent to reach the emissions cap of  million tonsFollowing a similar pattern the remaining emission caps are set as million tons for NOx emissions  tons for mercuryemissions and  million metric tons MtC of carbonemissionsTable  Benchmark Emission Levels and Assumed Emission Caps Other Analytical AssumptionsAs previously noted the letter from Senators Lieberman andJeffords requested that EPA use four different sets of technologyand policy assumptions to meet the specified emission caps shown inTable  The full set of technology and policy assumptions aredescribed more fully in section two of this report All scenariosare implemented in  At the same time there are other keyassumptions that EPA adopted to facilitate the evaluation of thefour scenariosIn addition to the different technology scenarios EPA was askedto include the assumption that utilities would begin to makecosteffective emission reductions in the five years that precedethe  compliance date These early reductions would be bankedfor use in the post period of analysis For purposes of thissimulation the amount of allowances banked from  through was calculated as the simple difference between the reference caseprojections and the actual emission trajectory of each scenarioThe decision to earn and hold early allowances is based on theassumption that allowances are viewed as an asset that must earn atleast an  real returnFollowing the assumption used in the CEF study all four of thepolicy scenarios assume nationwide restructuring of the electricutility industry This implies that prices are based on themarginal rather than the regulated costofservice pricing nowused throughout much of the countryEPA employed the Argonne National Laboratorys AMIGA modelingsystem to evaluate the impact of capping emissions under the fourdifferent technology scenarios AMIGA is a  plus sector model ofthe US economy that captures a wide variety of technologycharacteristics and their resulting impact on key indicators suchas emissions employment and income EPAIn practice it is more likely that significant reductions thatcontribute to any kind of allowance bank would be difficult toachieve before  Assuming a delay in implementation to would raise the economic impact of any of the scenariosAMIGA is especially suited to the t ask identifying andevaluating a different mix of technologies in the production ofgoods and services within the United States It is not only a plus sector model of the US economy but it also includes theArgonne Unit Planning and Compliance model and database thatcaptures a wide variety of technology characteristics within theelectric generating sector including industrial combined heat andpower systems and the typically available emission controltechnologies When the electricity module is integrated withasked Argonne to benchmark AMIGA to the reference caseprojections of AEO AMIGA was then modified to approximate theassumptions behind each of the four scenariosAn economic analysis of a policy compares the world with thepolicy the policy scenario to the world absent the policy thereference case or baseline scenario The impacts of policies orregulations are measured by the resulting differences between thesetwo scenarios In effect any meaningful analysis should comparethe full set of benefits and costs to the extent possibleFor purposes of this exercise there are at least sevencategories of costs and four benefits that might be reviewed Thecosts include  direct investment costs  operating andmaintenance costs  research and development and othergovernment program costs  transaction search and compliancecosts  adjustment costs associated with large changes inspecific capital stocks  lost economic flexibility created byadditional emission requirements and  potential interactionswith the existing tax system At the same time there are at leastfour categories of benefits These include  direct savings fromlower compliance costs  process efficiency and otherproductivity gains  environmental and health benefits notcaptured within normal market transactions and  spilloversandor learning induced by either the technology investment or theRD effortsThe costs associated with the emission limits in each scenarioare computed as the increased expenditures on pollution controlinvestment in more efficient equipment and appliances research anddevelopment tax incentives and additional government programs all relative to the reference case The increased costs are coupledwith credits for reductions in fuel use and productivity gains fromtechnology The economic impact of each scenario is reported in twoways The first is as a change in household personal consumptionmeasuring the goods and services available for consumers to enjoyafter subtracting these net expenditures The second is as a changein economic output measured as Gross Domestic Product GDPThe AMIGA model reasonably captures those costs and benefitsnoted above that arise in market transactions Some such as lossof flexibility and adjustment costs on the cost side and healthbenefits and spillovers on the benefit side remain beyond thescope of this analysis MultiEmissions AnalysisThis section provides additional details about the technologyassumptions that underpin the four emission scenarios It alsodescribes the results of the scenario analysis both in terms ofthe various marginal costs associated with emission controlstrategies and the economywide impact of each scenario AlthoughEPA made every effort to calibrate AMIGA to the AEO referencecase AMIGA is a different modeling system than EIAs NationalEnergy Modeling System NEMS Hence it was not possible toreproduce the exact AEO reference casethe larger macroeconomic system the model can then generate keyoutputs including projected electricity sales and net generationresulting emissions for each of the four pollutants underconsideration and the set of energy and permit prices associatedwith the resulting production levels Finally AMIGA can provide anestimate of the consequent impact on the economy including keyindicators as consumption investment government spending GDPand employment Hanson  For more background on the AMIGAmodel see Appendix projections Moreover Argonne researchers recently upgradedAMIGA to incorporate SO NOx and mercury emissions For this andother reasons AMIGA currently reports results only through theyear  Nonetheless the differences in the resulting baselineprojections are minor for the purposes of this analysis Modeling Technology AssumptionsScenarios A and B are based on the AEO standard and advancedtechnology characteristics respectively The standard technologyassumptions of scenario A were used by EIA in the development ofthe AEO reference case projections The advanced technologyassumptions of scenario B were used as a sensitivity analysis inthe AEO They demonstrated the effects of earlier availabilitylower costs andor higher efficiencies for more advanced equipmentthan the reference caseScenarios C and D are based on the recently publishedDOEsponsored report Scenarios for a Clean Energy FutureInterlaboratory Working Group  see also Brown et al Both of the CEF scenarios assumed nationwide restructuringof the electric utility industry From an analytical perspectivethis means that prices are based on the marginal costs ofgeneration transmission and distribution of electricity ratherthan the regulated costofservice pricing now used throughoutmuch of the country Moreover both scenarios reflected increasedspending for research and development and other programs designedto accelerate the development and deployment of lowcarbon energyefficient technologies Each of the scenario assumptions aredescribed more fully in the sections that follow Reference Case ScenarioThe scenario A reference case assumes a businessasusualcharacterization of technology development and deployment Asprojected in the AEO assessment the nations economy isprojected to grow at  per year in the period  through Given anticipated energy prices and the availability of standardtechnologies the nations primary energy use is expected to grow annually while electricity consumption is projected toincrease by  annually Further details are provided in Appendix Advanced Technology ScenarioUnder the AEO  advanced technology characterizationscenario B assumes that a large number of technologies have earlieravailability lower costs andor higher efficiencies For examplethe high efficiency air conditioners in the commercial sector areassumed to cost less than in scenario A This encourages a greaterrate of market penetration as electricity prices rise in responseto the emissions caps Building shell efficiencies in scenario Bare assumed to improve by about  percent faster than in scenarioAThe AEO was published in December  Energy InformationAdministration On the utilitys side of the meter the heat rates for newcombined cycle power plants are assumed to be less compared to thestandard case assumptions This means that more kilowatthours ofelectricity are generated for every unit of energy consumed by thepower plants Moreover wood supply increases by about  and thecapacity factor of wind energy systems increases by about compared to the reference case assumptions In the AEO reportthe combination of higher efficiencies and earlier availability ofthe technologies lowers the growth in electricity use from  inthe reference case to  CEF Moderate Case ScenarioThe authors of the Clean Energy Future CEF report describetheir analysis as an attempt to assess how energyefficient andclean energy technologies can address key energy and environmentalchallenges facing the US Brown et al  In that regardthey evaluated a set of about  policies to improve the technologyperformance and characterization of the residential commercialindustrial transportation and electricity generation sectors Thepolicies include increased research and development fundingequipment standards financial incentives voluntary programs andother regulatory initiatives These policies were assumed to changebusiness and consumer behavior result in new technologicalimprovements and expand the success of voluntary and informationprogramsThe selection of policies in the CEF study began with asectorbysector assessment of market failures and institutionalbarriers to the market penetration of clean energy technologies inthe US For buildings the policies and programs include additionalappliance efficiency standards expansion of technical assistanceand technology deployment programs and an increased number ofbuilding codes and efficiency standards for equipment andappliances They also include tax incentives to accelerate themarket penetration of new technologies and the strengthening ofmarket transformation programs such as Rebuild America and EnergyStar labeling They further include socalled public benefitsprograms enhanced by electricity line chargesFor industry the policies include voluntary agreements withindustry groups to achieve defined energy efficiency and emissionsgoals combined with a variety of government programs that stronglysupport such agreements These programs include expansion andstrengthening of existing information programs financialincentives and energy efficiency standards on motors systemsPolicies in the CEF analysis were assumed to encourage thediffusion and improve the implementation of combined heat and powerCHP in the industrial sector For electricity the policiesinclude extending the production tax credit of  centskWh overmore years and extending it to additional renewabletechnologiesBroadly speaking the CEF Moderate scenario can be thought of asa  increase in funding for programs that promote a variety ofboth demandside and supplyside technologies For example themoderate scenario assumes a  or  billion increase incostshared research development and demonstration of efficientand cleanenergy technologies in  dollars with half as federalappropriations and half as privatesector cost share It furtherassumes a careful targeting of funds to critical research areas anda gradual year rampup of funds to allow for careful planningassembly of research teams and expansion of existing teams andfacilities In addition the CEF moderate scenario anticipatesincreased program spending of  and  billion for the years and  respectively These expenditures include productionincentives and investment tax credits for renewable energy energyefficiency and transportation technologies They further includeincreased spending for programs such as DOEs Industrial AssessmentCenters and EPAs Energy Star programsThe combined effect of the RD and program expenditurestogether with other policies described in the CEF report implies asteady reduction in total energy requirements over the period through  By the year  for example primary energyconsumption and electricity sales were projected to decrease by and  respectively compared to the CEF reference case CEF Advanced Technology ScenarioBuilding on the policies of the moderate scenario the CEFadvanced scenario assumes a doubling of costshared RDinvestments resulting in an increased spending of  billion peryear again in  dollars with half as federal appropriationsand half as privatesector cost share In addition the advancedscenario anticipates increased program spending of  and billion for the years  and  respectively The addedspending covers all sectors including buildings industrytransportation and electric generationThe combined effect of the program and RD expenditurestogether with other policies described in the CEF report includinga  carbon charge applied in the CEF Advanced Scenario drove asteady reduction in the need for energy compared to the CEFreference case By  total energy use fell by  compared tothe reference case At the same time electricity sales in were projected to decrease by  compared to the CEF referencecase Implementation of the Technology AssumptionsThe assumptions embedded in each of these scenarios have theeffect of progressively increasing market penetration of higherperformance energy efficiency and energy supply technologies Asshown in Table  the net effect of these assumptions is to lowerthe expected level of electricity consumption while continuing tomeet the same level of service demanded by utility customers Thetechnology assumptions also have the effect of increasing theavailability of cleaner energy supply technologies that reduce thelevel of emissions per kilowatthour of generation The criticalassumption used in the EPA analysis is that program spendingaffects both supply and demand technologies in a way that interactswith the emission caps that are to be imposed in Benchmarked to the year  Table  shows the percentagechange of key indicators for each scenario with respect to itsrespective reference case These changes provide EPA withapproximate targets so that each of the scenarios can be mappedinto the AMIGA model As such the figures in Table  should beseen as inputs into the AMIGA model not outputs of the modelTable  Influence of Technology Assumptions on Key ScenarioIndicators  By definition scenario A assumes the standard technologyassumptions of the AEO reference case Hence there are noadditional programs or policies that generate changes in thereference case technologies when the emission caps are imposed bythe year  The level of technology responsiveness grows forscenarios B C and D as a result of greater program spendingThe CEF advanced scenario for example assumes a significantincrease in program funds to promote a variety of both demandsideand supplyside technologies As a result of this greater level ofprogram activity there is an accelerated penetration ofenergyefficient technologies that drives electricity sales down by percent in  compared to the CEF reference case for thatsame year At the same time the combination of a lower demand forelectricity and an increased investment in cleaner energy supplytechnologies reduces both carbon and NOx emissions by  and percent respectively again compared to the CEF  referencecase As EPA modeled this scenario the bundle of policies in theCEF advanced scenario became in effect a complement to theemission caps imposed by To avoid overestimating the impact of the policy scenarios inthis analysis EPA made a number of adjustments before implementingthe CEF assumptions in the four scenarios reported here First theCEF analysis was benchmarked to a  reference case In theAEO reference case however the demand for electricity in is about  higher compared to the CEF reference case Second theSenate request asked EPA to assume a  start date in running thetechnology and policy scenarios In effect there are fewer yearsin which programs can achieve the desired level of technologyimprovement compared to the CEF scenarios In addition the CEFanalysis includes a significant review of transportationtechnologies and policies EPA chose to exclude all assumptionsrelated to transportation focusing only on the supply anddemandside technologies associated with electricity and naturalgas consumptionWith the adjustments described above now reflected in thecurrent analytical framework and using the program costinformation documented in the CEF study Table  summarizes theincremental program costs that were assumed as necessary to drivethe kind of changes in electricity consumption and emissionsdescribed in Table  Since transportation programs drove asignificant part of the CEF expenditures and since there are feweryears to implement policies the estimated program expenditures arealso smaller compared to the CEF assumptionsTable  Incremental Policy Costs of the Technology Scenariosbillion  dollarsBecause scenario A characterizes existing program and technologyperformance no additional funds are required to drive thatscenario Scenario B on the other hand anticipates some changesin the technology characterization that will affect the electricitysector as shown in Table While the AEO analysis anticipated no program spending todrive these changes EPA assumed that additional spending would berequired for scenario B Calibrating to the CEF policy scenariosEPA estimated that program and policy spending would increase by billion in  rising steadily to  billion by  Forscenario C program spending increased by  billion starting in rising to  billion by  Finally program spending inscenario D started at  billion in  and increased to billion by the last year of this analysisThe net effect of mapping increased program spending togetherwith adjustments needed to update the assumptions of the CEF policyscenarios can be highlighted by reviewing the change in electricitygeneration for scenario D In the CEF Advanced Scenario based on a reference case for example the level of electricitygeneration in  was lowered by  from the reference caserequirements of  billion kilowatthours kWh As the CEFtechnology assumptions were applied in scenario D within thisanalysis updated to the AEO reference case electricitygeneration was reduced by  from  billion kWh The trendwas more pronounced in  Rather than a roughly  reductionfrom a generation level of  billion kWh in the  CEFAdvanced Case the scenario D equivalent in this analysis achievedonly a  reduction from a generation of  billion kWh Reasonableness of the Scenario AssumptionsThe results of the technologydriven scenarios should not beinterpreted as an EPA endorsement of any of the policies ortechnology assumptions behind each of scenarios described in thisreport On the one hand EPA has not conducted any significantreview of the EIA assumptions that underpin the AEOprojections On the other hand some analysts do not necessarilyagree with the assumptions and projected level of impacts in theCEF assessment despite the fact that it was peerreviewed and itsfindings published this fall in an academic journal The EIA for example notes that the CEF policies assume changes inconsumer behavior that are not consistent with historicallyobserved behavior patterns Moreover the EIA suggests that thereis little documentation to support the assumed technologicalimprovements generated by the research and development RDinitiatives described in the report Finally EIA notes thatThe program spending assumptions developed in this analysis areused only to approximate the impact of the CEF scenario s They donot reflect EPA endorsement of these spending levelsthe effectiveness of voluntary or information programs may beless than assumed in the CEF scenarios At the same time the leadCEF analysts have responded to the EIA assertions by citingrelevant economic literature and noting that the CEF study is oneof the most carefully documented and complete analysis of USenergy futures that has ever been funded by the US governmentKoomey et al Notwithstanding these concerns EPA attempted to respond to theSenators request by mapping in the critical assumptions of the CEFas a range of policies that provide a set of alternativeassumptions about the future In this regard the scenarios aremore like descriptions of alternative future outcomes rather thanpredictions or recommendations about how the future shouldunfoldTo provide a more complete context for understanding themagnitude of the changes in electricity generation that aresuggested by the different scenarios the figure below illustratesboth the historical and projected trends in the nationselectricity generation The information is shown as the number ofkWh per dollar of GDP measured in constant  dollars Thehistorical data covers the period  through  while theprojected trends are through the year  The historical periodshows a moderate level of volatility The reference caseprojections suggest an annual rate of declining intensity of per year through  with a final value  kWhHistorical and Projected US Electricity Trends kWh per  GDPIn comparison to the reference case Scenario D adapting theCEF Advanced Case assumptions reflects a national commitment toimprove both electricity supply and the efficiency of demandsidetechnologies The presumption is that such a commitment would besupported by a significant increase in RD and program spendingas described above Under these assumptions the nationselectricity intensity is projected to decline at an annual rate ofdropping to a final intensity of  kWh This level ofdecline is greater than previously seen in the recent past In theperiod  through  for example and again  through the annual rate of decline was only  percent Hence it appearsthat the assumptions driving the advanced scenario are aggressiveAt the same time however the research undertaken by the CEFanalysts indicates that the technology is available to achieve sucha reduction should a national commitment be successful in drivingsimilar policies Results of the Scenario AnalysisWith the model benchmarked to AEO and given the differentmix of scenario assumptions previously described AMIGA reports theresults in the figures and tables that follow More complete dataincluding reference case assumptions are available in Appendix Emission ProjectionsAll program and policy assumptions have a start date of Moreover the analysis anticipates the use of banked allowancesmade possible by early emissions reductions achieved in the years through  as requested in the Senate letter Figures through  on the following page illustrate both the emissionsprojections and the impact of banking the early reductions on allfour emissions caps implemented in Although all four categories of emissions are downsubstantially they only achieve  of the proposed cap by shown as the dotted horizontal line in each of the above figuresThis is because of the availability of the banked allowances thatcan be used by sources to meet emissions caps in  and beyondNote that costs would be noticeably higher if power plants wererequired to actually hit the target in  In  carbon andmercury emissions continue to be  or more above the targetThe reductions that generate the banked allowances are shown asthe area to the left of each vertical dotted line as thedifferences between the reference case and scenario emissiontrajectories The emissions above the cap are shown to the right ofeach vertical dotted line and between the scenario emissions andthe dotted horizontal line Subtracting these two areas on eachgraph reveals the level of the bank in  Using Scenario D as anexample the remaining allowances in  are  million metrictons for carbon  million tons for SO  million tons for NOxand  tons for mercury In the case of carbon the bank would lastanother two years at the rate of drawdown in  or longer if thedrawdown declinedFigure  Carbon Emissions million metric tons Figure  SOEmissions million tonsFigure  NOx Emissions million tons Figure  MercuryEmissions tons Changes in Electric Generation ExpendituresGiven the assumptions and economic drivers in each of thescenarios the AMIGA model calculates the capital investmentoperation and maintenance and fuel costs necessary to meetconsumer demand for electricity The incremental expendituresrequired to generate electricity under each of the four scenariosas compared to the reference case are summarized in Figure  inbillions of  dollars In effect the incremental expendituresreflect the range of decisions made by the electricity sector tocomply with each of the four scenario constraintsbut do notreflect efforts made outside the electricity sector Because theseexpenditures ignore spending on energy efficiency research anddevelopment outside the electricity sectorspending that can besubstantialthey are not measures of program costs Note thatincremental expenditures are incurred as early as  in all fourscenarios to generate early reductions that can be banked for usein  and beyondThe generation expenditures vary in each of the scenarios changefor at least three reasons  the size of the allowance bank madepossible by early reductions driven in part by program spendingprior to the introduction of the caps  the varying levels ofdemand for electricity over time resulting in changes in theoverall mix of generation resources and  the gradual reductionin the banked allowances available for withdrawal necessitatingadditional actions to reduce emissionsAs expected scenario A has the largest increase withexpenditures rising by nearly  billion in  compared to thereference case The higher level of expenditures is driven by a increase in unit generation costs caused primarily by the emissionscaps and offset only slightly by a small decrease in electricitydemand With less energy efficiency technology penetrating themarket a greater level of control equipment must be installed andoperated which in turn drives up the cost of generation ScenarioB follows a similar pattern with expenditure increases being offsetby further reductions in electricity demand as more efficienttechnology penetrates the market The expenditures for scenario Cdecline even further as reduced demand continues to lower both thelevel generation and the unit cost of that generation compared toscenario A Scenario D on the other hand actually shows a declinein total expenditures by  The combination of a  reductionon generation load together with only an  increase in the unitcost of generation both with respect to the reference caseresults in a  billion reduction in total electric generationexpendituresFigure  Incremental Expenditures on Electric GenerationBillions of  Marginal CostsThe marginal costs of emission reductions over the period through  are shown in Figures  through  for all fourscenariosFigure  Projected Marginal Cost of Carbon Reductions MetricTonFigure  Projected Marginal Cost of SO Reductions TonFigure  Projected Marginal Cost of NOx Reductions TonFigure  Projected Marginal Cost of Hg ReductionsMillionTonThe marginal cost of carbon reductions range from  tometric ton through  with each scenario showingsuccessively smaller costs as technology characteristics improveand more energyefficient andor low carbon technologies penetratethe market The marginal cost of SO and NOx reductions through are less than  and ton respectively in all fourmultiemissions reduction scenarios The marginal cost of mercuryreductions by  ranges from  millionton to millionton again depending on the scenarioIt is important to note that marginal cost reflects theadditional cost of one more ton of reductions and not the totalcost associated with each pollutant One can make a very roughestimation of this overall cost for each pollutant on top of thecosts associated with the other three by multiplying half themarginal cost to approximate average cost by the volume ofreductions By  as an example scenario A returns costestimates of  billion for carbon  billion for SO billion for NOx and  billion for mercury In Scenario D thecost estimates are  billion for carbon  billion for SO billion for NOx and  billion for mercury Note that thesefigures cannot be added together for an overall estimate becausethey a double count the benefits of controlling multiplepollutants simultaneously andb ignore the consequences of the underlying technology policyWe discuss overall costs belowSurprisingly the marginal cost of SO NOx and Hg reductionsincreases as the marginal cost of carbon decreases The reasonappears to be that as efficiency technology penetrates the marketand reduces carbon prices more of a price signal is required togenerate further reductions in the three conventional pollutantsIn the advanced scenarios for example both demand reductions andthe increased use of gas tends to reduce carbon emissions But gasprices begin to rise which allows coal to make a modest comebackwith respect to scenario A This is especially true as cleaner andmore efficient coal technologies begin to penetrate the market asassumed in scenarios B through D In order to offset the tendencyfor coalgenerated emissions to increase permit prices need toadjust upward Fuel Use ImpactsFigure  shows both total electricity consumption and thefossil fuel consumption used in the generation of electricity forthe year  The results are in quadrillion Btu in both thereference case and each of the four policy scenarios As eachsuccessive scenario generates a greater reduction in electricitydemand coal use is reduced significantly by about  percentGas consumption increases slightly in scenarios A and B anddecreases by a small amount in scenarios C and D as lowerelectricity consumption reduces the need for new capacityFigure  Total Electricity Consumption and Fossil FuelGeneration in  Quadrillion Btu Energy Price ImpactsThe model suggests that under the conditions described aboveelectricity prices are expected to increase by about  underscenario D to  under scenario A by the year  This is thelogical result of increased control costs and permit prices Thecombination of increased prices and the availability of moreenergyefficient equipment and appliances reduce electricity demandby about  Total electricity expenditures increase by about to  depending on the year and the scenario see Table  belowand the tables in Appendix  for more detail on the changingpattern of expenditures Economywide ImpactsTable  provides a summary of key macroeconomic data for theyear  to compare the impact of emissions reductions on bothpersonal consumption and other components of gross domestic productGDP The effects on personal consumption show a decline ofbetween  billion and  or  to  depending on thescenario This reflects the cost of the program in terms of thedecreased well being of households who must forego a fraction oftheir consumption of goods and services in order to pay for bothresearch and development programs energy efficiency improvementsand more expensive electricity production Table  shows littlechange in GDP under any of the policy scenarios reflecting thefact that this foregone consumption turns up as expenditures inother categories of GDP namely investment and governmentspendingTable  Summary of Economic Impacts by Scenario  The AMIGA modeling system reports the costs and benefits of eachscenario with several major exceptions The first omitted benefitis spillover and productivity gains beyond energy bill savings Anumber of studies suggest that energy efficiency technologyinvestments also tend to increase overall productivity of theeconomy especially in the industrial sector Sullivan et al Finman and Laitner  and Laitner et al  To datehowever no systematic effort has been undertaken to incorporatesuch benefits into the current generation of policy models Hencethis potential benefit is not reported at this time The secondmissing benefit includes gains in environmental quality especiallyimproved health benefitsOn the cost side the model ignores costs associated with rapidchanges in capital stocks as well as potential loss of flexibilityand interactions with the existing tax system For example themodel forecasts significant changes in the

and EIA  On the other hand the presumption of a tradeoffbetween environmental and economic benefits may not provide anentirely appropriate framework for analysis of such policiesDeCanio  Indeed there are a number of studies that shownet economic benefits may be possible when a full accounting ofboth benefits and costs are included within an appropriate analysisKrause et al  and Bailie et al At the same time understanding the proper characterization androle of technology improvements Edmonds et al  and thencapturing that characterization within an appropriate modelstructure Peters et al  is a critical aspect of all sucheconomic assessmentsFinally it is important to recognize that the mere existence oftechnologies and the potential for positive net benefits does notassure that these technologies will be commercialized and adoptednor that the net benefits will be realized Jaffe et al  Anunanswered question is whether and how policies might encouragethese activitiesThis current study while drawing on credible data sources andapplying a stateoftheart modeling system cannot adequatelycapture all such nuances associated with emission reductionscenarios The results of this analysis should be viewed withinthis larger context ConclusionsThe analysis suggests that under the conditions described aboveemissions through  will be significantly reduced although theywont meet the  target This is largely because of assumptionsabout the banking of allowances earned prior to  At the sametime coalfired electric generation is expected to decline by to  by the year  On the other hand oil and gasfiredgeneration is projected to increase by about  under morerestrictive technology assumptions but decrease by as much as under scenarios that embody more optimistic assumptions

modeling system of the US economy that coversthe period from  through  It integrates features from thefollowing five types of economic models Multisector  AMIGA starts by benchmarking to the Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA interindustry data which apreprocessor aggregates to approximately  sectors Explicit technology representation  AMIGA reads in fileswith detailed lists of technologies currently with a focus onenergyefficient and lowcarbon energy supply technologiesincluding electric generating units containing performancecharacteristics availability status costs anticipated learningeffects and emission rates where appropriate Computable General Equilibrium  AMIGA computes afullemployment solution for demands prices costs and outputs ofinterrelated products including induced activities such astransportation and wholesaleretail trade Macroeconomic  AMIGA calculates national income GrossDomestic Product GDP employment a comprehensive list ofconsumption goods and services the trade balance and net foreignassets and examines inflationary pressures Economic Growth  AMIGA projects economic growth paths andlongterm dynamic effects of alternative investments includingaccumulation of residential vehicle and producer capitalstocksIn addition the AMIGA system includes the Argonne Unit Planningand Compliance model that captures a wide variety of technologycharacteristics within the electric generating sector Thisincludes a system dispatch routine that allows the retirement andthe dispatch of units on the basis of traditional cost criteria aswell as the impact of various permit prices on operating costs Italso includes nonutility generation sources such as industrialcombined heat and power applications and renewable energysystemsClimate change mitigation policy has been the main applicationof the AMIGA system to date But the AMIGA modeling system recentlyhas been enhanced to include policies involving the reduction ofsulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and mercury emissions Moreover anew intertemporal optimization module has been added to AMIGA thatallows an evaluation of early reductions and the banking ofallowances to be incorporated into policy scenarios Hence thesystem is well suited to evaluate a variety of multiemissionstrategies that are driven by price incentives as well as RDprograms voluntary initiatives and cap and trade policiesBecause of recent upgrades and enhancements made in the modelthe current reporting period is extended only through the year We expect the full reporting period to extend back to theyear  in the very near futureThe model includes a complete database of all electric utilitygenerating units within the United States The cost and performancecharacteristics of the electricity supply technologies generallyfollow those modeled within the Energy Information AdministrationsNational Energy Modeling System The characteristics associatedwith the various emission control technologies generally followthose modeled within the Integrated Planning Model used by theEnvironmental Protection AgencyThe AMIGA modeling system is a highly organized flexiblestructure that is programmed in the C language It includes modulesfor household demand production of goods motor vehicleselectricity supply and residential and commercial buildings andappliancesThe production modules contain representations of laborcapital and energy substitutions using a hierarchy of productionfunctions The adoption rates for costeffective technologiesdepend on energy prices as well as policies and programs that lowerthe implicit discount rates sometimes referred to as hurdle ratesthat are used by households and businesses to evaluateenergyefficiency and energy supply measuresFor a more complete documentation of the AMIGA model seeHanson
