                                 Waiting for Nov             Last week in Slate  Jodie T Allen and BillBarnes proposed using advanced Microsoft software to condense thetranscripts of the presidential debates Compression is the right approach butmore of a human touch is needed Rather than reduce political dialogue tostraightforward facts and proposals perhaps we should try to bring out thesingular aesthetic vision that wells up in even our most roboticallypreprogrammed politicians Too many facts too much information We need tomake politics more beautiful melancholy strange The vast audience thatattends the plays of Samuel Beckett or reads the poetry of John Ashbery issadly neglected in our political process Here is a compressed transcript ofthe debates All the words were actually spoken They are presented completelyout of context but in perfect accord with what the transcriber believes to bethe inward poetic essence of each candidate                        NoteBob Doles remarks
