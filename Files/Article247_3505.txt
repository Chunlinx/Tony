                                 Weekend Cocktail Chatter                        Before we get to this weeks Cocktail Chatter I have a correction to makeIn Tuesdays column about the Federal Reserves use of symbolic action to guideinterest rates in the right direction I wrote that the Feds adoption of aneutral bias was a shift from its earlier stance In fact the Fed had alreadyadopted a neutral bias at its previous meeting shifting from a bias towardtightening What threw me was that its relatively unusual for the Fed to raiseinterest rates off a neutral bias but that is in fact what happened this weekThe bond market meanwhile seemed so concerned about inflation that it felt asif the Fed was leaning toward tightening Which it did do So when the Fedannounced that it was staying neutral it felt like a change            All of the above is true but I still shouldnt have made the mistakeApologies            In no small part because of that interestrate hike it was a roaring weekin the stock market Before todays minor selloff the Dow had been up percent in the previous seven trading days while the Nasdaq was up an amazing percent It used to be that interestrate hikes were automatic bad news forstocks since the idea behind the hike is that it will slow down the economyand presumably profits But this economy seems so strong that the danger ofhaving the boom killed by inflationwhich would eventually lead to very sharpinterestrate hikes feels more powerful than the danger of having the boomkilled by a slowdown So as long as the interestrate hikes remain manageablethe stock market welcomes them Who knows how long this will last but rightnow investors seem to feel that if things are stable the only answer is tobuy You cant keep a buoyant market down Which is I suppose why you wouldcall it buoyant Anyway on to the Chatter             The International Monetary Fund admittedwell I say admitted becauseit sounds more dramatic than saidthat it has no idea whether money itloaned to Russias central bank was improperly diverted by Russian banksfurther down the line because the IMF leaves the monitoring of disbursementsto central banks Now were not asking the fund to hire someone named Vito togo collect but considering that its now loaned Russia  billion with fewdiscernible results maybe making one or two phone calls wouldnt beunreasonable  You know something like So how much of that  billionis still around Really Well a kickback here and a payoff there do add upNo I understand             As expected Ecuador announced that it would miss a scheduled million interest payment on its Brady bonds but insisted that it wasnot defaulting just deferring to a later date Does anybody really know whattime it is Does anybody really care the finance minister reportedlysaid             Daily Variety headline for an article on Virgin Recordspurchase of Immortal Film and Music  Virgin Picks Up Immortal So whatkind of line do you have to use to get Apollo to come home with youanyway             Opening today in theaters everywhere is a film based on that greatchildrens classic A Dog of Flanders  Im sorry but is thereanyone outside of Flanders who considers this a classic Are there any Americanchildren who have even heard of Flanders let alone the dogs that come fromthere             Merrill Lynchs powerful media analyst Jessica Reif Cohen jolted TimeWarners stock price Tuesday when she cut her earnings estimates for thecompany citing a disappointing performance by Time Warners musicdivision Oddly though what the cuts did was bring Cohens estimates in linewith those of most other analysts who follow the company The definition ofauthority You can agree with an alreadyexisting consensus and still have itmake news             Richard Belluzzo resigned as chairman and CEO of SiliconGraphics after spending  months trying to turn around the company He thentook a job with Microsoft  heading up all its Internet operations Hey wait a minute Let me rephrase my opening sentence The visionary RichardBelluzzo resigned as chairman and CEO of Silicon Graphics after dedicating valiant months to turning around that company
