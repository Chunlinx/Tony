                so Eric what do you think um       that   well im more more interested in the longterm effects than the shortterm effects in terms of uh balancing budget and so forth um   yeah   i tend to view um and i i take a fairly radical view towards economic policy and feel that       well it has to be done somewhat arbitrarily at uh on in some uh instances i think that um goods should cost um real total costs rather than just manufacturing costs and that means uh if you oh produce something that creates uh uh adverse health effects that should somehow be reflected in the product if you uh the cost of forestry that you cut down and such needs to be uh reflected   so you think that they that those products should cost more   in well i think i think my longterm sense of of budget concerns is that were going is a lot of others governments spending goes on goes towards this uh health care and things like that and a lot of causes of poor health or need for health care are brought about by various factors such as such as pollution stress you know work work environment conditions and so forth but generally the government is   umhum yeah   government or individuals end up paying for that rather than the uh some of the source of need for the health care   umhum   um but thats a very longterm sort of concern um i dont i dont have great shortterm effects other than reducing spending and raising taxes and no one likes the idea of raising taxes very much and uh no one likes the idea of reducing spending very much so i dont see any real uh real immediate hope i mean its the whole quotas living on debt i mean but and they buy things on credits constantly   wow umhum well do they i mean um i never liked doing that and i i didnt up until uh several years ago when it came down to the point of   umhum   you you dont have a choice you know if you if you need to have a car then you have no choice and uh   yeah well exactly umhum umhum   and uh it it gets even worse when you think about trying to do things like buy a house   yes well i  i dont know anyone who paid cash for a house thats for sure yeah you dont have much um i   really i mean  so what choice do you have then   i mean it seems to me one might have choices if one radically restructured the system but thats not really a possibility at this point it has its own inertia and   yeah i did its just that uh there needs to be some some change take place so that the inertia can begin to go in a different direction and strike down   yeah i hope so   you know thats the problem that i think we have   yeah well im im in academics and actually im in the job market now trying to get a professorship and im watching uh the education budget getting cut back so severely um at least in California where i am where theres a very severe budget crisis because of agriculture was wiped out last year and um a number of other things and uh   umhum yeah   because im i i have a lot of i have some personal investments in this uh in addition to whatever philosophical investment   umhum   there is and i dont know its amazing that in the last ten years weve gone from a uh a major loaning nation to a major debt nation   yeah   in the in the course of a decade um we are  a lot has changed more radically   umhum   and   well we were we were in debt before that it just wasnt as apparent   yeah it was its its uh seems to have worsened considerably   somehow we still i guess believed that the countries that we were helping were were eventually going to pay us back and that hasnt happened   umhum umhum yeah well uh i can see you know its its its its kind of funny because we it seems like we loan money you know we money with strings attached and if the government changes and the country that we loan the money to um i can see why the might have a different attitude towards paying it back its a lot us that  you know we dont really loan money to to countries we loan money to governments and its the   umhum oh thats true i hadnt thought of it that way i think   and its the governments its the governments should that thats really what we do you dont go up to the country you talk to the president or the chair or whatever of some group and you loan it to these people who are representing the government and by extension representing the country but when those people are gone and you have some new you know starving third world country with a brand new government that threw the previous rascals out um theyre personal incentive for repaying that debt is understandably low  because its they didnt they didnt borrow i mean you know it would be like you paying off the debts of uh some neighbors of yours you wouldnt feel very happy about it   yeah thats true yeah thats true   um so its a sort of like this is uh  i see a i dont know theres if theres a metaphor going on who are we loaning the money to and people can disagree about who that money is being loaned to   yeah yeah in some in some cases it uh i think its actually going to you know the people that its intended for in other cases uh and and this is all based and this is all up to actually the government thats in control now in some cases the the money actually does filter down to the to where its   umhum umhum   supposed to get to and in other cases it it does not   umhum umhum yeah i i i tend to get a little upset about loans to countries to obviously corrupt governments um   yeah   there a number of them for political reasons because were enemies of the neighboring government or something like that so we give them an either corrupt government anyway but its hard to view that so much as a loan as a bribe at that point   yeah   um   i dont really have a good solution for the budget thing either except for that um i know that theyre trying to be theyre that theyre supposedly trying to be fair with taxes and by making it more equal       but i cant really understand why um it has to be the same percentage where you have someone that makes um a very low amount of money the same percentage may affect them thirty five or forty times more severely than the same percentage   umhum umhum   of someones well if if they earn a great deal of money and i would being somewhere in the middle feel like that it would be a lot more fair to have a little more heavily weighted   umhum   toward the top end if i i can put my you know i think to myself if i had that much money   you could afford to pay more taxes   i could afford to pay more taxes it wouldnt bother me a bit   umhum umhum umhum well boy uh i mean i completely agree with you um on the stress that the tax burden for the upper class has actually decreased over the last ten years um   yeah they used to have and what do they i dont know what the percentage is now they used to be taxed thirty percent   yeah its its   and i remember hearing an interview with uh who was it the man who invented Hawaiian Tropic   umhum   you know and he he was talking about that he was talking about nobody went broke over paying thirty percent   umhum well the US pays the US pays less taxes than almost every industrialized country  um   you know well thats       they they get well it it depends on how you look at that because like Sweden they pay a lot in taxes but their day care is government subsidized   umhum yeah they they get things that they pay for   women who want to stay home with their children are subsidized to do that they dont have to live um   umhum umhum umhum   hand to mouth because it the government there and the country there has placed a very significant value on motherhood   umhum yeah i i think thats um well i think thats an important thing personally um   umhum i think we could learn some things from and the and the health care system you may pay more in taxes but your health care is taken care of and you dont have the corruption and in uh   umhum well they   medicine that that we have here with the the outrageous charges and   yeah i think the the Americans that i know who are are are sort of antitax a lot of them seem antitax because theyre distrustful of the government will spend their money wisely and the sense is i can spend the money on myself if i gave it to the government they would just waste it seems to be an an an attitude i hear is a lot of people and i think you hear that attitude you if you go to Sweden you wont hear that as much people will say well we need those services and were it makes our country great so we will are more willing to pay for it uh   hum yeah yeah i think that if we could model you know programs after those that are already i mean they did a lot of work finding a program that worked and if we were to do the research take under advisement what they have   umhum umhum yeah   already working and adapt it that that that particular day care system um works very well and the Canadian health plan is probably the best one in existence today   umhum yeah well it uh it may not last  once they  i hope it does but its uh its uh sad situation part of this this you you hear the phrase creeping socialism     hum   which is uh uh a propaganda phrase used a lot against exactly such types of spending programs and um   yeah   you usually say creeping socialism to conjure up fears of bread lines in Moscow um but if you use i mean this creeping
