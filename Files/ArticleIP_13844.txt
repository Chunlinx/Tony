                                 GI Envy            The No  best seller inAmerica this week is The Greatest Generation  by NBC news anchor TomBrokaw The most acclaimed and second highest grossing film of  justbehind Armageddon  was Saving Private Ryan  Though StevenSpielbergs film is fiction and Brokaws book is something akin to oralhistory they have in common a fashionable theme the nobility of those whoserved in the armed forces during World War II and by extension Americans ofthat age in general            You might describe thisperspective as GI envy Both Brokaw born in  and Spielberg born in evince a powerful sense of nostalgia for the world of their fathers As histitle suggests Brokaw makes an explicit case for the superiority of the WorldWar II generation In an introduction to the interviewprofiles that make uphis book he repeats a claim he first made on television when he was swept upby the emotion of the  th anniversary of DDay in  This isthe greatest generation any society has produced            The corollary of this reverence is an oftenunderarticulated feeling of generational selfloathing Echoing throughBrokaws book and to a lesser extent through Spielbergs movie is an implicitcomparison to the softer and more selfish generation that followed Joe Kleinanother boomer critic of his own generation often drew this contrast duringthe ClintonDole presidential race which he described as a choice betweenexperience and callowness between sacrifice and selfindulgence between themost heroic American generation of the century and the most coddled Boomerselfdisgust has also been making itself felt in the impeachment battle Manyof those who want to remove the president are conservative boomers who believethat Bill Clinton symbolizes a generation raised amid postwar prosperityaccording to the principles of Dr Spock one that lacks the moral fiber ofthose who experienced the Great Depression and fought in World War II            Were they the greatestgeneration that ever lived Their childrens generational neuroses dontnecessarily prove Brokaw wrong But the Brokaw position is badly flawed notbecause of the instinct that motivates it but because of a romanticizingtendency that eclipses all logic and evidence The notion that the GIs weresomehow better people than those born after them remains like most facilegeneralizations about generations a matter of prejudice not analysis            Lets look at a few of Brokaws overreaching assertions Inhis introduction he writes of the GIs They stayed true to their values ofpersonal responsibility duty honor and faith That sounds plausiblewherehave you gone Joe DiMaggio But consider just one of those attributesfaith Putting aside the question of whether more faith is a good thing wasthe GI generation really more religious than others Brokaw doesnt offer anysupport for this claim and one might well make the opposite case The UnitedStates has probably become more religious as boomers have become the dominantdemographic group About  percent more people now say they belong to churchesthan did so in the s when the GIs predominated            Almost all the traitsBrokaw attributes to the GIs are subject to similar demurrals Thats anotherlegacy of the World War II generation the strong commitment to family valuesand community Brokaw writes in another characteristic passage Its true thatreturning veterans didnt get divorced in large numbers But that doesnt provethat our grandparents and parents had a deeper commitment to family values Itsimply testifies to the legal and social reality they inheritedit was hard toget divorced in the s and s Who changed that reality The GIs didbecause they found the virtual prohibition on divorce an intolerablerestriction on their freedom As divorces became more readily available GIshad them too The baby boomers who inherited the divorce laws the World War IIgeneration loosened have in recent years begun to contemplate tightening themagain            I dont mean to imply that Brokaws book is all drivel Itincludes a number of moving stories about wartime heroism that can beappreciated without reference to its argument which is pretty muchsuperfluous But whats missing from Brokaws bookas from most oralhistoryis any hint of analytical rigor Aspects of American life that Brokawdeplores such as segregation and McCarthyism are viewed as part of thewallpaper It was not the GI generation that rounded up Japanese Americans andput them into camps That was merely American racism But when it came to thegood that happened on their watch Brokaw gives the GIs themselves full creditThey came to understand the need for federal civil rights legislation hewrites They gave America Medicare Well GI Johnson did give AmericaMedicare But others such as GI Dole voted against it Lets not forget thatGeorge Wallace and Joe McCarthy also served in World War II            Brokaw repeats most ofthe other familiar clichs World War II veterans know the value of a dollarthey never boast and theyre reluctant to talk about their wartimeexperiences Im tempted to say that Brokaw never met my Uncle Stanley Ofcourse its true that there are a lot of World War IIera vets who arentinclined to relive the battlefield horrors they experienced But this may haveless to do with the unique stoicism of a generation than with the naturalinclination everyone has to repress traumatic experiences If Vietnam vets havebeen tempted to make more of a meal of their experiences its partly due tothe fact that those experiences werent widely shared The therapeutic cultureof the present era also probably plays a role teaching us that its nothealthy to keep ones pain bottled up inside But who created that therapeuticculture You could argue once again that it was a bequest from members of theGI generation who introduced psychiatry and psychoanalysis into Americanlife            What many of the GIs Brokaw interviews say explicitly isthat the baby boomers lack the moral character they themselves had They facedgreat odds and a late start but they did not protest  Brokaw writes ofthe GIs casting another aspersion at the Vietnam generation italics mineBut at the risk of stating the obvious Vietnam was not like World War II Thequestion men of draft age faced after Pearl Harbor was whether they would servetheir country in an unambiguously good cause The challenge faced by theVietnam generation was morally more complex How do you serve your country whenit is engaged in a morally dubious cause a cause the country as a wholenotjust a few protesterscame to conclude was a mistake The World War IIgeneration also had little choice Everyone was needed in the war effort andthere were few opportunities to dodge the draft During the Vietnam War themilitary needed only a small percentage of those who were eligible and therewere many options for evasion legal and illegal Some served and didntprotest Others protested and didnt serve Some like Bob Kerrey and JohnKerry served and then protested Even today there is no obvious answer to whoanswered this quandary in the best way The GI envy felt by members of theVietnam generation seems in part a longing for the clearer moral imperative ofanother time            There are to be surepivotal generational experiences No one would deny that the Great Depressionand World War II molded one group of people or that Vietnam shaped another Butattempts to explain history in terms of common traits already possessed by thepeer groups that confronted these events are seldom illuminating Just as wecannot know how the baby boomers would have responded to the moral challenge ofWorld War II we cannot know how the World War II generation would haveresponded to the different moral challenge of Vietnam For that matter wecant compare the GIs to the Athenians of Pericles time the Florentines ofMichelangelos or the Americans of Abraham Lincolns To call one generationthe greatest doesnt say anything meaningful about that generation It doeshowever reveal something of what the speaker finds lacking in his own
