                                 The Liberace of Style            Gianni Versace wassynonymous with glitz and indecorousness but he was also a man of greattalent He makes me think of Liberace another man of great talent famous foroverthetop sartorial splendor that made people nervous Both men were blessedwith a strong capacity for pure delight There was nothing hostile rancorousweakminded or confused in their confident love of extreme display Peopleadored them for it            Also like LiberaceVersace understood how to wield theatrical magic Richard Martin the curatorof the Costume Institutes show and author of the catalog has stripped theVersace ensembles of the celebrity aura of their original wearersClaudiaSchiffer Princess Diana etcso that the clothes can show their own truequalities Hes right Arrayed on dummies the Versaces have the air of waitingbackstage for their entrance music Their showbiziness isnt just in thedramatic fabrics bold cut and applied glitter It is in their look ofheightened selfconsciousnessthe get this effect that establishescharacter Many of these outfits seem intended for actors in s Biblespectaculars or s screen dramas set in the s or presentday screencomedies where the clothes exaggerate the rolesthe Vamp and the Creep and theWeirdo and the Bitch The clothes do the work the actor could be anybody Justright for modern living            Some of the pieces have been worked up from modesoriginally invented for ladies in the s and s by Mme Grs or MadeleineVionnet for instancetwo neoclassic and erotic designers not at all averse tousing bodily exposureand then fantasticated a few notches further Versacetends to twitch the drapes so they hang an extra bit as if already plucked atby a lustful hand A black columnar dress with long sleeves and a neckline upto the chin in front leaves the whole back bare to well below the waist at oneside The bareness is enhanced by a drape that seems yanked down on purpose toexpose the bottom  inches of skin over the right kidney Three inches belowthat begins the slit in the skirt opening over the right buttock anddescending to the shoe This twostage rear cascade of bare flesh adroitlyswerving to avoid the cleavage of the buttocks is invisible from the frontThe face is left to do its work alone            Versace followed ancientItalian tradition in his deep love of materials and thats not just silkcotton linen and wool but also metal and leather synthetics and plasticFive centuries ago Italian dress was far more sumptuous chic and sexy thananything Frenchjust look at the striped codpieces in Signorelli paintingsThe Italians taught France everything about daring sartorial eleganceto saynothing of daring stagecraft cuisine and architectureuntil Louis XIV wasable to turn around and impose French fashion on all of Europe Italy had towait until after World War II to regain its rightful status as a primaryfashion source But superior Italian design has never ceased to be expressed inmarble bronze and silver and later in steel and aluminum in vinyl andLucite in tile and ceramic in straw in painted paper and painted plasterThe relish Versace brings to his clear vinyl dresses strewn with rhinestonesor to shinycolored opaque ones punctuated with nifty cutouts has traditionalbravura and sprezzatura in it suggesting Bernini at his most outr Thevulgarity is integral to the glory just as it is in majolica plates or Puccinioperas            Sometimes Versace took this spirit too far into trendyconceptual play When he forgets the eye and the body and tries to appeal tothe mind when he blinds you with toovivid zebra juxtaposed with toovividleopard so you cant see the dress or when he overburdens the feminine torsowith a short floppy bulky hoop skirt apparently made of hugely printed pastelsilk curtains from a Las Vegas hotel room topped by a short bulky blue denimjacket with big brass buttons then he starts looking too French and by that Imean theoretical            In clothing opticalchaos offered up as carefully unbecoming unbeauty is meant to refer to the ideaof modernism rather than embracing it directly in bodily terms What doesembrace both the modern and the body by contrast is Versaces sleek stiffshort hoopskirt dress made of briskly clashing silkprint sections in colorswept with a flowing blackandwhite silkprint stole Here the scale ofwarring shapes and prints is attuned to the female shape underneath so theresult is a modern garment not a modern sandwich board Another triumph is thebrilliant leopardskincumbaroquegoldornament silkprint scarf draped intoa closefitting column that turns the wearer into a walking blend of wild beastand ormolu candlestick Note how the swirls of gold hit the body over thebreasts navel and ovaries while the leopards spots slink over the crotchthighs and knees Yum            Also yummy is a virtual slip in sparkly white metal meshtrimmed top and bottom in sparkly black cotton lace But the most perfectgarment is a sleeveless black dress of tough synthetic net ornamented withinspired beading and delicate black leather appliqus that rise from the hem inblack flames maybe seaweed around the thighs and pelvis and descend from theneckline in uneven black clusters of grapes maybe clouds over the breasts andshoulders Through the middle the synthetic net makes moir patterns as itmoves against the bare midriff            At the end of the show aresome of Versaces stage costumes for operas and ballets There we see hisimagination working with mobile combinations of expanded and unearthly humancreatures covered with color and pattern and accompanied by music not so veryfar from the desired effect in much of real life right now Versace may haveresembled Liberace but he was also like Andy Warhol in that he saw the mythiccapacities of modern tawdriness He found his own way of expounding them in themost modern of media the new eroticized and commercialized arena of highfashion Requiescat                in                Pucci
