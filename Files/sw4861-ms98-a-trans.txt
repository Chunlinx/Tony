            what do you think   well i think AIDS research should be funded more than its currently being funded i think that uh people including i mean mostly the government but also you know a lot of Americans i think that its a disease of of a certain population i meaning um homosexuals and and uh intravenous drug users   umhum right   in fact it is very much a a normal persons uh disease as well i think that we should fund much more   sure right i think i i agree with that to a certain degree um certainly on an absolute scale it should be i i think it should be funded more on a relative scale um looking at it in comparison with other problems and no its not a big environment im not so sure about that however um yeah youre right definitely theres theres a definite um stigma out there that yeah its its its limited exclusive to intravenous drugs users and homosexuals and um blacks or whatever   umhum yeah umhum   and thats not thats not the case anymore it may have started out that way even though theres theres still no proof of that actually the most recent um the that ive gotten is theyre starting to look at um well it started over in Africa theyre starting to look at i believe but believe it of monkey   yeah  the  monkey i think     yeah there was some kind of research going on and i cant remember what the exact uh gist of it was but something they hadnt considered before and its like they now theyre trying to go way back to the original first outbreaks of it to see if they can uh nail down what  exactly it was   yeah yeah   but uh   well you know you have you have a point about you know where theres other issues that that need a lot of funding too  sure that is true   umhum   but uh theres a lot of things that are funded and a lot of waste that can be redirected too  i think that that again that uh   oh sure yeah   you know AIDS is is something that has to be dealt with by every person um and and not just in understanding that its you know can affect uh everyone but in acting um in a uh you know sensible way to avoid uh the spread of this disease   yeah umhum well i i agree with that   umhum   um the point i i wanted to make was just strictly the environment like right now they say weve lost forty percent of the ozone layer just last year   um   in in selected in selected spots and thats really becoming a really big problem but thats not to down play the importance of AIDS research you know   sure right right   um when you think about that importance you also have to consider that uh not only is AIDS good in and of its own but it also uh has a lot to deal with um cancer and with mononucleosis and all the all the various diseases that affect the T cell from a and the and the when the white cells of the immune system because all fairly interrelated   umhum right right   so i think research on AIDS would benefit all that stuff   yeah good point um i i think more often should go into you know AIDS uh education   yeah oh yeah   you know commercials you know public service commercials um schools   umhum   things like that   but it seems a lot like theyre almost covering it up at this point   yeah which is ridiculous   you you you really dont see a lot out there   its like coming up with  plague you know no its not happening   yeah   uh disregard the you know  one out of two people dropping dead next to you you know   right you know thats thats for sure i i like i said i go to school at UCF in Florida and actually that kind of hits home because that Kimberly Begajah that had AIDS uh and died from it she went to a dentist in Stewart Florida thats where she got it   right right   and Stewarts like three hours away from where i go to school   umhum right people i hear a lot more in local news about it   uh more than that i had a couple of friends who went to that dentist   yeah interesting   yeah and they were definitely sweating bullets there for a while um and found out that they they were negative you know they didnt have any problems but um   uhhuh right   you know boy talk about making you think twice before you go to the dentist   yeah   or any health care practitioner at this point   yeah i guess so   yeah because they really the last article i read on that they still hadnt figured out how she couldve gotten it from him   umhum   because he he as far as they could tell he sterilized the equipment he used gloves he did all the the proper precautions um asides from telling his patients that he had AIDS um but still that didnt make any difference they still got it so they theyre not real sure how that how that worked   umhum right   but uh yeah im im a lot more cautious of that but
