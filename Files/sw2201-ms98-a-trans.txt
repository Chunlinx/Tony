        okay   lead on     um drug testing doesnt bother me   doesnt bother you   no uh ive been drug tested twice at TI and it doesnt bother me uh   well we differ there       it bothers me   why why does it bother you   i just feel like its an invasion invasion of my privacy you know i you know theres a lot alcohol for example i can go out and drink on the weekends and come in hung over and do a lot worse job than if i go out on Friday and i dont know say take take a hit of Ecstasy and dance all night not saying that i do but im just   i know i understand uh   i think alcohols a a whole lot worse drug and its more widely accepted   well thats true i i agree that there should be something done about people that drink alcohol because im sure that theres people that drink and come to work especially on a second shift or third shift so uh i agree with you there but it just uh and it and it probably is an invasion of privacy   i i feel like its okay if theres if theres cause somebodys performance is you know indicates indicates that theyre theyre obviously not all there theyre   do yeah okay   you know you got reason to suspect they may be doing drugs and he says sure you know take them down there and test them but i think a lot of people are going to go out and you know substitute something else for maybe what they would have done a lot of people i dont i personally dont smoke pot but a lot of people do and they do it in their own time at their at their at their own place and theyre going to find theyre going to go out and drink instead because they know that its their job on the line   thats true   and uh you know ive been ive come to work hung in the morning and i know im worthless   feel bad yeah i dont drink anymore but i can remember           but   i can remember the you know theres nothing worse than a hangover i have to agree there nothing worse than a i can remember staying in bed a whole day from a hangover  and not going to work but i that was years ago and i didnt work for TI so but you you know really and truly theres theres nothing worse than a hangover and youre right and you cannot perform well   and the same is true of the drug hangover you know if you   thats true   but theres i think theres a theres a big difference between use and abuse and i do do agree that drug abuse should be punished but if somebodys going to in their own home on their own time in such a way that doesnt interfere interfere with their responsibilities you know do it do some drugs then that should be their business   course through this i think that theyve helped a lot of people also uh a lot of people have ended up going uh to treatment you know which is offered i think at most government places i know it is at TI do you work for TI   yeah yeah i do   okay well you know a lot of people have used that treatment and i center and thats probably been a good thing especially for cocaine abusers and stuff   i think i think thats true and i think that the key thing is the difference between use and abuse and a lot of people dont they they dont know how to use drugs for recreational purposes without it becoming you know a dominant force in their life   the drug can use you   i mean yeah its its you know its easy for me to say im going to go out on Friday night and maybe you know i dont have to work till Monday and if i want to go out and and drink a little beer or do something and just dance a lot or whatever thats fine as long as i realize Saturday that in order to you know im going to feel like crap thats just the way it is same thing if you drink but the thing is you dont get up and drink another beer to get over it     yeah   and and unfortunately and i think cocaines a a good example its its just so much easier to just do some more do some more and then before you know it you know youre youre always doing it   yeah   i dont know   thats true thats true yep well   i mean i i work for TI so i dont do drugs you know   you cant i mean it and you just run the risk of   right its too big a risk yeah   of of getting caught and of course the first time you get caught its not that big a deal you have to go to treatment and that   but youre without a paycheck during that time and i dont at least thats my understanding is even you know the first time you go for counseling and its six weeks before youre back to work   oh i didnt know they took you off the job   i was that i was told that uh somebody had uh some woman had had a cold or something and had some cough medicine prescribed and her husband or maybe the other way around one of them anyway had uh come down with the same thing and used some of the medicine and was tested the next day and failed and was out of a job until he went through counseling and its like you know i cant afford that kind of loss of income you know   wow who can afford that  my God i cant afford to miss a day let alone six   i mean ive always been yeah the first time so what ill go explain myself and and   now i would have thought if hed have brought in the prescription wife prescription and explained the situation that they might have let him off of that   thats what you would think but i kind of i thats i you know i heard it through the grapevine so i dont i dont know firsthand but thats what i heard was that it was just   they didnt okay yeah   you know there there were no   now see that i wouldnt agree with see see i think you got to be able to bend the rules a little bit here and there too without you know if if its a case like that because look how many people take their husbands or their wifes medication you know but thats a really good example   oh yeah you know youve got the same exact thing yeah   yeah yeah and so i would think that either the doctor could get him off with that or or that they should listen i mean because i i just cant see that they would do some make somebody go to a rehab or whatever they go through because he took his wifes medicine that just doesnt sound right does it so it seems like they should be able to bend  the rules oops excuse me a little bit on that but you but i dont know because i dont know anybody thats had to go through treatment or anything so i really dont know   well i think i dont know anybody personally either   you know   i do know a lot of people that you know do use drugs recrela recreationally and theres such a big difference yeah i i dont know its its kind of ive also been you know known managers at TI i know one i guess i shouldnt make that a plural but uh who drank on the job had whiskey in his desk drawer and you tell me whats worse   ooh   you know   oh that could have been his whole career down the tubes   yeah but everybody covers up you know its the good old boy thing i dont know   so does alcohol show up in these tests   i dont think so they dont test for it i mean   so so it wouldnt show up yeah well its not thats true see theres the there it is right there its not illegal   its not illegal   and drugs are illegal so i guess if they made drugs legal or marijuana legal then we the we wouldnt be going through this you know they wouldnt be testing which doesnt make any sense either because they say you know it has no place on the job and you cant work safely under the influence of drugs and stuff like that   well thats true   and so if it was made legal that doesnt make it any safer on the job   no no i agree i think i believe in test for cause if if somebodys performance and i guess that theres the other argument is that well do you wait until they screw up you know and someone gets hurt   get hurt yeah   yeah but at the same time you know youre telling me that on some given day im going to walk in theyre going to tell me go down and you know and go down to the health center and you know pee in a jar or whatever it is no i havent and so   have you had to do it yet oh gosh i was one of the first ones to go i think the with the January that they started it up i got called so i was one of the first ones but but you did you get tested when you got hired   no see i was ive been working for TI for almost eight years   okay so you were well i i got tested before i got hired too so but hum   i have to i have to honestly say that i drink more now than i did because you know its what i can get away with and if im going to go on the weekends spend my money and you know i       if you dont drink you know you used to drink okay you go out and you want to party and thats thats something you do when youre young and dumb i guess       you know   im not young anymore   im not as young as i used to be but im still   i quit i quit drinking at oh a long time ago quit drinking i didnt smoke i dont smoke i gave everything up so i guess i dont know what just old age i guess is why i   no i dont smoke i quit doing that and ive tried to quit drinking but its the only thing left you know i quit doing drugs when TI said quit and it was no big deal you know its like i wasnt a regular drug user but uh   oh i have a lot of friends that just are uh smoke just you know occasional joint at a party or something you know and and im even afraid to be around it   i i understand   because im afraid what if it gets you know because you can inhale it if if youre if a room full of it   i understand i was around somebody today outdoors and theyre smoking and its like you know i smell it and im like well is this going into my bloodstream you know is this is there going to be enough there to get me   into my bloodstream yeah and with my luck thered be the notice Monday you know  go take your test and that would scare me   get me in trouble so see it didnt use to bother me when i thought that you know if i come in there and they say okay you tested positive now explain yourself and i could say yeah well i was around some people that were smoking pot but i wasnt but you know its the idea that   how can you prove it   you cant but at least youve got a chance whereas if they say for six weeks you dont have a job because you tested positive that you know thats thats devastating how you know i cant live without my income for six weeks theres no way   no not many people could i go paycheck to paycheck barely   exactly   so   so i dont know   well this has been interesting   yeah opposing viewpoints there   but huh   i said opposing viewpoints   sort well sort of i mean i i agree with a lot of what you said   for the most part
