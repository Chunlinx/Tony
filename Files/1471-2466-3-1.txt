                    Background        Human Tlymphotropic virus type I HTLVI has been        associated with sporadic cases of chronic bronchiolitis and        alveolitis especially in patients with concurrent HTLV        associated myelopathy HAM      HTLV type II        HTLVII has been epidemiologically associated with        increased incidences of bronchitis and pneumonia among        HTLVII infected persons             Biological studies have demonstrated increased levels of        CDCD lymphocytes     HTLVI proviral load and        HTLVI taxrex mRNA expression      HTLVI specific        IgA     soluble interleukin receptors            betachemokines    and soluble intracellular adhesion        molecule ICAM     in bronchoalveolar lavage        fluid from HTLVI infected humans In addition mice        transgenic for HTLVI p tax had lymphocytic infiltration        of peribronchial and perivascular lung tissues associated        with intrapulmonary expression of tax mRNA     In        general patients with HTLV myelopathy or uveitis had more        pronounced biological changes but some of these studies        also found biological changes in the lungs of asymptomatic        HTLVI carriers        However whether HTLVI or HTLVII alters pulmonary        function is unknown Such information is important because        the pathologic spectrum of these chronic human retroviral        infections has not been completely described In addition        such information would be useful to physicians who must        counsel or treat persons found to be HTLVI or II        seropositive by serologic screening at the time of blood        donation military service or as part of clinical care        associated with injection drug use        We therefore performed standardized pulmonary function        testing PFT on HTLVI and HTLVII infected persons        participating in the HTLV Outcomes Study HOST a        prospective multicenter cohort study of the health outcomes        of HTLV infection that was initiated as part of the        National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Retrovirus        Epidemiology Donor Study                    Methods                  Study design and patient population          The enrollment and followup procedures of the HOST          have been described in detail elsewhere     In brief          persons found to be seropositive for HTLVI and HTLVII          at the time of routine or autologous blood donation in           at five United States blood centers were          eligible for enrollment HTLVI and HTLVII infection          status was confirmed with typespecific serology andor          polymerase chain reaction testing Subjects have been          followed approximately every two years with health          history questionnaires physical examinations and blood          testing At the third biennial visit in  we          performed PFT on a randomly selected subset of HTLVI and          II positive subjects at four of the five HOST centers          American Red Cross Blood Services Southeastern Michigan          Detroit MI American Red Cross Blood Services Southern          California Los Angeles CA Blood Centers of the          Pacific San Francisco CA and the Oklahoma Blood          Institute Oklahoma City OK We also selected          seronegative subjects at the same four centers by strata          based upon the age sex and racial distribution of the          HTLV positive subjects and asked them to undergo          PFT                          PFT Procedures          In performing the PFTs we followed standards          published by the American Thoracic Society              Spirometers were calibrated according to these standards          and subjects performed three forced expirations We          measured forced vital capacity FVC in liters forced          expiratory volume at one second FEV             diffusing lung capacity corrected          for hemoglobin DLCO           corr  and diffusing lung capacity          corrected for hemoglobin and alveolar ventilation DLCO           corr VA Each subjects best effort          as judged by the highest sum of vital capacity and FEV            from among three expiratory efforts          was used in the analysis                          Statistical analysis          For each of the pulmonary function measures means and

       California San Francisco San Francisco CA USA has          approved the study                            Results        Among the  subjects enrolled in the study one        subject had only one instead of three expiratory efforts        recorded This subject was eliminated from further        analysis leaving a study population of  none had adult        Tcell leukemia or HTLV associated myelopathy The HTLVI        and HTLVII subjects were comparable to seronegative        subjects with regard to age gender and raceethnicity        except that HTLVI subjects were somewhat older and more        likely to be of black raceethnicity and to be former        smokers Table  Although the three groups were of        similar height HTLVI infected subjects had a        nonsignificant trend toward lower body weight Thirtyone        percent of the HTLVII subjects were current smokers        compared to only  percent of the HTLVI and seronegative        groups Dating from study enrollment in  incident        cases of medicallydiagnosed pneumonia or acute bronchitis        were reported by  percent of HTLVI  percent of        HTLVII and  percent of seronegative subjects in the        current analysis Data on log          proviral load were available from         of  HTLVI subjects mean   standard error         copies per PBMC and from  of  HTLVII subjects mean          standard error  copies per PBMC        Mean standard deviation pulmonary function values        among all  subjects were as follows FVC           L FEV             L DLCO         corr    mlminmmHg        alveolar ventilation VA    L and DLCO         corr VA    mlminmmHgL        These data were comparable to mean values for men and women        combined reported by the First National Health and        Nutrition Examination NHANES I of FVC   FEV            and DLCO         corr       In our study FVC        and FEV          were also corrected for height squared        in meters yielding values of   Lm and          Lm  respectively There was also no significant        difference in small airway flow FEF           between HTLV infected and        seronegatives p   data not shown        Figures through show the raw pulmonary function        values stratified by HTLV status The HTLVI group had        slightly lower mean FVC FEV          and DLCO         corr than did the seronegative group        but no such difference was apparent for the HTLVII        group        The results of the multivariable linear regression        analysis are presented in Table  For both FVC and FEV        adjusted for height squared mean values were only        minimally smaller for the HTLVI group and no different at        all for the HTLVII group both compared to HTLV        seronegatives For DLCO         corr  the HTLVI group had mean values        that were about ten percent lower and the HTLVII group        about five percent lower compared to seronegatives        However these differences narrowed after adjustment for        potential confounding variables and neither was        statistically significant although there was a trend        toward lower adjusted DLCOcorr for the HTLVI group DLCO        corrected for alveolar ventilation DLCO         corr VA showed no differences between        both HTLV groups and seronegatives in either the unadjusted        or the multivariable analysis Finally there was no        association between DLCO and the level of HTLVI or HTLVII        proviral load among the HTLV seropositives data not        shown                    Discussion        This study did not reveal significant differences        between HTLVI or II infected and uninfected persons in        pulmonary function or diffusing capacity after adjustment        for confounding variables This normal pulmonary function        data are in contrast to previous reports of        bronchioalveolitis and differences in biological        measurements in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid among persons        with HTLVI infection             Most previous reports of HTLVI bronchioalveolitis        reported more frequent and severe pathological and        biological abnormalities of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in        patients with HTLV myelopathy or uveitis compared to HTLVI        carriers without apparent disease       Since our        patients were without overt inflammatory disease we cannot        comment on potential pulmonary function abnormalities in        patients with clinical inflammation Likewise a rare case        of bronchioalveolitis among our study group could have had        pulmonary function abnormalities that were masked by our        comparison of mean values among the HTLVI HTLVII and        seronegative groups Finally our subjects could have had        clinical or subclinical pulmonary inflammation due to        HTLVI or HTLVII infection but this inflammation was not        of sufficient severity or duration to manifest measurable        decrements in overt pulmonary function        Data from the cohort study from which these subjects        were drawn has revealed an increased incidence of pneumonia        and acute bronchitis among HTLVII and to a lesser degree        HTLVI infected humans      Those results were based        upon analyses of reported physician diagnoses of these        illnesses and were adjusted statistically to account for        differences in socioeconomic status cigarette smoking and        alcohol intake between HTLV infected and uninfected        subjects Although we initially attributed these illnesses        to an increased susceptibility to bacterial infection we        now propose the hypothesis that these diagnoses may have        been due to immunological mechanisms as in cases of HTLVI        bronchioalveolitis The negative results of current study        although reassuring to persons with HTLVI or HTLVII        infection cannot exclude either of these hypotheses        Strengths of the current study include its setting in a        well characterized cohort study of humans with laboratory        confirmed HTLVI and HTLVII infection and the inclusion        of an appropriate control group Due to information        gathered in the cohort study we were also able to control        for other potential confounding variables such as cigarette        smoking and alcohol intake Weaknesses include moderate        size of the study which made us unable to detect PFT        differences that were less than about ten percent PFTs        were done at four different sites which could have        resulted in increased variability of the results The PFTs        that we used may be insensitive to minor degrees of        pulmonary damage and with this crosssectional data we may        have missed a progressive loss of pulmonary function over        time in the HTLV groups                    Conclusions        In conclusion this moderate size study did not reveal        any statistically significant differences in pulmonary        function between generally healthy HTLVI or II infected        persons and comparable HTLV seronegatives However it could        not rule out subtle differences in lung inflammation that        might lead to functional impairment over a longer followup        period Further studies of the immunologic characteristics        of bronchoalveolar lavage cells from HTLVI or II infected        humans are needed especially in persons with a history of        recurrent pneumonia or acute bronchitis but without        myelopathy or uveitis                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        Study Design Murphy Ameti        Patient Accrual Ownby
