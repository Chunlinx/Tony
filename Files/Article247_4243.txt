the Times  that for thefirst time since the ATT breakup phone customers in New York will beable to get local and longdistance phone service from the same company Thepaper views this as auguring the FCCs approval of longdistance provision bythe other Baby Bells as well Upshot The LD giants like ATT and Sprintwill have powerful new competitors who already have service relationships withtens of millions of customers            The LAT lead emphasizes the antiterror moves being made by theFederal Aviation Administration at airports The WP lead limns theintensifying concern occurring across the full spectrum of the federalgovernment reporting for instance on an antiterrorism meeting Mondayattended by Madeleine Albright the CIA director and the chairman of the JointChiefs Both stories note that Customs has just reassigned some  extraagents to remote spots along the Canadian and Mexican borders            The WP lead also promotes the significance of a second border arrest on Dec  of an Algerian man anda Canadian woman trying to enter Vermont from Quebec The man did not haveadequate identification and later a false French passport was found in hisjacket And says the Post  when two bombsniffing dogs were called into go over the carone for detecting plastic explosives the other blackpowderthey each alerted to the same portion of the car suggesting theresidue of explosives

contributions to individualcandidates The socalled victory funds are says the Times  being used forSenate races in New York California Florida Louisiana MassachusettsMichigan and Missouri The paper says experts say the funds are probablylegal because despite being incorporated and administered by national partyorganizations they create only an informal tie between the donor or thenational party on the one hand and the individual candidate on the otherwhereas a formal tie would be illegal given the amounts involved And yesthe paper explains the New York operation benefits Hillary Clintonto thetune of several hundred thousand dollars Gripe Although the story makes itclear that the Republicans have established victory funds as well the headlineonly mentions Democrats            A frontpage WP story cites unnamed sources to sketch PresidentClintons postpresidential plans living halftime in Arkansas where he willoversee a new graduate program at the University of Arkansas a public policycenter and a publicsector fellowship program for young executives Inaddition says the story Clinton intends to earn large sums of money makingspeeches at up to  a pop            Both the NYT and WP front Housing and Urban DevelopmentSecretary Andrew Cuomos announcement yesterday that his agency will takedirect control of the  million earmarked for services for the homeless inNew York

also makes the WSJ s frontpage business and financial newsbox although in the summary there the reader is spared any reference to thewoman            The NYT reports that newly declassified Senate testimony shows thatJanet Reno said last June that she thought federal investigators into thepossible theft of US nuclear technology by China had focused prematurely onformer Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee The paper which has run manyfrontpage stories in the past year suggesting that China did indeed steal USnuclear secrets often detailing suspicious behavior of Lee puts this oneinside Incidentally LAT columnist Robert Scheer noted yesterday thatthe NYT has yet to write about a Stanford University research teamscritique of the principal government document making the case against Lee andChina            A frontpage WSJ story documents something pretty interesting aboutschools on military bases Although their student bodies are more raciallydiverse and poorer than those in general society their test scores are verygood In fact in  base schools scores in the national eighthgradewriting exam were No  in the country And the rate of matriculation is percent compared to the national rate of  percent One hidden variable thestory suggests is partially responsible The military commands tend to supportthe teachers in disciplinary wrangles with students and their parents
