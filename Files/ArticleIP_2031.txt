                                 Putting on Heirs            Metaphors like magictricks may dazzle through deceit Take for example the recurring metaphor ofsociety as an extended family a particular favorite among those who aspire tobe the head of the household The accompanying patter goes like this Familiesdo not allow one member to prosper while another struggles ergo  weneed something like a bigger welfare system or a more progressive tax code            Note therhetorical sleight of hand While you were still pondering whether society isreally like a family I slipped in the wholly invented fact that familiestake from the rich and give to the poor The truth at least as it is revealedby last wills and testaments is otherwise Apparently among the childreneven when some children are much wealthier than others A bequest is a finalopportunity to redistribute income among those you love the most if mostparents reject that opportunity then its pretty hard to see anythingfamilial in using the tax system to redistribute income among strangers            But bequests arent the only economic transactions withinfamilies Does the family function as a welfare state in other ways What aboutschooling Lets think about that Who would you rather send to college yoursmart kid who can make the most of an education or your dumb kid who needsall the help he can get The answereven if you have an egalitarian impulse topour resources into the dumb kidis to send the smart kid to college and makeit up to the dumb kid through bequests or other cash gifts That strategymaximizes total family income which allows you to do more good for bothyour children So even if parents really wanted to equalize their childrensincomes they             If notschooling then what about time and attention At least in large families thebig winners in the timeandattention sweepstakes are the firstborns and thelastbornsthose who get to spend a few years as an only child The middlesiblings perform significantly worse on sixthgrade  This suggests that timeand attention are valuable in much the same way that schooling is and thatthey are therefore equally unsuitable as a medium for redistribution So thegeneral rule is that if people wanted to redistribute among offspring theyddo it through bequests            An exception might be poor families wherebequests are insubstantial In those circumstances lavishing the lessskilledchildren with schooling time and attention might be the only way to transferincome in their direction This exception incidentally could explain whyprograms like Head Start are disappointingly ineffective When little Johnny isaccepted into the Head Start program his parents compensate Johnnys brothersand sisters by spending more time with them and less with Johnny Theres anice irony here By and large the folks who want to argue that most people areinstinctively redistributionist are the same folks who want to argue for theefficacy of programs like Head Start But the stronger the redistributionistinstincts of Johnnys parents the less hell gain from the Head Startprogram            Returning to the generalrule the best way to redistribute income is through bequests But parentsdont use bequests to redistribute income We are entitled to conclude thatparents dont consider redistributing income to be terribly important Thatleads to a natural followup question What do parents consider terriblyimportant How do they decide what to leave to whom            I likethe theory that parents believe there is something intrinsically fairabout giving equal amounts to everyone But to test that theory wed need toknow more about the distribution of parental giftslike schooling time andattentionduring the parents lifetime I dont know whether my pet theorywould survive that test            An alternative theory is that a bequest is a mistakeAccording to this theory parents would prefer to spend everything theyve gotbefore they go The only reason theres anything left over is that deatharrives unexpectedly But if this alternative were correct wed see old peopleusing all their savings to purchase annuities that pay them a guaranteed incomefor life The limited market for such annuities suggests that people prefer toleave something behind            Yetanother theory is that parents are governed by a strategic bequest motiveusing their estates to purchase attention from their grown children The threatof disinheritance keeps those children in line when the threat is effectivenobody is actually disinherited If this theory were true youd expect parentswith a lot of bequeathable wealth stocks bonds etc to get far more visitsfrom their children than parents with an equal amount of nonbequeathable wealthsuch as pensions That prediction and found accurate which is one goodreason to believe the theory            Parallel to the strategic bequest motive wecan hypothesize a strategic gift motive that operates while the parents arestill alive Those children who are struggling and hence more likely to burdentheir parents say by returning to live with them get extra help in the hopethat they the children will become selfsufficient As a variation on thistheme one can imagine a strategic schooling motive whereby theleastaccomplished children get extra schooling in the hope that they willbecome more interesting to converse with At bequest time the strategic giftmotive would evaporate and the favored child would be favored no longer            Bequest motives interactwith economic policy in surprising ways The effects of a deficitfinanced taxcut can depend on whether most parents are altruistic or strategic Altruisticparents would save the money from their tax cuts and leave it to the childrenwho must pay off all that government debt someday that saving would holdinterest rates down Strategic parents might spend a large portion of their taxcuts causing interest rates to rise            Its thatinteraction with fiscal policy that has drawn economists attention to bequestmotives in recent years But a deeper reason for investigating bequests is thatthey reveal something about peoples instinctive sense of justice Thatinstinctive sense is the best guide we have to economic policy in everysphere
