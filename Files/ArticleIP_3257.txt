                                 The End of the World as We Know It            It cannot be said too oftenthat the principal job of a modern mainstream movie critic is to distinguishsmart formula crap from dumb formula crap At one extreme are The Truman               Show and Men in Black  at the other Godzilla and the direSix Days Seven                Nights  which squanders a plucky CaroleLombardish turn by the scrumptious Anne Heche Theres an especially virulentsubdivision of the above smart formula crap that makes the viewer dumbTo this category can be assigned the new

McKee the stakes in every act areratcheted up Where theres a cliff theres a hanger            Well Armageddon worked for this lab rat Theelectrodes were cannily placed the jolts administered at regular intervalsAlong with the rest of the audience I jumped when I was meant to jump laughedwhen I was meant to laugh and swallowed a lump in my throat when I was meantto feel moved Its true little irritants kept creeping in It gets harder andharder to like Affleck especially when he plays dumb guys by putting everyline in the same generic workingJoe italics Liv Tyler is a lollipop for theeyes

narration Willis climactic exhortationto Chew this iron bitch up Still there are few villains as apolitical as agiant asteroid We can all agree that it would indeed be a good thing to chewthat iron bitch up            DirectorMichael Bay  The Rock  has whiplash comic timing and he can certainlydo spectacle The opening bombardment of Manhattan is riotously well editedand so is  well without giving too much away we wont always have ParisIts too bad that Bay has to hardsell every shot His pacing is strictly forthe Ritalin generation and his carcommercial compositions make the movie seemeven more synthetic The asteroid itself is disappointingly undercharacterizedand Bay compensates by turning every frame into a blur of motion You cantreally see what the drillers are doingnot even maverick Affleck in his bigI can drill this number Armageddon is awesome dude but its likeshort on awe            Still I cant dislike a picture in which whenall seems lost the hero turns to the Mission Control camera and says Preparethe world for bad news Willis has become a master of doing nothing offinding just the right and most noncommittal combination of facetiousness andsincerity He can deliver zingers and he can also invoke the Almighty He cancall himself a thirdgeneration driller add that drilling is not a scienceits an art and not be laughed off the screen Hes the perfect mascot for ahaveitbothways hipsquare disaster epic which parodies The RightStuff machismo and wants you to buy into it at the same time which istrue come to think of it of The Right Stuff itself The yucks comethick and fast until the motley comicrelief crew starts getting blown away inthe line of duty and then its time to get patriotic            In theend its Buscemis movie As the horniest most sardonic member of Willisteam he has the funniest lines and his wormy dyspeptic grin sits on theworlds most ingratiating skull head Buscemi knows how to act on the flywhich is essential in a Michael Bay picture if you want to be more than asplotch on the screen As streakers go he makes more of an impact than theasteroid            Out of Sight is slick in all the right ways It starts witha disorienting series of shock cuts during which George Clooney tears off histie marches through traffic into a bank and without a weapon or a plan pullsoff a charmingly effortless robbery foiled only by a bad starter on his wreckof a car By now only  minutes into the picture the director StevenSoderbergh  sex lies and                videotape  has the audience in ahappy receptive statenot quite knowing what to expect and delighted to finditself in such clever hands The later whimsical novels of Elmore Leonard havebeen all too putdownable but Soderbergh contrives the perfect voice forLeonards proselaidback and grooving when it needs to be but also tautwith the eerie foreboding of violence about to erupt He has evolved into afirstrate commercial director            The movies zigs and zags aretoo entertaining to divulge but its permissible to say that Clooney andJennifer Lopez as a Miamibased government marshal meet cute She gets shutup with him in the trunk of a getaway car and is hostage to his chatter aboutmovies a life of crime and how he wishes he had met her in a bar so he couldhave picked her up Clooney is a handsome rogue and knows it Hes starting togo to seed though which makes him vulnerableespecially to Lopez a smartripely beautiful actress who projects a disarmingly high opinion of herself Nophony demureness here She acts as if she came of age telling an endless paradeof Latin men where to put it When she succumbs to Clooneys Irish allure youknow theres going to be a but            Produced by the same teamthat made Leonards Get Shorty  Out of Sight is stuffed withamazing actors among them Ving Rhames as Clooneys buddy Don Cheadle as amercurial psychopath and in unbilled cameos Michael Keaton and Samuel LJackson Jr Best of all is Albert Brooks as a multimillionaire financier whomeets up with Clooney when hes thrown in prison for felony fraud Brooks studshis familiar sadsack persona with hard shards of ruthlessness andopportunism Like this terrific confection he never melts
