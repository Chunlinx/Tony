        okay well how do you feel about uh drug testing uh for prospective employees     well i i think my feelings on it are it depends i think if its necessary if you have the kind of job that it it requires you to always be you know like police officers firemen doctors anybody who has you know whos important whose decisions are important and  you know thats   uhhuh   thats what i think as far as you are required to not only be at work when youre not at work as it were you know what im saying if you if if   oh i see oh twenty four hour people you mean   yeah people who who could be at work at any time or whose decisions could be clouded if they had to make a decision   uhhuh uhhuh   when they arent at work but i dont see the point in it if youre if youre putting something together down at the local pizza place or whatever   umhum   then id uh i just dont see what merits youre going to have from gaining what you do when youre not at work in those situations is your own business i think i think thats an infringement upon your personal rights   umhum   thats an invasion of your personal privacy thats if they were to decide that you shouldnt be drinking would would they just you know i mean you you have to draw the line somewhere i think and give people the right to do what they need to do what they want to do   uhhuh would you  uh would you do it before they were employed or would would you say random testing is also okay   yes i okay im im im i i think thats fine i think if youre if if it matters to you that much then you should you know i mean if you want to weed out those kind of people right from the start i have no problem with that because you dont you dont want somebody whos a drug user starting work for you but i dont i dont think that they can just   yeah   come back and and get you anytime you know i i dont think it it could be surprise at your door here we are you know or   umhum yeah   or come to show up for work one day and they just say here you go i i dont know its kind of   its a hard problem isnt it because because you dont want an airline pilot on drugs     yeah its its really you dont   yeah exactly   but at the same time thats a thats a thats an embarrassing humiliating kind of test to have to take people questioning you by you know by doing that     yeah umhum its yeah its kind of a do you trust me do you not trust me   yeah   you know its i dont know i dont i dont know its its awfully its it has its points its good points and its bad points see it kind of makes us look like were going in the other direction as far as the way the rest of the worlds going almost   yeah   you know ive walls are coming come in Berlin and   and were and were getting   we and here we are were going the other way and   it does feel like it doesnt it   yeah it does and so i dont know its kind of a perplexing problem   i know well it is because when we think about it and it isnt at all reassuring       doctors have been on drugs for years  from what i hear   oh yeah yeah   you know and and uh weve uh and we have all sorts of people whove done things and im certainly not in favor of of any of that and yet somehow theyve performed and then they say well if i did what i was suppose to do and did it       the way i was suppose to do it then why would you you know whose business is it   yeah who am i harming as long as i am doing my job yeah   right and yet the potential like i dont like knowing that there might be an alcoholic who is flying my plane or or you know cutting into my body     yeah yeah exactly you dont want your doctor coming in hung over if hes gonna be cutting on you that day thats for sure so uh yeah that is difficult youre gonna you cant but then that just kind of comes back to personal responsibility   uhhuh   you but i guess thats  more or less forcing you to be personally responsible for yourself       its basically all theyre trying to do with that then if you want to  if you look at it that way because you would think your doctor wouldnt be out drinking the night before but but if he thought he could get caught doing it then he certainly wouldnt do it as opposed to well   thats right thats right   its not a big operation tomorrow what the heck or something  you know   its only only only old lady so and so from where ever and     yeah yeah its just a gallbladder it aint  you know no problem yeah i guess thats just uh thats basically what theyre doing then just forcing you to be responsible but i guess some people have to be forced so   right   yeah it and it does it does make you wonder because im not sure i was trying to think in in history have have people checked that or did people just did people just accept the responsibility or are we able to test things now that never could be tested before so therefore were using technology in a way that wasnt available before   that was yeah wasnt yeah thats i dont know i i kind of think well its partially because we have the technology now but its also because i think moral standards have gone downhill quite a bit since earlier you know i mean its just its just reached that point where society accepts   umhum umhum   you know you dont think about seeing your doctor out at a bar anymore whereas you know nineteen forty doctor so and so   right
