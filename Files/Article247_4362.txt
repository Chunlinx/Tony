                                 Slander Patrol Gores Litmus Test            John McCain says Al Gore and Bill Bradley are not qualified to be commanderin chief based upon their support of a litmus test for future chairmen of theJoint Chiefs of Staff The Republican National Committee is now running adsthat say the same thing Leaving aside the minor nuance that Bradley neverendorsed any test at all let alone a litmus test for the Joint Chiefschairman is McCain right to argue that Gores position is unreasonable            Heres what Gore said in the debate on January  in response to aquestion from Peter Jennings on whether he would have a litmus test for thepost of chairman of the Joint Chiefs                           I would try to bring about the kind of change in policy on the dont askdont tell policy that President Harry Truman brought about after World WarII in integrating the military And I think that would require those who wantedto serve in on the position ofon the Joint Chiefs to be in agreement withthat policy So yes                        In answer to a followup question from Jennings Gore modified his answerslightly I would insist before appointing anybody to the Joint Chiefs ofStaff that that individual support my policy the vice president said Andyes I would make that a requirement Requiring support is somewhatdifferent than requiring agreement see Kausfilesfor further analysis of this distinction After he was attacked for theanswer Gore made clear his preference for his second response over his firstI did not mean to imply that there should ever be any kind of inquiry into thepersonal political opinion of officers in the US military Gore said at animpromptu press conference two days later            As Gore belatedly realized support is the better answer because itleaves open the theoretical possibility of appointing a military officer sohonorable that he will work assiduously to implement a policy he personallydisagrees with But in reality there isnt much of a difference betweensupport and agreementcertainly not enough to constitute a reversalwhich was how the New York Times characterized Gores adjustmentChairmen and members of the Joint Chiefs who personally oppose thisparticular change in policy are not likely to put their feelings aside andimplement it Theyre likely to try to sabotage it            Consider what happened to Bill Clinton when he tried to lift the ban on gaysin the military in  In theory the chairman of the Joint Chiefs at thattime Colin Powell was an obedient officer ranking directly below Clinton inthe chain of command In practice Powell worked around Clinton to prevent apolicy change that he disagreed with After Clinton was elected but before hewas sworn in Powell gave a speech at the Naval Academy in Annapolis in whichhe told midshipmen that if the new policy violated their beliefs they shouldconsider resigning from the military            George Stephanopoulos describes the political reality of the situation inhis book All Too Human  I knew we had no cards to play Stephanopouloswrites describing Clintons first meeting with Powell and the Joint ChiefsIf we didnt work out a compromise with the chiefs they would sabotage us onthe Hill While they were obliged to obey their commander they had the rightto present their personal views to congressional committees publicly It wasin fact the prospect of Powell and the other chiefs testifying before Congressabout their personal opposition to allowing gays to serve in the military thatgave Sen Sam Nunn the leverage to foist Powells own preferred compromise ofdont ask dont tell on the administration And had Congress not acted itsentirely likely that the chiefs would have worked to sabotage the new policy atthe bureaucratic level            For this reason Gores litmus test position is not merely defensibleits the only sensible one to take if you seriously intend to get rid of dontask dont tell By contrast Bradleys stancethat he would expect thechairman of the Joint Chiefs to follow his ordersis utterly naive As for theRepublican line that all the Joint Chiefs ever do is offer advice and obeytheir commander in chief its worse than naive Its disingenuousConservatives know that litmusuntested chiefs are likely to try to undermine aDemocratic presidents effort to allow gays to serve openly in the militaryAnd whats more Republicans want them to undermine it
