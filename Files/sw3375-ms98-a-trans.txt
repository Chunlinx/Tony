                uh well i i i guess its a subject i havent thought too much about uh i dont know if theres so much wrong with the public schools uh as much as were expecting too much out of them   uh that might be a lot to do with it i know a lot of it here in my state im from Mississippi im not sure where youre from Minnesota okay well a lot of it in Mississippi here is got to do with funding   Minnesota Wisconsin yeah   problems with our education system a lot of its due money and theyre trying to spend money where we dont have it and theres a lot of things we need that we just cant afford   umhum yeah well its it it is getting very expensive to run schools so they got computers now that you got to train on theres just so much uh more   well it is right   and less money to do it with   thats true and a lot of it lot of it has to do with uh salaries too speaking of money because if you cant pay the right people you know theyre not going to be able to do theyre not not gonna get the people that can do a good job   all right yeah yeah yeah i i i guess that in uh talking on lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools i i think theyre expecting schools to discipline the kids and uh i think it should go right back to the parents if you dont train your kids right then   right i feel the same right i feel the same way a lots got to do with how the kids were raised at home   right yeah   and then when the kids get to school they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids i mean theyve so severely severely severely limited what disciplinary action you can do   yeah yeah i i know when i uh was going to school it it wasnt uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving i mean they do that now and they could probably lose their job   exactly right lose their job and and big lawsuit and all that   yeah yeah   i feel thats got a lot to do with it people arent as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be   right right yeah uh seems uh a be a subject that i i dont have much to say on   really weve weve talked some about it in my state because weve have a lot of uh problems well our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education but he wasnt   yeah   and a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly i know a lot a lot of if you have more money its just logical that you can provide a better school system   umhum   and unfortunately theres not many places to get that money   yeah   then if you dont have        qualified teachers in the different subject areas i know one of my physics professors at college has has addressed this that most of the teachers at the um elementary and high school level arent scientists theyre teachers and they may not know a lot about what theyre teaching where as they may have just had a teaching major   um   and then had some social studies courses and theyre trying to teach social studies and they dont know a lot about that   right   where maybe a physics professor he my professor was a physics professor and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background in physics at the high school level so therefore theyre teaching from a teachers point of view and not from a physicist point of view and that causes a lot of trouble   right yeah i dont know  maybe they should sit back and and kind of uh decide on where the moneys best spent i know in lot of cases uh different districts like to have nice fancy schools   right   and maybe they should be a little more uh uh concerned with paying the right people to teach and and be uh satisfied with maybe a little older school   exactly because i mean here in uh the county where i went to high school one of the the the four high schools in my county one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado so when they rebuilt that school they had a a top of the line high tech school there and the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties   uhhuh   and then when uh evaluation committees came through they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones telling them what they need to do to fix up this building and this and this and this and so it it kind of would make you think that wed all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them   yeah yeah well i i i know uh where i came from uh we didnt have a very uh rich community and uh high school that i went to was uh very old and um as far as uh i know its still there theyve expanded expanded on it but theyve never build a new one and its probably fifty sixty years old or or better   right   i dont foresee them uh building a new one for a long time because they cant afford it   exactly thats
