                      Where to go        Where indeed This subcontinent is so rich and varied that        the choice of what to see on a first visit can be daunting Dont even        think of doing India the way people do Europe With some judicious        selection from among the places we suggest you can most certainly get        a pretty good feel for the country in the four weeks that most people        devote to a first trip        Even if you have a distinct taste for improvisation and a        horror of schedules and detailed itineraries you must accept from the        outset if your time is at all limited that travelling around India        will demand a certain amount of planning Remember there are over         million Indians out there and a lot of them will be on the move at the        same time as you will be therefore competing for plane seats and hotel        rooms So you will need to make at least some advance reservations for        hotels in principal cities and especially for your major plane or train        journeys This will still leave you plenty of room for getting off the        beaten track and staying overnight in new and unexpected places        Putting Together an Itinerary        We have divided the country into five regionsnorth west        center east and south        In each of the regions youll find a city such as Delhi        Mumbai or Chennai which you can use as a starting point and which        would also be the best place for phoning home and making other        practical arrangements Equally important each area includes a place        where in hallowed and sensible military phrasing you can go for rest        and recreation In this case youll find a beach resort nature        reserve or one of the old hillstations of the British Raj each being        ideal for a change of pace or climate Its easy to overdose on the        many temples palaces and museums in India They are all worth your        attention but do take plenty of time to relax tooyoull be        surprised at how much more you can see and appreciate if youve had        enough rest        If your budget allows you to fly around the country you can        design a smorgasbord of places to see in each region since you will        not be able to do all of them exhaustively In any case we recommend        that you choose from at least two of them ideally three when planning        your menu         Tourist Information offices can be very helpful You will        find their guides are much more reliable than those outside the temples        or palaces but one word of warning different tour guides will give        contradictory explanations about the significance of statues as well as        many different versions of legend and historical fact  It would be        easy to dismiss these explanations as being nonsense but youll        understand India better if you can appreciate that what each guide is        saying may in its own way be true When it comes to ideas there is no        more tolerant land on earth        Practical Hints        The Handy Travel Tips section at the back of the book        offers details on how to handle the practical side of your trip but        its worth keeping a few points in mind when deciding where youre        going in the time you have available        The climate in India see page  imposes its own        imperatives and restrictions on your itinerary Northern India is        simply impractical in December Delhi unbearably hot in June and        trains uncertain in the monsoon Think of three seasons cool hot and        wet emphasized here because they take on a particular meaning in the        Indian context        The cool season is from October to March the ideal time        for seeing most of India except in the northern hills and mountains        where its bitterly cold Cool means it is pleasantly warm by day and        fresh enough for a sweater in the evening The temperature begins to        rise by midFebruary Hot from April to June is hot as people only        rarely experience it The cities and plains in this season are        definitely a bad bet but the hillstations will be at their best From        midJune to September wet means monsoonwet not all day every day        but torrential rains occur often enough to make travel uncertain and        the mosquitoes and other bugs a real nuisance However during this        time the country is at its most green and the monuments especially        the Taj Mahal take on a glistening beauty        With regard to your health see also page  two        attitudes herald a miserable time carelessness and hypochondria Take        elementary precautions by sticking to bottled drinks and freshly cooked        food and you wont have any serious stomach problems An occasional        touch of Delhi belly is unavoidable when youre not used to the spicy        food but nothing to worry about take it easy and drink lots of        liquids and itll pass If you are on a short trip you may need to        take a quickacting remedy to keep you on your feet but if you load up        with antibiotics and a host of other patent medicines your body will        never build up resistance and the next attack will just be worse        There is one essential protect yourself from the heat        Save your suntanning for the beach or the hotel swimming pool        Otherwise stay out of the sun Wear a nicely ventilated hat and keep        to the shade in the street Try to do your open air sightseeing in the        morning and late afternoon Take a siesta after lunch Drink plenty of        liquidsin the heat dehydration is more of a risk than an upset        stomach        In all senses of the word stay cool In the first few days        jetlag acclimatization and culture shock may lead you to lose your        temper when you see the airports railways and hotels not organized in        a way youre used to but dont forgetJohn Kenneth Galbraith called        it a functioning anarchy Count to ten and like Delhi belly itll        pass Airports railway stations and hotels can be a pain anywhere in        the world these days Indians are mostly cheerful responding much more        readily to a smile than a scowl        The red tape can at times seem like barbed wire but this        too can be handled Part of Indias legacy after several centuries of        bureaucracy dont just blame the British civil serviceit began long        before is an inordinate respect for the written document and the        rubber stamp Dont knock ituse it Vouchers passes letters of        introduction and printed business cards all work like magic when a        confirmed reservation has become unconfirmed         If you should be travelling by train see page  and        rate comfort above improvisation go first class with an Indrail Pass        It saves you time in queues and gets you preferential treatment with        reservations Indian Airlines Discover India plan offers  days of        unlimited travel and is less economic than single tickets but buy them        en bloc with confirmed reservations that you should reconfirm at each        new airport        Echoing around every office you will hear the cheerful        sentence No problem  Though it rarely means exactly this interpret        it as meaning no catastrophe and have a good time anyway        THE NORTH        The region around Delhi embraces the government        capitalthe heart of the old Mughal empire at Agra and the nature        reserves of Corbett and Bharatpur In the Himalayan mountains there is        the hillstation of Simlawhich once served as the British summer        capitaland the magical but dangerous region of Kashmir        Delhi        On the Yamuna Jumna river at the western end of the great        Ganga valley the capital seems to have been a coveted place for        Indias conquerors Though they each very often destroyed the work of        their predecessors the thcentury city remains a fascinating        compendium of Indias imperial history        Recent archaeological findings suggest that a site on the        Yamuna river may have been the home of Mahabharata hero Yudhishthira        dating back to  bc A rock inscription from Emperor Ashoka        indicates that Delhi was a major point on the trade route between the        northwest frontier and Bengal in the third century bc        The Tomara Rajputs made it their capital in  with the        name of Dhillika and it was a focus of clan wars until the Muslims        conquered it and Qutbuddin Aybak set up his sultanate in  Delhi        was dismantled to make way for new monuments which then suffered from        the devastating passage of Timur the Lame in  He took away         elephantloads of building materials and thousands of skilled Delhi        stonemasons and sculptors to build his mosque at Samarkand With the        advent of the Mughals in  Delhi alternated with Agra as the        capital and each ruler asserted his particular taste in architectural        caprice        Under the British the town took a back seat to the ports        of Calcutta Bombay and Madras until  when it became once more a        proud imperial capital No less vain than the Mughals the new        conquerors all added their own architectural tastes which were a        tribute to Indias past but unmistakably British in overall conception        to New Delhi        Today a tour of the capital takes you through a mixture of        imposing ministries and embassies modern office buildings and hotels        and along the Old Delhi of vibrant Hindu and Muslim communities        crowding in on the Mughal monuments For more

stories each a tapering cylinder with angular        and convex ribs separated by balconies        The top of the tower is off limits due to dangers inherent        in the narrow staircase that leads to the lookout point so the best        bet for a panoramic view of the city is the top floor of one of the        taller more recent hotels        The ruins of the ancient mosque QuwwatulIslamMasjid        which means The Might of Islam was built with the might of the        Hindus With no skilled Muslim labor at his disposal Qutb called on        local craftsmen to build the mosque from the ruins of  Hindu and Jain        temples demolished by their own elephants You can see the results of        this construction method in the templepillars set on top of one        another Sculptures have been plastered over but the Indian carving        remains Islamic architecture shows in the five characteristic peaked        arches of the prayerhall screen but even here the decoration which        includes the Arabic lettering is naturalistic and Hindu in style        In the mosques courtyard there is a m ft Iron        Pillar from the fourth century brought here by the Rajput founders of        Dhillika but nobody knows from where Without rust after  years        worth of monsoon this monument to the Hindu god Vishnu is said to have        special properties if you stand with your back

QalaiKuhnaMasjid        with its minutely detailed molding of graceful peaked arches        represents an important transition from the TurcoAfghan to the        sophisticated style of the

Humayun which was built by his widow Haji        Begum and the inspiration for the Taj Mahal It is set back on a raised        terrace in a set of walledin treeshaded lawns surrounded by hedges        but without the water once running in its channels rivers of life        or the rectangular pools that were to be the perfect setting for the        Taj Humayuns Tomb has a remarkable charm of its own

kiosks over the        terraces latticed arches this is the first fullyrealized masterpiece        of Mughal architecture The numerous sixpointed stars set in the        abutments of the main arches are not the Jewish Star of David but an        esoteric emblem that youll see all over the country        Dominating Old Delhi the Lal Quila Red Fort was built by        Shahjahan when he transferred the capital back to Delhi from Agra        Behind its ramparts the Delhi citadel is more a palace than a        fortress with white marble preferred over the regions red sandstone        Its thought he used the same architect who worked on the Taj        Mahal        From south of the Fort notice the two monumental elephants        outside the Delhi Gate Part of the original design they were        destroyed by Emperor Aurangzeb who refused images susceptible to        idolatry Viceroy Lord Curzon had these replicas installed in         Enter the fort on its west side at the Lahore Gate and you find        yourself in a vaulted bazaar street an idea Shahjahan borrowed from        Baghdad Imagine administrators and Rajput princes riding on elephants        through the arcade as far as the Naqqar Khana Drum House where the        imperial band played and visitors were obliged to dismount        Pass with the ghosts of these nobles and commoners through        the drum house to the DiwaniAm Hall of Public Audience Here under        a baldaquin with  pillars the Emperor sat crosslegged on his        throne the Seat of the Shadow of God  He held audience surrounded        by nobles at midday while common petitioners attended in the        courtyard below As a visitor you can admire the inlaid stone panels        of birds and flowers at the back of the hall        Entrance to the DiwaniKhas Hall of Private Audience was        for the privileged by ticket only Youll find it on the left among        the palace apartments on the Yamuna river Beautiful as it is with        carved designs on the marble columns and cusped arches imagine it in        its full glory before the ravages of Nadir Shah in  His Persian        troops chipped the gold out of its pillars and inlay off the ceiling        and then carted away the fabulous Peacock Throne Above the arches        youll see the inscription        If paradise on earth there be         Tis here tis here tis here         The last emperor to enjoy it was King George V for whom a        painted wooden ceiling was installed        One of the few surviving palace apartments is the principal        harem Rang Mahal Palace of Color The walls paintings have gone and        water no longer flows in its indoor NahriBihisht River of Paradise        but mosaics made of mirrors ornament the ceiling and walls of six        boudoirs making a galaxy of stars when candlelit strike a match        Southernmost of the palace buildings Mumtaz Mahal was part of the        imperial harem and is now a small museum of Mughal artwork        To the northwest of the DiwaniKhas the Moti Masjid        Pearl Mosque is the one contribution to the Fort by Shahjahans        successor Aurangzeb Each evening a sound and light show

Shahjahans other great construction the Jama Masjid the great        congregational Friday Mosque is the largest mosque in India The        inadvisability of a mo rning or late afternoon visit on hot days will        become apparent when you see the three pyramidal flights of stairs to        the gatehouses The sqm sqft courtyard is enclosed by        long colonnades with a pavilion at each corner The prayer hall        highlights the emperors aesthetic in the lotus calyx on the gateways        two lantern shafts the delicately flaring balconies on the minarets        and the stripes to emphasize the bulbous marble domes        Raj Ghat the simple memorial to Mahatma Gandhi overlooking        the Yamuna river is far in spirit from the Mughals but an integral        part of Old Delhi On lawns planted with trees donated by visiting        heads of state a square of marble marks the place where Gandhi was        cremated The platform has an inscription recording his last words H        Ram Oh God and nearby a sign declares that most famous Gandhi        talisman Recall the face of the poorest and most helpless man whom        you may have seen and ask yourself if the step you contemplate is going        to be of any help to him  There is also a museum recording the        highlights of Gandhis life        New Delhi        Those nostalgic for the British Empire please note Clive        Road has been named Tyagraja Queen Victoria Road has become Rajendra        Prasad and Curzon is Kasturba Gandhi Though the statues of British        leaders have also disappeared the British spirit remains in the citys        planning Faithful to the policy of separating the British cantonment        from the Indian quarters with a railway as the barrier the new city        built for the Empires Indian seat of government is separated from Old        Delhi by the line running from Amritsar to Agra British NeoClassic        architecture here is mixed with elements of Buddhist Hindu and Mughal        past and the geometry of its plan exudes the selfconfidence of the        Empire As a visiting statesman once said of it What splendid ruins        it will make         The commercial pivot of New Delhi is the circular arcade        and bustling roundabout of Connaught Place With cinemas banks travel        agencies restaurants and the better craft emporiums its a place        whose new name Indira Chowk does not seem to catch on Connaught        Place straddles the northeastsouthwest axis which links the Jama        Masjid mosque of Old Delhi to Indias parliament Sansad Bhavan        Designed by the famous Herbert Baker the rather too massive        colonnaded rotunda of the parliament building is at its best        illuminated at night        The Viceroys Residence now the Presidents house        Rashtrapati Bhavan has wings radiating from the great greyblue dome of        the central block and the tranquil pools and lawns of its gardens and        so bespeaks the grandeur of Britains heyday It looms from an        artificial hill along the processional avenue Rajpath once Kingsway        which is flanked by parklands where India holds its marches on        Republic Day  January At the other end of Rajpath stands India        Gate the war memorial designed by Lutyens in the style of a triumphal        arch that pays tribute to  Indian Army soldiers who died in World        War I        The Jantar Mantar set south of Connaught Place is perhaps        the strangest monument in New Delhi It is difficult to believe that        these bizarre shapes staircases going nowhere and windows in walls        without rooms were built in  by a serious student rather than in        the last century by some deranged architect It is in fact the        astrologicothat is the astronomical observatoryof Rajput prince        Jai Singh II from Jaipur see page  Its centerpiece is the        rightangled triangle Samrat Yantra the Supreme Instrument with a        dome acting as a sundial accurate to half a second  In addition to        this structure he built four morein Ujjain Varanasi Mathura and        his native Jaipur        Near here surely the liveliest Hindu temple of all        Hanuman Mandir Temple of the Monkey God is a theatre where you can        witness the joyous atmosphere of popular Hinduism Hanuman is a        beneficent deity predating classical Hinduism and the reason why no        one would dream of harming the little lemurs monkeys running around        here        Museums        In what is artistically a predominantly Mughal city the        National Museum on Janpath Queensway just south of Rajpath is worth        a visit for its collection of old Hindu sculpture in particular those        from medieval India of the kingdom of Vijayanagar        Railway buffs will surely enjoy the display of the        countrys early steam engines at the open air Rail Transport Museum It        is situated in the diplomatic neighborhood of Chanakyapuri behind the        Bhutan Embassy Adventurous as rail travel in India still is today        one exhibit belongs hopefully in the past the skull of an elephant        that nearly derailed a mail train in         Nehru Memorial Museum is devoted to Independence and the        life of Indias first Prime Minister It is located in the house which        Nehru inherited from the British Indian Army CommanderinChief on Teen        Murti Road it also houses a planetarium        Agra        Location of the Taj Mahal Agra is the most popular sight        in India Even if the place had nothing else it would be worth the        trip for the Taj as one calls it affectionately is a sight that        awakens the wonder and enthusiasm of the most blas worldweary        traveller        But theres plenty more Agra was the capital of Akbar the        Great the site of his fort of his tomb outside the city at Sikandra        and several miles west at Fatehpur Sikri of the marvellous deserted        town he built to celebrate the birth of a son and which he abandoned to        fight on the northwest frontier Heirs of the craftsmen originally        brought here continue a tradition in jewelry brassware ivory and        inlaid marble        The first historical mention of Agra is in  when        Sultan Sikandar Lodi made it his capital Babur captured it along with        the KohiNur diamond now in the British crown jewels His grandson        Akbar chose Agra for his capital over Delhi In the th century        Jahangir made it a major focus of the Islamic world His son Shahjahan        lost his taste for Agra after finishing the Taj Mahal for his wife        MumtazMahal after she had died He moved the capital back to Delhi        again in  leaving the citys treasure to vandals including the        British after the  Mutiny until the viceroys organized its        restoration Today it is the effects of pollution that are taking their        toll on Agras monuments        Taj Mahal        This is truly a monument for all seasons There are those        who swear by the sight on the Taj Mahal in the Sharad Purnima the        first full moon after the monsoons a cloudless midnight in October        when the light is at its clearest and also most romantic Others love        to see it in the middle of the heaviest monsoon its marble        translucent its image blurred in the rainstippled water channels of        its gardens But its magic is strong at any time of year and any        moment of the day At dawn its color changes from milk to silver to        rosepink and at sunset it is golden Observe it too in the        brilliance of midday for then it is utterly dazzlingly white On        nights with a full moon the grounds stay open till midnight        The gateway to the gardens of the mausoleum can be admired        as a masterpiece in its own right with noble marble arches the domed        kiosks on the four corner turrets and two rows of  small chhattri        umbrelladomes just above the entrance It provides visitors with the        perfect frame for a first view of the ensemble You will find that        longrange photography is allowed but it is forbidden to take pictures        inside the monument        The chharbagh foursquare gardens are an integral part of        the Taj Mahal both spiritually as the symbol of the paradise to which        MumtazMahal has ascended and artistically to enhance the color and        texture of the mausoleum The dark cypresses heighten the brilliance of        the monuments marble and the water channels meeting at a broad        central viewing platform not only provide a perfect second image but        also with the reflection of the sky add at dawn and sunset a subtle        illumination from below        Exquisite harmony and refined symmetry are the keynotes of        the mausoleum itself The structure is clad in miraculously white        marble from the Rajasthan quarries of Makrana achieving a magnificent        texture with the subtly alternating broad and narrow slabs Standing        protectively at the four corners of the raised terrace the minarets        are deferentially slightly lower than the sublime central cupola        Inside the octagonal cenotaphchamber contains the ceremonial marble        coffins of MumtazMahal and also Shahjahan while as was the custom of        that time the actual bodies are entombed in another chamber directly        below Youll need to light a candle or use a flashlight in the        cenotaphchamber because daylight barely filters through the beautiful        marble trellisscreens        Sadly vandals removed all the tombs spectacular        treasures but they did leave the gentle beauty of roses and poppies in        rich inlaid stones of onyx green chrysolite carnelian and variegated        agate The mausoleum is flanked by two almost identical red buildings        to the west a mosque to the east a guest pavilioneach is a perfect        viewingpoint Try the pavilion at sunrise and the mosque at sunset        But go around the back of the Taj too to the terrace which overlooks        the Yamuna river This boasts a view as far as the Agra Fort        The Agra Fort        Built by Akbar in  a more embattled period than during        Shahjahans construction of the Red Fort in Delhi the Agra Fort was        conceived as a citadel with a moat on three sides and a river on the        fourth Pleasure palaces were a secondary consideration and were in        fact mostly additions by Akbars successors        The entrance from the south at Amar Singh Gate takes you        up a ridged elephants ramp sloped to slow down any potential        attackers Pass into the long quadrangle of the pillared DiwaniAm        Hall of Public Audience It was here that Captain William Hawkins        handed Emperor Jahangir a special letter of introduction from King        James I Due north is Shahjahans Moti Masjid Pearl Mosque Climb the        narrow staircase to the roof of the mosque for a fine view of the        fort        Just off the northeast corner of the DiwaniAm the harem        had its very own mosque Nagina Masjid Hindu temple and between the        two a bazaar where merchants sold silks and jewels Near the hammam        baths the DiwaniKhas Hall of Private Audience has rich carving        and inlaid marble The crack in the marble throne came from a British        cannonball in  As in Delhis Fort most of the private palace        apartments face the Yamuna river Among the most charming are the        arcaded loggia and the giltroofed pavilions of the Khas Mahal or        Private Palace A minute staircase led to the Musamman Burj the        pavilion of the emperors chief wife It is also popularly known as the        Prisoners Tower for Aurangzeb imprisoned his father Shahjahan here        allowing him a view of his Taj Mahal        The Palace of Jahangir is built around a square court with        arches There are Hindu motifs on the ceiling in the main hall and in        one on the west side peacocks holding snakes in their beaks for        example        Other Sights        On the river bank opposite the fort is the Tomb of        ItimadudDaulah overshadowed by the Taj Mahal This was built         years earlier by Jahangirs wife Nur Jahan for her father who served        as Mughal Prime Minister Theres a fragile elegance to the white        marble pavilions graceful silhouette with a cupola and four octagonal        turrets and topped by domed kiosks The fine latticework on the        arches and windows is superb but its outstanding feature is the marble        inlay which is even more abundant than in the Taj and better        preserved        Akbars mausoleum located at Sikandra is  km  miles        north of Agra The best view is from the top of the gateway On the        cenotaph are the  names of Allah        Fatehpur Sikri        In a country of crowded cities it makes a refreshing        change to travel  km  miles southwest to an outcrop on which        stands the citadel of Fatehpur Sikri briefly Akbars imperial        capital        Fatehpur planned as a capital with Agra as a fallback        position in case of attack is protected on three sides by ramparts        measuring about  km  miles On the fourth side is an artificial        lake stretching  km  miles to the Rajasthan border never        sufficient apparently for the needs of the citadel and so one of the        probable reasons why Akbar did not settle here permanently        Built by the architects working on the Agra Fort the        citadel adds the darker red stone of the mountain ridge to the usual        pink sandstone        Entering via the Agra Gate at the northeast corner one        passes on the right the karkhanas workshops where carpenters        weavers and stonemasons worked        In the Diwan KhanaiAm the courtyard used for public        audiences Akbar dispensed his justice while attended by an executioner        with instruments of torture and death The sight of the two of them was        felt to be an effective means of getting at the truth At the foot of        the colonnade is a big stone tetheringring for an elephant whose job        it was to crush capital criminals to death        Go through the pavilion to the Daulat Khana Abode of        Fortune on the south side of the courtyard a palace of which the most        striking feature is the Hindu nature of its decoration carved        pedestals with stylized elephant heads as capitals and sculpted stone        screens        In the southeast corner of the courtyard is the Turkish        Sultanas House or HujraiAnup Talao the Chamber of the Peerless        Pool animals covering every wall panel and pillar create the illusion        of woodwork rather than stone Fatehpur is the subject of many colorful        stories in which it isnt possible to establish a historians truth         For instance in the center of the courtyard is the Pachisi Court a        huge chessboard for the game of pachisi where Akbar and his friends        are said to have used human pieces each player using a team of        four slavegirls in different costumes        Also Akbar is said to have come to the Astrologers        Pavilion in the northwest corner of the court for a daily dose of        forecasts from the houseesoteric The emperor is known to have        consulted a whole panel of experts from Hindu and Muslim schools of        astrology Just behind this is the Treasury Pavilion where you can        imagine Akbar seated on cushions under the arches and counting the        imperial money The pavilion was known as Ankh Michauli Blind Mans        Buff because it was where Akbar was thought to have played        hideandseek with his wives        The purpose of the DiwaniKhas is hotly disputed it is        not necessarily the hall of private audience that its name implies It        is dominated by a great central pillar supporting bridges to a balcony        Some claim it was here that Akbar held his famous debates with Jesuits        Brahmins Parsi Zoroastrians Sufi mystics Jain and Buddhist        monksthe sages arguing while Akbar sat listening atop his pillar or        Akbar striding majestically around the bridges and balcony hurling his        questions at his listeners Others insist that it was just a storehouse        for jewels Truth in India even more than beauty is in the eye of the        beholder        Walk across the courtyard to the beautiful fivetiered        Panch Mahal a palace with the Persian system of ventilation known as        badgir wind tower without walls on three sides it is open for the        breezes to sweep in Each floor is supported on columns diminishing        from  at groundlevel to four on the roof Notice that no two columns        on the ground floor are alike Be careful on the steep climb to the        top but youll find it is well worth it for the wonderful view across        the citadel particularly the palaces of the imperial harem to the        southwest        The harems principal residence is Jodh Bais        Palacebuilt for Akbars Hindu wife the first royal spouse not        required to convert to her husbands Islamic faithand was Akbars        favorite residence at Fatehpur It has one side screening out the        summer heat while the other is open to the cooler breezes Its most        cherished feature is the turquoise ceramic tiled roof in the north and        south wings        Fatehpurs Jama Masjid the Friday Mosque at the south        end of the citadel up on its mountainridge was the very first of the        open courtyardstyle mosques to became characteristic of all Mughal        cities Notice the carved central mihrab the recess marking the        direction of Mecca The jewel of the red stone courtyard however is        the marbleclad Tomb of Shaikh Salim Chishti Its faade features black        calligraphy in the cenotaphchamber there are pretty painted flowers        Originally a more simple monument its white marble skin was the        addition of a very grateful Jahangir who without the mystic Shaikh        Salim Chishti might never have seen the light of day        Bharatpur        Strictly speaking Bharatpur is in Rajasthan but        proximity just  km  miles due west of Agra makes it logical to        include here The marshes of the bird sanctuary of KeoladeoGhana offer        a welcome change of pace Even if youre not an avid birdwatcher        youll enjoy the gentle walks in the woodland with the chance of        seeing exciting herds of nilghai antelope blackbuck and cheetal        spotted deer A good time to visit is just at the end of the monsoon        in Octoberwhen you can see flocks of storks egrets and        cormorantsand it is ideally combined with a fullmoon trip to the        Taj but theres plenty to see all year round        Among the more than  different species of birds here        youll find eagles cranes pelicans snakebirds kingfishers and a        host of ducks and geese as well as a flock of rare wintering Siberian        cranes between January and March The Maharaja of Bharatpur used to        organize formal annual duckshoots here for British viceroys and other        top officials as well as for fellow princes But today hunting is        strictly banned In other words Bharatpur is only for the birds        Corbett Park        Among Indias nature reserves this is the best known        because of Jim Corbett the audacious hunter of the maneating tigers        of Kumaon The park was established in  and was given Corbetts        name after India became independent        Northeast of Delhi this lovely park of forest and meadows        by the Ramganga river in the foothills of the Himalayas remains a home        to the tiger leopard and elephant as well as cheetah sloth bear        wild pig jackal and hyena The river abounds with mahseer and trout        as well as two kinds of crocodile and the occasional blind freshwater        dolphin Birdwatchers should look out for stork red junglefowl and        black partridge        The forest is thick with sissoo and tall sal trees their        timber is prized for shipbuilding An elephantride which allows you        to swing through the jungle and grassland while reclining on a        cushioned howdah is a great joy Rest at midday in the lodge at        Dhikala and watch the elephants head down to the river        Be sure to plan ahead through the Tourist Information        Office or a Delhi travel agency because admission to the park is by        permit only Permits are easy to obtain however and reserved        accommodation can be booked either in the lodges or in the official        campgrounds        Chandigarh        The capital of the Punjab is just a stopover en route to        Simla or a halfway point en route to Kashmir Its well worth        visiting this city which was planned in  by SwissFrench architect        Le Corbusier invited by the Indian government to create a new city for        the postPartition Punjab on a windy plain at the foot of the        Himalayas With British associate Maxwell Fry designing most of the        housing Le Corbusier created the leading public buildings and laid out        a town of spacious boulevards and sweeping treelined avenues inspired        at least in part by Lutyens ideas for New Delhi and blessedly        uncongested by growing traffic He planned the town on the principle of        the human body with the government buildings of the Capitol and        university at its head the commercial towncenter at its heart and        the outlying industrial districts as its limbs        In the Assembly building for parliament the Secretariat        administrative block the vaulted High Court and the smaller        Governors Residence you can see huge slabs of concrete like weathered        granite from the nearby mountains The buildings boast both geometric        and amorphous shapes with bright colors visible behind the subbreaker        grills Take a walk through the nearby Rock Garden of large concrete        blocks or to the east take a rowboat on the artificial Sukhna        Lake        Most people visit the holy city of Amritsar for its Golden        Temple Sikh Shrine Sikh architecture may also be appreciated at the        nearby Durgiana Temple Jallianwala Bagh is an important monument to        hundreds of martyrs who dies in an Amritsar massacre in         Simla        Similar to Chandigarh this town which is now capital of        Himachal Pradesh was built back in the early years of the th century        when the British colonial settlers were desperately searching for        refuge from the heat of the plains        At an altitude of  m  ft this was once the        place where a religious ascetic offered cool spring water to the        numerous weary and thirsty travelers coming out of the Himalayas Some        of these trekkers were British troops returning from the war with the        Gurkhas of Nepal in  They came back to build mountain retreats as        well as regular little cottages or perhaps an occasional mansion From         onwards when governorgeneral Lord William Bentinck spent a happy        summer here it became the most prestigious hillstation The viceroys        including the famous Lord Mountbatten who pondered the last details of        Independence and Partition here in  made it their summer        capital        The old reasons to head for the hills still make a trip to        Simla more than valid even if the old viceregal glamour has gone The        air here is sweet cool and clear and the pleasure of the quaint and        tranquil English village atmosphere remains along with some lovely        walks into the surrounding mountains You should however acclimatize        to the altitude before attempting any long hikes        In town visitors can retrace the favorite promenades        along the Mall and see the old administrative offices of the Ridge The        place at which these two meet is what Kipling called Scandal Point         At the eastern end of the Mall you can see the Gaiety Theatre onetime        home of the Simla Amateur Dramatic Company which is famous for its        productions of Victorian drama and Edwardian operetta        The Ridge leads past the NeoGothic Anglican Christ        Church where the bells are made from the brass of cannons captured        from the Sikhs At the end of the Ridge youll find the baronial pile        of Viceregal Lodge nowadays used by the Institute for Advanced        Studies You can imagine rickshaws pulling up onto the grounds of the        ivycovered grey stone mansion for one of the viceroys banquets Peer        into the grand hall which has an elegant fireplace a coffered        ceiling and a majestic staircase Then continue to the top of Jakko        Hill where you can see a fine view of the town and valley        Kashmir        The Vale of Kashmir  m  ft above sea level        has historically offered muchneeded respite for conquerors and        travelers alike Passing through the deserts of Sind and the hot and        dusty plains of the Ganga valley they have heard tell of its blessed        meadows forests full fruit orchards and lakes It remains the        undisputed treasure of the entire subcontinent Unfortunately        continuing tensions between India and Pakistan in the region have        rendered Kashmir a dangerous place for travellers        In accordance with the US State Departments and British        Foreign Offices travel advisories as well as warnings issued by most        other foreign consulates we do not recommend Kashmir as a tourist        destination The following information is provided only for the sake of        background on the area        Many people in the past particularly during high summer        made Kashmir the principal destination of their visit to India        combining it with perhaps just brief outings and daytrips in Delhi and        Agra Those making more extensive tours of India planned to see        Kashmir at the end with the intention of relaxing in a houseboat on a        lake or going on a refreshing hike in the lush surrounding        mountains        Travel to Kashmir used to require bookings and        preparations far in advance of visiting But since the increase in        eruptions of violence over the past ten years foreign travel to the        region has greatly decreased During Kashmirs height of popularity as        a tourist destination one of the areas most alluring features was the        unique accommodation on houseboats Travel agencies can reserve a        houseboat for a couple of days allowing travellers to change around        once theyve fully settled in One important and major advantage of        advance reservations is that the visitor will be met at the airport        straight away by a representative of the houseboatownerits not        easy for newcomers to find their way among the boats        Houseboats are a beautifully preserved tradition of the        heyday of the British Raj In the th century when Kashmir was the        most exotic hillstation of them all the maharaja forbade the British        to buy land there so they then hit on the brilliant alternative of        building luxuriously appointed houseboats moored on the lakes near        Srinagar Equipped with all the Victorian uppermiddle class comforts        the colonials were used to the more maneuverable smaller houseboats        made their way to other lakes for duckshoots or just for the pleasures        of the cruise while the larger ones stayed languidly put        With so many new boats having been built in the same old        style boasting lovely Kashmiri carvings on the bridge and decks many        are too heavy to move around the waters But the traditional comforts        are the same woodburning stoves plush armchairs in the living room        warm carpeting in the spacious bedrooms superb personal service and        fine Kashmiri cuisine you can enjoy on decknote that you can arrange        with the owner what you want to eat each day Western or Indian        style        Most houseboats are moored on Dal Lake but for those        seeking seclusion there are others on the smaller Nagin Lake to the        west They are well serviced by shikarasgaily decorated and roofed        canoes somewhat reminiscent of Venetian gondolasplying their way        around the lake ferrying passengers There is also a floating market        of fruit and flowers The shikaras will also show you carpets silks        shawls brassware jewels and carvingsand tailors establishments        with names like Savile Roy recalling their old British allegiance        Srinagar        Srinagar like Jammu and the rest of Kashmir is still        considered a dangerous place for foreign travellers There is a strong        military presence in the city and a dusktilldawn curfew is often in        effect The heart of Kashmirs capital is built along the banks of the        serpentine Jhelum river on the southern shore of the lakes The many        bazaars busy tailors shops and governmentoperated emporiums are        fascinating places to observe the style panache and neverending gall        of that charming and often shameless scoundrel the Kashmiri        merchant        Few monuments have survived Kashmirs troubled history        but the citys beauty lies in its numerous tranquil lakes and gardens        Dal Lake and the adjoining Nagin offer leisurely cruises with        passengers lounging on the cushions of a shikara Lovely floating        gardens growing melons tomatoes cucumbers and lotus root in a mesh        of reeds and mud floating in the water and moored in squares by four        poles stuck in the lake bed add to the tranquil beauty of the        lake        On the western shore of Dal Lake is the large white dome        and minarets of Hazratbal Mosque famous for its relic the hair of the        beard of the prophet Mohammed        There are two small squares of land that rise up out of        the lake Sonalank Akbars Golden Island to the north and Ruplank        Silver Island to the south        Two hills Hari Parbat to the north of town and        Shankaracharya to the east offer pleasant walkswith the reward of a        magnificent view over the lakes and the whole Vale of Kashmir  km        long and  km wide  by  miles        The Mughal Gardens are on the eastern shore of Dal Lake        For Jahangir if the Islamic idea of paradise had any meaning it was        here amid the staggered terraces tranquil pools waterfalls and        trees looking out over the lake against the backdrop of the Himalayas        In summer theres a soundandlight show at Jahangirs favorite the        Shalimar Bagh laid out in the year  Visitors are able to relax        here as the emperor did by lingering on the terraces to take in the        changing scene that surround them The white marble pavilion on the        first terrace was used for public audiences the second was a private        pavilion the thirdmade from black marbleaccommodated the harem        and the fourth was strictly reserved for the emperors private use        Three km  miles to the south Nishat Bagh was laid out        in  by Asaf Khan the brother of Jahangirs wife It is the largest        of the gardens with  terraces and lined with fine cedars and        cypresses It offers a magnificent view of the lake beyond        Tucked away in a small fold of the hills is Chashma Shahi        the smallest but in many ways most exquisite of the Mughal Gardens        drawing its water from a spring that runs directly down the adjacent        mountainside        Excursions from Srinagar        The resort Pahalgam is about  km  miles east of        Srinagar The route there runs through groves of willow used for the        local cricketbat industry and fields of saffron If youve ever        wondered why saffron is so expensive its because  of these        purple or white crocuses only the stamen is orange are necessary to        make up a single kilogram  pounds of saffron proper the stuff that        flavors and colors those famous Indian curries and Spanish paella        Spain is the only other place in the world apart from Kashmir where        saffron is grown extensively         The most popular journey from Pahalgam is  km  miles        up to the Amarnath Cave which has an altitude of some  m         ft Sacred to Hindus it is a destination of devout pilgrimage on        festive days for the sight of the imposing stalagmite called Shivas        lingam this phallic symbol stands for the gods fertility power and        creativity Just  km  miles from Pahalgam one trek the most        strenuous by far leads to the spectacular Kolahoi Glacier        Gulmarg  km  miles west of Srinagar is about         m  ft above sea level It is currently developing its winter        sports in addition to the golf and tennis already provided There is        wonderful hiking here too through pine forests and meadows carpeted        with wildflowers in summer        THE WEST        The West is above all Rajasthan land of the great        maharajas with its desert and lake palaces but its also the bustle        of Mumbai and the splendor of the cave temples at Ajanta and Ellora        There is also the great bonus further down the coast of the stunning        beaches of Goa        Introducing Rajasthan        Rajasthan is undoubtedly one of the most romantic regions        in India Known as Rajputana and stretching from Delhi to the        Pakistani Sind and the Punjab this land is where the Rajput warriors        erected their desert and mountain redoubts The palacefortresses were        built with granite from the surrounding hills and with the same        dazzling marble used for the Taj Mahal        The great cities of Jaisalmer and Jodhpur are on the        ancient caravan routes from the Indus Valley to the Thar Desert for        this is a land of cattleherders too One of their most spectacular        monuments is the annual marketfestival at Pushkar held each year in        November see page         Probably descendants of the invading Scythians and Huns        the Rajputs were a formidable opposition met by the waves of        invadersTurks Afghans and Mughals Despite the Rajputs foreign        origin their claimed descendancy from the Aryan dynasties of the sun        and moon was accepted by the Brahman priesthood and they were duly        inducted retroactively into the Kshatriya warrior caste a caste to        which the Rajputs of today continue proudly to belong         While the nearby Malwa and Gujarat came under Muslim rule        Rajputana remained Hindu Towns with the suffix pur had Hindu rulers        abad is the Muslim suffix Some Rajput princes pursued an independent        line Others sent their daughters to the harem or their sons to serve        as officers in the imperial army They enjoyed a privileged position        during the time of the British Raj        Jaipur        The capital of Rajasthan was built according to        astrological precepts Raja Jai Singh II that scholar of the stars who        dotted northern India with his collections of instruments for observing        the heavens chose an exact date for moving his capital from Amber        November as auspicious He then laid it out according to the        disposition of the stars and planets        But lets begin at Amber  km  miles northeast of        Jaipur high up on a hill commanding a gorge which offered military        advantage but was not right for the expanded city he wanted for his        capital        The road up to Amber takes you through classical        Rajasthani landscape its parched hills embracing Lake Maota where        water buffalo snooze lazily in the sun You may also pass an occasional        camel that timehonored vehicle of transport known as the ship of the        desert hauling his load on a cart fitted with discarded tires from an        airplane        At the fortress the Rajputs of Jai Singhs Kachwaha clan        slowed down their enemies with a steep elephant ramp You can travel by        elephant up through the Suraj Pol Sun Gate to the Jaleb Chauk a        garden courtyard swarming with langur monkeys and surrounded by        elephant stables        A staircase zigzags its way to the Temple of Kali wife of        Shiva built for the Hindu mothergoddess The silver doors have        basrelief panels depicting Kali riding various animals Her statue was        brought from Bengal where the cult of Kali is particularly strong The        palace is a subtle example of the maharajas opulence artists banished        by Emperor Aurangzeb see page  worked on the columns and arches        and on the buildings gallery around the DiwaniAm Hall of Public        Audience        The DiwaniKhas the Private Audience Chamber known as        the Shish Mahal Palace of Mirrors features the Rajputs flamboyant        taste for covering walls with green orange and purple glass and the        vaulted ceilings with thousands of little convex mirrors Strike a        match to see the effect        The most inviting place in the palace is the Sukh Niwas        Hall of pleasure with doors inlaid in ivory and sandalwood Inside        cool water was brought down from the roof through a carved white marble        chute and fresh air was brought in through the finely chiselled        lattice stonework The color of its sandstone has earned for Jaipur the        name pink cityalthough you will see that it changes color with the        season and time of day from a rosy pink to warmest amber bright        orange and dull ochre        Appropriate for a descendant of the sun dynasty Jai Singh        laid out the city on an axis from the Suraj Pol Sun Gate in the east        to the Chand Pol Moon Gate in the west a main street that is today a        lively bazaar        The towns central focus was the most elaborate Jantar        Mantar observatory which was the final fruit of his labors and begun        in Delhi see page  The initiated will appreciate the significance        others the mysterious atmosphere of its creamcolored gnomons the        uprights of sundials quadrants and sextants        Chandra Mahal directly south of the observatory is the        Citys Palace with seven mystically planned courtyards and stories A        museum inside the building gives intriguing insight into the life and        heyday of the maharajas their rich costumes their scimitars and        rifles inlaid with bright jewels and silverand a horrible bludgeon        with a double serrated edge        Overlooking the street is the Hawa Mahal literally the        Wind Palace but actually a rather grand fivestoried royal box in        which the ladies could sit and watch festive processions Its airy        projecting orielshaped balconies are seen as a symbolic image of        Jaipur style Theres a fine view from the top of the zigzag        staircase        Jodhpur        Of all Rajasthans fortifications Jodhpurs Fort

templelike memorials built on the site of the maharajas        funeral pyres and a colonnade of Hindu godheroes        If youre going to Jaisalmer by road its well worth a        detour to Osian to see the stunning Hindu and Jain temples many of        them dating as far back as the eighth century Somehow this ancient        sculpted pantheon of Hindu deities and Jain prophets has survived the        sometimes ferocious weather of India and Mahmud of Ghaznis        iconoclasts        Back on the road to Jaisalmer one last splash of color        delights the senses before you plunge into the

Maharawals in  is the        oldest of Rajasthans fortified cities Though much of the city has        grown up outside the fortmodern in time but not in style        people live within its walls Some of their houses in the side streets        are from the th century The best view of the whole citadel can be        had from the terrace of the Jaisal Castle Hotel        The elaborate sculpture in four thcentury Jain temples        within the fort finds its counterpart in the finely carved faades of        the Merchants Havelis mansions built  years later and sheltered        from sandstorms on the northeast side But much more than the        individual monumentshandsome but hardly grandiose because of the        restricted spaces availableit is the general atmosphere of the town        that gives it its special magic Everything here is bathed in a serene        desert light that adds a shimmer to the stone and a translucence to the        shadows To see the desert at its best go out at dawn and at        sunset        Beyond Jaisalmer youll find the road peters out at the        village of Sam and the forbidden area of Indian military installations        on the border with Pakistan On the way to the village youll come        across a camelstation from where you may wish to take a ride For        fans of this quaint form of transport longer camel safaris can be set        up through Jaisalmer travel agencies Ask the camel driver to direct        you to the still uncharted village of Kuldharauncharted because it        was one of  villages abandoned over  years ago by the

the east shore of the lake        is now part royal residence part luxury hotel and part museum The        sun symbol of the maharana is everywhere worshiped during monsoons        The armor displayed here includes an outfit for disguising horses as        elephants The frescoes illustrate the tragic story of Princess        Krishnas suicide at Jodhpur Glass baubles some as big as golf balls        have replaced real jewels in the mosaics        North of the City Palace is the handsome Jagdish Temple a        rare example of IndoAryan style and symbol of its independent spirit        The Bharatiya Lokkala Mandal Folk Museum has an excellent display of        Rajasthani art which includes bright puppets costumes and the whole        range of turbans worn by the various Rajput clans A modest puppet show        is put on every  to  minutes in the puppet theater        Fateh Sagar Lake is reached by boat at the north end of        Pichola but you can also get there by a pleasant drive past the        gardens of bougainvillaea and lilac of Lakshmi Vilas Palace        You can visit the Gardens of SaheliyonkiBari Maids of        Honor where the maharana kept the Muslim dancers presented to him by        the Mughal emperor The gardens here are famous for their five        fountains that imitate the many different sounds of the monsoon from        light showers to torrential storms        Chittorgarh a fortress was the site of the Rajputs many        acts of sacrifice Making the trip by road or rail from Udaipur it is        on a plateau some  m  ft in height up in the Aravalli        Hills        Entering the northwestern side you can go through seven        gateways to see the remains of the Rajputs heroic exploits Stones        mark where each of these brave soldiers fell in battle        South of the Main Gate the thcentury Palace of Kumbha        is built over the cave where Padmini led the first jauhar and to which        the Rajputs descendants return for an annual celebration Some of the        walls in the palace were built with pieces of stone removed from        Buddhist temples        Kumbhas Jaya Stambha the Tower of Victory  m         ft high was built to celebrate his great victory over Sultan Mahmud        Khalji of Malwa in  The towers nine stories are decorated with        Hindu deities but otherwise it seems inspired by the Kirti Stambha a        Jain Tower of Fame built in the th century        At the southern end beside a pond with a pavilion in the        middle is Padminis Palace where the princess is said to have passed        her last days It is unlikely that the mirror in the room overlooking        the pond was the very one in which the sultan got his fatal peek at        her but the guides tell the story this way to make it more enticing        for visitors        Ranakpur        Hills and mountains are especially sanctified in the cult        of Jainism In fact in the Aravalli Hills situated in the        southwestern part of Rajasthan you will find one of the Jains leading        sanctuaries North of Udaipur a mountain road takes you past green        terraced fields and mango groves over the deepest ravines to the        magnificent white marble temple complex of Ranakpur        Chaumukha Temple is known nowadays as the quadruple temple        because of its four central domes within a complex of  domed shrines        each one topped by a flag with tinkling bells attachedpaying musical        homage to the many deities worshiped inside Built in  the        Chaumukha is dedicated to Adinath Jainisms original  Tirthankaras        teachers whose truths were revealed by the prophet Mahavira see        page         As with all the holy places of Jainism you must remove        not only your shoes but any leather you may be wearing Walking through        the entrance hallwhich is decorated with a number of sensual        sculpturesand across the halfmoon threshold you penetrate a forest        of symmetrical pillars each subtly different in its intricate carving        The thcentury temples rich carvings attest to the wealth of the        Jain merchant who commissioned it You can find a sculpture of him in a        position of prayer facing the statue of Adinath in the second row of        pillars second pillar from the left His architect Deepa is also        here in the third row of pillars first pillar on the right        Restoration work on the temple is amazingly carried out by the th        generation of Deepas direct descendants You can climb up to the roof        for a fascinating perspective of the flags domes and trees surrounded        by the Aravalli Hills        The Dilwara Temples are located on Mount Abu in a former        hillstation for the British now used by the Indian bourgeoisie If        you goand the temples are well worth ityou would do best to take        the train from Jaipur or Ahmedabad        Ajanta and Ellora        The cave temples hewn from the granite of the Vindhya        mountains in the northwest of Deccan are among the great wonders of        India They are considered masterpieces because the caves are        actually manmade hollows in solid rock from which a complex of        architecturally elaborate temples and monasteries has been carved with        simple instruments Even beyond this tour de force the rockcut        sanctuaries of Ajanta and Ellora are superb works of art boast ing        sensuous painting and expressive sculpture of the highest order        Both temples are within easy reach of the town of        Aurangabad Try not to visit both sites on the same day If you are        interested in following the historical evolution of the temples stop        off at Ajanta first where some caves are from the second century bc        Reserve Ellora for a tour during the afternoon when the caves will be        illuminated by sunlight Reliable official guides from the office of        the Archaeological Survey of India offer their services free of        charge        Having remained untouched for  years until British        soldiers discovered it during a tiger hunt in  Ajanta has the        advantage over Ellora whose caves were in constant use as dwelling        places The use of rockcut sanctuaries goes back to the time of        Emperor Ashoka during the third century bc  when itinerant Buddhist        monks formed a religious order and the emperor provided them with        rockhewn cells as a vihara retreat during the monsoons The monks        added a hall for worship called a chaitya temple        Of the  caves all of them Buddhist five are chaitya        temples and the rest vihara monasteries They are cut from a        horseshoeshaped cliff standing  m  ft high above a narrow        gorge which has a small stream running through it Originally each        vihara had its own stairway down to the stream The caves have been        numbered from  to  west to east Experiencing just nine of them        will give an impression of the whole Start in the middle at the        oldest then work your way east before returning to the historically        later caves at the western entrance        Cave  is probably the oldest of the chaitya temples        dated at about  bc Its nave and aisles are divided by  octagonal        pillars leading to a stupa the domed focus of veneration with an apse        beyond permitting the circumambulation There is no representation of        the Buddha in this early era        Cave  a sanctuary from the first century bc  is        smaller than number  It is dominated by the stupa The twostory        faade with arched window and Buddha figures in side niches was        probably added in the sixth century ad        Two elephants in a kneeling position welcome you to Cave         one of the most important of the later caves created between ad         and ad  The Mahayana school of Buddhism encouraged worship of        a Buddha image which is why the stupa was replaced with a sculpture of        Buddha sitting in a posture used traditionally for teaching Look for        the two sculptures of amorous couples on the ceiling        With the richness and vigor of its mural paintings Cave         represents the summit of Ajantas artistry The walls from the        fifth century ad  show the  stories of Buddhas enlightenment        Buddhas steadfast resistance to temptation gave the painters of that        time a splendid pretext to show the sensual side of court life as a        foil to the Masters spirituality We see him taming an enraged        elephant or appearing as the warrior Simhala attacking the Island of        Ogresses while his wife Rani holding a mirror languorously prepares        her toilet with handmaidens holding her cosmetics        The sculpted Buddha is seen with the wheel symbolic of        his law and two deer referring to the park at Sarnath where he held        his first sermon Look for two smaller figures on the pedestal one of        which is holding a bowl for alms or offeringsthey represent the rich        merchants who financed the caves construction        The small chaitya of Cave  is notable for the carved        faade and Buddha statues in its interior and for the graceful figures        relaxing in the side niches at the entrance Visit Cave  for a riot        of architectural bravurathe elaborately ribbed vaulting finely        carved pillars and a truly Baroque shrine with seated Buddha        Unlike the early rather austere monasteries Caves  and         are richly ornamented There are superb murals of brighteyed deer        peacocks monkeys and elephants and also those depicting the opulent        life with Prince Siddhartha riding away on horseback The        masterpieces though are in Cave  two spiritual Bodhisattvas on the        back wall on either side of the antechamber        The caves of Ellora are cut out of a whole hillside of        basalt rock and conceived on a much grander scale than Ajantas Local        villagers have relied on them as shelter during monsoons or epidemics        so the murals have disappeared but the magnificent sculpture has        survived Starting where Ajanta left offsome of the Buddhist artists        may well have moved over to Ellora all of the  caves were created        between the seventh and th centuries The first  are Buddhist         are Hindu and the other five are Jain They stretch northsouth over         km  miles allowing you the option of climbing behind some of them        as well as approaching from the cave entrance        The most important Buddhist excavation  is the only        chaitya sanctuary here the eighthcentury Cave  with its fine        ribvaulted ceiling reminiscent of a western Romanesque cathedral The        great Buddha seated in the domed stupa is worshiped by Hindu artisans        as Visvakarma carpenter of the gods so the sanctuary is known as the        Cave of the Carpenters         Cave  consists of a vihara dormitory with three stories        Its sensual feminine sculptures show significant Tantric Hindu        influence You must imagine these as they were originally painted in        brilliant colors        Of the Hindu temples  Cave  is an interesting        transition from the Buddhist caves because in the pantheon of Hindu        gods Vishnu sits in a meditative pose suggesting he was converted        from a Buddha Another two are similar to the Bodhisattvas of Ajanta        The sculpture shows a dynamic Shiva killing demons and playing dice in        the Himalayas a group of boys playing with the sacred bull and mother        goddesses with children        The masterpiece of Ellora is the Kailasa Temple of Cave         With a ground plan the size of the Greek Parthenon and a structure        half as tall again this was the work of the eighthcentury Deccan king        Krishna I In the process of shaping the temple and its shrines in an        area  m  ft long and some  m  ft wide leaving the back        wall of the courtyard  m  ft high an amazing  tons of        rock were cut away from the face of the hill Whatever was saved in        hauling the masonry needed to erect such an edifice was more than        counterbalanced by the seven generations of craftsmen who completed        their amazing carvings from one piece of rock The anonymous sculptors        created a panoply of Hindu traditionlegendary heroes and their        battles hunts and weddings        The result is a Hindu temple on a grand scale which can be        easily compared with its inspiration the many temples of Mahabalipuram        see page  built some  years before in the southern region The        huge gateway leads to the mandapa worship hall with the tall pyramid        of the shrine beyond the whole structure symbolizing the mythical        Mount Meru Himalayan home of the gods        After seeing the sculpted friezes at courtyard level you        can gain yet another perspective of the temples fine detail from        above by walking along the stone ledge that leads around the top Do        wear good shoes and use the safety railing        After Kailasa the Jain caves numbers  excavated        between the eighth and th centuries will come as an        anticlimaxand this despite the considerable prowess of their        sculptors        Cave  tries to emulate the style of the great Hindu        temple on a much smaller scale but the artists here were working on        much harder rock and so abandoned their effort The most interesting of        all remains the twostory Cave  known as Indra Sabha notable for        the upper floors extravagant carvingthe hallmark of Jain        sculptorsand the great stone elephant more rigid than        Kailasasbecause of the tougher stone but somehow more noble        Mumbai Bombay         Gateway of India still describes the main function of        Mumbai known until  as Bombay For those who want to work their        way down to the south Mumbai is still as it was for the servants and        soldiers of the British Empire the natural gateway        An occasional luxury liner still glides past the great        stone gateway the harbor promenade of the Apollo Bunder and the Yacht        Club to dock at Ballard Pier For the rest of us landing at Santacruz        Airport the old turmoil of dockside porters and rickshaws that once        submerged the newcomer has been replaced by the equally crazy bustle of        businessmen and workers going

them they have        acquired the strangely melancholic air of old museumpieces The town        once had a population of  and some  churches Nowadays the        laterite stonework of many of the remaining churches has been        thoughtfully and carefully covered with lime plaster to protect them        against deterioration from the heavy waters of the dreaded Indian        monsoons

escape the preoccupations of        existence at the wildlife sanctuary of Kanha However a reminder of        the historic reality of the Indian Mutiny at Lucknow is also        everpresent        Lucknow        As a logical stopover on your way to Varanasi coming from        Delhi or from Calcutta Lucknow is worth a visit for its special place        in the history of Indias determined fight for Independencea focus        of the Mutiny of  see pages         The British Residencytoday preserved as a        monumentinitially commemorated British resistance but since        Independence it has been visited by Indians interested in this relic of        their own struggle for selfassertion or interested in a family picnic        on the lawns        On a lawn surrounded by  palm trees a cenotaph pays        tribute to Chief Commissioner Sir Henry Lawrence who was killed during        the attack An obelisk here honors Native Officers and Sepoys who        diednobly performing their

fought for Indias independence        Lucknow with its th and thcentury mosques used to        be a Muslim stronghold although the size of its community has now        dwindled to only  percent of the countrys population it is one of        the two single most important Indian centers of Shiite doctrine the        other being Mumbai        Varanasi        One thing is certain you cannot begin to fathom the        mystery of India without a visit to Varanasi Not that this old city        will explain everythingin fact its dramatic confrontations of        life and death on the Ganga river and of scholarship and superstition        may only mystify you even furtherbut the citys aura of sanctity is        so overwhelming that it supercedes any need for rational explanations        Perhaps the Muslim conquerors once perceived the Hindus reverence for        Varanasi as a threatthere is no temple in this yearold city        dating from before the th centurybut later it became a holy city        for Muslims too with Emperor Aurangzeb even trying to rename it        Muhammadabad        The name Varanasi misheard by Europeans as Benares is        derived from its site between the tributaries of the lifegiving holy        river Ganga the Varuna and the Asi Shiva is said to have poured the        river down on the plains from the Himalayas this mythical story leads        Hindus to believe that Varanasi is the oldest city in the world        Probably founded by the IndoAryans around  bc  the        city was established from earliest times as a famous seat of learning        for Hindu thinkers theologians philosophers and poets alike It has        remained ever since a center of the Hindu sciences It was just outside        Varanasi that Buddhas disciples gathered in the sixth century bc to        hear his sermon at the Deer Park of Sarnath Since then Jain monks        Muslims and Sikhs have proclaimed it a holy city building        monasteries mosques and temples here        The Ghats        The stonestepped embankments leading down to the Ganga        river are the gathering place of more than  pilgrims a year To        see the day unfold at the Ghats you must rise before dawn to join the        pilgrims Holy men and women are up and about busily chanting Ganga        Mai ki jai  Praise be to Mother Ganga         Some are sannyasi wandering beggars who have abandoned        their homes and walked from as far as Chennai Madras to stand on the        Ghats and pray to bathe and drink the waters of the holy river or        just to sit and meditate on this supreme moment of their religious        lives Even the most aged and infirm travel here to die for nothing is        more blessed for a devout Hindu than to die in the great waters of the        Varanasi and thus be released from the eternal cycle of rebirth        Practically all roads in town lead down to the Dasaswamedh        Ghat where Brahma the Creator is said to have made a ritual sacrifice        of  horses At the top of the steps holy men sit under their bamboo        umbrellas chanting mantras and offering for a coin or grains of rice        either sandalwood paste flowers or water from the Ganga        At the waters edge you can rent a boat and go into        midstream for a view of the impressive skyline which features many        Hindu temples gopuram towers Muslim minarets and Mughal domes In        the  km  miles between her tributaries the Ganga inscribes a        crescent turning north as it is suggested for one last gesture of        farewell to her sacred home in the Himalayas before descending east        towards the Bay of Bengal You can ask your boatman to take you further        upstream to the Asi Ghat before doubling back as far as the        Panchganga        Notice how the ritual ablutions which are highly        elaborate when performed by a learned Brahman usually involve a kind        of crouching movement completed at least three times in the water        Women you will notice bathe in full sari Youll see plenty of soap        and shampoo and on the Dhobi Ghat laundrywashing too After all        Mother Ganga however sacred is also just a river Out on stone        platforms young men perform gymnastics part of a devout        selfdiscipline known as danda        Those people who might at first be reluctant to confront        the omnipresence of death along the river will be impressed by the        simple dignity of the funeral rites here Families bring their dead for        their cremation to the holiest of Varanasi ghats Manikarnika The        body in a white shroud is carried on a bier of bamboo to the rivers        edge where a few drops of Ganga water are poured into the lips of the        dead The body is placed on a pyre of perfumed sandalwood which is        then set alight        Jai Singhs observatory and learning temple the Scindia        Ghat is at Man Mandir Ghat The Alamgir Mosque rises behind the sacred        Panchganga Ghat said to be the mythical confluence of four Ganga        subterranean tributaries        The Town        The Chawk bazaar is famous for its perfumes silks and        brassware Look out for the gilded Golden Temple of Vishwanath the        holiest temple of Varanasi forbidden to nonHindus You can view it        from the building opposite before going behind the temple to see the        sacred bull stained deep vermilion by the libations of its        worshippers        The Varanasi Hindu University has an Art Museum with a        superb collection of thcentury Mughal miniatures considered        superior to the national collection in Delhi        Sarnath        Now a suburb of Varanasi which is located about  km         miles out of town Sarnath is where Buddha gave his famous Deer Park        sermon the veritable foundation of the religion to five disciples        around the year  bc see pages         It quickly became a leading pilgrimage site attracting        devout Buddhists from many Eastern regions including Japan China and        Southeast Asia as it still does today Emperor Ashoka commanded his        edictpillars to be built within the monasteries and stupas of which        he had thousands constructed But just like Varanasi Sarnath suffered        at the hands of Qutbuddin in the year  Today the ruins have been        well restored they are accompanied by an excellent museum of Buddhist        sculpture which you should save to enjoy until last        On the western side of the road coming out of Varanasi        youll find the Chaukhaudi Stupa built by a Gupta king in the fifth        century ad With a proud octagonal tower that rises out of the top of        the structure it was built to mark the passage of the Emperor Humayun        after his defeat in the s The remains of seven redbrick        monasteries dating from the third century bc to the ninth century can        be discerned among the ruins in a pretty setting of flowers and sacred        neem trees Since its attractive bricks were carried off to build        houses in the town only a platform of the Main Shrine which once        marked Buddhas dwelling place during his stay at Sarnath remains        West of the shrine surrounded by an iron railing are the        stump and fragments of Ashokas Pillar which was once over  m         ft high Notice how the shine of the granite has withstood the        elements for over  years Its inscription warns the Indian people        against the dissidence that could upset the important national unity        under his leadership No one shall cause division in the Order of        Monks         The dominant feature of these ruins is the m ft        high cylindrical Dhamekh Stupa built in the fifth century ad         which is believed by many to mark the ancient site of Buddhas most        famous sermon        Immediately below eight empty nichesperhaps they once        held statues on display in the museumis a beautiful frieze of fine        floral and geometrical patterns interspersed with pretty birds and        small seated Buddhas If you should have a pair of binoculars they        will come in handy here take a close look at the fine craftsmanship in        this work of art        Visitors will take delight in the Museum which is a        treasuretrove of superb early Indian sculpture dating from the third        century bc to the fifth century ad Greeting you as you enter the        museum is its famous masterpiece the lioncapital of Ashokas pillar        a high point of the distinctive art of the Mauryan empire The lion        symbol of power and pride was an understandable choice as the emblem        of Indias regained nationhood in  Four vigorous lions stand back        to back atop a frieze of animals comprising a horse an elephant a        bull and a smaller lion each of them separated by a Wheel of Law        resting on the inverted lotus that once connected it to the pillar        Against the wall is the Wheel of Law that originally rose above the        lions As a gentle counterpoint to this and sculpted some  years        later a crosslegged Buddha with a finely chiselled halo was added        look out for it The Deer Park to the north of the excavations is just        a modern afterthought pleasant to relax in but not related to the        original        Khajuraho        This town is famous for the erotic sculptures of its        medieval Hindu temples many come expecting to snigger They leave        however full of admiration because the sandstone temples are marvels        of harmony and the sculptures true grace in their sensuality stifles        any temptation to smirk        We have British hunters to thank for uncovering these        masterpieces around  halfburied in earth and hidden by the        overgrown jungle They didnt see the light of day until their        excavation in   years after being abandoned during the Muslim        conquests        Khajuraho was capital of the Rajput kingdom of the        Chandellas a clan that brought vigour to love and war as is clear in        the temples they built from the tenth to the th centuries The        temples are divided into three groups western eastern and southern        The major ones in the western group are in a beautifully kept park        with paths leading easily from one to the other To see the sculptures        at their best go in the morning or afternoon or both and then go        back at night when the temples are illuminated        The lovely Lakshmana temple dedicated to Vishnu is one        of the earliest and the only one in which each of the four shrines at        each corner of the square platform on which it stands are        preserved        Four sikhara domes rise above the entranceporch in        addition to the mandapa hall for worshippers a larger hall for        dancinggirls and the inner sanctuary surrounded by an ambulatory for        walking around the image of the deity The silhouette seems to suggest        the Himalayan home of the gods but this may be more of a Brahmanic        interpretation than the conception of the architect The sculptures        portray not only erotic postures but also the adventures of Krishna        in one he uses all four arms to fend off two wrestlers        Visvanartha built in  is more compact and ultimately        more harmonious than Lakshmana Its sculptures include a fluteplaying        maiden and a small nymph pulling a thorn from her foot        The most spectacular temple of the western group is        KandariyaMahadeva with three domes culminating in the great m        ft high sikhara composed of row upon row of  other smaller        sikharas        Created at the height of the Chandellas power in the        midth century the sculpture inside is the most sophisticated and        ingenious apsara dancinggirls and surasundari nymphs coquettishly        yawning scratching applying their makeup or playing with monkeys        parakeets or with their cheerful lovers The Kandariya is the largest        of all the Khajuraho temples and adds with its grand scale a special        exuberance to the lifeenhancing spirit of the place        The eastern group of structures includes three Jain        temples The most important is the tenthcentury Parsvanatha built in        the classical Hindu sikharadomed style and incorporating the        sculptural themes of the Vishnu temples While the religion of the        Jains prohibits anything too explicit in sexuality the ambience of        Khajuraho is clearly contagious and there are a lot of voluptuous        fullbreasted ladies here that you dont usually see on a Jain        temple        Kanha        Kanha is famo us widely acknowledged as the best place        for seeing an Indian tiger in the wild In fact for the sheer        abundance of wildlife to be seen Kanha is probably the best national        park in India and should not be missed        You might think the journey is a little complicated but        if you go to the trouble you will find it well worth the effort You        can either fly into Nagpur or if youre coming from Khajuraho take a        train to Jabalpur and continue by road It is however best to reserve        your accommodation in forest resthouses in advance of your        journey        The best season is February to May when youll be able to        see plenty of beautiful cheetal spotted deer blackbuck sloth bear        gaur or bison largest of the wild cattle wild boar Kanhas unique        barasingha pointer swamp deer and also monkeys galore        The Project Tiger campaign is doing a sterling job here        to protect the king of Indias jungles without neglecting the elusive        leopard Enthusiastic birdwatchers might also spot black ibis and the        crested serpenteagle        Tracking down the tiger is a subtle affair and requires a        degree of dedication calm and stealth On the first morning you take        a jeepsafari at dawn to scout the terrain The forest of sal trees and        bamboo is a truly sweetsmelling delight interspersed with rolling        green meadows where the deer and gaur graze Gametrackers will be out        by this time in an attempt to locate the tigers hunting ground for the        evening safari        A team of junglewise mahouts with elephants set out in        the afternoon to seek the tiger in the most likely areas you will be        following in a jeep keeping a watch out for any telltale signs that        the tiger is near The things to listen and look out for could be any        one or perhaps several of the following the alarm bark of the deer        a noisy screech from the monkeys andthe most telling sign of        allvultures waiting for the tiger to abandon the leftovers of what        he caught for lunch When the elephant has located a tiger the mahout        signals and you hop aboard his howdah to penetrate the jungle Et        voil        Sanchi        About one hour away from Bhopal the stupas of Sanchi are        the most admired Buddhist monuments in the whole of India The site        from the third century bc  when Emperor Ashoka ordered stupas        containing the Buddhas relics to be built is on a m ft hill        on the Vindhya plateau        Stupas were originally burial mounds Buddhists developed        them into shrines of plastercovered stone inside which are caskets        containing relics of Buddha Crowned by a chhattra umbrella made of        stone the stupa was erected on a terrace with a fence to enclose the        path The stupas of Sanchi lay in the jungle until they were uncovered        by the British in  but delay in their restoration led to their        plunder Three stupas and the temples and monasteries from the fifth to        the th century ad can still be seen        The Great Stupa Stupa I built in the first century bc         envelops a smaller mound erected some  years earlier It is        surrounded by stone railings in the terrace railing are four torana        gates off northsouth and eastwest axes perhaps in order to deceive        evil spirits Formed by square posts with finely sculptured panels the        gates are topped by three architraves crossbars one placed above the        other with dwarfs or animals        At the time Stupa Iwas built Buddha himself was not        represented in human form but symbolized by the horse on which he rode        away from his palace by the wheel of law by his footprints and by        the pipal tree under which he found enlightenment        The rest of humanity is present in the form of his        worshippers his adversaries dancers and yaksi nymphs Despite the        strict asceticism preached through Buddhism its clear that the        craftsmen employed were given free rein regarding their joyous        sensuality        The smaller Stupa III to the northeast of the Great        Stupa has one torana gate it was originally built to contain the        relics of the two disciples of Buddha which are preserved in a casket        with pieces of bone and jewels The Stupa II mound is down on the        western slope of the hill Its circular balustrade has four Lshaped        entrances with a simpler decoration of flora fauna and Buddha        symbols Historians have noted that the horsemen are using stirrups        the earliest known example of their use in India        THE EAST        The east of India encompasses the birthplace of Buddhism        at Bodh Gaya the great Hindu temples of Bhubaneshwar and the        challenge of Calcutta a huge confrontation of vitality and hardship        You can cool off in the green tea plantations of Darjeeling or in the        mountains of Sikkim        Calcutta        The towns reputation for squalor has so deeply imbedded        itself in the worlds imagination that it comes as a surprise to find        the Calcuttans to be the liveliest bunch of people in the country        Bengalis are irrepressible perhaps the challenge of coping with daily        life in this city of  million has sharpened their wit        Survival here is a creative art it is no accident that        Calcutta remained the countrys intellectual and cultural capital long        after it relinquished government to Delhi Calcutta was the home of the        writer Rabindranath Tagore Indias first Nobel Prize winner and of        the philosophers Ramakrishna and Vivekananda Creative people still        make their name here        After the establishmentminded press of Delhi the        newspapers in Calcutta seem bright ebullient and vitriolic while        Mumbais filmmakers are masters of melodrama Calcuttas cinema is        known for its sensitivity and poetry producing faithful mirrors of        village and city life in the hands of such directors as Satyajit Ray        and Mrinal Sen It is the proper home for the countrys best museum        which is simply and aptly named the Indian Museum         For all their ardent nationalism Calcuttans retain a        strong if sometimes sardonic attachment to things British in        particular they have an affection for the English language which        youll find spoken here with the most British of accentsand often        with a good deal more style and elegance than the British themselves        can muster        The West Bank        Even if youre not arriving in the city by train start        your visit at Howrah Station The crowds in and around the station will        douse you in something of a baptism by fire youll soon realize that        only a small fraction of them are actually there to take a train The        station is a home for many its entrance hall and platforms are        dormitory and kitchen        Head next for the restful Botanical Gardens laid out in        the th century boasting  species of flowers and shrubs The        first tea cuttings were brought to these gardens from China to found        the plantations of Darjeeling see page  and Assam The gardens

m         ft        The Howrah Bridge itself a national monument conveys you        across the river to the city center This massive steel suspension        bridge stages the most magnificent traffic jams it is a great place to        gauge the Bengali temperament        The City        Another park the Maidan is in the center of the city        landscaped to allow for a clear line of fire from all around Fort        William it was rebuilt by Robert Clive on a more easily defended site        than its predecessor Like Britains Hyde Park the Maidan attracts        ferocious soapbox orators

the hall of worship and ribbed sikhara dome over the sanctum repeat        the classic silhouette of Orissa temples        The Rajarani standing on a platform at the end of a        pleasant garden is a more robust structure than that of the        Muktesvara with a more pronounced pyramid over the worship hall and a        powerful sikhara behind it        The greatest of the citys many temples is

divine charioteer has gone but the grandiose pyramid        of the Jagmohan Hall of Audience where the priests used to        officiate still soars above  pairs of huge stone wheels sculpted        into its huge platform and drawn by numerous galloping horses The        temple was built in the th century but the sikhara toppled its        porous stone ruined by storms and plunderersand by the ambitious        concept of its architect As you climb over the remains youll find        they have a decidedly secular air Surya was given his due with        dignified green chlorite statues of parsvadevatas sundeities set in        niches facing the four points of the compass and much of the sculpture        profusely decorating the walls emphasizes his life as a kinghis        battles the

worth a visit just to see a        community devoted almost entirely to the industry of its great Temple        of Jaggannath either directly or by trading with the pilgrims        NonHindus are not permitted within the temple precincts        but you can get a good view from the roof of the Raghunandan Library        near the temple wall Some  priests artisans and other workers        are employed within the grounds Of the four main buildings all of        them whitewashed and decorated with bright painted sculptures the        first is where the worshippers bring offerings of flowers

 Brits believed it would be a healthy place for soldiers and East India        Company employees to recover from the ills of the plains but above all        they found the area strategically useful

 and a glass case featuring a rolled gold replica of the British crown        set between a tea kettle which is noticeably bigger than the coffee pot        near it        On the summit of the Chamundi Hill the Sri Chamundeswari        Temple offers a fine view of Mysore On your way back down the hill        take a look at the massive black Nandi bull Shivas sacred mascot        with chains and bells that are a mixture of both real and sculpted        items hung around its neck        Another popular sight are the Brindavan Gardens in Mughal        style some  km  miles north of Mysore worth visiting at night        when the fountains are floodlit        Srirangapatnam        The names of many southern towns are longer than their        main streets Situated due east of Mysore Srirangapatnam was the site        of the battles against the Muslim ruler Tipu Sultan in the s in        which the British gained control of the peninsula        The fort which was taken by Lord Cornwallis and Colonel        Arthur Wellesley the Iron Duke with the rubber boots no longer        stands today but the sultans summer palace Darya Daulat Bagh has        been preserved and made into a museum honoring the brave resistance of        Tipu and his father Haidar Ali        Somnathpur        The Kesava Temple built in  is a tiny shining jewel        in the crown of Indian architecture The structure is small no more        than  m  ft high and its vimanas shrines are set on a low        modestplatform but the temple achieves a grandeur in miniature        peacefully enclosed in its courtyard and isolated from the rest of the        village        The temple has been dedicated to Vishnu in his various        aspects as Janardana the Punisher shown as a rigid solemnlooking        statue on the north vimana as Kesava the Radiant after whom the        temple is named but whose statue is missing from the central shrine        and as Venugopala the Krishna on the south shrine with another        Krishna as cowherd listening at his feet        With a domed sikhara on each shrine the temples overall        effect remains horizontal in the style of the Hoysala kingdom        emphasized by the layers of narrow parallel carved friezes running        around the walls Every square centimeter of the temples surface is        sculpted An unusual feature in the Hoysala temples is that their        carvings are signed by the sculptors        Like the statues of Romanesque and Gothic cathedrals        portraying events from the Bible the carvings were intended to be read        like a book by those who had no access to the scriptures which were at        that time reserved for the Brahmins They tell the stories of the        godsof the mischievous tricks of Krishna as a child stealing butter        from his mother and later as a young man stealing saris from girls        bathing in the riverand of the adventures of the epic        Mahabharata        Belur and Halebid        The most comfortable way to see these important Hoysala        temples is to visit them on either side of an overnight stay at Hassan         km  miles northwest of Mysore        The Chenna Kesava Temple in Belur is also dedicated to        Vishnu the Radiant but it was built in   years before the        Kesava Legend has it that all Belur Halebid and Somnathpur temples        designed by the same architect The Belur temples silhouette makes for        an unfinished look but its not certain that towers or domes were ever        planned Here too it is the sculpture rather than the form that gives        the temple its impact        The friezes bring the building to life with the legends of        the gods Shiva the demonkiller or scenes from the        Mahabharataincluding Prince Arjuna shooting a fish while looking at        its reflection in an adjacent bowl of water The bracket figures are        masterpieces a huntress girls dancing or singing and a woman about

in Halebid  km  miles from        Belur dedicated to Shiva and his wife Parvati is the biggest of the        Hoysala temples It suffered some destruction by the hands of Muslim        iconoclasts so its worth visiting the Archaeological Museum too        where some of the best of its statues are now kept Look at the        surprisingly fine carving of the bracket figures in the dancing hall        achieved by the craftsmen working with soft steatite soapstone which        subsequently hardened to the texture of granite        Sravanabelagola        Fifty km  miles east of Hassan the

Sravanabelagola  years earlier by the Digambara        sect of Jains who regarded nakedness as part of the abnegation        necessary to achieve true enlightenment see page  It is believed        that in the fourth century bc Chandragupta converted to Jainism at        Sravanabelagola and fasted to death        Coming upon the statue at the top of the hill even though        you may have already seen it from a distance is still an aweinspiring        experience This Jain saint looms  m  ft tall carved from a        granite monolith polished by centuries of libations with milk        Gommatesvara the son of the prophet Adinath is entirely        naked except for a single vinecreeper winding itself around his legs        and arms The creeper symbolizes the impassiveness he is said to have        observed in this upright position of pratimayoga which he adopted for        one whole year in response to his brothers lust for worldly power An        anthill and serpents at his feet
