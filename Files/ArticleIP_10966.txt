                                 The Coup Bomb            By allaccounts the House of Representatives is about to impeach President ClintonFor the past year he and his surrogates have deployed nearly every argument tohalt this process They have won over the public according to polls but theyhavent persuaded enough members of the Republican congressional majority Theswing votes in Congress are turning against Clinton pushing him to the brinkof a Senate trial But Clinton has a weapon of last resort in his rhetoricalarsenal He can accuse the GOP of staging a coup            Going into theimpeachment vote the Republicans message is that theyre putting principleabove politics A thermometer is not a terribly useful thing on matters ofconscience and matters of principle argued House Judiciary Committee ChairmanHenry Hyde RIll on ABCs This Week  And what is the GOPs principleWe congressmen were sent there to protect our Constitution protect our ruleof law said Hyde And if we ignore that because it isnt popular then Ithink we do real damage to our form of government  The Constitution meanssomething The rule of law means something Were a government of laws and notof men            Moreover the Republicans hold out hope that they canparlay these principles into good politics by persuading the public thatClintons actions merit impeachment It has been my hope that as this processplays itself outthe hearings and the debate and the argumentthat this wouldhave an instructive effect on the American people and they might begin to payattention as to why this is very serious what this is all about namelyprotecting the rule of law and change their opinion Hyde explained So wehave to frame the issue as to whether the American people want to tolerateperjury in a chief executivethe one man who is sworn under the Constitutionto take care that the laws are faithfully executed            The coup argumentreverses this logic It parlays good politics into principle by framing theouster of a politically popular president as an affront to democracy theConstitution and the rule of law It combines three points Clinton and hissurrogates have been making for months The first is that the public opposesimpeachment The November elections were generally interpreted rightly orwrongly as a popular verdict against impeachment and todays New YorkTimes and Washington Post polls underscore the same patternSixtyfour percent of Americans approve of Clintons job performance percent dont want him removed from office  percent dont want theirrepresentative to vote for impeachment and  percent favor a censureresolution which Republicans refuse to let the House vote on            The second point is that the impeachment juggernaut hasbeen driven exclusively by the GOP Not a single Democrat voted for any of thefour impeachment articles approved by the House Judiciary Committee and only ahandful of Democrats are expected to vote for impeachment on the House floorIn the Times poll  percent of Americans said Republicans voted forimpeachment not on the merits but mostly to hurt Clinton and the Democrats Inthe Post poll twothirds said most members of Congress would cast theirimpeachment votes based on partisan politics rather than the facts of thecase            The third point is thatmany of the legislators who will vote on impeachment are lame ducks Somewere voted out of office in November Others didnt seek reelection The newCongress chosen by the voters will have five fewer Republicans But the oldCongress including the old Republicans will decide whether to impeach thepresident            As impeachment draws nearer the White House andcongressional Democrats have been escalating their rhetoric along these linesThey have accused Republicans of trying to defy the will of the peopleoverturn the votes of the American people and undo the last electionIts a sad day for America when extreme elements of one party seek to impeachthe president on a partyline vote in a lameduck Congress White HouseSpecial Counsel Greg Craig declared Saturday Nothing about this process hasbeen fair Nothing about this process has been bipartisan Nothing about thisprocess has won the confidence of the American people            The escalation culminated in an assertion by theJudiciary Committees ranking Democrat Rep John Conyers DMich that theimpeachment process does sometimes to some people begin to take on theappearance of a coup In that explosive word the Democrats three criticismsof the processunpopularity partisanship and the participation of lawmakerswho lost their seats in the electioncombined with the force of athermonuclear reaction Republicans reacted with anger This is the orderlyprocess of the Constitution not troops in the streets said one member of thecommittee Mr Gore is a man of very similar views to Mr Clinton saidanother so theres not going to be an abrupt change in the policies that thepresident of the United States advances            The Republicans havereason to worry Imagine the uproar when televisions across the country showthe first Democrat rising on the House floor in a thundering crescendo todenounce the Republican coup against the president Imagine the barrage ofvideo clips on the nightly news showing Clinton Hyde and other figures in thedrama being hounded by reporters as to whether a coup is in progress Yesthe GOP can rebut this charge But the charge is easy to understand whereasthe rebuttals are subtle complicated and technical Its too bad Republicanshave spent the past year mocking legal distinctions Thats all theyll haveleft when the bomb goes off                           Recent FrameGames                                        Bill Clinton and Saddam Hussein
