                    Background        The dorsal horn of the spinal cord plays important roles        in sensory information processing The dorsal horn contains        the neural circuitry conveying nociceptive information        including pain and temperature from the periphery by the        primary afferents       Nociceptive afferent fibers        terminate predominately in the dorsal horn of the spinal        cord Activation of the nociceptors transmits afferent        messages to the spinal cord dorsal horn through        neurotransmitters such as glutamate Initial processing of        nociceptive information occurs in the spinal cord dorsal        horn by excitatory and inhibitory interneurons The        projecting neurons spinalthalamic tract cells then convey        primary nociceptive information to higher centers        signaling localization and encoding the character of the        nociceptive input Other inputs related to the subjective        components of pain and related to motor and autonomic        control are also relayed to higher centers The projection        neurons of the dorsal horn also activate the descending        control system which in turn controls the gain of dorsal        horn neurons either through excitatory or inhibitory        mechanisms In this manner the initial nociceptive        information may be further modulated by signals descending        from higher centers              The dorsal horn can be subdivided into six distinct        laminae on the basis of the cytological features of its        resident neurons      Classes of primary afferent        neurons that convey distinct modalities terminate in        distinct laminae of the dorsal horn Thus there is a close        correspondence between the functional and anatomical        organization of the neurons in the dorsal horn of the        spinal cord Nociceptive neurons are mostly located in the        superficial dorsal horn in the marginal layer lamina I        and in the substantia gelatinosa lamina II and receive        direct synaptic input from A and C fibers Laminae III and        IV are located ventral to the substantia gelatinosa and        contain neurons that receive monosynaptic input from A        fibers Lamina V primarily contains widedynamicrange        neurons that project to the brain stem and to regions of        the thalamus These neurons receive monosynaptic input from        A and A fibers They also receive input from Cfibers        either directly on their dendrites or indirectly via        interneurons Many neurons in lamina V also receive        nociceptive input from visceral structures Neurons in        lamina VI receive input from largediameter afferents from        muscles and joints and respond to nonnoxious manipulations        of joints These neurons are thought not to contribute to        the transmission of nociceptive messages        Consistent with the important role of the dorsal horn of        the spinal cord in pain transmission and modulation        neurochemical studies have implicated an enriched        expression of neurotransmitters neuropeptides ion        channels and receptors in these neurons including        substance P enkephalin CGRP somatostatin and GABA The        morphology of primary afferent central terminals dorsal        horn neurons and descending systems together with their        chemical neuroanatomy synaptic arrangements transmitter        systems and functional properties have been extensively        documented         However the molecularchemical        neuroanatomy of the dorsal horn is a subject that is        constantly being revised and updated as improved techniques        reveal new insights into classical pathways or substances        that are localized in the spinal cord In this study we        performed a largescale screening for genes that are        enriched in the dorsal spinal cord In addition to        molecules that are known to be highly expressed in the        dorsal spinal cord we identified other neuropeptides ion        channels and signaling molecules enriched in the dorsal        spinal cord We then further characterized the cellular        localization of a subset of these genes in the spinal cord        as well as the regulation of a subset of the genes in a        neuropathic pain model                    Results                  Global identification of genes that are enriched in          the dorsal spinal cord using DNA microarray          analysis          In order to identify genes that are enriched in the          dorsal spinal cord we took advantage of DNA microarray          technology which is powerful in identifying          regionalspecific gene expression We screened globally          for genes that are expressed at higher levels in the          dorsal spinal cord as compared to the ventral spinal          cord A total of  rats were used in this study Dorsal          spinal cord and ventral spinal cord are separated by          cutting through the central cannel Dorsal spinal cord          samples from  rats were pooled and ventral spinal cord          samples from the same  rats were pooled to form each          pair of samples RNA was prepared from  such pairs of          samples each was analyzed by hybridization with a          Affymetrix chip RGUA which contains  probesets          Using the SAFER analysis approach see methods we          compared gene expression between the dorsal and ventral          spinal cord samples using a paired ttest and analysis of          variance ANOVA Using a paired ttest we found           probesets with pvalue smaller than  and greater than          fold higher expression in the dorsal spinal cord Table           An ANOVA analysis detected  of these  probesets          along with  additional probesets that met these          criteria We found evidence in the literature for          enriched expression in the dorsal spinal cord of  genes          among the  genes detected by ANOVA Table  In          addition we independently tested the expression of           genes by QRTPCR  genes by in situ hybridization and           genes by immunohistochemistry All but one of these genes          were confirmed to be enriched in the dorsal spinal cord          Both paired ttest and ANOVA analysis detected genes that          are enriched in the dorsal spinal cord as revealed by          independent confirmation As ANOVA analysis provides more          candidate genes we chose to subsequently present the          results based on ANOVA analysis          The  genes that are expressed higher in the dorsal          spinal cord represent several functional categories          including neuropeptides ion channels receptor and          signaling molecules calciumcalmodulin binding proteins          transcription factors synaptic proteins and others          Table  Neuropeptide genes are among the category that          have the highest number of genes expressed specifically          in the dorsal spinal cord These include somatostatin          protachykinin betatachykinin neuropeptide Y NPY          neurokinin B and nociceptin In addition we also          detected another peptide Ctype natriuretic peptide          CNP which is expressed at fold higher levels in the          dorsal spinal cord A number of ion channels were found          to be expressed higher in the dorsal spinal cord          including voltagegated sodium channel type VI SCANA          a putative four repeat ion channel NMDA receptor NR          and potassium channel Kv A few Gprotein coupled          receptors such as cannabinoid receptor GABAB R          receptor and olfactory receptorlike protein SCRD          as well as molecules important in signaling such as          Galphaolf Guanine nucleotide releasing factor and CAM          kinase I beta  CAM kinase II beta and PKC beta were          also identified to be expressed more in the dorsal spinal          cord We found that the dorsally enriched genes also          include several members of the calcium sensor protein          family such as vesicle associated calcium calmodulin          binding protein CAMK IV homolog PKC substrate          neurogranin chromogranin neurovisininlike protein          secretogranin and hippocalcin In addition several          transcription factors and synaptic proteins were also          expressed higher in the dorsal spinal cord Table                           QRTPCR confirmation of genes enriched in the          dorsal spinal cord          We sought to confirm the differential gene expression          of a selected subset of genes in the spinal cord along          the dorsalventral axis using QRTPCR The genes selected          showed expression differences between  to fold by DNA          microarray We compared gene expression between dorsal          and ventral spinal cord samples And the results of these          comparisons are depicted in Fig  In general higher          expression was confirmed for  out of the  genes tested          in the dorsal spinal cord despite some degree of          variation among the  pairs of samples from different          animals Fig           We confirmed the enriched expression of the following          genes a transcription factor NGFIA a putative four          repeat ion channel a vesicle associated          calciumcalmodulin binding protein that is homologous to          CAMK IV a neuronal calcium sensor protein hippocalcin          synuclein beta and an EST gene The Zinc finger protein          mRNA was found to be only marginally enriched in the          dorsal spinal cord Fig                           Cellular expression of dorsal spinal cordenriched          genes          Using in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry          we sought to investigate whether differences in gene          expression as detected by DNA microarray reflect          differences at the cellular level In situ hybridization          revealed that PKC substrate neurogranin and          vesicleassociated calciumcalmodulin binding protein          CAMK IV homolog mRNA are both highly enriched in the          superficial layers of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord          Fig  Neurogranin expression seems to be enriched in          subsets of the cells of lamina II and III Fig A          similar to PKC localization Fig C CAMK IV homolog          seems to be broadly expressed in layers IIII of the          dorsal horn Fig B Immunohistochemistry with          antibodies against Galphaolf syntaxin A and PKC          revealed that these proteins are also enriched in the          dorsal spinal cord Fig  Galphaolf and Syntaxin A          appear to be localized in the neuropil of the dorsal horn          Fig Aand B whereas PKC appears to be expressed in          layer IIi of the dorsal horn Fig C as previously          described                              Regulation of dorsally enriched genes in a chronic          neuropathic pain model          We sought to study whether the genes that are enriched          in the dorsal spinal cord are regulated during a          persistent pain state such as the spinal nerve ligation          SNL model of neuropathic pain For a subset of genes          enriched in the dorsal spinal cord we used QRTPCR to          compare the gene expression in the lumbar spinal cord          between spinal nerve ligation rats and rats subjected to          sham surgery and to compare expression between          ipsilateral and contralateral sides separated by cutting          through the midline in the segment of lumbar spinal cord          in spinal nerve ligation rats In general we found that          genes that are enriched in the dorsal spinal cord are not          among those found to be upregulated in the spinal nerve          ligation model of neuropathic pain Table                             Discussion                  Validation of microarray data          The reliability of these DNA microarray results is          demonstrated by the following three observations  A          subset of the genes was observed to be consistently          regulated by multiple probesets on the microarray  We          detected  genes by  probesets which have previously          been described to be enriched in the dorsal spinal cord           Genes that we chose to study further were confirmed          to be expressed higher in the dorsal spinal cord by          QRTPCR  out of  in situ hybridization  out of           and immunohistochemistry  out of  Based on the          consistency and the rate of independent confirmation          many of the genes listed in the tables are likely to be          true positives          We note that our list of dorsal spinal cordenriched          genes is likely to be incomplete since the Affymetrx DNA          microarrays do not represent the entire rat genome and          our study may not have been sensitive enough to discover          all the genes especially those that are expressed at low          levels                          Toward a molecular anatomy of the spinal cord          particularly in the pain sensory pathways          We found that some genes are expressed in a          laminaspecific manner while others may have a gradient          of expression Neurogranin is highly enriched in the          superficial laminae PKC has been demonstrated to be          expressed in lamina IIi The colocalization of          neurogranin and PKC in similar regions in the spinal          cord suggests that neurogranin may be an endogenous          substrate of PKC in the spinal cord Neurogranin has          been shown to be phosphorylated by PKC and this          phosphorylation is greatly decreased in PKC knockout          mice suggesting neurogranin is a PKCspecific substrate              Evidence that strongly suggests the          phosphorylation of neurogranin plays an important role in          neural plasticity comes from the studies that          demonstrated neurogranin knockout mice show essentially          the same deficits in behaviors related to learning and          memory as that of the PKC knockout mice              Neurogranin is not only a substrate of PKC but also          plays a important role in regulating PKC signaling              Interstingly PKC knockout mice demonstrate reduced          neuropathic pain     Similar to neurogranin we          found that a calmodulinbinding vesicleassociated CAM          kinase IVlike protein is highly expressed and enriched          in the superficial layer of the dorsal spinal cord The          function of this gene is not yet known However the          protein was also found to be enriched in forebrain          neurites              Using immunostaining we found that Syntaxin A and          Galphaolf proteins were enriched in the dorsal spinal          cord Syntaxin A has previously been shown to be          preferentially expressed in the dorsal spinal cord          neuropil Galphaolf is a G protein that was initially          found to be expressed in the olfactory epithelium The          Galphaolf has been shown to be specifically expressed          in the striatum in the brain and was found to colocalize          with and activated by adenosine A           A receptors     It is possible          that the specific expression of Galphaolf in the dorsal          spinal cord implies its mediation of functions for          specific Gproteincoupled receptors in these          neurons                            Conclusions         We conducted a largescale screening using DNA        microarray for genes that are specifically expressed in the        dorsal spinal cord We found additional neuropeptides        receptors ion channels and signaling molecules to be        enriched in the dorsal spinal cord         The regulation of a subset of the genes was confirmed        by QRTPCR Six out of the seven genes were confirmed to be        enriched in the dorsal spinal cord         In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry        revealed that neurogranin CAMK IV homolog Galphaolf        and Syntaxin A are indeed enriched in the dorsal spinal        cord         Through the detection of a large number of genes        which were previously determined to have enriched        expression in the dorsal spinal cord and our QRTPCR in        situ hybridization and immunohistochemical confirmations        this study provides a level of validation for the case of        Affymetrix DNA microarrays in conjunction with SAFER        algorithm to detect differences in gene regulation                    Materials and Methods                  Animals          Male SpragueDawley rats Taconic Germantown NY          weighing  g at the time of

silk thread The muscles were closed with           absorbable sutures and the skin was closed with wound          clips Rats that exhibited motor deficiency such as paw          dragging or failure to exhibit subsequent tactile          allodynia were excluded from further testing less than           of the animals were excluded Sham control rats          underwent the same operation and handling as the          experimental animals but without spinal nerve          ligation                          Behavioral testing          The assessment of tactile allodynia ie decreased          threshold

response to probing with a series          of calibrated von Frey filaments Each filament was          applied perpendicularly to the plantar surface of the          ligated paw of rats kept in suspended wiremesh cages          The withdrawal threshold was determined by sequentially          increasing and decreasing the stimulus strength          updown method analyzed with a Dixon

capture a          fluorescence image                          Affymetrix microarray data analysis          A total of  animals was divided into  groups and          the dorsal and ventral spinal cord were pooled for each          group to give rise to  samples Each sample was analyzed          on one Affymetrix microarray RGUA For each probeset          an array of  pairs of oligonucleotides for a specific          gene an index of gene expression was calculated and          analyzed using the SAFER algorithm    for all chip          analysis The SAFER gene expression index is a robust and          resistant measure of gene expression which is an          alternative to the average difference calculated by the          Affymetrix analysis software and the modelbased          expression index proposed by Li and Wong     Like Li          and Wongs procedure the procedure for calculating the          SAFER gene index involves both betweenarray          normalization and an adjustment for probespecific          biases          To analyze gene expression in the spinal cord          differences in mean level of the gene expression index          between dorsal and ventral samples were assessed for each          probeset using a paired ttest and ANOVA These models          facilitated estimation of ratios comparing the dorsal and          ventral samples and calculation of pvalues testing          whether the ratios are different from one            ie  a ratio of one implies no          change between the means for the experimental          conditions By fitting separate models for each          probeset differences were assessed using an error term          that included biological variability between samples and          did not assume that this variability was the same for all          genes                          Quantitative RealTime PCR QRTPCR          Total RNA was treated with DNase I Amplification          Grade Invitrogen Carlsbad CA to remove DNA
