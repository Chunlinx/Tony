in the deduction formortgage interest or charitable contributions Id like to suggest that the taxsystem should go much much farther down this road particularly the sales taxUnder my plan sales taxes would only be not eliminated on certain sociallydesirable purchases but also good shoppers would receive an antitax a bonusfor their beneficent purchases            For example in New York City youre charged an  percent tax when you buy a book I propose that when you buy a really goodbooksay a Patrick OBrian hes marvelousyoud be paid a  percentbonus Buy a  book receive  from the city            Buy a TV set and you should pay a tax Yourpurchase will make you fat and stupid Buy a TV set that operates only when youpedal a bicyclepowered generator and you receive a bonus Your purchase willmake you thin and stupid            Rent a copy of Seven Samurai  a fine movieand you get the bonus Rent Three Ninjas and you pay a tax but you cancheck a box that allocates your money to hire a guy to beat the hell out ofJack Valenti            The question of courseis who decides which items are taxed and which earn the buyer a bonus I do Bymaking these decisions a matter of narrow selfinterest my reform remainswithin the historical context of the present system where tax rates are set tobenefit the rich and powerful My system would differ only in benefiting adifferent self And whats good for me would no doubt be good for thecountry                           Bracket CreepAnswer                        If you dont want to pay your taxes today all youhave to do is say two magic words
