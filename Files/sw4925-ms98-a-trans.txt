            i dont really know any elderly uh in uh   no i hello   homes or anything   care of the elderly i guess is   yeah i havent given much thought to it im kind of busy raising my kids the only way i can relate to it is i think of my mother taking care of her parents     yeah   and i remember her running over there every morning to make sure they got dressed and and and  fed and cleaned       and uh i remember her saying to me i hope dont ever let me do that to you put me in a home because its its hellish on the person who has to give the care to a person like that       you know these   they have uh around here theyve got these uh theyre like uh condos   umhum   uh complexes and theyre uh   oh for senior citizens   geared to  elderly and senior citizens and they have i think uh like a nurse on staff there   well i dont think yeah i dont think the problem is i mean those condos are like elderly people just living in their own apartments i think the trouble begins when they have more physical problems   and they take care of some of that kind of thing umhum   i mean its got to be humiliating to have a stranger a nurse or somebody lift you in and out of a bathtub   yeah   you know because i mean im im not aged but im im forty one now and i still feel twenty something and i realize that my body is kind of traitorous and and and changing on me even though im not feeling terribly old     yeah     so i can imagine you  you know being eighty and somebody has to dress you and youre probably sitting there thinking my God this is so degrading but your body just wont do it     yeah       well i dont know i dont im not sure that uh this is necessarily true during even if theyre eighty you know because you can a lot of people uh maintain their their uh fitness and so forth right on up   well i i think nowadays people are making that effort to eat right and to be more fit and i think old age is getting older   yeah thats a definitely uh thats statistically true   hum are your parents alive   and my dads eighty five i think right now eighty five   do  and he fends totally for himself   yep   thats wonderful   he still  yeah he was having a little trouble getting his drivers license he lives down in Florida       where i was raised but uh   thats great  that looks good for you too you know  longevity in the family   yeah right yeah and my grandmother was lived to a pretty ripe old age too of course she was in a home when she lost you know her her mind went my dads is still pretty you know pretty well with it   well i you know  my thought is if your mind goes at the same rate your body goes then nobody cares right you know its like animals when theyre stupid what the hell do they know  i think if one goes before the other is when you run into trouble     yeah right i guess yeah well that like that uh what is it uh that disease of the   Alzheimers   yeah oh thatd be awful   well i i think it that kind of thing is probably awful for everybody around you i think these people dont rightly know what theyre doing   yeah yeah really yeah its hard to say   yeah thats true   i had a friend that got that and he was fairly young i think he was in his like late thirties or forties or something like that   well is that something that is that something that affects you all the time or do you kind of like wave in and wave out of it   uh maybe a little lower i dont know i think it does come and go to some extent but it just keeps continually getting worse yeah   um that doesnt doesnt sound too pleasant   no it isnt   well well i you know i talking about  what would you look for if you had to put someone in a home i guess uh i dont know i guess a place that has the most activities you know keeping your mind alive even if you couldnt do very much   umhum youd have to go uh i guess youd have to go kind try and pay them surprise visits and see if you could tell what the atmosphere was like and so forth   yeah thats thats true   if they were uh you know seemed to be caring or whether they were just  warehousing them   yeah   theres a lot of them like that im afraid   well you know you nobody takes care of your own as well as you would i was brought up in in a city where everybody lived in apartment buildings and there wasnt any room to you know wasnt houses  there wasnt a room to take in the elderly   umhum yeah   so if and when they couldnt take care of themselves they couldnt move in with you because you had a three room apartment or something so you know thats why they went somewhere else     where in the city   uh you know my lifes changed now i only
