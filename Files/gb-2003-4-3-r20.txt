                    Background        Plants respond to invasion by pathogens with an array of        biochemical and genetic changes including the production        of reactive oxygen species antimicrobial compounds        antioxidants and signaling molecules such as salicylic acid        SA and jasmonic acid JA They also respond by the        localized activation of a celldeath program designated        the hypersensitive response HR and by the systemic        activation of cellular and molecular defenses termed        systemic acquired resistance SAR                  Second messengers that contribute to the development of the        systemic response include reactive oxygen species ROS        SA JA and ethylene       There is evidence for        commonalities between plant responses to pathogens        referred to as defense responses and environmental        stresses referred to as stress responses             Despite similarities however a plants response to each        environmental challenge is unique and tailored to        increasing the plants ability to survive the inciting        stress               A comprehensive understanding of the networks of genes        proteins and small molecules that underlie plant stress and        defense responses requires identification and        characterization of the molecular components including the        genes that respond both initially and as the physiological        response to the stress or pathogen develops Several groups            have used existing expressed sequence tag EST        collections to carry out microarray experiments in initial        efforts to identify genes whose expression levels change in        response to pathogens and various abiotic stresses        However existing EST collections are not complete and most        were derived from cDNA libraries made from plants grown        under normal environmental conditions hence ESTs        representing stress and pathogeninduced transcripts are        likely to be underrepresented in them        To characterize the stressdefense transcriptome of         Arabidopsis more thoroughly we        sought to identify genes whose expression levels change in        response to abiotic stress known second messengers and        bacterial and fungal pathogens We used the bacterial        pathogen         Pseudomonas syringae and the oomycete        pathogen         Peronospora parasitica to evoke the        pathogen defense response The availability of both        avirulent and virulent strains of these pathogens        facilitates identification of genes that are important for        resistance as well as those expressed during disease        development       Moreover both of these        pathogens cause severe damage to crops of economic        importance such as tomato and crucifers     We also        treated plants with SA and methyl jasmonate MJ because        both are important signaling molecules implicated in plant        responses to pathogens herbivory and wounding and they        induce different aspects of the SAR            We used ozone as an abiotic stressor because the plants        response at the biochemical and molecular level shows        extensive overlap with the pathogen defense response and        includes the production of ROS as well as induction of HR        and SAR      At the phenotypic level acute ozone        exposure high dose for a short interval causes necrotic        lesions similar to those caused by avirulent pathogen        infections whereas chronic ozone exposure low dose for an        extended period of time accelerates foliar senescence        producing similar symptoms to those caused by virulent        pathogen infections      There is evidence that        elicitorevoked ROS production called the oxidative burst        is an essential signaling component of the defense response            Moreover ozone is a component of photochemical        smog and itself represents an oxidative stress to living        organisms damaging crops and forests            There are several strategies for identifying        differentially expressed transcripts including        differential display DD representational difference        analysis RDA serial analysis of gene expression SAGE        enzymatic degradation subtraction and subtractive        hybridization         We chose the PCRbased        suppression subtractive hybridization SSH procedure for        several reasons it includes a normalization step it        enriches for differentially expressed transcripts and it        yields cDNA fragments that can be used directly for the        construction of DNA microarrays We viewed the        normalization step as particularly important because a few        stressactivated genes such as those encoding the        pathogenesisrelated PR proteins are abundantly induced        by a variety of stresses potentially obscuring important        stressspecific transcripts expressed at much lower levels        The SSH procedure developed by Diatchenko         et al     has the additional        advantage that it exploits the suppression PCR effect        eliminating the need for physical separation of single and        doublestranded cDNAs     We have cloned and sequenced        cDNA fragments representing  stressinduced genes from        eight different SSH cDNA libraries We describe and discuss        the stressdefenseinduced genes we have identified many        of which have either not previously been associated with        stress responses or are not represented in existing cDNA        libraries                    Results                  SSH cDNA library construction          Plants of the           Arabidopsis ecotype Col show          disease symptoms when infiltrated with virulent           Pseudomonas syringae pv           tomato DC or when sprayed with          the oomycete           Peronospora parasitica strain Ahco          The avirulent bacterial strain of           P syringae expressing the           avrRpm gene elicits a marked HR in          Col plants whereas the           P parasitica strain Emwa elicits a          microscopic HR All treatments including pathogen          infection and treatment with ozone SA and MJ were          carried out on weekold plants All treatments affect          foliar tissue which was the material used for library          construction          To capture a wide spectrum of differentially expressed          genes leaf tissue was collected at different intervals          after the treatment and pooled before RNA extraction          Table  Leaves were harvested at     and           hours after acute ozone treatment and at   and           hours after bacterial infection and after MJ and SA          treatments Because fungal spores take almost a day to          germinate and penetrate the host cell samples were          collected at  hours  and  days in the incompatible          oomycete interaction In the case of the compatible          interaction the host fails to recognize the pathogen          early and mounts a response only when the pathogen has          proliferated extensively  days Samples were          therefore collected up to day  after inoculation For          the chronic ozone treatment samples were harvested           and  days after exposure          The efficiency of subtraction was evaluated by PCR          amplification of a housekeeping gene that for          gyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase            GPDH  and one of several          differentially expressed genes If subtraction is          efficient transcripts of housekeeping genes should be          reduced while those of differentially expressed genes          should be substantially enriched in the population of          cDNA fragments used for library construction Figure          shows that the           GPDH fragment is barely detectable          even after  cycles of amplification in the subtracted          sample while it is clearly detectable in the          unsubtracted sample after  cycles To test enrichment          for differentially expressed genes we amplified the           PR gene for the biotic stressors          and SA treatment the plant defensin gene           PDF for MJ treatment and the          aminocyclopropane synthase gene            ACS  for the ozone treatments                The genes tested showed strong amplification in          the subtracted samples after  cycles of PCR whereas in          the unsubtracted samples the PCR product was seen only          after  additional cycles Figure  On the basis of          the number of PCR cycles required for equal amplification          of the corresponding PCR products from the subtracted and          unsubtracted cDNA samples we estimated that the          subtracted libraries were fold enriched for          differentially expressed genes          One of the main advantages of SSH is that it          normalizes the cDNA abundance so that cDNAs encoded by          genes that are expressed infrequently but nonetheless          differentially can be identified readily     The          efficiency of normalization is illustrated in Figure           The more uniform distribution of hybridization          intensities obtained using the subtracted cDNA probe          Figure c reflects the equalization in the          concentrations of individual species present at markedly          different concentrations in the initial unsubtracted cDNA          populations Figure b                          Differential expression of genes identified by          SSH          cDNA clones for differentially expressed genes were          identified by successively screening new clones first          with the unsubtracted driver cDNA Figure a and tester          Figure b cDNA pools as the probes then the          forwardsubtracted Figure c and reversesubtracted          Figure d cDNA pools as probes The first screen          identifies cDNAs corresponding to only the most abundant          differentially expressed genes while the second screen          identifies genes that are expressed less abundantly but          still differentially The results from the four          hybridizations were recorded for each clone and those          showing the most marked differential expression were          selected for sequencing Although selecting clones that          showed strong hybridization only with the forward          subtracted pool was straightforward it was more          difficult to select differentially expressed genes when          signals were detected in both the forwardsubtracted and          unsubtracted pools We endeavored to select those clones          that showed fold differential hybridization However          as this was done by visual inspection such genes          constitute a potential source of false positives          After screening the first three libraries acute          ozone SA and virulent oomycete infection we          incorporated an additional procedure that permitted us to          identify clones already represented in our collection          This was necessary simply because there is significant          overlap at the molecular level in plant responses to          different stresses and cDNA fragments were being          identified and sequenced redundantly We therefore pooled          and labeled aliquots of DNA from sequenced clones using          them to probe each new set of clones This procedure not          only permitted identification of clones representing          genes in previous libraries but also allowed us to          monitor the completeness of screening of each library          Figure shows that the yield of new clones decreased as          the number of clones examined increased indicating that          by the time several hundred clones had been examined few          new genes remain to be identified in a given library As          the libraries were both normalized and enriched for          differentially expressed sequences it is likely that the          recovery of cDNAs for differentially expressed genes is          reasonably complete It should be noted however that          because we screened each new library for clones we had          already identified in previous libraries the libraries          are not independent of each other This procedure might          also lead us to miss highly homologous members of          multigene families          We cloned and sequenced the reversesubtracted cDNAs          for just two libraries those prepared from ozonetreated          plants and those infected with a virulent strain of the          oomycete pathogen Although we screened almost  clones          in these two libraries we identified cDNAs for only           differentially expressed genes most of which encode          proteins involved in photosynthesis Thus it appears that          a relatively small number of genes is downregulated by          stress and suggests that different kinds of stress          downregulate the same genes          Although differential expression of every gene has not          yet been tested under every stress condition of the more          than  genes tested to date roughly  have exhibited          differential expression by either northern blotting or          DNA microarray analysis see Additional data files each          of which has different sensitivity limitations Some          representative northern blots are shown in Figure           Because these tests have been carried out under a more          limited set of conditions than those represented by the          treatments used for library construction it appears          likely that most of the cDNA clones described here          represent differentially expressed genes                          Sequence analysis of stress ESTs          We sequenced  clones selected for differential          expression as described above from among more than           clones in the eight stress cDNA libraries On average           of the sequences in each library were redundant          Table  The frequency with which identical cDNA          fragments were isolated and sequenced was low          approximately  in large part because of the          prescreening to eliminate such redundancy Most of the          redundancy within libraries  as well as between          libraries  resulted from the use of           Rsa Irestricted cDNA fragments in          the SSH procedure Because of the restriction step two          or more different cloned cDNA fragments can represent a          single transcript This type of redundancy was rapidly          identified using coincidence of the Munich Information          Center for Protein Sequences MIPS identifiers Thus the           different fragments sequenced identified a total of           different genes Table           With the information gathered from the MIPS           Arabidopsis database    and          InterPro protein domain searches    we were able to          identify or assign putative functions to about          threequarters  of the genes in the stress cDNA          collection More than  SSH clones encoded proteins          with insufficient similarity to proteins of known          function to assign a function with confidence and we          therefore classified them as being of unknown function          The genes of known function were sorted into the           primary functional categories     The distribution          of the genes with known or predicted functions is          represented as a pie chart in Figure  The largest set          of genes  was assigned to the metabolism category          while genes involved in cell growthdivision constituted          the smallest group comprising less than  of the genes          Genes involved in signal transduction and protein          destinationstorage formed the second  and third          largest groups  respectively Genes implicated in          stressdefense response and genes involved in          transcription together constituted  of the stress cDNA          collection Figure                           Digital northern analysis          EST datasets have been used recently to extract          information on geneexpression levels       The          underlying assumption of such a digital northern          analysis is that the number of EST clones is proportional          to the abundance of the mRNA used for constructing the          library     Most           Arabidopsis EST collections are          derived from nonnormalized cDNA libraries making them          useful for this purpose     We recorded the number          of EST hits from the MIPS summary report link or by BLAST          searches with the           Arabidopsis EST database for each          clone in our stress collection Using  as the          definition of a rare message      and knowing          that there are more than            Arabidopsis ESTs in GenBank we          consider genes with fewer than six ESTs to represent          rarely transcribed genes          By the foregoing criteria   of the          stressinducible genes are in the rarely transcribed          category and  of these  are not represented by an          EST in the           Arabidopsis EST database Only            of the genes in the stress cDNA collection are          represented by more than  ESTs and can be classified          as abundantly transcribed These are the Rubisco activase          AzUF Atg and a polyubiquitin gene APPFD          Atg The remaining   cDNAs correspond to          genes transcribed at moderate rate  ESTs in          unstressed plants This analysis does not of course          reflect the stressaltered levels of these transcripts          Nonetheless it reveals that a significant fraction of          stressmodulated genes is not represented in existing EST          collections and that many are infrequently transcribed in          normal plants underlining the need to construct          specialized libraries                          Promoter analysis          The number order and type of proteinbinding          sequences present in promoters are major determinants of          the differences in expression patterns of genes Because          the transcript levels of the genes represented in the          present collection change in response to stress          proteinbinding motifs associated with          stressinducibility should be overrepresented in the          promoters of the stress collection when compared with the          total complement of           Arabidopsis promoters We compared          the frequency of occurrence of  different          stressrelated motifs in the total collection and in          each library individually with their frequencies in the          total population of           Arabidopsis promoters see          Materials and methods          We found that six of the  stressrelated motifs          analyzed were overrepresented in the promoter sequences          of the stress collection as a whole Table a and four          additional motifs were overrepresented in the promoters          of at least one of the libraries Table b The          ABRElike motif Wbox motif Wboxlike motif          SAinducible motif the Gbox and the TGA motifs were          significantly overrepresented in the promoters of the          stress collection as a whole compared with the total          population of           Arabidopsis promoters Table a          The Hbox factor HBF motif was overrepresented in the          promoters of genes represented in the virulent bacterial          library heatshock element HSE and Myb motifs were          overrepresented in the avirulent bacterial library and          the Myc motif was overrepresented in the SA library          Table b We also looked for combinations of motifs          that had been reported to function together     The          Gbox and Hbox motifs occur together in  promoters in          our collection            p   Over all more than          half of the tested stress motifs are overrepresented in          the promoters of the genes in the stress cDNA collection          reflecting its enrichment for stressresponsive genes          The two ethylenerelated motifs GCCbox and EIN and          the droughtresponse element DRE AtMyb AtMyb and          AtMyb motifs were not statistically significantly          overrepresented in the promoters of genes identified by          the stress cDNA collection                            Discussion                  Analysis of the total SSH library          To assess the contribution of the present stress cDNA          collection to characterizing the           Arabiopsis stress transcriptome we          examined five recent reports of                     Arabidopsis stressdefensemodulated genes that used          either commercial or investigatorconstructed cDNA          microarrays         Using the accession          numbers provided in each publication we retrieved each          sequence from the GenBank database We then used BLAST at          the TAIR site to search the AGI genome database and          identified the MIPS code for the differentially expressed          genes reported in each of these studies Once the MIPS          code had been identified we were able to estimate the          number of genes differentially expressed in each of these          studies and determine the overlap between each group and          the stress cDNA collection Table           The extent of overlap between the stress cDNA          collection and the subset of stress or defensemodulated          genes ranged from a low of  with the  genes          identified by Maleck           et al     to a high of           with the  genes reported by Schenk     Thus          almost  of the genes in the stress cDNA collection          have not previously been identified as stressdefense          modulated Conversely a significant number of genes          reported to be induced or repressed in the stressdefense          response is not represented in the stress cDNA          collection This may be attributable in part to the          stringency of the differential expression criterion          fold difference between experimental and control          expression levels we used in selecting clones to          sequence As the criterion for differential expression in          the microarray studies analyzed was fold over          control levels many genes identified as differentially          expressed in these studies would not have been included          in our libraries          Although we do not have the information to determine          all of the reasons for the limited overlap between          previous studies and the present one we can identify          several contributing factors A major factor is the          ability of the SSH procedure to identify genes that are          expressed differentially but at low levels As noted          earlier more than half of the differentially expressed          genes in the present collection can be classified as          rarely transcribed on the basis of their representation          by six or fewer ESTs among the more than            Arabidopsis ESTs sequenced Indeed          almost  of the genes in our SSH collection are being          entered in the           Arabidopsis EST database for the          first time as a result of the present work It seems          unlikely that the genes represented on the EST arrays          used by Maleck           et al    and Desikan           et al    comprise an unbiased          sample of           Arabidopsis genes as genes          transcribed in normal plants and at moderate or high          levels are more likely to be represented than the rarely          but differentially transcribed genes that dominate the          stress cDNA collection In addition there are          differences in experimental conditions and in detection          sensitivity that undoubtedly contribute but whose          contribution to different outcomes is difficult to          assess But it should also be noted that the overlap          between microarray datasets generated using the same          conditions and organisms in different laboratories can be          surprisingly low particularly when different microarray          technologies are used Enriched cDNA libraries such as          the one we have constructed may therefore contribute to          the characterization of the stress transcriptome through          the construction of standardized specialized arrays                          Functional classification of genes represented in          SSH libraries          We were able to assign nearly threequarters of the          genes to functional groups based on sequence similarities          with known genes or motifs see Additional data files          Although functional assignment based only on sequence          homology needs experimental verification it nonetheless          provides a measure of the diversity of the genes in the          stress cDNA collection Genes from all the major          functional categories are represented in the collection          Figure  and see Additional data files          Genes encoding proteins involved in stressdefense          signaling comprise  of the genes in the collection          They include genes encoding proteins involved in signal          perception several types of receptor kinases and signal          transmission G proteins protein kinases protein

such          as drought     heat shock     dehydration                and elicitors such as           Avr               avrRpt    and harpins               were also identified in the stress cDNA collection          underscoring the overlap between the different stress          responses          Genes encoding proteins involved in moving modifying          storing and degrading proteins constituted the third          largest group  in the stress cDNA collection Nearly          half of the genes  in this category  are involved          in proteolysis see Additional data files Proteolysis          of important regulatory proteins is a key aspect of          cellular regulation in eukaryotes     and there is          evidence that the ubiquitinproteasome pathway is          important in implementation of the plant defense response                Proteosome subunit genes are induced in          response to stresses     and several regulatory          subunits were identified in the stress cDNA collection          The Fboxcontaining proteins of the SCF complex          constitute a family of E ligases key components of the          ubiquitinproteasome pathway     as are many RING          finger proteins     The RING finger motif is thought          to mediate proteinprotein interactions and E ligase          complex assembly Certain RING finger proteins are          rapidly induced by elicitors in           Arabidopsis and may be involved in          the rapid degradation of regulatory proteins during early          stages of pathogen attack     Four genes encoding          proteins with an Fbox domain and seven different genes          encoding RINGRINGHfinger proteins including the          elicitorinduced           ATL like gene     were          identified in the stress cDNA collection In summary the          stress cDNA collection comprises a broad repertoire of          stressresponsive genes encoding proteins that are          involved in both the initial and subsequent stages of the          physiological response to abiotic stress and          pathogens                          Transcription factors and regulatory elements in          the promoters of genes in the stress cDNA          collection          The WRKY transcription factors are involved in          defense wounding senescence and plant development                   There are  genes with a WRKY domain          in the           Arabidopsis genome and six of them          WRKY      are in the stress cDNA          collection These WRKY transcription factors modulate          gene expression by binding to Wboxes and Wboxlike          motifs which are significantly overrepresented in the          promoters of the genes in the stress cDNA collection          Table a The bZIP transcription factors are important          in the regulation of genes activated by light UV          radiation pathogen attacks elicitors wounding          abscisic acid ABA treatment and SA treatment                       We identified two basic          zipper bZIP transcription factors and basic          helixloophelix bHLH transcription factors in the          stress cDNA collection The promoters of a subset of          genes in the stress cDNA collection are enriched in Gbox          and TGA motifs suggesting that they may be regulated by          these bZIP and bHLH transcription factors Identifying          insertional knockouts or creating antisense lines for          these transcription factor genes and using them for          expression profiling with microarrays constructed from          the stress cDNA collection will facilitate identification          of the targets for these transcription factors          Abscisic acid response elements ABREs are important          during the plants response to abiotic stresses such as          dehydration salinity and cold all of which are          ABAmediated      There is evidence that ROS are          involved in ABA signaling     The enrichment of the          ABRE motif in the promoter sequences of the genes in the          stress cDNA collection may reflect crosstalk among stress          signaling pathways mediated by common second messengers          such as H            O             The overrepresentation of the          SAinducible element in the promoter sequences of the          genes in the stress cDNA collection especially those in          the SA library further validates the enrichment of the          stressorspecific genes using the SSH technique and          suggests that these genes may be regulated by the changes          in the levels of SA that occurs in stress responses                       The motifs associated with the hormone ethylene          GCCbox and EIN were not significantly          overrepresented in the promoters of genes represented in          the stress cDNA collection A plausible reason is that SA          and ethylene act antagonistically to each other              The overrepresentation of the SAinducible genes in the          collection may be correlated with the reduced          representation of the ethyleneresponsive genes in the          stress cDNA collection The Myb motif was identified in           Antirrhinum      the Myb and          Myb motifs in           Petunia     These sequences          have not been verified as valid Myb binding motifs in           Arabidopsis  The          underrepresentation of the DRElike element suggests          that genes whose expression is modulated by pathogen          attacks and oxidative stress signaling may have minimal          overlap with genes involved in dehydration and cold          responses          There is evidence that the Hbox motif is involved in          developmental regulation of flowering but there is no          report of its involvement in stressdefense responses               However a combination of the Hbox motif and          the Gbox motif has been shown to be important for          binding of bZIP transcription factors to rapidly induce          defenserelated genes       The significant          overrepresentation of these two motifs together in the          promoter sequences of the stress cDNA collection suggests          that combinatorial interactions between these two           cis elements may also be important          in the regulation of stressresponsive genes It is          becoming increasingly evident that a major theme          underlying eukaryotic transcriptional regulation is          combinatorial control     Identifying the           cis elements and the cognate          transcription factors that bind to them during stress or          defense responses is the first step towards          characterization of higherorder nucleoprotein          complexes                            Materials and methods                  Plant materials and growth conditions                    A

manufacturer to compensate for the loss of mRNA          during the phenol chloroform extractions cDNA prepared          from the treated samples was used as the tester and          that from the

subtraction was carried out with          the control sample as tester to isolate fragments          corresponding to genes whose expression level decreased          following the treatment The PCRbased enrichment of          differentially expressed sequences depends on the number          of tester molecules with adaptors ligated to their ends          If the fraction of tester cDNA with the adaptors was less          than  ligations were repeated We designed          plantspecific glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase                     GPDH  primers to test the          ligation
