  A teamof Canadian psychologists believes that Tourettes syndromethe condition that leads patients to suffer muscular spasms and toblurt out obscenitiesmay be a psychological rather than a physical disorderSufferers may actually be able to control their sputterings according toexperiments led by Randy Flanagan at Queens University in Ontario BBC Onlinereports In one experiment a Tourettes patient was directed to hold aweighted box loaded with sensors Anticipating the patients regular tics theresearchers monitored how his grip on the sensor box changed as his armtwitched They observed the subject adjusting his grip on the box just beforeexperiencing a tic indicating that at some level he was in control of hisactions Flanagan concluded Tourettes sufferers have motor control overthese tics and these movements look normal and have all the same sort ofresponse we would expect to see in voluntary movement He also suggested thathis findings may point the way toward behavioral therapy for the syndromeClick here for a summary of the experiment                           No More TeachersNo More Books  No More Notes Either                        College students drop your
