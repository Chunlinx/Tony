          are do you work outside the home   uh yes i do full time   and do you have small children   no i dont have any children   oh okay   no huhuh   i uh i also work outside the home full time   umhum   i i do have small children though   oh my gosh   it makes it does make it very difficult i think that um our culture has um broadened quite a bit so that it is very acceptable for a woman to do so   uhhuh   and um   do you think its gotten easier on you personally you know as far as at work uh you know other people how you interact its gotten easier on you   um well yeah yeah but i didnt i i never found it difficult   uhhuh   as a woman my im im in the medical field and so i dont i im not in a field that is typically a mans field im not a surgeon im not a doctor um   oh uhhuh right   and so i i havent um  oh breached anybodys confidence on i havent tried in you know going into a mans   yeah yeah right yeah yeah im an engineer   what is typically a mans role are you in a are you in a job that   and so  so i have i have uh uh problem even when i was going through school   yes you are youre challenged frequently yeah   i found it to be a mans world and i got a lot of static from that   yeah it it   my and it my first few years at TI i found it to really be hard but now that ive been there for a while its its kind of a deal you have to prove yourself and after ive been there for a while now you know the guys im just kind of one of the guys im um you know respected and and and i do the same things they do   umhum   im sure not necessarily sure i get the pay the same pay but im pretty sure i do and and i feel a lot better about it i have a friend that had just turned forty five   umhum   thats an engineer and she tells me horror stories   oh im sure   of what it use to be like you know you know always getting um   umhum   belligerent comments like you ought to be at home having babies instead of doing these blueprints and things like that things that would just make her cry at work but she couldnt cry in front of them because theyd do it more you know so shes   yeah   she you know builds me up and says be a strong woman and and present yourself professionally and you know builds my confidence quite a bit   umhum   so thats why i ask you that if if you thought maybe times his changed made it easier on you at at work   uh  for me personally i dont think that um my sex really has much to do with um with limiting me as a matter of fact my um employer wanted a female for my position   umhum umhum   i do have trouble um im a physician assistant which is   uhhuh   somewhere between a nurse and a doctor   right   and i um frequently see patients without the doctor seeing them   uhhuh   and it is a its not uncommon that the um its its typically Hispanic males       typically Hispanic males do not want me to be their medical you know provider their their medical care provider that day   uhhuh   they um they really have a problem with it and theyll and they will almost always ask me to see the doctor   that is so strange   well  not not when you think of their culture though     yeah   and their culture i im talking about the ones who came from Mexico not the ones that were reared in the states   right   im talking primarily about um you know the the guys that are over here on work thesis   uhhuh uhhuh   you know that sort of thing but their culture is still very much thought not a womans thing and im a blonde and and and they are just like you know who is this girl why is she in here telling me anything   uhhuh yeah yeah yeah this little young girl yeah   yeah so they um so thats thats thats the only place ive ever even had a problem   umhum   regarding my sex sometimes my size is one limitation because i assist in surgery too   uhhuh   sometimes i wish i were strong as a man but um or the average man anyway   yeah well let me ask you this how have um did children do you feel like children set you back or kind of went off track a little while you know this is this is womens an issue im on a womens subcommittee womens initiative subcommittee and we were discussing this last week matter of fact   umhum umhum   that certain women have taken career kind of jobs you know and and  decided to go in and have one or two children and then got back on track and they didnt see that as a setback but   i dont i dont i dont see how i can ever get back on track i dont see that as being a possibility i will i will never work   uhhuh in other words if you wouldnt of had   seventy hour weeks again   oh yeah thats what they were saying before they had children they were working like crazy people   i mean i dont i yeah seventy hour weeks every week i mean it was nothing i mean that was what i did every week and but i dont not only   uhhuh   i mean i cant any longer my husband works a full time job outside the home too   right   and not only i mean i i physically cannot do it because of day care et cetera   uhhuh uhhuh   but i dont want to the desire is not there   right yeah   um and i am not someone i i i didnt i didnt think i had the desire to be a mother even   uhhuh right   and yet the childre n had transformed me and and and the mothering has transformed me to the point i dont  if if something happened and i no longer had a job   uhhuh id be okay   i dont even think i would go interview again     yeah   i i you know its its i mean i love what i do but i love my children so much more   yeah   and theres there is a guilt that goes along with leaving them to in the hands of other people   right right   that arent you   and a fear   theres a fear there too im not really afraid of what might be happening happening to them   umhum   in an in an abuse issue but im afraid of what theyre missing im afraid of what   yeah yeah right   of of whats not being uh you know uh discussed discussed with them or what or what opportunities are missed that i could fill in   yeah   so that fears there   yeah yeah yeah i i hear that uh theres all men in my group im im one of two women the secretary is a woman  and these men a lot of them have uh small children either just one or or two you know babies because were all fairly young and and i hear the men saying that a lot you know and i think that is a culture change that you know their lives have changed since they had children   yeah   you know they dont want to work that sixty hours anymore they want to hurry up and get home you know i cant wait to get home so i can play with my son   right see the kids   so and they have the same concerns as not necessary an abuse guilt but you know thinking well you know if i i could spend more time then they could learn so much more you know   just just learn about me i mean learn what i want them to be learn the things that are truly important to me because if you just tell them it doesnt count   yeah yeah umhum right   its what they see routinely that they remember   right   its that they see routinely that you deal with the you know with the gardener in a in a nice manner   uhhuh   uh that they see routinely that you are um you know doing Bible study or prayer group or whatever you are   yeah uhhuh   they need to see that instead of you just telling them well after you go to bed at night i uh you know stuff envelopes envelopes for the Crippled Childrens Association you know that doesnt count they need to see what it is you spend your time and your energy doing   yeah yeah yeah yeah   in order to get part of you otherwise they grow up with parts of their child care or there care givers   thats right their nannies and you know right day cares thats really interesting   umhum yeah yeah its its its a tough thing i dont if you if you have children you know   yeah i was going to say if uh when i get to that point im sure ill know it i see it from daytoday like i say the the men are experiencing this   umhum   you know a lot of them one of them just had a child within the last year and he has totally changed from this seventy hour work person to somebody that goes God im ready get out of here you know i need to go to day care   its incredible its   and he routinely calls the day care during the day you know like can i talk to my daughter you know and and uh   it is the most life changing experience i have ever ever i mean i i had no idea i never even wanted children     yeah   and uh then we were blessed with one in an expected fashion and i mean i just i i cant believe it i mean i i cant believe this is me   uhhuh yeah   and neither can anybody else you know i mean but its just phenomenal     thatll   it is absolutely phenomenal   thatll me too and my family theyll go oh my God youve got children are you fixing to have a child they wont believe it theyll pass
