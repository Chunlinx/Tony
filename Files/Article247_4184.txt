                                 New York Manners                        David            I quite agree that filmmakers are enthusiastic about the considerablefreedom given them by digital production But then you write Most filmmakersdont care if digital projection looks better than celluloid theyd bethrilled if it looked as good And I wonder            I think most filmmakers do care about the picture quality of their films asevidenced by the fact that those who broke through with video like Rodriguezturned to real film the moment they had the money And besidessod thefilmmakers I care While I am perfectly able to enjoy films shot on videosuch as Blair Witch  El Mariachi or American Movie  I alsoenjoy the voluptuous pleasures of great celluloid cinematography in a film likeFargo or The Double Life of Veronique             You write of Magnolia  At a screening the other day I had thepleasure of listening to Joel Siegel make fun of the movie behind me and JohnSimon in a separate conversation make fun of the movie in front of me Thatclinches itits one of the years best movies            Its also on my bestmovie list No  I also heard there was a lot ofderision at the Boston screening If you can keep your head when all aboutyou etc Thats one difference between New York screenings and Chicagoscreenings In Chicago unless a movie is really bad and everyone sensesthat everyone else thinks so the critics do the director the courtesy of notdistracting from his work by vocalizing their own opinions I have been to alot of New York screenings over the years and have been surprised a at howsome critics feel the right to laugh scornfully or even talk back to thescreen and b how so many of them loudly share their opinions of a film assoon as its over In Chicago we have a rule that we do not talk aboutfilms with each other after the screening I have zero need to know what mycolleagues think and they have the same interest in my opinion            As for Magnolia  it is so exciting to see a director and yes youare right actors swinging for the fences not holding back not playing itcool going for it What a movie            I agree too about Chlo Sevignys work in Boys Dont Cry  Sheprovides our entrance into the story and her reactions to Brandon let us knowwho Brandon is and how heshe is perceived It is a superb performance            I fully expect that many critics snorted and hooted all the way throughTitus  too but Harry J Lennix was superb in the films key role asthe villain Aaron And Anthony Hopkins was splendid too in a role thatprovides the definition of thankless In a season when directors have beenbreaking free of timid generic expectations why not an audacious film ofShakespeares least accomplished and most wretchedly excessive tragedy            Roger
