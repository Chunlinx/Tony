                                 Clinton Turns Yellow            By JacobWeisberg                           I words postedFriday Oct  to be composted Friday Nov                         In a small office in theWest Wing of the White House next to Press Secretary Mike McCurry sits anintense wiry political operative named Rahm Emanuel Though he is not amongPresident Clintons bestknown advisers Emanuel may be the administrationsmost diabolically effective tactician On the issue of crime in which hemostly specializes Emanuel has gotten celebrated victims like James Brady andMarc Klaas to appear in Democratic TV spots He is also largely responsible formoving the Clinton campaign beyond mere rapid response to preemptivestrikesengineering for instance Clintons endorsement by the FraternalOrder of Police on the day Bob Dole was set to launch a major attack on thepresidents crime record            So it wasnt hard to guessthe origin of the presidents latest little things proposal to require drugtesting of teenagers who want a drivers license Doles attack on Clinton forpresiding over an increase in drug use by young people had the potential tobite by tossing out the drugtesting idea Clinton could claim to be doingsomething about the problem Our message should be simple Clinton said inhis Saturday radio address No drugs or no drivers license            Clintons simple proposalmight be better described as simpleminded not to mention impracticaluseless and offensive to notions of privacy and constitutional rights But thetruth is that though Emanuel pushed the proposalalong with domestic policyadviser Bruce Reedit cant be blamed on advisers or even laid at thedoorstep of electionyear politics No one had to work very hard to talkClinton into accepting yet another abridgment of individual freedom for thesake of political expediency What the drugtesting proposal should remind usis not just that Clinton is an opportunist who with a point lead is nowpandering beyond the call of victory It should also put us on our guard abouta man who if he is a liberal at all is a liberal of an odd sort One with noinstinctive regard for civil liberties or the Bill of Rights            Clintons abysmal recordon liberty goes back to his days as governor of Arkansas The low moment was in when under no pressure from anyone he proposed a law to bandesecration of both the American and Arkansas flags It was totallygratuitous says Joseph Jacobson who was director of the state chapter of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union at the time Under a thenrecent Supreme Courtdecision It wasnt even in doubt that it was unconstitutional Clintonseemed more First Amendmentfriendly after he was elected president when hereversed himself and opposed amending the Constitution to ban flag burning Butthat stance turned out to be a false positive for the president on civilliberties Since then he has consistently insulted both the First and theFourth amendments Some would say he has disregarded the Second Amendmenttoo But thats a different discussion            Clintons First Amendment slovenliness firstbecame apparent in  when he boxed his own solicitor general on the earsfor having been on the wrong side in the Knox case in which a graduate studentat the University of Pennsylvania was convicted for possessing videotapes ofteenage girls wearing bikinis and underwear When the Supreme Court overturnedthe graduate students conviction Clinton joined in the chorus condemning thecourts decision            You might grant Clinton thatone as a necessary surrenderno politician in his right mind wants to beallied with child pornographers But what Clinton did on the CommunicationsDecency Act is truly unforgivable When Sen James Exon of Nebraska introduceda foolish bill which would have criminalized the transmission of indecent orpatently offensive material via the Internet the administration backedit            It was Republicans morethan Democrats who tried unsuccessfully to derail the CDA in Congress Oneoddity of this political moment is that while our Democratic president has nospecial love of civil liberties civil libertarian sentiment is growing in theunlikely soil of the GOPwhere vilification of the American Civil LibertiesUnion has been campaign boilerplate at least until recently This surprisingdevelopment is partly a matter of pandering to antigovernment paranoids in thegun lobby and militia movement partly antiClinton opportunism partlyexplained at least in the CDA case by the interests of business but partlyperhaps principled            In the CDA debate Republican Rep ChristopherCox of California led the push for an alternative both Newt Gingrich andMajority Leader Dick Armey supported Coxs position But it was left to athreejudge US Court of Appeals panel in Philadelphia to throw out the lawcalling it profoundly repugnant Did Clinton learn his lesson Hardly Theadministration is appealing the decision to the Supreme Court And Clintonrecently signed an immigration bill giving the government the power to excludeanyone who advocates terrorist activity This threatens to become a modernversion of the McCarranWalter Act which was used during the Cold War toexclude lefty writers and intellectuals            On Fourth Amendment rightsClinton has been no better In his crime bill passed in  he went furtherthan any Republican president would have dared to restrict habeas corpus thewrit by which state prisoners including those on death row can get theircases reviewed by federal courts Under the immigration bill Clinton directedthe Immigration and Naturalization Service to deport asylum seekers withoutgiving them any opportunity to appear before a tribunal And in his most recentantiterrorism proposal which he tried to wing through Congress in the wake ofthe TWA  disaster Clinton requested vast new wiretapping powers for theFBI Once again it was primarily a few libertyloving Republicans whorestrained him            The drugtestingproposal may be Clintons most obnoxious gesture of all In the otherinstances there is at least a tradeoff posited between individual rights andcompeting public purposes like the protection of children In the case of drugtesting however the proposed warrantless blanket invasions of privacy serveonly a symbolic value A scheduled drug test is easily beaten you just need tostay clean for a short time before the test Then you can celebrate yourlicense by getting high In answer to the objection that urine tests revealonly very recent use of hard drugs Bruce Reed says that before longdrugtesting technology will have advanced from urine to hair tests which mayreveal chemical traces for up to a year But here the insult to civil libertiesbecomes staggering The explicit purpose becomes finding out who among theyoung has ever indulged in the kind of experiment that both members ofthe Democratic ticket have acknowledged participating in themselves Clintonmade this purpose clear in his speech Thursday at Birmingham Southern Collegewhere he said the reason for the tests was to to find those kids and help thembefore theyre in trouble and its too late            That Clinton simply has no conception of whysuch an intrusion might be worrisome was evident from that speech as it wasfrom his radio address in which he compared his proposal to the requirementthat parolees take drug tests Parolees are convicted criminals Peopleapplying for drivers licenses arent even suspects of anything It has beensuggested that Clinton limited his idea to unders in order to affront onlypeople who cannot vote The more likely reason however is that if the idea isultimately judged constitutionala big ifthis will only be because itapplies to those who do not have the full legal rights of adults            On top of this sorrycivilliberties record are the misuse of the FBI in the White Houses ownoriginal traveloffice investigation and what has come to be known asFilegate No one has yet traced these abuses to the president himself Butthere is something to the argument that his cavalier attitude about individualrights helped to create an atmosphere in which thuggish members of hisadministration could regard invasions of privacy very lightly Dole is hardlybetter than Clinton when it comes to the Bill of Rights and there are lots ofRepublicans like Bob Barr of Georgia who decry only those incursions thatperturb the National Rifle Association But if Clinton sets the new Democraticstandard the day may not be far off when some Democratic candidate accuses aRepublican opponent of being a cardcarrying member of the ACLUand theRepublican proudly admits it
