        what what do you feel is the the major change thats been going on     thats a tough question were now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework right   i think that has been the major change is that   dont ask me   women feel they need to go out and do this they they no longer feel its um   its no big deal to to stay home and raise your family anymore   well it has no credibility anymore   i know it and i i think i think thats really sad because i think theres going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else   well im a school teacher and im in charge of raising them so i can appreciate it   you dont well  im im still home with with my last one and i wouldnt trade change a minute of it for anything     oh good for you good for you   but i i cant i cant help but think that eventually the pendulums going to swing back the other way again   well you know its interesting because when i heard the topic i was thinking uh this summer Oprah had a TV show   umhum   about wives that refused to go to work and how their husbands thought they were terrible and one woman had four children and her husband said she wasnt pulling her own weight in the family and thats frightening   oh yeah thats yeah it its sad   and its you know it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue yeah people were siding with the husband saying youve got to go to work if you have these four children youve got to support them   umhum   and nobody would give her credit for being home and raising them   uhhuh yeah i i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant life style than necessary   thats true   uh you know to i i dont think you know the kids dont benefit from the bigger house and the fancier cars and and and this type of thing i think that they would from the you know attention or whatever   thats true   uh but i i uh i i dont know i i see it as a major problem and i think its going to have to swing back the other way because i think were going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this   yeah well you know i as i said i teach school and   umhum   gosh im trying to think i dont know i have one woman one mother that i know is home but she also has ten children   what what grade do you teach   six seven and eight   six seven and eight ive got a child uh where do you live are you out   in Richardson   in Richardson were in Plano here and i have a daughter in middle school and uh i know there arent very many but she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home but do you see   oh okay   um you know do you ever do you ever see problems you know that you feel you know that the kids are are left alone too much and   oh yes yeah ive got one child um that stays with me everyday till five because his mother doesnt come home until seven and he doesnt wanna to be home from three thirty to seven by himself   he stays at school and the school allows that   umhum well he stays with me and i have a tendency to work late i work till six   uhhuh umhum   so he stays with me till five thirty and then goes home and you know i have lots of kids because they know im there late im a slow mover to say the least but um theyll come in and say can i stay with you because i dont wanna go home to an empty house   oh my umhum oh   and thats frightening because you know the when i said i im im raising them i am because were talking about boyfriends and were talking about what the girl said in class and you know whats right because theres no mother at home to do it     umhum no mother to talk to   and um it makes a difference ive and just the social values   well ive  do you do you feel it will swing back the other way or do you feel theres just going to be a big push to uh you know for for more more and more day care type situations   i i dont know i i have a feeling were gonna go more and more ive got a twenty one year old female and ive got twenty two year old male children child children and   umhum   i listen to my daughter and shes going to work and shes going to buy her house and shes gonna get her car and then shes gonna have her children and then when you know they go on one salary will they be able to sustain what their lifestyle is   umhum   and they back to work and you know i agree with you i was raised in a generation we didnt need all those things   yeah   and we live without them we did fine
