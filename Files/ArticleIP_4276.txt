Men whocould lead us out of the Flytrap morass That is the mournful keening you hearthese days from about half the folks in Washington They lament the passing ofan alleged era when figures of towering prestige and gravitas would swoop inlike superheroes when democracy had tied itself in one too many knots Gentlybut firmly they would guide us to safety then disappear back into theirwalnutpaneled clubs until needed once more If only we had such Wise Men todaynot excluding the possibility of a Wise Woman of course they would be ableto broker a deal between the president and the Republican Congress sparing thenation the prolonged agony of impeachment To hear the keening check out thisrecent New York Times piece by RW Apple Jr            The other half of Washingtonfinds the idea of WiseMentotherescue pompous patronizing andundemocratic This group includes both those who relish the prospect ofimpeachment and those who think President Clinton should hang tough                  Slate               s David Plotz falls into this category See his recentDispatch            In a recent New YorkTimes oped essay titled No Time for Partisans not available in theTimes Web site free

several distressed readers haveasked Why so many writers in                   Slate                from the WeeklyStandard  Answer Theyre just so  handy  In this case thoughKristol and the Standard are the leading voices urging Republicans notto flinch or compromise on impeachment so were especially delighted to havehis participation So delighted in fact that well refrain from making anyjokes tying Bills skepticism about Wise Men to his former employment as DanQuayles chief of staff Actually we couldnt quite work out a good oneSuggestions welcome            DefendingWise Men as a concept and as a solution to Flytrap will be James Hamilton Asthe youngest member of the Four WouldBe Wise Men he probably has the thinnestpatina of wisdom That is no measure of relative actual wisdom of course Butif we had to guess it probably means hes doing most of the work                           Poetryin Motion                        When weimagine the life of the poet laureate we seethrough a
