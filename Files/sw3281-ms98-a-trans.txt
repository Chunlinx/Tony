        okay Diane and a very good afternoon to you     and afternoon good afternoon to you   do you uh do most of your cooking at home or do you uh have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them     um no i do most of my cooking at home and um i could safely say that i have never cooked for a dinner party   ah my goodness  well what would you uh like to cook whats what what what is your favorite uh recipes uh that you would like to have for a dinner party now youre in Dallas is it     um   uh right im in Dallas of course um dinner parties down here probably   okay   oh turn out to be more things like barbecues  and   i was i was thinking in terms of Mexican almost TexMex TexMex   uhhuh yes yeah uh TexMex TexMex uh Mexican food um   umhum   probably a little bit different than what you serve up in Pennsylvania for a dinner party   well thats a very interesting food though and when i go out to eat dinner sometimes thats the type of foods i like to find we have uh   umhum right   i think  Chicos or or these different restaurants in this area that uh have all those fine Mexican foods but um if i were to cook uh a dinner party   umhum   uh it may be standard to you but uh actually i never get too much fried chicken   fried chicken   but i would have fried chicken um  with reasonably hot sauce on it almost a Mexican type thing   umhum   and i love twice cooked potatoes have you ever had twice cooked potatoes   oh yes i have   with with the cream made of the the sour cream and cream cheese and uh little oleo and i use uh oregano and maybe dill weed on mixed in with it   uhhuh right   and uh i like broccoli casseroles   umhum   which would include onion and cheese and again more dill weed and some medium hot peppers as you can see im inclined towards the Mexican type of a meal   umhum right   and i would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too   umhum   so  uh how would you improve upon that   improve upon that lets see id probably put a bunch of fresh vegetables in   more fresh vegetables included to that   and some  yeah uh green beans and um carrots and things like that   uhhuh how do you cook your green beans   my green beans um i just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes   umhum   so you   and i like to put a little Mrs Dash in with them   all right thats what i was wondering about what what you use and and and  herbs and so forth   uhhuh right uhhuh um i like to just put a tablespoon or so of Mrs Dash in there and it makes them pretty tasty   umhum have you ever tried Chinese type green beans   the Chinese type are they the real   we use soy sauce   no i havent ever used that   well you might uh be interested in that have it gives a very delicious taste you you have a soy sauce taste and you also have a little cream sauce in there because you you would use the water and um   umhum   golly whats this white powder that that uh that you mix with water and gives a thick sauce and i cant even think of the name of that right at the moment   a white powder um gosh   anyhow sorry about my mind but uh it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans and then you have the nice soy sauce taste under it     thats okay umhum   with a few onions in there with it it does it it brings out such a so much different things in uh in the string beans   umhum yeah   i like i like it to try them differently i hardly ever cook them the same way twice   umhum   just so i can enjoy them so you might uh think about that Chinese   yeah i might try that   Chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them   oh yes i love Chinese   and uh north African cooking is good when you use something called couscous   North African uhhuh   and thats uh made from uh semolina i think they call it beans and thats the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous uh absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it with it makes a very delicious dish you probably probably have to buy that from specialty stores   umhum   C O U S C O U S and thats a a north African dish they eat it one to two meals every day in North Africa   hm   and it is very very flexible you can do a lot of things with it makes a fantastic uh uh salad with cucumbers and olive oil and onions and oh boy real tasty     uhhuh   well ive enjoyed talking with you and i hope ive given you some ideas and uh   well ive enjoyed talking with you   thats one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food   oh yes   well thank you very much Miss Diane   okay thank you byebye   byebye
