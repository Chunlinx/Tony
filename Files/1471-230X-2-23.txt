                    Background        The biliary system is more than a passive conduit        transporting bile from the liver to the intestines Hepatic        bile is actively modified by the epithelial cells that line        the bile ducts and gallbladder Biliary epithelial function        is partially under the control of secretin and vasoactive        intestinal peptide     Other extracellular agonists        that influence biliary function include neuropeptides             ATP      and bile salts     In addition to the        welldocumented role that cytokines play in the immune        response and inflammation      cytokines also modify        the functioning of epithelial cells For instance tumor        necrosis factor TNF can modify intracellular signal        transduction and regulate ionic channel activities in        various epithelial cells     A few studies have shown        that cytokines can alter biliary epithelial cell function                    Biliary epithelial cells are capable of producing a        great variety of physiologically active compounds For        example it has been shown that biliary epithelial cells        synthesize nitric oxide a strong vasodilator     and        endothelin     a potent vasoconstrictor Various        cytokines are also produced by biliary epithelial cells            As biliary epithelial cells are capable of both        producing and responding to cytokines these cells may use        cytokines for the autocrineparacrine regulation of their        own function as well as that of other cells        Bile in the biliary ducts and the gallbladder often        contains bacteria and the bacterial product        lipopolysaccharide LPS This may be due to ascending        infection from the intestine or descending infection via        portal venous blood      Bacterial infection usually        leads to activation of the immune system followed by        inflammation While inflammation is an important element in        the defense against infection it can also contribute to        cholestatic biliary diseases and cholelithiasis Therefore        the control of the immune and inflammatory response of        biliary tissue to bacteria is important in determining        disease progression While the biliary epithelium can act        as a physical barrier to limit bacterial infection of the        underlying tissue     its physiological response to        bacteria and bacterial products is not well characterized        Like pulmonary and intestinal epithelial cells biliary        epithelial cells might respond to bacteria in bile by        producing cytokines and other factors To test this        hypothesis we used cultured normal mouse gallbladder        epithelial cells MGBE as an         in vitro model system to examine the        ability of gallbladder epithelium to produce mRNA for        various cytokines and chemokines The synthesis and        secretion of TNF protein was also measured These cells        demonstrated distinct changes in their cytokine and        chemokine mRNA expression profile and TNF protein        production in response to LPS                    Methods                  Materials          Analytical grade chemicals and tissue culture supplies          were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co St Louis MO          except where noted

      E coli serotype B or           Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype           at  gmL added to the apical compartment of the          insert After two hours the cells were harvested by          trypsinization and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol          reagent Gibco BRL Gaithersburg MD Five g of total          RNA was reversetranscribed according to the          manufacturers protocol Superscript II Preamplification          System Gibco BRL using oligo dT as primer cDNA          prepared from  g RNA was subjected to PCR using          murine genespecific primers for  different cytokines          and chemokines Table  as previously detailed              All of the primer pairs spanned at least one intron in          the corresponding genomic DNA Positive RNA controls were          performed previously to confirm specificity of primer          pairs data not shown Negative controls were performed          by omitting the RT step or the cDNA template from PCR          amplification For qualitative PCR target sequences were          amplified at C for  cycles for semiquantitative          PCR target sequences for TNF IL and MIP CXCL          were amplified at C between  and  cycles in order          to yield visible products within the linear amplification          range PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on          a  agarose gel and stained

acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein ARP were used as          internal controls                          TNF Immunoassay          Confluent MGBE were fed serumfree medium with or          without LPS added to the apical side LPS concentration            or  gmL Medium from the apical and basolateral          compartment was collected separately at measured          intervals and immediately frozen at C The cells were          lysed with  NP buffer  mM NaCl  mM Tris pH           containing  gmL phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride          and  gmL aprotinin sonicated for  seconds then          frozen TNF was measured in cell lysate and undiluted          medium using the Mouse TNF Immunoassay Kit from RD          Systems Minneapolis MN Statistical analysis on the          TNF immunoassay data was performed using Students          ttest Cell viability was assessed by measuring lactate          dehydrogenase release into the medium as previously          described     Changes in transepithelial permeability          was measured using Hmannitol as a small molecular          weight probe Tritiated mannitol  Ci with cold          mannitol  mM was added to the apical medium and          samples of the basolateral medium harvested and counted          at    and  hours after LPS treatment                            Results                  RTPCR          Using cytokinechemokinespecific primers with RTPCR          untreated MGBE showed distinct bands representing mRNA of          TNF RANTES Regulated on activation normal T cell          expressed and secreted CCL and macrophage          inflammatory protein MIPCXCL Figure  Upon          apical treatment with LPS from           E coli for two hours these cells          additionally produced mRNA for interleukin IL          IL and monocyte chemoattractant protein          MCPCCL There was no detectable expression of IL          or KC murine GROCXCL mRNA before or after LPS          treatment Semiquantitative RTPCR using specific          primers for TNF MIP CXCL and IL showed that          LPS treatment caused the amount of TNF mRNA to slightly          increase compared to the already abundant levels found in          untreated cells figure and  In contrast there was a          substantial increase in the expression of MIP CXCL          mRNA and IL mRNA following LPS treatment compared to          control Similar responses were seen when the cells were          treated with LPS from           P aeruginosa Figure and  All          visualized PCR product bands were of the expected size          and nucleotide sequence confirming proper identification          Although the RANTES CCL sample had extra bands of          unknown origin the band at the expected size of  bp          had a nucleotide sequence that matched RANTES                          TNF Immunoassay          The immunoassay experiments showed no detectable TNF          in untreated MGBE or their surrounding media after           hours of incubation limit of detection   pgmL In          contrast following treatment with  gmL           E coli LPS the concentration of          TNF protein in the cells was  pg per  cells in          one hour Figure  Intracellular TNF concentration          reached a peak two hours after LPS treatment with a          subsequent decrease by five hours After two and five          hours of LPS treatment there was measurable release of          TNF into the media of both the apical and basolateral          compartments figure  Three different species of LPS                     E coli            P aeruginosa  and           Klebsiella pneumoniae  stimulated          TNF release in a similar fashion figure  Treatment          with  gmL           E coli LPS showed comparable          results None of the treatments increased lactate          dehydrogenase in the medium compared with controls          showing that the LPS treatments did not alter epithelial          cell integrity data not shown LPS treatment also had          no effect on the transepithelial permeability of these          cells for up to  hours as measured by Hmannitol          diffusion experiments when compared to controls data not          shown                            Discussion        Bacteria are found in the bile of the gallbladder and        bile ducts      the presence of which may have        relevance to clinical diseases such as stone formation              primary sclerosing cholangitis     and        cholestasis      Direct exposure of subepithelial        tissue to LPS from gramnegative bacteria causes release of        cytokines by resident leukocytes and activation of        macrophages     The biliary fluid of patients with        cholangitis has increased concentrations of the        inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL suggesting that        bacterial infection leads to an increase in cytokines        released into the bile     Adding LPS to the bile of        guinea pig gallbladders         in vivo led to increased IL        concentration in the bile     What role biliary        epithelial cells play in the response to bacteria in bile        is not known        While most cytokine research has focused on cells of the        immune system other cell types produce cytokines including        the epithelial cells of the lung      retina            and intestines      Among the few studies        involving the biliary system it was demonstrated that        cultured human intrahepatic duct epithelial cells produce        functional IL and MCP CCL      Isolated human        intrahepatic epithelial ducts expressed immunoreactive IL        when treated with IL or phorbal myristate acetate            Intracellular TNF mRNA and protein was detected in        intrahepatic biliary duct cells in tissue sections            but not in cultured intrahepatic epithelial cells        therefore there was no clear demonstration that biliary        epithelium secretes TNF Little research has focused on        the ability of the epithelial cells of the extrahepatic        biliary system to produce cytokines or chemokines        As described in this paper MGBE were used as an         in vitro model system of gallbladder        epithelium to measure the endogenous production of        cytokines and chemokines by extrahepatic biliary epithelial        cells These cultured cells consist exclusively of normal        nonneoplastic epithelial cells     without other cell        types such as leukocytes ordinarily found in biliary        tissues The experiments showed that unstimulated MGBE        express mRNA for TNF MIP and RANTES CCL After        treating the apical surface of the cells with LPS the mRNA        levels for TNF and MIP CXCL increased while mRNA        for IL IL and MCP CCL appeared for the first        time Therefore cytokines TNF IL and IL a CC        type chemokine MCPCCL and a CXC type chemokine        MIPCXCL are all up regulated at the RNA level by        bacterial product interaction with the epithelial cells        The effects of LPS treatment for two hours on cytokine and        chemokine mRNA expression clearly suggests that biliary        epithelial cells can modify their own cytokine and        chemokine production after bacterial challenge at the mRNA        level As with all         in vitro cell systems there is the        possibility that the cells in culture may have phenotypic        changes to their cytokine profile compared to         in vivo cells In other parameters        tested ie morphology mucin secretion etc these        cells retain the normal phenotype of cells         in vivo         Measurements of TNF protein showed that MGBE        synthesize and secrete TNF when exposed to LPS while        untreated cells do not This demonstrates that gallbladder        epithelial cells themselves secrete a cytokine in response        to bacterial products The results from RTPCR showing a        relatively high TNF mRNA expression levels in untreated        cells which is only slightly increased by LPS treatment        along with the immunoassay results suggest that TNF mRNA        is constantly present in these cells but is not translated        into protein until certain triggers are provided This is        consistent with the posttranscriptional regulation of        TNF observed in other cells     In contrast the        mRNA of other factors such as IL IL and MCP        CCL are not synthesized until the cells are stimulated        suggesting that their production is under transcriptional        control The protein expression of these other cytokines        and chemokines along with the precise nature of the        interaction between LPS and cell surface receptors warrants        further study        While the exact role that gallbladder epithelial cells        play in inflammatory and infectious diseases has yet to be        determined our research supports the hypothesis that        gallbladder epithelium have some innate cytokineproducing        capabilities in response to the presence of bacteria on        their apical surface The accumulation of TNF in the        gallbladder bile of patients with cholangitis may be due in        part to the apical release of TNF by biliary epithelial        cells In contrast basolateral secretion of TNF could        lead to a focal accumulation of TNF in the submucosa of        biliary tissue Sufficient cytokine secretion could then        stimulate the leukocytes in the subepithelial tissue        leading to inflammation of the tissue without the need for        the bacteria to pass through the epithelial barrier The        production of cytokines by gallbladder epithelial cells        following LPS exposure demonstrates that biliary epithelial        cells may be an active partner with the immune system in        the detection of and defense against bacteria in bile        During sepsis biliary epithelial cells could mediate        biliary secretory function through cytokine and chemokine        production Dog gallbladder epithelial cells demonstrated        increased mucin secretion following TNF treatment            In addition exogenous TNF altered the absorptive        properties of cultured human gallbladder epithelial cells            It is therefore reasonable to suggest that TNF        produced by gallbladder epithelial cells in response to LPS        could affect cellular function in an autocrine manner        Since mucin secretion and gallbladder transport properties        play vital roles in cholelithiasis changes in these        parameters caused by endogenous cytokines and chemokines        may promote stone formation Epithelialderived cytokines        and chemokines also may alter biliary function leading to        cholestasis                    Conclusions        Gallbladder epithelial cells demonstrated distinct        patterns of expression of mRNA for various cytokines and        chemokines and responded to treatment with LPS by altering        their expression of certain cytokine and chemokine RNA and        increasing TNF protein synthesis and secretion The        ability of biliary epithelial cell to control endogenous        cytokine and chemokine production has important        implications for biliary inflammation and diseases such as        cholangitis cholestasis and cholelithiasis                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions
