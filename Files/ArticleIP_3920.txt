                       WhyGrill Brill                        William Saletans Brills Con Game raisesonly one interesting question Why is the press so afraid of Steven BrillShort of cases of outright lying  la Janet Cooke or Stephen Glass I cannotrecall reporters so viciously going after one of their own One answer is thatBrill has gone a long way toward turning off the golden spigot of leaks fromKenneth Starrs office The broader reason is that Brill has had the temerityto breach the inky wall of silence that largely protects reporters from beingsubject to the same rules of exposure they expect everyone else to live by            Two ofSaletans points are especially absurd One is that it now apparently is notenough to disclose the sources of the information in a story Brill also shouldhave disclosed how and with whose input he chose to focus hisinvestigation on Starrs manipulation of the press rather than Clintons Ifthat is the new rule why didnt Saletan disclose in his article how and withwhose input he chose to focus on Brill What are his hidden motives The otherbit of nonsense is the complaint that Brill relied on authority from the DCCircuit Court of Appeals about the scope of Federal Rule of Criminal Proceduree but didnt cite supposed conflicting authority The problem for KennethStarr is that his grand jury is in the DC circuit and unless and until theSupreme Court takes up this issue it is that courts rulings that bind himregardless what the rulings may be in other circuits Brill who trained as alawyer understands that Saletan does not

bothdisplay clear outrage at Brills magazine piece Their outrage was also sharedby the talking heads on all the Sunday shows What comes across to an objectiveviewer is that Weisberg Saletan and the press in general feel emotionallythat they are collectively above criticism and that Brill has violated a tabooI am surprised I had thought better of Weisberg and Saletan That they feeltheir egos were punctured by even an intimation that the press was in the wrongin its Starr coverage tells something about them             Ed OConnell                                       Overkillon Brill

Breakfast Table June  Now I know that I cant have a beerwith a friend in a public bar in Washington without being accused ofimpropriety by one of President Clintons everwatchful partisans So be itIll make some concessions to the need to avoid imagined appearances ofimpropriety But Ill have a beer with anyone I damned well please            To put in perspective theconspiratorial inferences that Estrich strains to draw from seeing me withStarr deputy Jackie Bennett at the Jefferson Hotel bara block or so from theWashington Post  where I always go when Im looking for a secure localein which to do furtive thingsperhaps Estrich should know that I also had somebeers recently with a member of the Clinton defense team We were at his homewhere no peeping partisans intruded            To be clear Jackie Bennettwas not leaking to me he was not telling me what to write or say ontelevision it was not a business appointment at all Bennett evidentlytroubled and hurt by my former employer Steven Brills ugly portrayal of himhad asked if we could get together for a private and personal conversation tohelp him understand why a man whose fairness I had mistakenly touted to Bennettwould write a catalog of falsehoods and distortions about Bennett and Starrpainting them both as criminals I had readily agreed because I like Bennettand I felt I owed him the best perspective I could give on Brills article theextreme tendentiousness of which had surprised me I had asked Bennett whetherwe should find a spot where he would run no risk of catching flak by being seenwith me Bennett had indicated that he was not going to let the risk ofencountering malicious gossipmongers dictate which bars he could frequent            Ourconversation moved from Brills article to other nonconfidential matters suchas the legal rules curbing what Starrs office can say to reporters to matterslike Bennetts sons my daughters mutual acquaintances and other matters thateven so creative a mind as Brills might have trouble painting as grand jurysecrets After the arrival of Estrich Bennett and I also wondered idly whethershe would seize the chance to misrepresent our conversation as somethingunseemly about which Bennett should be embarrassed This she has now doneBennett was not embarrassed I am not embarrassed It is Estrich who should beembarrassed for having concocted a fantasy to serve her partisan agenda             Stuart TaylorJr                                       Address your email tothe editors to lettersslatecom Please include your address and daytime phonenumber
