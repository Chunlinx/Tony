                                 Sex Machines            The painter of the machineage Thats the standard line on the French painter Fernand Lger Its also the theme of the retrospectivethe first in New York in  years tobe devoted to himmounted at the Museum of Modern Art Its easy enough to goalong with too especially with Anjelica Hustons voice purring in your earaudiotapes have replaced wall panels for this show about how Lger waspeerless in portraying the feel of the modern city            A hulk ofa man with a capacious appetite for women and red wine Lger seemed the rightchoice to muscle French painting out of the cafe and the artists studio andinto the world of steel girders and factory smoke He took elements from themajor  th century schools of artCubism but also FuturismNeoclassicism and Surrealismand forged his own peculiar idiom one thatseemed as racy and streetsmart as slang Of the modern masters he cameclosest to capturing the dynamism and rhythm of our headlong century            But beyond his uptotheminute virtuosity Lger doesntplay his designated role of machineage hero all that convincingly Born on aNormandy farm the only child of a cattle breeder Lger never lost a palpablenostalgia for the countryside reminders of which appear in some of his mosturban paintingssuch as the incongruous tree branches on the elevated platformin Construction Workers of  By  he had made his way to Pariswhere he first trained as an architect then studied at a couple of traditionalart academies He fell in with the Cubists whose reverence for CzannesFormalist innovationsdepicting landscape and figures with interlockingplaneshe shared Later Lger would claim he freed himself from Czanne bymeans of abstraction the pathbreaking paintings he called Contrast of Formscirca fully abstract exercises in funnels cylinders and arcsretainall their vigorous charm            DuringWorld War I Lger served for a year in the worst regions of the Western FrontIt was a democratizing experience by his own account making him feel as heput it in an often quoted remark on a level with the whole of the Frenchpeople His extraordinary Card Game  uses those contrasting forms to reconfigure atraditional genre subject Czannes Card Players is the most familiarexample Lger captures a leisurely break from the battlefield routine buthis tincan soldiers are still fully armored and their cards suggest anequation between war and a game of chance The earthcolored table is as rivenand scarred as the trenches of the Argonne            After the war came The City  probably hissingle most famous painting Some grimly monochromatic figures mount thestairway in the center of the picturereturning soldiers perhapsbutotherwise the city seems a cheerful colorful refuge decked with tastefuladvertising posters Never has the poetry of the first machine age been sograndly and proudly exalted comments the art historian John Golding in theexhibition catalog Maybe so but theres something opportunistic about Lgersabrupt embrace of urban life Its as though after wrestling long and hard withCzannes dictum that the artist should paint the world of nature in terms ofspheres cylinders and cones Lger realized Hey heres an environmentthats actually made of these shapes            The cogsand pistons that dominate his paintings of the early s remain unusuallyintimate humanscale Its true that hes drawn to machinery but his favoritedevices are typewriters and accordions and siphonsnonthreatening mechanismsthat lack the depersonalizing menacing quality of say Fritz Langsnightmarish film Metropolis  Although Lger was a Communist withpronounced sympathy for the working man his experience of factory conditionsapparently was limited to what hed heard from his fellow cardplayingsoldiers His Social Realist Construction Workers was displayed in thecanteen of the Renault auto factory to predictably tepid response It was thesame factory where the French philosopher Simone Weil worked long hours toexperience the true lot of the worker            The alienation of modern lifea central theme in the workof Lgers literary friends Henry Miller and Blaise Cendrarsdoesnt enter thepainters resolutely optimistic vision Even New York City where he waited outWorld War II takes on cozy contours for Lger who was quickly hired by NelsonRockefeller to decorate his New York apartment the fireplace surround is inthe MoMA show Lger saw the city of the s through a s temperamentreworking a drawing of  into his appealing oil The Three Musicians a particular hit of the MoMA show The looming skyscrapers of GeorgiaOKeefes betweenthewars paintings or Charles Sheelers threateningsmokestacks have no counterpart in Lgers work His Goodbye New York the cover illustration for the exhibition catalog has no urban feel atall despite some freefloating girders and a row of neckties glimpsed at aTimes Square stall The stray fences and tree limbs from the upstatecountryside where Lger spent his summers are more prominent Back in Parishe painted stilted idylls in the countryside utopias no one would want to livein The most sophisticated machinery here is the bicycle            The storythat MoMAs show tells about Lgerhis heroic struggle with Czanne hisescape into abstraction his flirtation with competing schools of Modernismhis late monumentalityis the same story that MoMAs permanent collectiontells with Picasso as the hero But theres another way to think of Lgersdevelopment As the machinery shrank in his pictures his women grew inprominence and size So many Modernist breakthroughs involved the visualdismantling of a womanPicassos Demoiselles dAvignon  on thesecond floor of MoMA de Koonings Woman I  on the thirdthatit should come as no surprise that Lger began the same way with hissystematically fragmented Woman in Blue  the first piece in theexhibition            Many of Lgers key paintings seem to have been inspired bythe question of what women are exactly Are they companions in the human realmor visitors from the naturalor even the mechanicalworld Are they animalvegetable or mineral The metallic moving parts of Woman in Blue yieldto the Neoclassical contours of the marmoreal Three Women  whoare as still as the stilllife lunch theyll never eat has a primitive EasterIsland look Lger paints a holly leaf in exactly the same blackonred idiomas though the nude woman is a botanical exhibit A decade later in hisComposition With Two Parrots  the women are still bulbous andinert but theres blood in their veins The painting suggests an equationbetween two forms of wildlife the clothed boy holds a parrot his companionholds a woman            Lgers ideas about women areinseparable from his ideas about machinery His clever BalletMcanique an influential little nonnarrative film he made in  MoMAhas it on a continuous reelintercuts dancing pistons and kitchenware withblinking eyes and a mouth that opens and closes rhythmically The idea Lgerclaimed was to prove that machines and fragments of them that ordinarymanufactured objects have plastic possibilities In other words detachedfrom their familiar uses and manipulated on film such objects could beanimated rendered flexible andin the sculptural senseplasticConversely Lger was also implying that human beings are composed of movingparts But the blinking eyes in his mechanical ballet are heavy with mascarawhile the sexy mouth shines with lipstick In his dreams of the future Lgerwanted his machines to be as sexy and intimate as beautiful women and hiswomen to be as available and predictable as household appliances
