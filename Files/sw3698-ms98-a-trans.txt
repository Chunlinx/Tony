                do you have any thoughts on uh uh uh our jury system   yeah actually i i have quite a few thoughts on it before i became a mother i was going to law school because i wanted to change how our law system right now is working   oh really uhhuh   because its not its not working correctly   what parts of the of the system would you change   well i mean when they pick like when they pick a jury theyre supposed to have an equal or almost equal number of men and women to get different viewpoints and they dont have that because the women cant appear in court because they have take care of their kids   umhum right right sure yeah and   so they they end up having an all male jury   right does the system not provide the system provides uh compensation for wages but they dont provide compensation for like say day care   yeah   they dont   no they dont   oh im that surprises me i didnt know that   and a lot of women have to cancel their appearance and tell the judge hey i cant ive got two or three kids at home that need me you know   sure yeah   and all the judge can do is say oh okay youre excused   uhhuh uhhuh   theres nothing the judge can do about it because theres no law that says you know the judge has to help them with day care so he you know they dont bother   right   and most of the juries if if anybody did a study of most of the juries theyd see that its almost always an all male jury because women cant leave their kids   sure yeah   and if they do get a woman on the jury she is beyond the age of fifty   huh thats curious i i i never even thought of that uh before um i i i did notice that uh most of the time the juries are males and  uh but id never thought of any reasons why or why not   well i wanted to go to law school mainly for the purpose that if i was doing something in the legal profession i thought maybe if enough people knew about the problem maybe we could do something about it but then of course i got married and became a mother so   umhum umhum     its kind of taking a back burner right now but im i still intend to finish law school ive got two years left   uhhuh where where did you begin   over in Arizona A S U   uhhuh a okay all right   but i i just dont think its very fair   right yeah   because they say well its all equal and you know we send papers to this many women yeah but how many do you actually pick because they can appear   right right yeah um uh what are your thoughts on uh leaving the sentencing to the judge   i dont think thats right   yeah   i mean most judges that would be fine because theyre pretty open minded   umhum umhum   but if someone accidentally got a judge that wasnt and there are judges out there that are racist or prejudiced about one thing or another   umhum   people could be convicted just because of personal feelings and i dont think thats right   right   i think they need more views than just one   right that that that thats curious uh im  im currently uh i have been asked to appear in court in Denver County Court uh uh for uh a traffic violation which i kept uh uh i i tried to uh plead not guilty by mail and uh for some reason i really uh hacked the judge off and so now im supposed to appear uh in court uh and and so ive been thinking a lot lately about uh first of all what im gonna do i dont know if im going to uh just go ahead and pay the ticket now pay the plea bargain or or fight this thing to the end i i wasnt guilty and uh but its almost impossible uh you you know what what really aggravates me is its impossible its impossible im in graduate school and they set the court date on a Wednesday so to go from Dallas to Denver uh to fight a ticket on a Wednesday would mean id have to leave either Monday or Tuesday and be back yeah and i go to school that misses a full week of graduate school well you just cant survive uh missing a full week of graduate school uh   and youd miss school oh yeah no kidding   uh  and uh its its completely absurd first of all that i that i got the ticket and its completely absurd that i should appear on a Wednesday at court you know i could appear at Spring Break uh you know theoretically and and i wouldnt mind doing that but   yeah   so im trying to figure out what uh what action im going to take if any or if im just gonna go ahead and forget it all and just pay it to to ease my uh ease my pain  but but you know it there theres a point uh  i guess you and i being younger uh tend to be a little more idealistic uh uh but but i see uh i i definitely see a an instance now where maybe i wont be as idealistic where where i would be able a uh willing to give up my ideals for uh a little peace of mind and get them off my back which which is new to me id never been that way before   yeah well  a friend of mine got in really
