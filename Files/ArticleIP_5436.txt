                                 Black Like Whom            Like it or notAfricanAmericans have inherited a historical exemption that allows them toemploy racial pejoratives freely and even playfully But the exemption has beenstrained to breaking point in Flytrap as black intellectuals struggle toexplain why the AfricanAmerican electorate supports Bill Clinton so much morevigorously than the white one does            Harvardsociologist Orlando Patterson conjectured reasonably enough on the New               York Times oped page that black voters rushed to Clintons aid becausethey feel historically vulnerable to invasions of privacy like those committedduring the Starr investigation Novelist Ishmael Reed stepped closer to anincendiary line writing in the Baltimore Sun that the AfricanAmericanaffinity for Clinton stems partly from the fact that the president has a blackstyle and even walks black Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison crossed into thefantastical when she wrote in The New Yorker that Clinton is blackerthan any actual person who could ever be elected in our childrens lifetimeExplaining what she meant by blackness Morrison listed single motherhoodpoverty saxophone playing and an uncontrollable desire to eat at McDonaldsEmboldened by this example white liberal playwright Arthur Miller suggested onthe Times oped page that Clintons blackness resides in the fact hecame from a broken home with an alcoholic mother            The deconstruction of socalled blackness might passmuster as a parlor game but its lame as political analysis The notion thatblacks cleave to Clinton because he does the pimp walk eats fried chicken andreminds them of unwed motherhood trades on noxious racial stereotypes andimplies that AfricanAmericans lack the ability to make rational politicaldecisions It also shortchanges the White House which conducted a brilliantcampaign to court black voters directly            Anypollster worth his paycheck knows that political approval ratings are basedalmost entirely on economic concerns By that standard AfricanAmericans havedone better under Clinton than under any president back to and includingNixonwhose enlightened policies on urban aid and public health surely qualifyhim as the blackest president of all time This point is borne out in thisweeks poll results from the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies inWashington For the first time in a Joint Center survey black people were morelikely than whites to report that they were better off financiallyby a marginof  percent to  percent            Clintons favorable ratings among the blackelderly  percent are astonishing given that this group disapprovesstrongly of the death penalty which Clinton supports with gusto These votershave given Clinton a pass on this issue telling him that he can burn thecriminals he wants as long as black economic fortunes remain good Combinethose fortunes with Clintons support of affirmative action and hisappointments of blacks to Cabinet positionsand  years of Republicanassaults on equal opportunityand it should come as no surprise that blacksare enthusiastic about this president            The WhiteHouse helped itself with a brilliant outreach campaign that went around thesometimes surly Congressional Black Caucus and reached black voters directlythrough their ministers and churches The office that carried out this plan wasofficially called the White House Office of Public Liaisonbut was morecolloquially known as the Office of Negro Affairs Alexis M Herman ran thiseffort so well that she was later named secretary of Labor While at the WhiteHouse her job included bringing in powerful black ministers who were morethan happy to take photo opportunities with Arkansas Bill They prayed and atewith him and prayed some more Clinton returned the visits in triplicate withchurch appearances that cemented his supportwhile enhancing the reputationsof the ministers he visited When Torquemada arrived at the White House gateblack ministersmany of whose church services are broadcast onradiounleashed a torrent of appeals on Clintons behalf Faced with a surgeamong its constituents the Congressional Black Caucus scrambled to the frontof the parade            Clintons church visits were more than singing and chickendinners He delivered his toughest talks on welfare from church pulpits Herealized intuitively what many Democrats and the Republicans have always failedto see that the black middle class is prime conservative timberangry aboutcrime intolerant of social pathology and deeply scornful of the traditionalwelfare system Given how this strategy paid offpleasing both conservativewhites and the black middle classRepublicans like George W Bush will surelyduplicate it in             Black people particularlyblack Southerners have endured political contempt for so long that many ofthem have come to assume that any white person who treats them with respectmust somehow be black under the skin But the claim that Clinton has a blackway of being not only goes too far but is also sociologically impreciseClinton is a Southerner like his hero Elvis what that means is that they bothgrew up close to black people with open access to black culture a lot ofwhich is synonymous with American pop culture The Baptist churches in theSouth were segregatedbut they sang the same hymns and preached the samesermons Given that all AfricanAmericans have Southern roots Clintonspersonal style and patterns travel easily from one black community to anotherIn short he is more comfortable in a room of black faces than any Americanpresident before him This is what Toni Morrison and others were trying to saywhen they described him as black
