                              A Yankee Dime and Other Reginal Expressions            Some years ago when sportscaster Red Barberused Southern expressions like sitting in the catbirdseat and tearing up the pea patch  there was a degreeof national amusement  Unfortunately much ofthis colorful speech has been lost as the language hasbecome homogenized through raido and televisionSigmund Freud is not blameless  Thanks to him weare all nowadays more or less selfconscious            The generation that came of age in the first twodecades of the century was probably the last of theunselfconscious breed  And because there was muchless travel in those days the regions retained theirspeechways much more completely than they do nowLater however especially during World War II therewas considerable mobility from region to regionSoutherners who went up North were quickly madeaware of curiosities of speech like Im fixing to dosomething or go somewhere  And there was hilarityamong Northerners for instance when a Southernerasked Whos carrying you to the dance  Carry inSouthernese meant escort  Hush puppies and hoecakes were also terms sure to attact attention fiftyyears ago but are now in common use  Hoe cakes originally baked on hoe and hush puppies  allegedlyso named because pieces of them were fed to dogs tokeep them quite are variations of what Southernerscall corn bread and New Englanders call spiderjohnnycake spider because it was baked in a spider  ablack castiron skillet  And when Northern visitors tothe South first saw blackeyed peas they were puzzledWe call these beans  they would say  Whenwe say peas we mean what Southerners call Englishpeas or green peas  Northerners were also amusedat a Southern matriarchs saying to a tardy arrival atthe dinner table Weve waited for you the way onepig waits for another            Those were the days of the enormous middaymeal  Most men worked close to home and the paterfamiliasas well as all school children came homefor dinner  It was the custom to cook large quantitiesof many vegetables and at least two breads for thismeal  Yeast bread was called light bread and cornbread was corn pone corn dodgers hoecake or hushpuppies   Even in small families large meals wereprepared at midday  One could never tell how manypeople might drop in  In big families the cook customarilywent to her own garden or to the curb market now called the farmers marker  to lay in a bigsupply of vegetables and fruit  Usually enough wascooked for supper too  However if everything cameout even with nothing left over the meal came out likeWillie Rosss fish   If some foold was particularly tastybeyond delicious it was larruping   If someone ate toomuch he had a hogs bait   The word bait used as anoun meaning sufficiency is given in few languagereferences  In Southern parlance a bait ment morethan enough  A hogs bait was a gluttonous plentyShe has more than she can say grace over was anotherexpression which seems to have disappearedEven though it refers to grace before meat and thusmeans that the materfamilias has more people to feedthan she can manage the term was used in many situationsof someone whose load was too heavy            If a child in early attempts at cookery made amess it was a mommick or a begarm  both of whichwere used as noun and verb  However the word bollix meaning to bungle was used only as a verb  Bollixis the only one of the three terms listed in most languagereferences  It is a safe bet that many who usethe term bollix informal do not know that it is a variantspelling of ballocks vulgar testes            Before storebought clothing was available homemadewas the rule  During a fitting if something wastoo tight  it was as tight as Dicks hat band and wouldhave to be altered  Girls learned to sew at an earlyage  For some it was a slow and tedious business butothers picked it up fast and sewed with a red hot needleand a burning thread   Although it is standard touse the adverb directly for right away it is not used asmuch now in American English as formerly  Ill bethere directly sometimes contracted to treckly wasfrequently heard as was in three shakes of a deadsheeps tail  a colorful hunorous variant on the usual intwo shakes of a lambs tail             A bossy woman was the old ballyo bell eweand of a person who put on airs it was said Shes gota big place   If plans went haywire they went skywestand crooked   Children were warned not to go atsome task with main strength and awkwardness ornot to go whalestaving at some job  When youngstersoverdid some subject they were told not to makea blowing horn of it             In the early days of TV dancing groups blanketedthe air waves  This early dancing was fairly frenziedgyrating which SJ Perelman labeled fireinawhorehousechoreography  Oldsters called it didapping Why are they didapping all over the place likethat some would ask            Few things are as crude as antiquated slang considerthe terms dandyfunk and hambeaters  circa  Some men it was said wore dandyfunk ontheir hambeaters  Dandyfunk is perfume and hambeatersare the long tails of a swallowtailed coatwidely worn during that period  Another relic of thatperiod not heard any more is the call to children forhousehold help Come quick and see old RingdieThe source is unknown perhaps it originated when adog named Ring was in his death throes and the familywere being called  Ringdie was said as one wordand the call was made if one wanted quick response            Some of the common comparisons were slow asthe sevenyear itch mad as a

wanted hot biscuitsfor breakfast and spoke disparagingly of bakersbread as wasps nests   Skim milk was blue John  awidely used term  Also common was the term Yankeedime  as in not worth a Yankee dime  This regionalismwas used mainly at Christmas if a personwanted to make it clear he had not given a friend a gift he would say I gave him a Yankee dime  Theterm means a kiss but was used disparagingly as in tokiss off   Not in any reference work I checked it isprobably a relic of Southern attitudes after the CivilWar as is the term gone to Lincoln   The latter refersto property which had been appropriated because thehome ovwner had not paid taxes on it            The South was indeed the Bible Belt as HLMencken labeled it  However not only the South butthe whole country was caught up in religious revivalismduring the early decades of the century  The bestknownnational revivalists were William Jennings Bryanand William A  Billie Sunday  But there were hundredsof lesserknown revivalists whose teams blanketedthe South  These revivals usually lasted twoweeks and were also called rotracted meetings During the summers every city and small town hadits revival tent where repentant sinners walked downthe aisle the sawdust trail  to the mourners bench forprayer and sometimes emotional repentance  Ordinarypeople especially children genuinely tried to begood in word and deed  The children were probablydamaged beyond repair because they were not allowedto take the Lords name in vain or to swear ie usewords like devil and hell   Instead of devil  they were tosay the bad man  and instead of hell the bad place Churchgoers were told not to call anyone a fool nomatter how justified the label because there was an injuctionagainst it in the Bible Matthew             Keeping the Sabbath was also important  Respectablepeople never did a washing on Sunday  And asfor sewing on Sunday the old superstition stated that ifa person sewed on Sunday the devil would make thesinner rip every stitch with hisher nose  Of courseno one took this seriously  However two New Englandsuperstitions were taken seriously  One known also inEurope warned against giving knives as gifts theywould cut the friendship  The other warned againstwatching a parting guest out of sight bad luick wouldensue  Another superstition warned a woman contemplatingmarriage Change the name and not the letterchange for worse and not for better            In the old days a standard farewell was Youkeep out of meanness hear  Though it was oftenused jokingly it was the equivalent of the

chief use of language is to communicate itmight come as a surprise to note a few of thetimes when language is used specially to confuseand alienate            Antilanguages do just this their reason for existenceis to ensure secrecy by being understood byonly a small band of people  Once too many peoplehave cracked the code  most important when thosewho have done so are in some way opposed to theantilanguages users  the language becomes obsoleteand dies            Linguistically speaking an antilanguage isformed by a process of relexicalization which is substitutingnew words for old  The grammar of the originallanguage is kept but a distinctive vocabularydevelops quite often when referring to activities orareas important to the subculture that the creating thelanguage  Established society usually has its nose putslightly out of joint in the process            John S Farmer coeditor of Slang and Its Analogues wrote in  The borderland between slangand the Queens English is an illdefined territory thelimits of which have never been clearly mapped outOther linguists who have taken on the chalenge ofdoing so include Jonathan Green Hotten GroseWilliam and Mary Morris Wentworth and Flexnerand Eric Partridge who published the first edition ofhis enormous Dictionary of Slag and UnconventialEnglish in   Further back as long ago as Friedrich Ch Laukhard wrote It is common knowledgethat students have a language that is quite peculiarto them and that is not understood very welloutside student society  But if the code of behavioursomewhere is particularly lievly then the languageof the students is all the richer for itand viceversa            Convicts shipped to Australia spoke a criminalargot described by James Hardy Vaux as flash languagein his New and Comprehensive Vocabulary ofthe Flash Language of   Vaux in fact was criminalhimself but also a linguist transported to thecolonies three times he used the journeys as opportunitiesfor research  Most of the words he

afriendly manner two men are talking in the presenceof third man an impostor  a detective or an investigativereporter  who believes he has infiltrated theirranks  His problem is that the first two are aware ofhis deception  The first man says to the second Shallwe clear up this mess  No the second replieswell leave it for the cleaner  Little does the impostorknow that he has just been sentenced to deathfor what was really said was Shall we kill him  Nowell leave it to a professional  A cleaner is a hiredgun an assassin  or at least it was until recentlyNow the definition is too well known and it willshortly be dropping away  Cleaner is a word whichadheres to the second principle of an antilanguagethe word employed in the process of relexicalzationshould not itself be conspicuous            A great deal of argot appears to be ordinary language not only in the Englishspeaking sunderworldIn india a sentence that translates into English as Goclean the bowl is used by a murderer to an associate infront of a victim  It means Prepare a grave  Notethe similar links between murder and hygiene Fewstudies however have been made into the languageof underground groups not least because of the dangersto researchers  We know that the language of theCalcuttan underworld contains more than forty wordsfor police and more than twenty for bomb   Oftenthe meanings of such code words are detected andthen they promptly go out of use sometimes theyare not detected at all            The same is true of the antilanguage of prisonersConsiderably more is known about grypserka the antilanguage of Polish prisoners  than about anyEnglishspeaking system but even that knowledge isincomplete and outofdate            The alternative second life inside Polish prisonsinvolves a complex caste system of people and suckers categories determined by the type of offence involvedand the length of incarceration  Movement withinthe hierarchy depends on sticking to the rules of agame in which grypserka figures prominently  An inmateis downgraded to sucker by breaking the rulesone of which is never ever to reveal the secrets of theantilanguage no matter what pardon or privilege isoffered  It is a concept well known in all prison systemsIn England a prisoner would be grassing English prison slang is readily enough available in anyprison drama or comedy screw is a guard snout istobacco nonce is a child molester or other sex offenderand nick or porridge is prison itself  This isnot antilanguage for we all understand it  This outdatedprison slang is used almost nostalgically in thesame way that some people still employ Cockneyrhyming slag which was once itself an antilanguage            Antilanguage is not easy to define as it does nothave rigid rules to which a subcultures inventionsmust conform  Nor is it easy to determine its originsalthough historically an argot known as pelting speechwas employed by bands of neerdowells in ElizabethanEngland  There were over twenty terms forvarying types of vagabond rogue prigger of prancershorse thief counterfeit crank  and bawdy basket arebut a few            Both then and now new vocabulary in key areaslead to finer distinctions in meaning than are foundin the parent language  There are many synonymsand for the speakers there is the comfort that comeswith the freedom to discuss illegal acts in publicplaces            While slang is not itself antilanguage it exhibitssome of its tendencies  Slag has as many divisions asthe English language has dialects  Youth slag soldierslang actor slang gay slang CB slang  the list isendless  And every gang wants its own argot a test bywhich a potential recruit can be measured if you dontknow the language very often you cannot get in or ifyou are already in not knowing the latest key wordscan be disastrous for your credibility            Slang is a means of unification for those who useit it is fun unconventional and sassy  What is moreit can be witty picturesque metaphoric  How it differsfrom antilanguage is that while it often intends tosubvert it does so by being understood at least inpart by the world at large  Where the purpose ofantilanguage is to be secretive slang is often offensiveIt is used by those who want it to be known thatthey are a clique  not dangerous people or criminalsrow            It is important to remember however that whatsurvives of this generations slang may bacome thenext generations standard English  Bus was the slangterm for omnibus zoo for zoological gardens  andpiano for pianoforte             The board slang once used on Citizens Bandradio has similarities with antilanguage althougheven the police more often regarded CB users as eccentricnuisances than criminals  The users howeverrevelled in their outlawed status the police were wellrepresented in the CB lexis  They were bears orsmokeys  police station a bear cage or cave  a policehelicopter a bear in the air   Police using radar werekojaks

this decade has beenstrongly influenced by African and American culturesby immigration and by cinema  Wrongly accused ofbeing a lazy language youth slag is in fact as complexand rhythmic as any dialect  The words manwell hard wicked  and swearwords are not simplyidle padding for a sentence they are anintrinsic part of the language  That so many adultsdisapprove of the way the youth communicate is preciselywhat keeps this variety of slang going            This leads to the issue of talking Black  LinguisticallyBlack English has origins in Caribbeanmainly Jamaican Creole  Black English a patoisdoes not vary much from region to region and belongsto an ethnically defined social group  In Blacksittings its use ensures soldarity between speakers inWhite or mixed sittings the use of the patois symbolizessocial distance from mainstream society and anassertion of ethnic identity  The more linguisticallydistinct the sounds of a patois the more it can cometo symbolize social distance  Here is approaches thestatus of antilanguage  For some Black speakerstalking Black provides a system of resistance on a linguisticlevel to a powerful social order            It has long since been noted that when two peoplewho come from different social backgroundsmeet there is often a tendency for their speech toalter so that they become more alike a process knownas accommodation or convergence  Its opposite  divergence occurs when people wish to stress theirpersonal social religious or sexual identity divergencetakes on a position of confrontation though isoften said to be a result of the speakers pride  Antilanguageis divergence on a grand scale and most varietiesof slang are at least sympathetic to thephilosophy and purposes of antilanguage            Are we faced with the paradox in which groups ofEnglish speakers effectively use different languagesVery unlikely  But perhaps there will be a rethinkingof the word communication and an instinctive scintillaof caution

mentioned spending the weekend preparingLower Loxley for an influx of grockles on MondayThe Archers is set in the Midlands but it seems theword grockle has trqanscended its southwestern connectionsand become a widely distributed informalterm for tourist summer visitor or holidaymakerBy extension it can mean nonresident nonlocal oroutsider  Tony Thornes Bloomsbury Dictionary ofContemporary Slang  claims that it has beenadopted by nonnative hippies and travellers living inthe West Country to refer to anyone who is not approvedof            The OEDe labels grockle as dialect and slang ofuncertain origin  and mildly disparaging  as well as associatingit especially with southwest England  It provideseight citations from  to  includingJohn Fowels novel Daniel Martin  and another referringto the Isle of Weight  In Cornwall the wordemmet is used with exactly the same meaning and islikewise labelled mildly disparaging by the OED which gives two citations both of which includegrockle  from  and   Its meaning is presumablytransferred from the basic sense ant  Indeed thewriter quoted in the  citation  Listener  Sept regarded it in comparison with grockle  as lessdifficult and more vivid because its true meaning isant  The Bloomsbury Dictionary claims it has beenused in Cornwall since the s            There have been various attempts to illuminatethe uncertain origin of grockle  from the fanciful tothe plausible  An Exeter University academic oncespeculated perhaps tongueincheek that it might comefrom the Latin graeculus  translated as Greekling witha derogatory flavour  It has often been derives from thename of the clown Grock an allusion to the red sunburntnoses of seaside holidaymakers  That is the versiongiven in The Dictionary of Contemporary Slang  byJonathon Green Pan Books  rev ed The term originated in the West Country specificallyTorbay where a local remarked that the stream ofvisitors to the town resembled little Grocks orclowns                        A most detailed and circumstantial account of itsgenesis which more than a little impresses me alsotraces its origin to the Torbay area and a comic butnot of the Grock variety  This version claims thatgrockle was the spontaneous coinage of a worker inthe southwest holiday trade prompted by an earlymemory of a picture story in a childrens comicBetween  and  Arthur Rivers then in histwenties and Londoner by birth was in charge ofthe boatinglake at Goodrington a district of Paigntonin Devon now part of Torbay  In the summer of or  Mr Rivers saw among the customers a tinyold lady with beady eyes a pointed nose and a ruddyweatherbeaten pinchedup face  He was so struck byher appearance that he observed to his assistant thatthe old lady was like a little grockle  His assistantnot surprisingly replied What the hells a grockleMr Rivers explained that he had been reminded of afigure from a picture serial he had once read calledJimmy and his Grockle   The grockle was a small dragonlikecreature with magic powers  Mr rivers tellsme that he could not recall the name of the comicwhen he had seen it and even whether it was Britishor an American import            The old lady and the three equally diminutiveadults and two small children in her North Countrygroup regularly visited the boatinglake during theirholiday and the staff took a fancy to the expression MrRivers had used and would say things like Yourgrockle familys here and so on  The term survivedthe departure of the originals and was soon consciouslyadopted for all the holidaying patrons mainlyfrom the Midlands and North by the large number ofseasonal employees at the lake  Mr Rivers assistantFreddie Fly wrote an Ode to the Grockle and thecoaches bringing the tourists were christened grocklewagons   Mr Rivers has emphasized to me that theword was not then used in a disparaging way butmore as a kind of professional injoke with about thesame force as the now universal punter client customerpart of the verbal comaraderie of a lively bandof young workers            The word became current among the families ofthe boatinglakes local staff and outlasted the seasonto be acquired later by other holiday trade people inthe area such as the Paigntonborn novelist and localcolumnist Brian Carter  In an article in TorbaysHerald Express May  he remembered hearinggrockle for the first time in the late s when workingon the Goodrington promenade  From there itwould inevitably spread to Paignton and Torquay thetowns which with Brixham now make up Torbay            By the early s Freddie Fly had become abarman at a Brixham pub and there met a writerPeter Draper who was working on a screenplay for aflim based on the adventures of seasonal workers inthe holiday industry  He picked up Freddie Flys useof grockle to add authenticity to his script  The flimstarring Oliver Reed was released in Britain in as The System  the system being one to pullbirds  and in the US as The GirlGetters  a moreexplicit rendering of the same idea  This was the firstnational publicity for the hitherto local expressionand the OEDs first citation of grockle is in fact fromFlims  Fliming   October  extracted from areview of what is presumably The System             In the same year Pan Books published a halfcrownpaperback novelization by John Burke of PeterDrapers screenplay  The text contained the films extendeddialogue explanation of grockle includinggrocklecomforter for transistor raido and grockleboxfor cheap camera as well as its other passingreferences but added about fifteen more in the narrativewith an example between quotation marks inthe backcover blurb  It may be that in prevideodays these appearances in print after the film hadended its run in the cinema played a part in thespread of the expression during the res of the s            The word was certainly hard to escape in theTorbay area in the early s and by then often hada derisive flavour as friction increased between younglocals and young summer visitors  Hence Look atthose bloody grockles from some trawlerman wasmy own first encounter with it as I took a party ofSwiss students round Brixham  Stickers reading Nongrocklecould sometimes be seen in the rear windowsof cars as an assertion of local identity  The word hadalso spawned more extensions like grocktrap shopselling tourist sovenirs  The Daily Telegraph of August  the last of the OEDs citations also givesgrockle fodder fish and chips grockle bait touristsouvenirs and grockle nests camp sites            In  Arthur Rivers who had become the landlordof a Paignton pub took part in a Radio Four programmewith Peter Draper Brian Carter and anOED representative  At the end the presenterhanded Mr Rivers a photocopy from a  issue ofThe Dandy  a British weekly childrens comic  Thepage heading was Jimmy and His Grockle  so MrRivers was able to validate and localize the memorythat had floated to the surface of his mind in the mids  Grockle turned out to be onomatopoeic beingall the little dragon ever said            The first number of The Dandy  published by DC Thomson of Dundee was dated  December when Arthur Rivers would have been six or sevenyears old  However Jimmy and his Grockle hadstarted in  as a conventional serial story in anotherThomson childrens publication The Rover  beforebeing tracslated into picture strip form in It ran again in the DC Thomson comic Sparky from to             Perhaps it was The System that helped grockleto beome so farflung and win out over the allegedlymore vivid but today still Cornwallconfined emmet But I personally would speculate that the unknowncreator of Jimmy and his Grockle in the early skeew the sort of word that resonates in childrensmemories  Could a further reason for the words successbe that it rhymes with the name of a kind of ediblemolluse that is a traditional feature of Britishseaside holidays  It clearly seems to have appealed tothe writer of some verses in Shooting Times Country Magazine for  August   not spottedby the OED  which ran in partThere are the like in other landsBut here they call them grocklesAnd feed them on the summer

the world his Golden Bible The Book of Mormon  hecertainly introduced some radical new theologh  Howeveras his followers presecuted and harried out of the esternUS to the godforsaken wastes of what is now Utah thenproceeded in build Zion as they made the desert bloomthey and their descendants have also contributed someunique words to the English language or in some casessome unique twists on existing words            A full exposition of strictly doctrinal terms is beyondthe scope of this article because such a listing would entaila detailed examination of Mormon doctrine  Speaking ofMormon doctrine the term used as a generalpurposenoun adjective and adverb as an unofficial designation forthe Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints and its adherentsand comes from The Book of Mormon  a bookthat Joseph Smith claims to have translated from goldplates goven to him by an angle  The book claims to be aparallel to the Bible but pertaining to the New World andrelates the religious history of several groups of peopleTalking about the book in a scholarly way in somewhatlike discussing Tolkiens works which also contain a richlydeveloped cultural world  In Tolkiens case it is selfevidentthat his Lord of the Rings trilogy is a work of fiction andnonMoromons would probably assign the Book ofMormon to the same category but faithful Mormons takeits truth seriously whether strictly historical on one end ofa spectrum to mythologically symbolic on the other endalbeit of faith  This is by way of pointing out that Mormonwas the name of the major editor of the book and it wasnamed after him although he did not write the wholebook            Whether Mormon was historical figure or a fictionalCharacter is a matter of faith but many of thenames in the book do have roots in Near Estern languagesfor whatever reason  Several of the personalnames in the book are popular boys names amongstMormon families today especially popular are Jaredwhich is also the name of an obscure Biblical personagebut the Book of Mormon character has a fargreater profile Helaman and Nephi   Current placenames in Utah that come from the Book of Mormon includeBountiful Lehi Nephi Manti Moroni  andDeseret town not the territory  There are numerousBiblical names as well Paradise Jordan River WestJordan Goshen Ephraim Zion National Park JosephMount Carmel  and Moab  as well as places named afterearly leaders and settlers Brigham City GrantsvilleHeber City and others  The Jordan River is so calledbecause the geography of Utah resembles that of PalestineLake Utah drains via the Jordan River into theGreat Salt Lake just as the Sea of Galilee drains via theJordan River into the salty Dead Sea  Old World Zionand New World Zion are thus mirror images of eachother  The names of two towns American Fork andSpanish Fork bear special mention because of a peculiarityof Utah pronunciation especially rural pronunciationlocally these towns are known as American Farkand Spanish Fark respectively            An intriguing example of a Book of Mormon placename is Desert  which was a very popular name in Mormondomin the th century  Utah was not allowed toenter the Union until long after it had achieved the minimumrequirements for statehood  becauseAmericans at the time abhorred the Mormon practice ofpolygamy called plural marriage in Latterday EnglishHaving more than one wife was all right Gentiles nonMormonsjust disapproved of having them all at the sametime  Speaking of Gentiles  there is a story perhaps apocryphalthat the famous Israeli general and archaeologistYigael Yadin once prefaced a speech at the University ofUtah with the observation You know this is probably theonly place I can come and be a Gentile            The territory that preceded the state of Utahnamed after the Ute Indians was called the Territoryof Desert   It is a term for the promised land in theBook of Mormon and is supposed to mean land of thehoneybee  It has been speculated that the word is relatedto the Egyptian drt  a term for the Red Crown ofUpper Egypt whose emblem was the bee  In the thcentury these was a Deseret Industries   The hive isthe symbol of Utah and appears on its

  Several doctrinal terms bear mentioning  Mormonsor Latterday Saints  as well call ourselvesnot out of asense of spiritual superiority it is to be hoped but becauseof a reference of St Pauls to the members of the ancientchurch being called saints have two basic types ofreligious buildings chapels and temples and they are as differentas synogogues and temples are in Judaism  A chapelis a meeting house but the area of assembly for worshipwithinthe chapel building is alson called a chapel Traditionally there is also a cultural hall  which serves aseverything from an overflow for the chapel a basketballcourt an area for dramatic and musical productions anda hall for wedding receptions  The main Sunday meeting the counterpart to Catholic mass  is called sacramentmeeting  sacrament in the Mormon sense beingone specific sacrament only what other christians calledthe Eucharist  A temple is a building where as a rule nomeetings are held but where Mormons go for certain ceremoniesincluding vicarious ordinances ordinances on behalf of ones ancestors for celestial marriages technicallycelestial marriage is the institution of marriage that extendspast death as generally understood and the weddingceremony itself is called a temple marriage  and aplace where one receives ones endowment   An endowmentin this case is a ceremony at which one ritualizesones place in the universe both with respect to God andwith respect to ones extended family  There are also tabernacles which are large meeting places for specialpurposemeetingsthe bestknown one is of course the tabernaclewhere the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is based on TempleSquare  in Salt Lake City            When Joseph Smiths successor Brigham Youngfounded DesertUtah he sent colonists out to places as faraway as Colonia Juarez Mexico Cardston AlbertaCanada San Bernardino California and all over WyomingIdoho Nevada and Arizona  All of these colonies were setup in the same way with streets wide enough to ensure afull team of oxen could turn around  The towns were organizedpolitically in a way presious Mormon colonies inthe estern states Kirtland Ohio and Nauvoo Illinoiswere into stakes and words   The image of the stake comesfrom the stakes used to hold up the tabernacle in OldTestament days today it corresponds roughly to a dioceseand is a collection of words  The word started out as a politicalsubdivision just like wards in most North Americancities but became the equivalent of a parish  Stakes areheaded by a stake president  a volunteer official there is noprofessional clergy and wards are headed by a bishop             All males from twelve years of age are eligible tohold the priesthood ant it is this semiuniversal priesthoodthat governs the church with participation by women insome administrative roles but outside the context of thepriesthood itself and conducts its rituals  The priesthoodis divided into the Aaronic Priesthood  for young menfrom twelve to eighteen and the Melchizedek Priesthoodfor adult males  Each branch is divided into three officesDecons are  Teachers are  Priest are and the Melchizedek Priesthood is divided horizontallyinto three offices Elders you might have met some awfullyyound Elders on your doorstep  Seventies  andhigh Priests   The imagery comes from the time whenMoses went up Mt Sinai leaving a group of seventy atone point and the edlers of Israel behind

TheReorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints note the difference in spelling of latterday who did notfollow what they call the Utah Mormons out west butstayed in Missouri are called Reorganites  and althoughMormons have their share of fundamentalists to callsomeone a fundamentalist in Mormondom is to accusehim of being a closet polygamist  The practice of polygamywas outlawed just before the turn of the century butpolygamous families persist down to the present day  Onehas to admit these terms represent an improvement overone term that used to be applied to Missourians

Bush a murderer for having bombed BaghdadAt the same time supporters of George Bush who hadcheered when US planes bombed Baghdad calledSaddam Hussein a murderer for bombing Tel AvivBoth sides agreed on what they meant by the wordmurderer  mut they made opposite judgments as towhom it applied and why  How is that possible andwhat does it tell us about how language works                           Murder differs from kill in involving the notion ofjustification  To say that one person kills another is tosay that the first deprives the second of life but to saythat a person murders another is to say the depriving isunjustified  This raises the questions What does justifiedmean and How does one justify judgments about it                           Justified falls among a class of words that also includeswhat linguists call modals  the most notable ofthese are must should  and can   Despite their apparentdefiniteness the meanings of such words involvean element of indeterminacy that someewhatresembles ambiguity                           Must assets that there are laws and facts thatjointly necessitate some occurrence either alreadycompleted or yet to be brought about without specifyingexactly what those laws and facts are  For examplethe context in which sentence  originallyappears makes it clear that the author intends it to expressa historical necessity already in place based onthe law that time moves forward and on the fact thata lot of time has passed  Although precise figures must remain elusiveaccording to the best current estimates a total of to  million living slaves crossed the AtlanticOcean from the sixteenth through the nineteenthcenturyKolchin Peter American Slavery Hill and Wang                         However the sentence could just as well haveappeared in a government report expressing an admonitionto keep the numbers secret based on thefact that numbers of such magnitude would anger theslaves descendents and on an assumed law to the effectthat sufficient provocation caused people to rebelNeither must itself nor the sentence as a whole providesthe slightest clue as to which of these inter pretationis intended  Only the context makes that clear                           Should means the same as must  except that itleaves room for loopholes that avoid the asserted necessityin new or unusual circumstances  For example and  progvide ways around the necessities  asserts on its reprective historical and admonitoryinterpretations  Although precise figures should remain elusiveunder normal circumstances major new discoveriesof slaveholders journals and artifactswill enable us to compute exact totals  Although precise figures should remain elusiveunder normal circumstances publishing thefigures in the current climate of suspicion willclear the air defuse anger and enable people tomove on                                       Can is related to must in being what logicianscall its dual   Whereas must says there are laws andfacts that necessitate some occurrence can assertsthat whatever laws and facts there are some occurrenceis permitted or possible  One consequence ofthis relation is the fact that though can and must havevery different meanings cannot and must not are synonymousFor example  has can where  hasmust  but the meanings of their respective sentencesare the same  Dr Larssen you cannot let it get you down tothe point where it affects your work  You cannotTurtledove Harry World War Tilting theBalance Ballantine   Dr Larssen you must not let it get you downto the point where it affects your work  Youmust not                        Negating a sentence containing must keep thenecessity claim intact negating only the verb whereasnegating a sentence containing can keep the verb intactnegating only the permission or possibility  Tosay x cannot v is to say x must notv  To say x canv is to deny x must notv                           Justified is in effect a hybrid of must and can Like must  it asserts the existence of laws and factsbut like can it expresses permission rather than necessityTo say that some action is justified is to saythere are laws and facts that permit it whereas can expressespermission for whatever laws and facts thereare  To say that some action is not justified is to saythat the action is prohibited whatever the laws andfacts are            So to murder is to kill in a way that is prohibitedwhatever the laws and facts are  To deny that a killingis murder is to claim there are laws and factsa that permitit  Those who cheered for George Bush insteadof calling him murderer based their judgment onwhat they took to be a law regarding the sanctity ofnational borders and on the fact that Iraqi troops hadviolated such a border by invading a neighboringcountry  Thoses who cheered for Saddam Husseininstead of calling him a murderer based their judgmenton a law regarding the sovereignty of nationalgovernment and on what they took to be the factthat the borders his forces had crossed were imposedby Western colonialists without the consent of the inhabitants            Obviously none of this sheds any light at all onwhich of the sides if either was correct  It does helpto explain how people can talk past each other usingthe same words in the same language expressing thesame meanings but interpreting those meanings inrelation to very different frameworks of concepts beliefsexpectations and values                              Kudirat Abiola  was in her car when she was shotat close range by six gunmen Tuesday morning  She died

hand wrapsan immense corpus of colloquial and formal speechup in the respectable garb of grammatical explicationleaving the reader to have learned elsewhere which ofthe examples should serve as a model when he inviteshis boss to dinner  I take this to be not only sillybut potentially politically pernicious            In her delightful study Theories of Discourse Diane Macdonell describes how after the French revolutionthe bourgeois came to realize that if the lowerorders took seriously the slogan Libert EgalitFraternit  their wealth might fall into the hands ofthe wrong people  The solution to the problem wasstraightforward  Teach everyone French as if it wereLatin  The results were a working class who couldread directions but not compose a wellformed compositionin their complicated native tongue and aneducated class who got to the university used Frenchas they had learned it at their mothers knee naturallynot as they had been taught it in school and madegood use of the grammatical rules they had beentaught by applying them to their study of Latin anicely dead and therefore reasonably systematizablelanguage            The British who didnt go through the dislocationand revivification of a revolution simple allowed thegentry to establish the colloquial norm for those whocounted themselves among the educated and minedthe literature for texts to constitute a canon that wouldbe taught as a stylistic and as a byproduct grammaticalmodel  The result was a respect for properEnglish that is to say the English spoken by propergentlemen  All a bit authoritarian but reasonableThe effectiveness of the policy can be seen by makinga quick analysis of the language spoken by OliverTwist Dickens qua social reformer knew perfectlywell that if Oliver hadnt somehow come to speak theQueens English he wouldnt have made it  Onemight add in passing that the twentiethcentury establishmentarianfeathers ruffled by D H Lawrencewith Lady Chatterleys Lover were less the result ofMellors seducing a member of the aristocracy thanhis not addressing her properly            This latest trend to make use of a vast corpus oflinguistic data as a way to democratize the understandingof language isand I think here you and Iquite agreea gross mistake  Not only does it throwout the concept of good English but it establishesthe norms of language on whats said  This is an expressionfrequently used by my British colleagues andone that in my opinion is as silly as basing a legal systemon whats done  Not long ago when I suggestedfora passage chosen for our entranceexamthat an it that referred back to an unstipulatedtopic of a previous paragraph be changed tothis  I was told that theres no need to be so picky becauseits said  The consequences of this not it have not been such salutary effects as a broadening ofacceptable usage or a loosening of the traditionalschoolmasters authority over what constitutes properEnglish or a diminution of class consciousness  Theresultsperhaps totally unforeseenhave ratherbeen a shift in linguistic authority away from the gentryand Oxbridgians to the media            The consequences of all this are fascinatingWe who are in control of the media and thereforeaware of the context in which unclear English is usedknow whats going on and therefore the meanings ofthe utterances used to describe it while the vulgarto use Berkeleys delightful expression for those witha shaky grasp of vocabulary and syntax who are thereforeill equipped to understand some particular bitof newspeak are led to believe when they fail tofathom whats going on that the failure in comprehensionis entirely their fault            Greenbaum in his Grammar  with its democraticwhats said corpusbased approach to language unwittinglyI am quite sure keeps the really proper useof English in the hands of those who are to the mannerborn while allowing the media moguls to interpretor misinterpret the topics of public concern asthey will and at the same time disallowing the vulgarfrom gaining a firm grasp on the means by which theymight enter the debate  We have here a delightfullyconstructed catch if you dont study your grammaryoure uneducated if you do youve been exposed toa proper education by your kindly school system butwhen you use one of your grammar books dreadfullyimproper constructions as a model you placeyourself in the class of the obviously simplemindedwhose opinions are irrelevant  And please noticewhen we use the word class here we do so not at allin a social senseoh dear me nobut strictly in anintellectual one  If you dont know the difference betweenthe appropriate contexts in which to use two examplesplaced one after the other in your grammarbook its a consequence of your minds incapacity tograsp how things ought to be correctly expressed notthat youve had the misfortune of being born into theworking class  To what extent this is a consciousagenda on the part of the establishment and howmuch it is simply an illconceived educational policy isa matter for further inquiry            Rather than focusing our attention on the establishmentof universally applicable rules of grammar asa way to make a more democratic society we mightbetter develop a more holistic semiotically based curriculumthat points our young in the direction of clearthinking  I take Peirce to be right when he tells usthat meaning and therefore correct usage in thebroadest sense is always inseparable from contextAnd given that fact I would argue that as long as theeducational system teaches dictionary definitions asgiving lexical meaning and grammatically properstructures as carrying grammatically meaning we willhave as we do now the vast bulk of our populationfunctionally illiterate            The subset of semiosis calledperhaps misleadingly languagecomes into being when there is a willto share  Searle would call it an intention  It workswhen those involved share a common experience acommon set of general rules for their communicationgame and a common aim for their dialogue  It happensbest when the experience has the broadest possiblehorizon the rules are supplemented by goodstyle and the aims are the achievement of the bestpossible degree of understanding  To give short shriftto any of these three facets of communication is totear apart the fabric of dialogue            Too much buckpassing usually in the name ofscientific rigor between the experts on language literatureand history has resulted in the sad fact thatclear thought the mortar that serves to create integratedhuman interaction has been quite consistentlyassigned to the other guys bailiwick            School systems teach systems  But that cant bethe end of the matter  The process that Bakhtin callsDialogue is ultimately context based and not systembased  This is why for example the expression Theteacher has it in for me falls through the cracks oflexicon and grammar  The sentence doesnt meanwhat the words mean and if they did why is the verbhave it in for defective  Ive never heard it used inthe first person nor one might add with the Pope assubject  Students would learn ten times more aboutwords and how they are used if instead of being askedto remember what is grammatically or lexically correctthey were asked in class to play roles such asshoe salesmen or lords of the manor and by doing sogot a feel for what is said by such people in such dialoguesnotjust what is said  but what is said in suchby such people dialogues   This kind of contextualsensitivity a sensitivity that is as yet not sufficientlywell understood is far more important than that sortof abstract knowledge of the proper use of languagethat prompts certain of us to shiver at someone elsesstumbling over a shibboleth  Needless to say the ideaof abstract knowledge isnt all that simple  Howmuch of what passes from Knowing grammar is infact remembering what was said at home or by an authorone has read  Are grammatical rules explanationsof what is said by people like us  If they arehow does the learning of them help someone whodoesnt speak like us  Does a child learn to walk byhaving the musculature of the legs explained to herI add in passing a news bite heard between the writingof this paragraph and its mailing a teacher was recentlygiven an award for innovative teaching  Hereceived it because he has his students write letterstaking the part for example of Martin Luther KingJr and explaining his reasons for encouraging civilrightsmarches a context in which repetition mightwell be more frequent than in an essay by BertrandRussell  A correlate to this observation can be foundin the otherwise wise stylistic advice of E B WhiteWhat grade would he have given the eloquent civilrightsleader  And why            I would argue that for survival in the twentyfirstcentury students will need an integrated course inPeircean semeiotics  A course in which an appreciationof ones

to comment on EmanuelStrausss review of Peter Mertvagos ComparativeRussianEnglish Dictionary of Russian Proverbs Sayings XXIII  A couple of observations in thereview whether Strausss or Mertvagos strike me asdubious at best and the translation of an example asmisleading            I do not agree that the relative brevity of manyRussian proverbs stems from the fact that the Russianlanguage has no articles and also resorts idiomaticallyto participial condensation by not using obliqueforms of the verb to be  What about byvshii havingbeen and budushchii  the future participle of theRussian verb for to be  No the form of the Russianverb for to be that is usually but not always omittedis the present tense as sometimes in English Terrificguy that Tom  This omission and the absence of articlesdoes lend a certain pithiness to Russianproverbs  But I think that the apparent brevity whichdepends in part on whether you count words or syllablesis due much more to the heavy inflection ofRussian that compresses meaning in single wordsThe best example of this kind of semantic compressionthat occurs to me is from Latin a language thatin many respects is grammatically similar to RussianRomae romane  which comes to us in English asWhen in Rome do as the Romans do  In Russian Ican squeeze this down to V Rymeporymski   Butthen in English one can come pretty close to boththe Latin meaning and brevity with say In Romeact or be Roman  Running English proverbs andsayings through my mind I seem to find that althoughour language has the resources to be fairly pithy weare not as attracted to pithiness as Russians andRomans            What bothers me more however is the translationof the Russian proverb Chemu Vanya nye nauchilsyatovo Ivan nye vyuchit   Literally leaving outthe tovo as redundant in English this proverb meansWhat Johnnie hasnt learnt John wont learn  Just asin English the nickname Johnnie implies youth sothe Russian nickname Vanya implies boyhoodbutonly implies Uncle Vanya was not youngwhile theformal names JohnIvan imply maturity  By overloadingthe proverb with little and old in Whatlittle Johnnie hasnt learnt old John will not learnthe translator here a traditore indeed has killed theclever implication inherent in the play on names perhapsin a fumbled attempt to bear out his claim thatRussian proverbs are relatively brief            Maybe I am nitpicking though  The statementthat Generally speaking the Russians make greateruse of proverbs than the Americans or the British isdoubtless true with the consequence that the carefulattention given Mertvagos compilation is quite justified            As for me I hope that my nitpicking through thearticles you publish in VERBATIM demonstrates theconsideration I think due these articles rather thanenvy and pedantry                              I found the following article by my grandfatherProfessor Walter W Skeat among some of his papersThe justification for reprinting it would be thatalthough I find his explanation totally convincing it isnot to be found either in the original edition of theOED under the word dear  to which he refers or inthe revised edition published in                                              OH  DEAR                        It must have struck many that the very common phraseOh dear is after all a very senseless expression  When wecome to try to read sense into it some might think that itmay be contracted from some longer expression such asOh dear me  But this is not in accordance with the evidenceThe earliest known example of Dear me is noolder than  whilst Oh dear occurs as early as and is the earliest known phrase in which dear occurs at all            Dr Murray remarks in Volume IV of the New EnglishDictionary   sv dear that several phrases occursuch as dear save us in  dear knows in  dearhelp you in  and the like which suggest that dearrepresents or implies a fuller dear Lord  thus dear knowsis equivalent to the Lord knows and so on  But he addsvery justly that a derivation from Ital  Dio  God restingupon the modern English pronunciation of dear  finds nosupport in the history of the word            I wish to draw attention to two ascertained facts  Thefirst is that the particular phrase Oh dear  is the earliest ofthe set as has been already remarked and secondly thatthere is no trace whatever even in dialects of a fuller formlike dear Lord  If we are to go by the evidence we mustrecognise that the interpretation of dear by dear Lord oreven by Lord at all is due to the influence of popular etymologywhich could make nothing of dear when it stoodalone            I think it is equally clear that we must dismiss allthoughts of connecting its origin with the Italian Dio             I will now go a step further and assert that there is noevidence whatever for connecting it with the adjective dearat all  It makes no sense as we may see by a little thoughtFor dear means beloved affectionate precious and thelike but the exclamation Oh dear  is one that denotessomething very different something that is lamentable orcalamitous and very far from being pleasant  Thus in Congreve makes one of his characters sayOh dearyou make me blush  In  we findOh dear oh dearhow melancholy has been to me this last week  And againOh dear  I shall die  And in Goldsmiths She Stoops toConquer  Miss Hardcastle saysDear me  Dear me  Imsure theres nothing in my behaviour to put me on a levelwith one of that stamp            If we will only for a moment consider this probabilityviz that there is no good reason for associating this interjectionalphrase with a wellknown adjective this will leaveus free to look around us and see whether any other sourceis possible            And if we do this we have not to look far  The phrasefor instance makes no good sense in English and this affordsa presumption that it was borrowed from abroadAnd whenever we consider the possibility of borrowing atthe end of the seventeenth century our first thoughts turnas a matter of course to France  Let us see what Frenchwill do for us            I now venture to quote some remarkable words fromCotgraves wellknown Dictionary and from the Old FrenchDictionary by Godefroy            Cotgrave has De  an interjection as D ouy dethe circumflex over the a is not mine but Cotgraves yestruly verily without doubt also a tearme of expostulationnote this as de qui vous mouvoit   why or good Godwhat reason had you  or what a Gods name moved you            It should particularly be remarked that the sense coincidesexactly with that of the English phrase  We can translatethis literally by sayingDear dear who put you up toit  It is a note of expostulation as Cotgrave truly says andit indicates despair rather than hope            Godefroy has Dea dia dya da  a sort of exclamationof astonishment  His examples show that it was sometimespreceded by the interjection he illegible character as Hdia or H dea  which is suggestive of the English phraseIt was usually employed as in English to imply lamentationor disaster as eg H dea quand je fus n quelle mauditteestoille presida dessus moy ie  Oh dear what an evil starpresided over my birth   Dea quel desastre est ce quiregne en France ie Dear what a disaster prevails inFrance  It served also as Cotgrave notes to enforce an affirmationas in  Ouy dea  dis je Yes forsooth say I            It is worth while trying to guess whence this expressioncame  We notice that Cotgrave writes it with a circumflexover the a  as if it were a contracted form  It is remarkablethat the chief word which in Old French began with dea ordia  is the too common word deable or diable  the use ofwhich in expressions of lamentation is so prevalent both inFrench and English  It really seems as if the true sense ofOh dear were Oh the devil  The clipping of swearwordsis a common phenomenon  If this be so the exclamationDear knows may have originated in a phrase whichmeant the devil knows  But as this interpretation was notat all obvious or was forgotten the familiarity of manyEnglishmen with the Span  Dios and the Ital  Dio may reallyhave suggested a new interpretation in the eighteenthcentury indeed even Cotgrave seems to have had such anotion  For the earliest example of Dear save us is noearlier than  whilst on the other hand the use of deaoccurs in Rabelais and Godefroy in his supplement quotesthe phrase  Dya dya  houoih hau dia ie  Dear dearhouoih Oh dear from a book dated             This OF dea  later dia  seems to be modern F da The OF disva diva ie come along is clearly quite adifferent word            Finally we may notice that the double form dea dia will suit either the old or the modern pronunciation of theEnglish dear  so that phonetic requirements are fulfilledeither way                               The Modern Language Quarterly  date unknown  or                              In OBITER DICTA XXIII

Contradiction in Terms            Given that the English language is the worldsprincipal form of communication we can perhaps beforgiven for tripping ourselves up with it occasionallyWe are particularly good at contradicting ourselvesso good in fact we do it daily assuming that otherpeople dont beat us to it            I can recall the time I bought some terracottaducks containing scented candles which I was instructedto place on a dining table during a meal or inany room I wished  The scent would repel all bitinginsects in the area  When the ducks arrived a footnoteon the instructions informed me they were for outdooruse only            Newspapers are extremely good at bringing peoplescontradictions to a wide audience  Consider thememorable statement made by the head

who were determined to improve thepoor standard of spelling on the Isle of White             So contradictions are rife  And I am unanimousin that                              The Internet is quickly
