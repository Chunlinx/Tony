                                 The Cockroaches of Cyberspace                        Dear Joe            How nice that you are sitting in an idyllic New England town away from thedeadening lighting of a typical office One of my favorite writers theWashington Posts Henry Allen noted once that modern offices weredifferent in the ways that make no difference and the same in the ways thatdo As I sit here under fluorescent lights in the Wall Street JournalsSan Francisco bureauno view even of the bayI am wishing for any Amtraktrain            I did indeed write my last posting late at night but remember I am threehours behind you So  am is pretty respectable for a workaholic Beforeyou decry the faster lifestyle of us all I will add that I have been a nightowl since I was a wee lass and this is nothing different On the topic of theseblurred times I just read an interesting review of James Gleicks new bookFaster  in New York magazine The review was not a good one butI was heartened to hear that the authoran early Web pundit andentrepreneurwas arguing that humans have liked speed since the beginning oftime I often wonder if I can keep up the pace I have set for my life but Ihave to admit I kind of like it            Which is probably why I am such an optimist about this Internet phenom andyou are more circumspect I caught the bug early from covering the early daysof AOL for the Washington Post and it has never left me I wish I couldtell you the feeling I got when I first met with the AOL team in theirlessthanimpressive offices behind a car dealership in Vienna Virginia Thefeeling of speed and change and something different was palpable So was thefeeling of imminent crisis of being on the edge of disaster constantly Thiswas a group of people that had been born into nearbankruptcy and lived itsformative years in a nearconstant state of chaos            Thats why I often discount all the stories that predict AOLs downfall Ithas almost been comical at times but they have endured everything from lack offunding to questionable accounting to technological glitches to attacks fromsome of the biggest companies out there All of these challenges it was widelypredicted each time were going to surely put AOL out of business Theyrestill standing as far as I can tell            So the free access trend seems to me to be another assault at the gates ofSteve Case that will probably not kill them In fact I would go as far as tosay that Steve will take the problem and turn it into an advantage I thinkalthough subscriber fees now represent the lions share of revenues for AOLthat they will eventually make the service free and make money off the giantaudience via advertising and commerce fees I remember a long time ago thatSteve said this would happen and I think the only question is if the companycan finesse a soft landing that Netscape did not When you note that AOL willnot give away free what it used to charge for I would point out that it usedto make a lot of money from hourly charges some users spent hundreds ofdollars on the service a month and it managed to wean itself away from thatmodel quickly            One executive at AOL once told me that being a fast follower is the bestposition to be in and that AOL tends to move to whatever trend seems to betaking over They moved from an Apple to Windows audience in their early dayswithout a blink they moved from a gated service to one where the Web wasnearly coopted into AOL they went from hourly to unlimited without a lookbackthis is a company that is not tethered to anything except that whichworks So if free Internet access is the plat du jour you can be sure thebrainiacs at AOL are noodling this one right now I know of few other companiesthat can change as quickly and it has always been AOLs greatest strength            Like Andy Serweralso an old friend from graduate school where he alsodated my roommateI think free Internet access makes a lot of sense As yousurely know from our stellar stories in the WSJ  Microsoft has beenmaking a lot of noises in this direction of late and those strategies areclearly aimed at AOL But in the matchup between AOL and Microsoftat leastin the online spacethe giant from Redmond has proved time and again to be thedecidedly weaker player            And this brings me to your last query the nature of the AOL execs In mybook I dubbed the executives theremost of whom are the same ones from thecompanys earliest daysthe cockroaches of cyberspace I think that says alot This is a resilient and deeply cynical team who has been around the blockmore times than I can count They are like a giant dysfunctional family thatlooks like it is going to blow apart at any momentthis always tricksrivalswho then go into the back room and come out as one solid force            That is due in large part to the personality of Steve Case who is indeeda smart and clever guy and someone I would not often bet against This is a manwho was told on a daily basis that he was an idiot and he kept going anywayHis hard shell in fact was one of the problems I had when writing my bookHow do you make a main character of a cipher I think the most important thingyou can say about Steve is that he does not care what anyone thinks of him            Which brings us to the colorful David Colburn He is simply AOLs bad boyand it has worked thus far for them He apparently often tells the joke that hehad better make his money at AOL because after he leaves no one will everhire him because he has been so obnoxious for so long You might imagine Iloved covering him            CheersKara
