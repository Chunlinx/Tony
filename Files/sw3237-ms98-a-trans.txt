                okay so you said that you live in Coppell   umhum   so what is your house like   its a two bedroom two bath duplex  brick   oh well thats neat uhhuh is it one that youre renting or buying oh   and uh no we own it yeah well our side   uhhuh uhhuh   yeah yeah well thats kind of neat that you can even though its a duplex you can still buy thats good do you have any children   uhhuh yeah no huhuh do you   yes i have two children and our home is really too small for us right now   umhum ours is too we outgrew it when we moved in   yeah we moved from an apartment that was really small and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old   uhhuh uhhuh   and we moved into this house in Garland its in one of the older areas of town  and one thing i really like is it has big trees everywhere and   uhhuh umhum   you know lots of shade and squirrels and birds and real pretty but the the house is real small it has less than a thousand square feet   um yeah oh wow   yeah its real little   yall are cramped   yeah and now i have a daughter now my the one that was five months old is seven years old and the one and i have another one thats three and a half and i have all these clothes and  toys and stuff that were just trying to find places to put   uhhuh uhhuh wow uhhuh how many bedrooms is it   well they advertised it as a three bedroom house because it has a a built on addition room you know but the room thats built on doesnt have a closet   uhhuh uhhuh ah   so um the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and  you know its kind of a catchall room   umhum uhhuh     but it sure is nice to have it   yeah   when the kids come over to play they all go out there to play with the Barbies and that kind of stuff so   uhhuh how fun   yeah that works out good  and im thankful i have two girls because theyre in bunk beds and so you know they can share a room and uh make for more space that way   uhhuh uhhuh and how olds the youngest   shes three and a half yeah   umhum   so um and right now we have their clothes on uh like double racks you know in the closet we made a higher and a lower and it works out fine but theyre just about to get too tall  where the dresses are beginning to drag you know and   uhhuh umhum   umhum   uh were going to have to figure out a new idea but were were kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home and  uh hoping to be able to do that within a year or so so that would be nice   yeah yeah thats what wed like to do   yeah is Coppell a nice area to live   oh its wonderful place to live and they i dont have any kids so i dont really know but they say that we have wonderful schools   well i think ive heard a lot uh about Coppell schools that theyre real good and thats neat  do you  do you hope to have children or are you not planning on having any or ah i see  well do you have any pets   umhum umhum umhum um nah i dont think so nah  oh of course those are my kids i have two dogs   uh yeah  ah so do they stay inside or ah well thats neat   yeah theyre inside dogs theyre my babies   yeah  well what are the colors in your house   uh um kind of a mauve and gray   oh i bet thats pretty   umhum and then the kitchens kind of a a country pink and country blue and   uhhuh   its all done in cows im a cow nut   oh well thats neat i like cows too     uhhuh   yeah well our house was redone uh our house is very old also its like thirty seven years old yeah and it was redone before we moved in which im   so uhhuh wow   thankful for that but the it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in you know everything is like   yeah yeah   the carpets kind of a tan and brown and has um   umhum   paneling in the living room and lots of lots of tans and lots of browns but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that you know so   umhum oh yeah yeah   uh thats worked out good in the in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan um wallpaper and had done it up with blues so thats nice thats   uhhuh oh sounds pretty   yeah yeah weve enjoyed living here its its close to my uh oldest daughters school and that makes it really handy too     oh umhum umhum   and she really likes her school so and were so close to shopping and just   well good thats an important factor there   yeah what uh how about in Coppell ive always imagined it kind of out away from everything   well you know now we have that new mall in Lewisville and thats just like a mile or two from our house   oh really oh well thats nice   but when we first moved to Coppell its what six years ago we didnt even have a grocery store   oh wow   and now we have four and Coppells not really big enough to support four four grocery stores   oh yeah yeah but it does sound like its definitely growing   so oh much very much in fact its about the size now i moved down here from Chicago what twenty three years ago and to Lewisville   yeah oh uhhuh uhhuh   and Coppells now about the size that Lewisville was when when i moved down here   oh i see  well when we first moved here we moved here from Lubbock and we almost moved to Lewisville that was our second choice yeah behind Garland we  at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home     uhhuh oh really
