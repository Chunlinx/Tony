        do you have any pets   yeah i have five cats two dogs a snake and a bunny   holy Nellie   thats enough to keep anybody busy with pets how about you   i oh i guess we have one miniature Dachshund   um i think im envious   oh i dont think i could cope with that many how do how do you uh avoid having your house smell   well my cats are indoor outdoor cats and i dont know i hadnt really thought about it  one thing is to keep everything clean i mean you have to keep cages like for the rabbit you have to keep it cleaned and you have to keep litter boxes scooped     umhum   but most of my cats go outside so theres not that much there i only have one who stays inside   um  do you let your rabbit run around loose   oh no its in a cage lot of people do but ive never been able to quite handle that with a rabbit   okay i i knew somebody who said they were easy to uh litter box train but she had trouble with it chewing on wood   no ive never ive never even tried it to be honest with you       its really my daughters rabbit   oh how what kind of a dog do you have   um i have i have one thats kind of a Golden Retriever mutt that means a mix  and then my daughter just got an American Eskimo   umhum uh do they get along   and oh yeah oh yeah all my cats and my dogs and even the rabbit and the dogs and the cats everybody in my house gets along except the snake he kind of keeps to himself   see we our dog hates every other animal  and our we have a couple children that are are grown and on their own and every once in a while they will come home for a visit with an animal   right   and our our dog just about has a stroke   well hes probably older and hes used to being the only dog and its hard for him just like people its hard for them to give up their   well   their place as the only one and kind of share the attention but almost all of my animals are used to not being the only one in the house and so theyre kind of used to being part of a group   umhum well we we kind of joke that that our our dogs about eight years old and but one son was between jobs for a couple of weeks and was here with a Golden Retriever   uhhuh   and uh when he left you know we swear the our dogs muzzle turned white and then uh our our other son is in the Navy and was being relocated to go to school down at College Station so he was here for a couple days in between waiting for his household goods and stuff and with a beagle puppy and we swear after she left the dog got gray on the front two feet you know   maybe hes just getting old   i dont know but it seems a a a visit from uh one of his cousins uh tends to uh really really affect how he is   turns him gray  one of the things they mentioned was why do you think people have pets   well i think theyre i think theyre good company i have been trying for years to convince my mother who lives alone that she would like a a dog she loves it when she comes here and our dog sits on her lap you know and shell just sit there and pet him and pet him and ill say you need an animal he would   i think so too i really think that they are wonderful therapy theyre theyre just companionship im   and yes umhum   obviously im a im a real believer in them   well and i i think theyre good for kids in that they can teach the kids responsibility you know if if you if you have a a kid who wants an animal badly enough and agrees to take care of it i mean its a responsibility cleaning up after it and   yes i think so too   um you feeding it making sure it has water and uh you know just just all that kind of stuff thats thats good also uh   feeding it thats right   but we just have a we we in the past weve had Great Danes   ooh thats a big dog   which were probably the best pets weve ever had   really   yeah oh they were well the first one we had was wonderful she just finally died of old age but she was just so the the greatest house pet and uh we were asked when she was probably about ten years old when our our youngest one was born and she would totally ignore this baby i mean the dog could be laying there sleeping and somebody could carry this child into the room and the dog would just kind of sniff and walk walk out of the room  and would have absolutely nothing to do with the baby until uh she got old enough to sit in the high chair and throw food over   oh yeah   yet and then all of a sudden the dog decided she was okay but yeah but then  my husband decided it would might be nice to have a lap dog for a change   um heres a source yeah   now he just really likes having a dog that curls up in his lap when he watches TV and sits in his recliner and falls asleep     sure thats neat thats neat   uh what what
