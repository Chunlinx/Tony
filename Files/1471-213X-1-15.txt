                    Background        Following a classic epithelialmesenchymal interaction        developmental program the mouse neonatal submandibular        salivary gland SMG is comprised of large and small ducts        which terminate in lumencontaining presumptive acini that        express embryonic mucin            Progressive        prenatal morphogenesis begins as a solid outgrowth from the        oral epithelium around E and is best conceptualized in        stages             Initial Bud Pseudoglandular        Canalicular and         Terminal Bud Epithelial cell        proliferation is found in all stages even after        welldefined lumen formation in the         Terminal Bud Stage Epithelial cell        apoptosis begins with the onset of lumen formation in the         Canalicular Stage        The proper balance between SMG epithelial cell        proliferation quiescence and apoptosis is mediated by the        appearance of transcription factors growth factors        cytokines caspases etc at specific times and places                These SMG cellular and extracellular        components may be visualized as a         Connections Map which details the        functional relationships within and between pathways Fig                Complex networks of biological signaling pathways Fig         emerge from the interconnections of simple pathways        under local control       As such these cellular        pathways are more analogous to the mostly redundant        overlapping neural network of the brain than to traffic        grids of intersecting streets and interacting vehicles        There are two general not mutually exclusive classes of        interconnections  junctions which serve as signal        integrators and  nodes which split the signal and route        them to multiple outputs     Understanding the        nonlinear dynamics of these interconnections is intrinsic        to understanding the regulation of SMG morphogenesis This        requires the integration of transcriptomic proteomic        phenomic and bioinformatic approaches not least because        development in its most basic sense is genes plus context                      With the present experiments we sought a glimpse of the        extraordinarily complex behaviors of a focused signaling        network Fig  To this end we studied the molecular        patterns and phenotypic outcomes of a nodal short        circuit ie the inhibition of NFB activation and        translocation to the nucleus to bind to NFB response        genes In most cell types the NFB pp heterodimer is        maintained as an inactive form in the cytoplasm bound to        the inhibitory protein IB Exposure of cells to stimuli of        NFB induces the rapid phosphorylation and subsequent        degradation of IB proteins Released NFB dimers then        translocate to the nucleus bind to its cognate DNA        elements and induce the expression of target genes              Activated nuclear translocated NFB transcription        factor has been documented in the mouse embryo from the        cell stage onward      Activated NFB        translocation into the nucleus directly or indirectly        effects the transcriptional control of over  target        genes     NFB enhances cell proliferation by        stimulating the expression of cytokines such as TNF IL        IL IL and IL among others      NFB        inhibits apoptosis by inducing TRAF and clAP expression        which suppresses Caspase  activation     and by        inhibition of p transactivation             We interrupted the NFB signal in embryonic SMG        explants using the cellpermeable peptide SN a potent        inhibitor of NFB nuclear translocation                   SNmediated inhibition of NFB nuclear        translocation in SMG explants results in extensive        apoptosis and a very substantial decline in cell        proliferation Functional genomic analyses demonstrate that        inhibition of NFB signaling is associated with the        altered expression of numerous components of the genetic        network of related signaling pathways This modified        expression of genes and proteins associated with the        inhibition of the cell cycle and the induction of        apoptosis as well as the increased activation of        proapoptotic and compensatory antiapoptotic pathways        provides a snapshot of the broad primary and secondary        effects of NFB signaling during SMG development                    Results and discussion                  NFB inhibition and SMG phenotype          E SMG primordia were cultured for  days in the          presence or absence of the cellpermeable peptide SN a          potent inhibitor of NFB nuclear translocation                SN is composed of a nuclear localization          sequence NLS for NFB p linked to a cellpermeable          carrier       SN blocks the intracellular          recognition mechanism for the NLS on NFB thus          inhibiting NFBs translocation through the nuclear          pore After  days in culture SNtreated explants          exhibit a substantial decrease in gland size and          branching morphogenesis compared to controls compare          Fig Ato B These day SNtreated explants          demonstrate a highly significant  decline t              p   in cell          proliferation Fig A B Fig A and a significant          fold increase t              p   in apoptosis          Fig C D Fig B This substantial increase in          apoptosis is associated with a highly significant           fold increase t              p   in           activated phosphorylated p          Fig  This result is not surprising given that NFB          inactivates p              To demonstrate that this SN phenotype is consequent          to SNmediated inhibition of NFB nuclear          translocation and not the nonspecific effect of exogenous          peptide we compared E   SMG phenotypes in explants          cultured in control media  gml SN peptide or           gml mutant SN mSN peptide As expected we found          a marked difference between control and SNtreated SMGs          but none between control and mutant peptidetreated          explants data not shown In addition since TNFTNFR          signaling has been shown to induce embryonic SMG cell          proliferation and inhibit apoptosis           in vitro    and TNFTNFR          signal transduction primarily signals by induction of          NFB nuclear translocation     we postulated that          TNF supplementation should have no inductive effect on          SNtreated SMGs Thus we cultured E control          SNtreated and mSNtreated explants in the presence          of TNF rTNF  Uml supplementation for  or more          days In this set of experiments we extended the culture          period to provide sufficient time to allow for possible          TNFmediated recovery TNF supplementation induced NFB          p and p translocation Fig A a marked increase          in explant size and a notable increase in cell          proliferation not shown similar results were seen in          TNF mSNtreated explants not shown By contrast          NFB redistribution was not found in explants cultured          in TNF  SN Fig B rather NFB was absent from          epithelial cell nuclei and exhibited a very weak diffuse          cytoplasmic distribution Moreover TNF supplementation          was unable to rescue the abnormal SN phenotype          Finally the identical response of control and          mSNtreated SMG explants to TNF supplementation          provides further evidence that this mutant peptide had no          effect on NFB activation                          Transcriptomic analysis          To investigate transcriptional responses to NFB          inhibition we analyzed control and SNtreated E            SMG explants using cDNA arrays Of the  transcripts          assayed on these arrays including transcription factors          cell cycle regulators growth factors etc            demonstrated a fold or greater increase or decrease          in expression with SNinduced NFB inhibition Fig           Of these we focused our attention on those signal          transduction cell cycle and apoptosis transcripts          related to the           Connections Map Fig  With          inhibition of NFB translocation into the nucleus            Connections Map transcripts exhibit          altered expression Table  We used Probabilistic          Neural Network PNN analyses to determine which          transcript changes best discriminate control from          SNtreated explants These analyses identified those          transcripts with significant changes which are relatively          more important in defining the SMG phenotype regardless          of the direction up or down of change          Among the cell cycle transcripts with altered          expression Fig A PNN analysis shows that the           increased expression of cyclin D          p and Cdca as well as           decreased expression of PCNA best          discriminate control from SNtreated explants Cyclin          D Cdca and PCNA promote cell division p inhibits          cell division Fig  The significant decline in PCNA          transcript Table  is consistent with the highly          significant p   decline in PCNAdefined cell          proliferation Fig A          Among apoptosis transcripts with altered expression          Fig B PNN analysis demonstrates that downregulated          Caspase  transcript almost alone best discriminates          control from SNtreated explants Caspase  activates          Caspase  and appears to promote production of the          cytokine IL which upregulates the transcription of          both Caspases  and  additionally potentiating          apoptosis      Thus           this regulatory mechanism of          caspase gene expression would likely be diminished in          SNtreated explants were they allowed to develop          further in culture Contemporaneous proteome analysis          provides a very different profile see Table and text          below          Although many RasRaf growth factor pathway          transcripts were upregulated Table  as a group they          were poor predictors of SMG phenotype control v          SNtreated PNN analysis Fig A shows that only          IGF IGFR and IGFBP are best at discriminating          control from SNtreated explants          TGF and TGF show a fold increase Table           which is not unexpected given that TGF and NFB are          found to be inversely proportional to one another              Nevertheless among the TGF family transcripts and          others related to their expression and signal          transduction Fig B BMP BMPb BMPa Smad and GR          best discriminate control from SNtreated explants          BMPs inhibit cell proliferation via downstream Smad          proteins whereas Smad inhibits TGF and activin          signaling Fig  This inhibition of TGFactivin          signaling is modulated through NFBdependent inhibition          of Smad     In addition there is a negative          feedback between NFB and Smad activated NFB          inhibits Smad promotor activity    whereas Smad          inhibits NFB activation and potentiates apoptosis              Curiously the           relative importance of increased          Smad expression is  times greater than that of Smad                    vis defining the NFBinhibited          explants It is likely that in the absence of NFBs          negative regulation Smad signaling is upregulated          thereby sensitizing cells to apoptosis Finally the          nearly fold decrease in glucocorticoid receptor GR is          also of high relative importance in defining the          SNtreated phenotype Table  Glucocorticoids CORT          function through the GR to both activate specific gene          expression as well as transrepress NFB     Since          GR confers this latter effect by associating through          proteinprotein interactions with NFB bound at B          response elements         it is important to          also evaluate changes in GR protein levels see          below          Further we utilized PNN analysis to determine the          iterated composite relative importance among           Connections Map Fig           transcripts which have altered expression as a          consequence of inhibition of NFB translocation into the          nucleus Fig  That is we then subjected those          transcripts with altered expression in each group cell          cycle apoptosis RasRaf TGF family previously shown          in Figures and  to be relatively important in defining          the SN SMG phenotype to further PNN analysis This          transciptomic analysis is a timebound snapshot in          which gene expression is indicative of possible future          protein expression It is instructive that of the            Connections Map transcripts with          altered expression Table   genes of diverse pathways          but overlapping function best discriminate control from          SNtreated explants PCNA GR BMP BMPb The          declining PCNA and GR reflect the sharp decline in cell          proliferation and branching the increasing BMP and          BMPb similarly reflects inhibition of cell proliferation          Fig                           Proteomic analysis          Our cDNA array analysis provides a           good first approximation of           likely protein differences          However one cannot extrapolate from mRNA abundance to          relevant protein levels     A recent study by          Aebersole and coworkers    analyzing yeast protein          and mRNA abundance clearly showed that mRNA transcript          levels are           poor predictors of protein          expression They demonstrate that some genes with          comparable mRNA levels exhibited a fold difference in          their protein expression while mRNA levels of comparable          protein expression varied as much as fold          Thus we next analyzed SNtreated and control E            SMG explants using D Western Multiprotein Arrays to          determine protein differences This technique allows for          the densitometric analysis of about  signal          transduction and other proteins simultaneously in each          independent sample Fig  As shown in Table  we          find  proteins which have both a fold or greater          change with NFB inhibition           and are specifically related to the                    Connections Map Fig  They          include signal transduction cell cycle and apoptosis          proteins that are either directly or indirectly          downstream from activation of the TNF IL EGF IGF          and FGF signaling pathways The significant decline in          PCNA protein Table  is consistent with the significant          decline in PCNA transcript Table  and PCNAdefined          cell proliferation Fig A          PNN analysis shows that among cell cycle proteins with          altered expression Fig A the increased expression          of Chk Chk and EF best discriminates control from          SNtreated explants Of particular interest is EF          Among the five known mammalian EFs the ability to          induce apoptosis is unique to EF              Overexpression of EF in several cell lines results in G                     arrest as well as apoptosis via          pdependent and pindependent pathways                The presence of a dysplastic SMG phenotype in           Ef mice indicates that EF          plays an important role during SMG development              Moreover EF overexpression in human salivary gland          HSG cells diverted these cells into an apoptotic          pathway              Among apoptosis proteins with altered expression Fig          B PNN analysis demonstrates that increased expression          of FAF and Caspase  best discriminates control from          SNtreated explants Caspase  is activated by active          Caspase  and in turn cleaves lamin resulting in nuclear          membrane fragmentation     FAF interacts with the          cytoplasmic domain of the Fas receptor to potentiate          Fasmediated apoptosis      Thus the upregulated          cell cycle inhibitors and apoptotic proteins clearly          favor cell cycle arrest and death          Among signal transduction proteins with altered          expression Fig C PNN analysis shows that members of          all three growth factor pathways RasRaf JAKSTAT JNK          have high relative importance in discriminating control          from SNtreated explants Of particular note are cRaf          ERK and JAK Raf plays a key role in the Ras signaling          pathway Fig  That ERK is of very high relative          importance is consistent with the observation that the          MAPKERK overrides apoptotic signaling from Fas TNF and          TRAIL receptors     It appears that effectors apart          from the MAPKERK pathway may also mediate the          antiapoptotic function of cRaf a Further both the          SHPRas and JAKSTAT pathways are activated by          ILRgp signaling Fig           Moreover it is especially noteworthy that the nearly          fold           decline of glucocorticoid receptor          GR Table  is also of very high relative importance          in defining SMGs deprived of NFB nuclear translocation          As noted above CORTGR binding both activates specific          gene expression and transrepresses NFB     To          repress NFB the GR associates through proteinprotein          interactions with NFB bound at B response elements                 The precise relationship between          decreased NFBmediated transcription and a decreased GR          protein expression is unclear          Nevertheless CORTGR function is important to          embryonic SMG morphogenesis     Radioimmunoassays          first detect SMG CORT in amounts  pggland on E          Western analysis first detects SMG GR on E           fmolgland By E SMG CORT has increased more than          fold and SMG GR has increased nearly fold The SMG          GR is functional as defined by its ability to bind a DNA          response element GRE Increasing CORTGR function           in vivo is associated with a          significant decline in TGF expression and a significant          increase in cell division SMG primordia cultured under          serumless chemically defined conditions and deprived of          CORT exhibit a dramatic decline of SMG branching          morphogenesis It is reasonable then to assume that the          high relative importance of diminished GR protein          expression to the phenotype of SNtreated SMGs is          directly related to the significant p            decline in cell proliferation and branching Fig A B          Fig A          The iterated composite relative importance of all           Connections Map proteins with          altered expression as a consequence of NFB inhibition          was then determined Fig  This proteomic analysis is          a timebased snapshot of proteins assumed to be          associated with physiologic function at the moment of SMG          harvesting Viewing the most defining proteins with          altered expression it is clearly reflective of increased          apoptosis increased Chk Caspase  EF decreased          cell proliferation and branching decreased GR and          interestingly increased expression of diverse signal          transduction pathways RasRafERK JNK to compensate          for the proapoptotic signal                          Analysis of activated pathway components          We then focused our attention on two particularly          important pathways relative to cell proliferation and          apoptosis ERK  and Caspase  Downstream of           activated ERK  is an          upregulation of cell proliferation proteins and          potentially enhanced cell division as well as a          protective effect over apoptotic signaling via suppressed          activation of caspase effectors Downstream of           activated Caspase  are the          sequellae of apoptosis including PARP cleavage and          inhibition of DNA repair DNA fragmentation and nuclear          membrane fragmentation The increase or decrease in          expression of the components of any signaling pathway is          not necessarily probative of pathway activity Rather it          is the change in the level of activated protein that is           physiologically important Thus we          determined if SN treatment was associated with          activation of the ERK and Caspase  pathways using          E   control and SNtreated explants D Western          blot analysis and antibodies specific to           activated phosphorylatedcleaved          proteins Specifically we evaluated the levels of          activated cRaf ERK Caspase  and PARP using          antibodies which identify only the phosphorylated or          cleaved proteins and do not cross react with the inactive          protein We found a significant increase p   in                    activated ERK Caspase  and          PARP in SNtreated explants Fig  no change was          seen in           activated cRaf levels between          control and SNtreated explants The greater than          fold increase in Caspase  activation is associated          with a fold increase in PARP cleavage Fig  and a          fold increase in apoptosis Fig B Since Caspase           is nodal to EF via p FAF via FasCaspase  and          Caspase         our observation of increased           activated Caspase  is consistent          with the increased levels of EF FAF and Caspase           proteins Table  Regarding the ERK pathway we          found a greater than fold increase of activated ERK in          SNtreated glands Fig  associated with a fold          increase in total ERK protein Table  This increased          activity of proapoptotic caspasePARP and compensatory          antiapoptotic ERK pathways is consistent with the          dramatic cell death seen in SNtreated SMGs          Paradoxically increased ERK activation is seen despite          a fold decrease in total ERK protein Table  and          increased ERK  activation is associated with virtually          no change in the antecedent activation of cRaf The          latter is consistent with the demonstration that cRaf          function is not mediated by the MAPKERK cascade              Moreover although we find an increase in total Raf          protein Table  no increase in activated cRaf is          found we also see a fold increase in activated Caspase           but no change in total Caspase  protein These results          clearly illustrate that changes in           total protein level are not always          indicative of altered protein           activity           Finally it should be noted that a recent study using          cell lines raised the possibility that SNs action is          not specific to NFB      SN is composed of the          NLS for NFB p and was believed to specifically block          NFB pp nuclear translocation by binding the NLS          receptor complex and preventing transport through the          nuclear pore       However Torgerson and          coworkers    have shown that SN treatment inhibited          nuclear transport of transcription factors NFAT AP          STAT and NFB at a high dose of  gml in Junkrat          cells However others have shown that lower doses            gml of SN specifically inhibited NFB nuclear          translocation in human peripheral blood lymphocytes and          murine T cells      These reported differences are          likely due to dosedependent or cellspecific differences          in the effect of SN     Given that  embryonic          SMGs were cultured in the presence of  gml SN           immunodetectable NFB was absent from SMG epithelia          nuclei in TNF  SNtreated explants and  one cannot          extrapolate observations in Jurkat cells to those in          primary cells    or organ cultures it is most          probable that our observed interruption of SMG          development is proximately due exclusively to the          inhibition of NFB nuclear translocation Indeed for          low doses of SN there is no evidence in the literature          to the contrary Nonetheless we do recognize that          absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of          absence                            Conclusions        Our results indicate that NFBmediated transcription        is directly or indirectly critical to embryonic SMG        developmental homeostasis We demonstrate the interplay        between gene expression protein expression protein        activity and morphology in response to NFB inhibition        Geneprotein differences between control and        NFBinhibited phenotypes are not linearly causal of SMG        dysplasia In fact these differences are discovered        correlations between network components and an emerging SMG        phenotype a glimpse of nonlinear organogenesis                   Considering the outcome of this study relative to the         Connections Map Fig  it is        apparent that NFB nuclear translocation is functionally        integral to a genetic network with broadly related rather        than independent components It may be said to represent        the collective dynamics of a smallworld network such        that the average number of factors in the shortest chain        connecting any two factors is small     Such dynamical        systems with smallworld coupling display enhanced        signalpropagation speed and synchronizability Thus if        one focuses on the superimposition of the various layers of        information namely morphology gene expression protein        expression and protein activity Figs                    one can visualize a coordinated        multidimensional response to inhibited NFB nuclear        translocation This visualization however is necessarily        impressionistic even though our assays have some precision        This is so because we cannot extrapolate from transcriptome        to proteome to activated proteins with any accuracy in the        absence of actual steadystate measures         and because in these experiments time        is necessarily crosssectional not longitudinal        Nevertheless relative to understanding a complex genetic        network and organogenesis our results demonstrate the        importance of contemporaneously evaluating the gene        protein         and activated protein expression of        multiple components from multiple pathways within broad        functional categories Understanding the signal dynamics of        these pathways will require expanded models that encompass        more aspects of regulation eg     Still we will        always be limited by the fact that phenotypes are complex        emergent phenomena                        Materials and Methods

Expression Arrays were used to analyze each sample          These arrays include  mouse cDNAs  housekeeping          control cDNAs and negative controls immobilized on a          nylon membrane wwwclontechcom Briefly total RNA was          isolated and cDNA probes were synthesized using the Atlas          Pure Total RNA Labeling System and P The labeled cDNA          probes were hybridized to the Atlas Array using          ExpressHyb Solution Hybridization signals were revealed          by phosphorimaging and quantitated using the Clontech          Atlas Image  software package which allows for          unbiased normalization of transcript abundance to overall          signal We generated pseudocolored images indicating up          and down gene regulation The probe set intensity          average difference is proportional to the abundance of          the specific mRNA it represents and was calculated by          comparing hybridization signal of the control          oligonucleotide to that of the treated Total signal          intensity of different probes was scaled to the same          value before comparison Fold changes were calculated by          AtlasImage  software by pairwise comparisons of          corresponding probe pairs from experimental and control          Three independent experiments were conducted per          experimental group and the composite array determined          Relevant genes with altered expression were then assigned          to functional groups Specifically we assigned those          genes related to the

KY This D Western Blot Array          methodology simultaneously examines relative changes in          protein expression in  proteins in a given sample          Using highly specific monoclonal antibodies in antibody          combinations carefully formulated by BD Transduction          Laboratories this multiprotein assay detects proteins to          the nanogram levels and can distinguish closely related          members of many important signaling families E CONT          and SNtreated explants were collected and processed          according to the protocol of BD Transduction          Laboratories Each sample CONT and SNtreated was          analyzed on  separate D gels which were then          transferred onto  blots Each blot was then incubated          with a different mixture of  monoclonal antibodies          and proteins were detected by chemiluminescence            antibodies   blots proteins were evaluated in a          given sample For this set of experiments two          independent samples were analyzed The relative level of          proteins were determined by phosphor imaging and          normalized to overall signal We then assigned those           Connections Map proteins with a           or greater foldchange to functional groups as described          above                          D western blot analysis          To determine which key pathways were activated          Western blot analyses of phosphorylated or cleaved          proteins in E CONT and SNtreated explants were          conducted as previously described     For this set of          experiments we first determined the specificity for each          of the following antibodies purchased from Cell Signaling          Technology Beverly MA using E and E SMG          homogenates antiphosphorylated Erk phosphop          MAP kinase ThrTyr antibody antiphosphorylated          cRafSer antibody anticleaved Caspase  D           antibody and anticleaved PARP D antibody Each          antibody had previously been shown to be specific for the          activated phosphorylatedcleaved protein and not to          cross react with inactive protein Once optimal          experimental conditions were established for each          antibody we then incubated blots of E and E SMGs in          a mixture of these  antibodies and determined that we          could identify all proteins in a single sample by M           r  This methodology using a mixture          of antibodies has been successfully used by Cell          Signaling Technology and BD Signal Transduction for D          and D Western blot analyses Controls consisted of          blots incubated in preimmune rabbit serum or in the          absence of primary antibodies controls were routinely          negative In each sample each           activated protein was identified by          M           r and the relative level of           activated proteins in CONT and          SNtreated explants was determined by densitometry The          SN results are presented as fold change relative to          CONT protein Two independent samples per group was          analyzed Statistical comparisons were made between CONT          and SNtreated E   explants as described below                          Probabilistic neural network analysis          We used PNN analyses to determine which           Connection Map Fig  transcripts          or proteins with altered expression best discriminate          CONT from SNtreated explants with  sensitivity and          specificity     PNN analyses identify the relative          importance  with  being of no relative importance          and  being relatively most important of gene and          protein expression changes in defining the SN          phenotype It is the change in expression not the          direction of change that is important in defining the          phenotype The algorithm we used Ward Systems Group          Frederick MD is based upon the work of Specht and          colleagues        Utilizing proprietary          software designed by Ward Systems Group Frederick MD          we made comparisons among           Connections Map transcripts or          proteins with altered expression in a given group                          Statistical analysis          Means differences were analyzed by ttest in the usual          manner     To meet the assumptions of this analysis          namely normality and homoscedasticity homogeneity of          variances counts ratios and percentages were log or          arcsin transformed     This allows for parametric          statistical testing
