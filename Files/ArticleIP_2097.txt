                                 Quotas and Colin Powell            The issue Mr Presidentis not affirmative action but racial preferences declared Abigail Thernstromto President Clinton at his Town Hall discussion on race in Akron Ohio Dec Clinton returned the volley Do you favor abolishing the affirmativeactionprogram that produced Colin Powell Yes or No Thernstrom coauthor of anantiaffirmativeaction tome and participant in a current dialogue on race in                  Slate                responded that she does not think that it is racialpreferences that made Colin Powell            In thecurrent Newsweek  Thernstrom amplifies Yes Colin Powell benefited fromaffirmative action But the military has a good kind of affirmative actionwhich expands equal opportunity without making racial preferences She offersas an example Powells promotion to brigadier general by President CartersSecretary of the Army Clifford Alexander When originally sent an allwhitelist of candidates for the position Alexander rejected it demanding a listthat included some blacks From the revised list Alexander chose Powell            As Jacob Weisberg notedin last weeks                   Slate                critics of reverse discrimination ofteninsist that they support affirmative action And they often point to themilitary as the one American institution thats got the distinction right Themilitary by all accounts has indeed done a great job of integrating itshigher reaches and achieving racial harmony without harming its ability toserve its mission Affirmative action in the military is a success But has themilitary avoided the alleged poison of reverse discrimination Not at all Thereal lesson of affirmative action in the military is that reversediscrimination is not so poisonous It gave us Colin Powell            Thernstroms anecdote about how Powell became brigadier general is ambiguous onits face The boss asked for a list that included blacks and then chose a blackoff the list Equal opportunity or reverse discrimination A little moreinformation resolves the ambiguity One reason Powell wasnt on the originallist is that he was at  below the age normally considered eligible forpromotion to brigadier general An exception was made in order to giveSecretary Alexander a black as he had requested Powell who has always beenforthright in his defense of affirmative action says himself that he wouldnthave appeared on the second list or been made the youngest general in the Armyif it had not been for preferential treatment            Thernstrom and others imagine the military as aplace where in her words people rise or fall according to their merits nottheir race But this is a misconception The services set stringent guidelinesfor minority recruitment and promotion that sometimes surpass the supposedexcesses of racially obsessed university admissions officers For instance theAir Force long the most resistant of the services to affirmative actionrecently changed its promotion policy to increase its number of black pilotsNow  percent of black applicants are accepted compared with only  percentof white applicants Do you believe this is the result of pure equalopportunity with nary a drop of racial preference            Both theNavy and the Marines have set themselves fiveyear deadlines to make theirofficer corps percent AfricanAmerican percent Latino and percentAsianAmerican In a Nation article supporting these quotas anexMarine recruiter boasts of his tactic for meeting these goals I routinelyturned down long lines of qualified white males to save room for blacks Idenied whites interviews I put their names on waiting lists Every few monthsI threw stacks of their rsums into the trash            But what about the Armythe service most celebrated forits history of colorblindness The Army implemented its affirmativeactionpolicy in the mids responding to rising resentment of white superiorsamong the black rank and file which had resulted in race riots on bases Todiversify its officer corps the Army began targeting scholarship moneydisproportionately to ROTC programs at historically black colleges and beganheavily recruiting blacks for West Point At least  percent of each West Pointclass must be black Thats an order            Armyguidelines explicitly require that the officerpromotion panels takecandidates race into consideration Promotions the guidelines say mustroughly match the racial composition of the pool of candidates The regulationsnaturally say that the panels should not lower standards simply to boostnumbers but affirmativeaction plans often say similar things and criticsusually have little trouble seeing through it Members of the panels are underheavy career and political pressure to meet goals According to the Pentagonmore minorities and women have been appointed to promotion boards andexplicitly instructed to act as advocates for the minority and women candidateswho appear before them To see that as expanding opportunity and not grantingpreference is wildly naive            Promotions are reviewed by a Pentagon agencycalled the Defense Equal Opportunity Management Institute to ensure that theprocess was racism and sexismfree A recent article in the WeeklyStandard showed that the officers who serve in the institute on a rotatingbasis are trained in lengthy seminars rife with the goofiest sort of politicalcorrectness In one class on the White Male Club an instructor lectured QWho are the white males that sustain power over us A Ted Turner AlanGreenspan and Bill Gates In other sessions they were required to confesstheir own biases and were shown videos from the Oprah Winfrey RacismSeries             So if themechanics of affirmative action in the military mimic those of affirmativeaction in higher education why hasnt the military taken the same flak Unlikethe universities the military has none of the notorious statistics aboutdropouts and racial separatism and it has many success stories such as ColinPowells The militarys officer corps especially the Armys has beensuccessfully transformed from a clubby elite where promotions depended ongolfing partners into a more integrated meritocracy            To be sure the Armys program insists though more vaguelythan people admit that affirmativeaction beneficiaries must meet the sameminimum qualifications as their white counterparts But there is a criticaldifference between being qualified in the sense of meeting some minimumstandard and being better qualified than all those who are rejected Choosinga black over a betterqualified white is still racial preference even if theyboth are qualified in the absolute sense            The main difference betweenmilitary and civilian affirmative action is that the military has anoverabundance of minority candidates Consequently the Army can eliminate itsweakest candidatesabout onehalf of blacks and onethird of whitesand stillhave a large number of blacksabout onethird of the Army Most universitiesand federal agencies must compete aggressively over a much smaller pool            When affirmative actionworks its critics deny its essential nature For affirmative action to doanything it must involve advancing people who are slightly less qualifiedNot one hopes un qualified but less qualified under otherwiseprevailing standards than people who get passed over It is necessarily asloppy process that injects another arbitrary standard into an alreadyarbitrary decisionmaking process But the Army shows the process can work andcan help
