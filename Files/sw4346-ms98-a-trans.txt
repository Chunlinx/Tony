        okay     okay you go first   well i have um two kids i have one seven and one five and um theyre in a public school here in Tyler and um   umhum   im happy with it im happy with their school its great good teachers good curriculum   umhum   um they learn a lot they have no problems um but i do live in the better and well in the best part of the city though i live in you know the real richy part i guess im not but everybody around me is and um but the i have friends that live in the other the       less fortunate or whatever you wanna call it part of town and their schools are kind of rundown and um older and they dont really offer as much i dont know as uh the school that my girls are in i dont really think thats fair you know um   umhum umhum   but you know im happy with what theyre in so go ahead   well yeah it its its pretty much what i was  going to say is theres a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in   umhum   um i grew up in New York and um the place or not New York City upstate New York   wow umhum   and i went to uh the City of Rochester School District and so a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs   umhum   and it wasnt we werent too far removed geographically from each other but the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial and uh one of the things that probably would have been better if is if the entire county had had had just one school system   umhum right   and that would result in some um could result in more equitable distribution of money because what was happening was you know all the very rich people went out to the move out to the suburbs and the city had a very low tax base so they didnt have a lot of money to work with   uhhuh   as a result the schools were rundown there wasnt as many you know the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked there wasnt as many advanced placement courses uh when i was a senior as some other schools had   umhum   and uh it it so i you know i think that one of the things one of the ways to to to help schools in general uh and get them all to a minimum level of of of competency almost would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people and the the problem with that is then then then people will either the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools   yeah   or theyll move farther away  to get better schools so you know it its kind of you end up chasing like a dog chasing its own tail sort of   right also um the the family environment you know you can come to south Tyler where i live and you have got room mothers in every room youve got art mothers youve got every every holiday theres parties all the kids have these really supportive really supportive parents always up there for something you can go to north Tyler to the schools and the parents might not could even tell you what their kids teachers name is   yeah umhum   you know um that has a a whole lot to do with it you know as far as their learning i mean if the parents arent um you know willing to go with the kids and find out what theyre learning and if theyre learning   umhum   you know they really dont have much of a chance at all and   yeah why is that   huh   why is that   oh  why are you  you just they just dont i mean i mean im im up there at my kids school       i know what theyre learning and if theyre up i call and find out you know is she having problems does she need help with anything no shes doing fine okay you know um and i i know kids that their parents could really give a rip and the kids are not motivated   right right   they have no motivation from home so they just go to school and you know eh you know ill get through the day and um bring homework home and theres nobody to to sit them down and say youre going to do this   right   um just you know they they take a notion to do it they do and um that doesnt work either you know they have to have guidance and um they cant just have it at school and then come home and theres nothing   umhum   you know   yeah yeah  yeah i know that that that was a big factor for me i ended up coming out of of the public school system very well you know with very good education   uhhuh   i ended up getting some scholarships to go to college and which has been you know which is really nice and i think the difference for me was that my parents were   umhum yeah   you know they were definitely they were always there was like well yeah of course youre going to study and do well i mean thats the way of course are you know
