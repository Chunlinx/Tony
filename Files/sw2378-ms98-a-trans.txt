                okay Jay um could you tell me uh what your thoughts are about crime   i tell you what here in Dallas its uh its awful bad because that theyre i i believe theres starting to be a lot more violent type crimes uh where you see armed robbery and and uh rape and murder you know are starting to be a lot more prevalent in this area and uh thats thats getting thats getting scary because i grew up in a real small town and i moved here to Dallas and uh its been a rude awakening i tell you   oh so thats what do you do work in Plano   uh right right   how how far away is that from Dallas from the city itself   well see its it its really just a suburb uh i really cant even tell where Plano starts and Dallas Dallas ends   oh so it   but uh i grew up in a real small town in north Texas and uh moved down here to Plano an and uh its uh its definitely a big change   yeah thats uh thats the same with me well um i grew up in a rural area theres nothing but farms   right   and i still live in the same area its its built up somewhat and crime really hasnt been a problem its been uh uh mostly outsiders coming in and you know robbing or breaking into automobiles and stealing uh   i see   radios and cassettes and things like that   not really the violent crimes then     not so much in in the town i live in now but but the closest large city in Rhode Island is Providence and then its Boston which is about uh   i see   oh forty five fifty miles away   i see   which is really not that far   right   and Providence is only like a dozen miles from from where i am   okay so thats real close   but the cities down there yeah and and and the next one up is uh is a small city between me and Providence   right   and that theyre stealing handbags now in broad daylight theyre taking the the crime now the latest thing up here is uh theyll somebody be driving along whether theyre theyre in their early twentys or or teens   right   and theyll steal jackets theyll holdup kids and theyll take their jackets and chains you know just get out of the car and   oh Lord   because they have got some of these like the leather jackets are are quite expensive   right you know ive heard about that uh also for tennis shoes there was uh uh  a big surge going on oh just last year i think where uh kids like in New York uh were uh knocking off other kids to get their tennis shoes   they just  thats thats incredible   yeah i tell you what though if you go price some of those tennis shoes i can see why now you know theyre getting up in the hundred dollar range   yeah thats   and that just seems ridiculous   yeah for a pair of tennis shoes   for a pair of tennis shoes yeah   yeah yeah no shoe is worth that that price uh   so thats right   you know not to not to go out and scuff up and but i dont know what the its   i dont know what the answer is though to to try to fix that problem   its probably the uh the times now um   right   i know you guys down there have had have had a problem for a while which were experiencing now with the savings and loans and   exactly yeah just economic overall economic uh times around here in Texas have been tough   yeah and rents are are extremely high i mean people and they just dont care   yeah right   you know its either its either you go out and you and you steal something or you you bash somebody over the head   to get it yeah   or you starve   well another another problem i think is the the drugs you know uh people have to get money for the the drugs and     yeah   and theyll just go out and do anything they can to do it   yeah we had we had uh an incident in our town not too far from where i live where uh the police made a raid on and and most of them were teenagers or or or in their early twenties   right   which is unheard of in a small town you know you dont usually associate associate that   right   but they did they made the raid you know and the whole town was upset but im not so sure now if if uh if the drugs are really prevalent theyre saying that alcohol now is is uh one of the major contributors   right   like all of all the students now on campus uh i guess most of them drink or have binges on weekends and   exactly   and going to school is also always very prohibitive now unless your parents are wealthy   right   you know you either have to take a loan or most of them dont work or if they work they work parttime for   yeah its hard to get a job you know   minimum wage yeah   right   yeah im not sure down there if you guys are all picking up but up here its its terrible   you know we really havent uh because the oil industry just hasnt come back like it was and so much of our economy was based on that   so youre still suffering then   so yeah yeah   as far as that goes   right that that and real estate you know just have not come back uh even close to what they were   yeah   and um yeah Dallas is you know you can see some economic turnarounds but uh and i dont think it will ever be back to what it was because it was you know it was really blowing and going there for a while   yeah i was down i was in Dallas about uh twelve thirteen years ago and then i just went down again last month for a week   i see   and it was its like one huge city when i was flying in   right   it was just all lights       but you couldnt tell there was a problem   right   you know because its so huge   right   part part of the problem too i think up here is i mean um   and   all the banking crisis all the white collar crimes uh stock brokers have been getting away with bloody murder the bankers have been getting away with bloody murder   right   nobodys being prosecuted   thats right   so   whats going to stop them from you know other people to   right whats yeah whats whats the poor guy going to do thats thats you know being threatened or thrown out on the street and hes got a family to support and hes got no job um im not sure how much of that is is crime rather than just kids out there for a good time yeah   well thats true too yeah yeah but you know the violent crime is is uh definitely somethings got to be done on that because   yeah because theres more and more theres more murders we had uh   right   just in southern Massachusetts and Rhode Island over the weekend we had five murders   golly thats ridiculous   yeah i mean Rhode Rhode Islands just like a neighborhood compared to you guys down there its just so so so small   right right   and nobody even cares or nobody seems to care   they just overlook that as uh common occurrence   yeah yeah yeah and if its if its drug related they turn the other way because thats one less problem that they have to put up with the law enforcement   right oh thats   and uh if they do come in ive got some friends on the police force and they say that you know they apprehend somebody and they bring them in and uh they let them out theyre out on the street before they get their reports done   golly thats terrible isnt it   so theres no checks and balances   right   and im not sure what what to do about that or which way its going to go   well see im not either because im im really not for higher taxes you know to go out and pay for uh more people to be out on the street as far as the officers and things like that but uh   yeah theyre being overwhelmed i think anyhow i mean   i think yeah thats true   the fire power against them now is is atrocious   and uh   you know theyve got all kinds of automatic weapons these criminals do   right   and these poor guys out there uh trying to uphold the law um i dont know i kind of think they should bring back capital punishment   so i dont know well i do too and you know i know people argue that thats really not a deterrent and people dont think about that but ive ive got to believe that   well   in the back of their mind if they know theyre going to go out and kill somebody and that you know theyre going to get the death penalty then and that it will actually happen   its yeah yeah   you know so many so many of these jokers get the death penalty and then you know just end up in prison uh   yeah for twenty or thirty years or forever theres no   right you know with the chance of even getting paroled and uh you know thats just i just dont understand that   yeah um   but   and when i say theres no deterrent you know of the death penalty um thats like saying that you dont put up any stoplights anymore because its not a deterrent for people to stop at crossroads   right thats true yeah   so it it just doesnt hold water and you look at some of the other countries that that have the death penalty   right   and they dont have anywhere near the crime rate that we do of the violent crime rates that we do   right right because you know a lot of countries just shoot you on the spot you know forget that trial and the jury and all that you know they just      yeah i yeah i wouldnt want to see it go that far       you know give them due process and then and then let them   and then do it huh   and then let them appeal yeah then youd get yeah because some of it some of its its its just down right   thats right   uh mean i mean they go out there just just for the sake of of harming somebody   right exactly   and those are the people that you know can you rehabilitate them the some of the ones that are you know perpetual   exactly and and   um   you know i dont even know if they are worth rehabilitating if if uh they go out and commit some of these violent crimes so but i dont know what the answer is well just have to i guess each each person will just have to try to do their part and   yeah yeah he can   because its eventually its going to its going to swing back   right   it was they had the death penalty way back and then it swung the other way and everybodys swore you know were no better than they are if we if we put the death penalty in and
