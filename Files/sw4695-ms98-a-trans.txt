        an avid camper     um im a more of of a wanna be     uhhuh   uh my wife uh uh was an only child but her family all through her adolescence had a uh small pull behind trailer so they didnt go out necessarily camping in tents and such but they did a lot of weekend um trips all through the midwest and the east uh Lancaster Pennsylvania and so forth and so on they did a lot of traveling with that so if you count that as camping which may some people may or may not um she had a lot of experience with that and when we first uh got engaged and got married we you know kind of hung around did a lot of stuff with her folks uh till they sold sold the trailer and then finally they passed away but dont have a whole lot of experience or opportunities to but were were all kind of wannabes here at the family   there is sort of a wide range of camping opportunities i remember when i was a kid my only my only camping experience was when i was about thirteen or so and it the Y camp used to have an overnight every so often   umhum   and wed cut down a couple of saplings or you nowadays you wouldnt cut down saplings i guess   yeah i mean i know what you mean   and wed lash them up which lash was tying and wed make sort of a triangular thing and you know with a tarp over the top   sure there you go   and um sleeping bag dug a hole made a fire uh the old shovel with the toilet paper over it so that i think thats real legitimate camping uh just recently uh my husband and i and our kids joined a friend whose parents has one of the have one of these big Silver Bullet trailers that stay parked in upstate New York and   umhum   i chuckled when i got there there was a microwave oven and a gas burner stove and five bunk beds and heat for the evening i mean   umhum umhum thats thats more like a mobile home   yeah but it was so big that you know they dont use it mobilely it just you know you you pull it somewhere and you leave it there its sort of like a summer house i guess and i guess thats camping too um   not a camper uhhuh yeah i guess my kid you know my kids go to the YM um or go to the uh girl scout camp uh there are several of them here in southwest Ohio that are all run by the same uh council and theyre usually there for a week each during the summer at some point so theyre they do a lot more rustic camping but most most of their meals are served in the mess hall i think they have one or two outings where they cook at the campsite um out in the fringes of the uh of the park rather than uh than at the than at the um mess hall so they get some of it   umhum   the only other opportunity really that i get anything like that is uh in the summer um im a ham radio operator and   oh tell me about it you ready for Dayton   oh cant wait uh like a pilgrimage to Mecca     right   but its and its very convenient for me because its only forty five minutes up the road   uhhuh   but um for field day which is an exercise in the summer where ham it know its its its a couple of things its supposed to be a uh a demonstration of how the ham community can be mobilized to to operate under simulated emergency or field conditions   i think ive heard something about this you go set up a tower right   yeah where well some people set up towers other people use a fishing line and pull wires up into trees and use wire antennas or whatever depending on how energetic the club is but uh   umhum   you know it its also a contest see how many other ham stations you can contact who are doing the same thing and then its also a chance to get out with your buddies and drink beer and play radio all night or if if you you know we have a number of women in the club also but its you know its a chance to get out with your friends and drink beer and play radio all night but we do go out to one of the local city city municipal whatever parks um here in Cincinnati and uh you know go up on top of a tall hill and string some wires up in the trees and such and um put out the picnic tables and uh lawn chairs and set up the equipment with a generator and set up a tent for the kids to sleep in or for the people who are who are uh taking a break to to go off and sleep in and then use propane stove to cook breakfast at six oclock the next morning with and thats about as close to camping as i really have much of a chance to get right now   uh right i mean you know theres not that much free time and i dont know uh we we we daydream about going camping i guess uh theres a very nice state park around here um that were on Long Island   umhum oh umhum   and um near Montauk if youve ever heard of it the big light house out there theres a beach state park where you can you know they have tent sites i guess wed have to rent all that stuff and   um   and theres picnic tables and theres the beach and i guess its pretty popular its sort of a um a lottery for who gets it and you have to apply at the right time and people in the know how do that and we keep thinking about doing it and it
