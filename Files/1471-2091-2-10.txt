                    Background        The CD F FRP molecule a cell surface        disulfidelinked heterodimer was originally described as a        T cell activation antigen     and later was shown to        provide a costimulatory signal for CDmediated Tcell        activation     independent of CDCDCD        interaction     In other studies triggering of human        monocyte CD could suppress T cell proliferation            or promote homotypic cell aggregation of monocytes            Also CD may be a target antigen for natural killer cells            may mediate fusion of blood monocytes leading to        osteoclast formation      and may modulate        hematopoietic cell survival and differentiation            The CD molecule is also widely expressed on rapidly        growing nonhematopoietic cells where it may modulate        oncogenic transformation      metal ion transport             cell fusion      and amino acid transport               CD is also expressed on normal        proliferating tissue such as the basal layer of squamous        epithelia    and on cells having secretion or transport        functions     Understanding of the role of CD in        amino acid transport has been greatly enhanced with the        recent cloning and characterization of multiple CD light        chains Distinct CD light chains appear to mediate        distinct amino acid transport activities for review see                    Several lines of evidence now suggest that CD may        modulate the functions of integrins For example CD and         integrins may act together during Tcell costimulation            A genetic screen revealed that CD may indirectly        influence integrin affinity for ligand     Also        antiCD mAb appeared to modulate integrindependent        adhesion in two separate studies      In addition        antibodies to both CD and  integrin promoted cell        fusion     and antibodies to  and  integrins        blocked monocyte cellcell fusion and aggregation functions        induced by an antiCD mAb     Finally like CD the         integrin has been implicated in amino acid transport                   The biochemical mechanism by which CD and integrins        functionally interact remains unclear The CD molecule        associates specifically with immobilized  integrin        cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins under very mild detergent        conditions  Triton X     but CD has not        yet been shown to interact physically with intact         integrins We began the present study by searching for        integrinassociated proteins in an unbiased manner ie we        were not specifically looking for CD We utilized a        monoclonal antibody screening method involving        coimmunoprecipitation of integrins under nonstringent        detergent conditions      Using this approach we        have previously discovered specific associations between        particular  integrins and other cell surface molecules        including CDEMMPRIN     and various tetraspanin        transmembrane superfamily proteins       In        this report we demonstrate for the first time that CD        constitutively and specifically associates with intact         integrin heterodimers Specific CDintegrin interaction        occurs in the context of low density proteinlipid        microdomains possibly resembling lipid rafts             Several important signaling molecules including activated        TCR LAT and LCK are present in organized rafttype        microdomains and integrity of these microdomains is        necessary for T cell receptor signal transduction             Our present discovery that  integrins specifically        associate with CD in lipid microdomains helps to explain        the functional connections between  integrins and CD        during T cell costimulation monocyte fusion and        elsewhere                    Results and Discussion                  Identification of CD as a  integrinassociated          protein          Mice were immunized with MTSV human mammary          epithelial cells and approximately  hybridomas were          generated Upon monoclonal antibody screening  were          identified that coimmunoprecipitated integrins without          recognizing integrins directly Of these one recognized          CD as reported previously     and three including          mAb B recognized a disulfidelinked cell surface          heterodimer consisting of an  kD heavy chain and a           kD light chain          From I surfacelabeled HT cells mAb B          immunoprecipitated a heterodimer of  and  kD under          reducing conditions Fig  lane a solid arrows and a          single protein band of  kD under nonreducing          conditions not shown but no other protein bands when          lysates were prepared in  Triton XI  detergent          However in the less stringent Brij  detergent mAb          B coimmunoprecipitated an integrinlike protein band          of  kD Fig  lane b dotted arrow Similar results          were noted when CHAPS or Brij  detergents were used          not shown          Because the proteins recognized by B resembled the          disulfidelinked  and  kD subunits of CD               they were compared to authentic CD as precipitated          using mAb F Both mAb F and mAb B precipitated          identical patterns of cell surface proteins as seen by          reduced SDSPAGE Fig A lanes cd Furthermore          preincubation of cell lysates with mAb F resulted in          loss of the antigen recognized by mAb B not shown          Upon addition of  mM DTT to cell lysates mAb B          immunoprecipitated only a  kD protein band consistent          with specific recognition of the CD heavy chain Flow          cytometry of CHO cells transfected with CD heavy chain          cDNA confirmed that the CD heavy chain is the B          antigen Fig B Also by flow cytometry the B          antigen was present at high levels on all human cell          lines tested more than  as expected for CD                          Specificity of CDintegrin association          To identify the integrinlike  kD proteins          coprecipitating with CD immune complexes prepared          from HT cells were dissociated and reprecipitated          with mAb against various cell surface molecules From          CD immunoprecipitates we recovered  integrin but          not other cell surface molecules including the LDL          receptor HLA class I the metalloprotease regulator          EMMPRIN CD  CD or CD  Fig A Several          other  integrins that are abundant on HT cells             and  also could be          reprecipitated from CD immunoprecipitates Fig C          Using the same experimental conditions we were unable to          detect  in CD immunoprecitates prepared from the          rhabdomyosarcoma cell line RD the lymphoblastoid cell          line Molt or K cells transfected with  integrin          not shown However we did observe          coimmunoprecipitation of CD with  integrin in the          presence of  mM manganese not shown The precise role          of manganese is unclear Incubation with anti          activating antibody TS not shown did not mimic          the effects of manganese on CD association Thus          although manganese is well known to activate           integrins     this activation may not be relevant to          CD association Comparison of material isolated          from CD immunoprecipitates with total amounts of each          integrin on the cell surface indicates that approximately           of each integrin is associated with CD Fig C          compare lanes ad with eh In a reciprocal experiment          CD heavy chain was reprecipitated from an           integrin immunoprecipitate Fig B lane a at a level          comparable to reprecipitated CD lane b a molecule          shown previously to associate with  integrins              Results in Fig Aand Bindicate that CDintegrin          complexes are distinct from previously described          integrinCD     and integrinCDEMMPRIN             complexes          Because not all  integrins associated constitutively          with CD in the absence of manganese the  chain must          help regulate specificity of CD association Notably           with a truncated cytoplasmic tail and wildtype           associated equally well with CD Fig D lanes cd          Thus specificity for constitutive association with CD          may reside in integrin  chain extracellular or          transmembrane domains To check whether CD is a ligand          for  integrin we used K cells transfected with          wild type  or  mutants deficient in adhesion to           ligands laminin  WA and invasin YA              All of these  proteins constructs associated with CD          Fig E Notably  mM EDTA had no inhibitory effect on          constitutive integrinCD associations not shown          Thus CD itself does not appear to be acting as an          integrin ligand We were unable to demonstrate any          changes in the adhesive functions of CHO cells upon          CDtransfection However functional effects of          transfected human CD could be overshadowed by an excess          of endogenous hamster CD          Next we asked whether clustering of CD would induce          selective clustering of  integrins On the surface of          RDA cells CD was clustered by incubation with          antiCD mAb F followed by incubation with rabbit          antimouse antibody Subsequent incubation with anti          mAb directly conjugated to Alexa revealed that           was highly clustered Fig C unless preclustering of          CD was omitted Fig A In contrast staining with          antiAlexa mAb revealed a diffuse pattern of          staining regardless of CD clustering Fig B D If          no Alexaconjugated antibodies were added no          staining was observed not shown Immunofluorescent          staining of both  and CD showed that they were          distributed similarly on the cell surface of HT and          RDA cells and partially colocalized not shown                          CD mutation and sucrose density gradient          localization          The CD heavy chain contains two extracellular          cysteines Each of these cysteines was mutated to serine          and the effects on  integrin association were          evaluated Stably expressed human CD heavy chain CS          mutant retained association with endogenous murine  in          NIH T cells comparable to that seen for wild type CD          heavy chain However the CS mutant showed no          detectable  association Fig A right panel Murine           Fig A left panel and mutant and wild type forms          of CD see legend were expressed at comparable levels          in each of the transfectants Notably association of          CD heavy chain with CD light chain was maintained for          the CS mutant but was lost for the CS mutant not          shown in agreement with previously published results          suggesting that Cysteine  is required for disulfide          linkage to the light chain     These results suggest          that the CD light chain might be necessary for          CDintegrin association One possibility is that the          light chain is more proximal to the integrin When          suitable antilight chain reagents become available this          could be directly tested in covalent crosslinking          experiments In this regard we have thus far been unable          to crosslink CD heavy chain directly to  integrin          using either membranepermeable or membraneimpermeable          crosslinkers not shown          Another possibility is that the CD light chain may          target the CD heterodimer to the specific membrane          domain where interactions with  integrins may be          localized To test the latter hypothesis we compared the          total  integrin distribution with the distribution of          the fraction of  integrins complexed with CD on HT           cells Fig B Although  integrins were          predominantly present in the dense membrane fraction on a          sucrose gradient the subset of  integrins complexed          with CD was localized to the light membrane          fractions These fractions typically contain caveolae and          membrane rafts thought to be enriched in active          signaling complexes       The fraction of the           integrins detected in the light membrane fractions          represents no more than  of total  integrins based          on the densitometric analysis not shown Though          caveolin is present in the same fractions as          CDintegrin complexes it does not coimmunoprecipitate          with CD under these conditions not shown and thus is          not part of integrinCD complexes Similarly          GPIlinked proteins such as CD  TMSF proteins such          as CD and other transmembrane proteins such as          CDEMMPRIN can be found at substantial levels in light          membrane fractions      and our unpublished          results and these also did not coimmunoprecipitate          with CD Fig A B Thus CD association with          integrin has another level of specificity beyond simply          colocalizing in light membrane fractions          Finally to see whether the CD light chain might          help to target the CD heavy chain to the light membrane          fractions we looked at the distribution of the wild type          CD and CD mutants in the sucrose gradients Fig          CD The majority of wild type CD heavy chain and          control mutant CS are localized to the light          membrane fraction  Fig D whereas the CS          mutant is partially shifted to the dense fractions           in the light fraction  in the dense fractions Fig          D These results are consistent with the CD light          chain targeting the CD heavy chain to light membrane          fractions It is perhaps not surprising to observe           of the CS heavy chain mutant remaining in the light          membrane fraction Fig CD considering that the CD          heterodimer retains partial association and amino acid          transport function even in the absence of a disulfide          linkage of the subunits     Notably transformation          of BALB T cells caused by overexpression of CD heavy          chain required its association with the light chain and          a missense mutation in C eliminated its transforming          activity              The CD protein was recently shown to associate          specifically with integrin  chain cytoplasmic tail          fusion proteins    in  Triton X detergent          conditions One may speculate that the use of           Triton X may have allowed maintenance of CD          microdomains needed for  interaction In this regard          in  Triton X lysates many transmembrane          proteins remain in the light membrane fractions of a          sucrose gradient      Although the role of the          CD light chain was not addressed in the earlier study              we assume that it may have played a key role          Furthermore CD interaction with recombinant  chain          cytoplasmic tail fusion proteins in the absence of the           chain     is consistent with our observation that          the  chain cytoplasmic tail is not needed for          integrinCD association On the other hand we observed          CD interaction with several  integrins but not           Thus for intact integrins in the context of mammalian          cells the integrin  chain apparently does contribute to          the specificity of CD interaction The  chain might          provide a level of specificity by changing the          conformation of the  chain andor by providing an          additional site of interaction with the CD light or          heavy chains          Because our integrinCD complex was observed in          light membrane fractions and not in dense sucrose          gradient fractions and because we could not capture the          complex by covalent crosslinking not shown the          interaction may not be direct Nonetheless an abundance          of evidence points to the functional relevance of this          complex references above Furthermore integrin          VCD complexes have considerable functional          relevance despite being found only under relatively mild          detergent conditions eg Brij  and exclusively in          the light membrane fractions of a sucrose gradient                                          Conclusions        In summary we show a highly specific biochemical link        between intact  integrins and CD as demonstrated by        reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation and coclustering        experiments Furthermore CD association with         integrins appears to occur in the context of an ordered        lipid microdomain as evidenced by colocalization in light        membrane fractions of sucrose density gradients and        appears to require the light chain of CD These results        may help to explain recent reports that CD may modulate        integrin ligand binding adhesion signaling T cell
