                                 Hook Line and Sinker                        Dear Dinesh            Like you I find Morris book extraordinarily disappointingparticularlygiven my expectations I like his TR book very much and I like him althoughI dont know him well and consider him an interesting and very intelligentman But something went badly wrong with this book I dont want topsychologize but clearly he simply found himself unable to manage this largeand difficult subject floundered and grasped onto a series of unwise devicesthat derailed the projectof which the fictional narrators are only one andnot the most disastrous            Like you as well I find Morris view of Reagan as something close to anempty suit inherently implausible I suspect that spending many hours gettingReagan to talk about the past which he is astute enough to realize does notmean much to Reagan except as the source of wellworn anecdotes must havegiven him an exaggerated sense of Reagans detachment from any engagement withthe present My view of Reagans powers of leadership is perhaps different fromyours I agree with you that Reagan was a tremendously effective leaderpartlybecause he was attractive and a good speaker but even more because he was aman of absolute certitude about his core convictions and was able to convey asense of assurance and selfconfidence Where did that certitude come from Onething that Morris does convey pretty well I think is that Reagan formedconvictions fairly early in his consideration of a question and that theseconvictions then became more or less impervious to challenge from evidence thatmight contradict them That did not always make these convictions useful basesfor policy or action but they did make them extremely effective as vehiclesfor shaping opinion and attracting support Morris is clearly impressed bythose moments when Reagan demonstrated his powers of leadership and persuasionand he concedes that Reagan had an enormous impact on the attitudes of theAmerican people But his explanation of where that power came from is at oddsas you note with his dismissive view of Reagans own personality andintelligence            But my larger problem with Morris is undoubtedly very different from yoursAs I noted yesterday Morris seems to know very little about American politicsand American history And yet he is on the whole a completely creduloussupporter of most of the assumptions and ideas we associate with Reaganism Imentioned yesterday his preposterous summary of the history of the welfarestate which sounds like one of Reagans uninformed anecdotes about welfarequeens and his uninformed analysis of Keynesianism and the New Deal economicorder But the largest example of his credulity in this book involves the partof Reagans presidency in which he takes the greatest interest the Cold WarIt is an article of faith among many Reagan admirers that Reagan won the ColdWar I do not deny that Reagans policies and his relationship withGorbachev were important in shaping the way the Cold War ended But I dontthink many historians would argue now and I dont think many will argue in thefuture that Reaganor American policy generally except in a very largesensehad much to do with the unraveling of the Soviet Union That had muchmore to do with the grave internal weaknesses in the Soviet system than withanything the United States did If there was an event that really precipitatedthe unraveling it was not anything Reagan did but the disastrous invasion ofAfghanistan and its aftermath            Morris however selects a few incidents in Reagans presidency andattributes to them a historic importance for which there is no real evidenceThe evil empire speech for example Reagans use of the word evil he sayspenetrated the Russian soul as surely as the cadmium poisoning Russian beetsIt produced a shock of selfrecognition and presumably contributed to thedecline of popular legitimacy of the regime The evidence for this he sayswas gathered over many yearsbut what evidence does he provide An interviewwith Max Kampelman who was presumably expressing his own anecdotal reactionsafter conversations with a few Russians and an article by the author of thespeech Or later the Mr Gorbachev tear down this wall speech in Berlin in Morris may speak condescendingly of Reagans language as you notedyesterday But he also argues that this speech resonated throughout theCommunist world and helped spawn the will to resist that culminated in therevolutions of  and beyond And what is his evidence for this extraordinaryclaim An article byonce againthe author of the speech            People in the Reagan administration Reagan partisans and Reagan himselfhave had obvious selfserving reasons for making such argumentsfor insistingthat a major event in world history that arose out of a vast confluence offactors was the result of the policies and the rhetoric of a single man Butwhat is Morris excuse He has simply accepted the claims at face value justas he seems to have accepted his views of American domestic policy on the basisof a few rhetorical statements that seem to him plausible In the end then hehas done exactly what he and many others claim that Reagan often did            You think the book is a great injustice to Reagan and in many respects itis But it is also an injustice to history because it accepts far toocredulously the claims made by Reagans admirers about his accomplishments andhis influence
