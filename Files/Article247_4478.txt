                                 Republicans Test Their Metal            During tonights Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire Gary Bauercriticized his fellow conservative Republican Alan Keyes for flinging himselfinto a mosh pit to the music of Rage Against the Machine            In case you didnt actually watch tonights Republican presidential debatein New Hampshire this really did happen The exchange raised a number ofurgent questions  What was Ambassador Keyes doing in a mosh pit Answertrying to secure the support of Michael Moore the leftwing filmmaker Does Bauer listen to a lot of heavy metal Answer Apparently not since hefirst called the band The Machine Rages On  Why is either of thesenohope religious zealots still in the race Answer For the same reasontheyre flinging themselves into mosh pits at the behest of radical documentaryfilmmakers because theyre running to get attention  What does OrrinHatchs wife Elaine think about Korn Answer We may never know            If you really want to get into it Bauer had a bit of a point Keyes who ina previous debate accused John McCain of lending aid andcomfort to fans of Nine Inch Nails was participating however facetiouslyin the Caucasian version of the gangster culture that he thinks is destroyingAmerica At the very least moshing with Michael Moore was the height ofhypocrisy But if you start to take Keyes seriously enough to criticize him inthis way he has already won his battle which is to not be ignored            With the exception of this and a few other sideshows the debate was onceagain mostly about George W Bush As the other candidates took potshots at theleader of the pack for according to them coddling China wanting tofederalize education policy equivocating on abortion and endangering SocialSecurity with a huge tax cut Bush ducked smiled and declined to take thecharges entirely seriously His dodging was as artful as ever What makesBushs brushoffs so effective is not what he says at a substantive levelwhich is usually pretty evasive but rather his jovial confident demeanorBush survives debates in which he is the constant target by refusing to getriled You can insult him you can mock him and you can patronize him but youcant ruin his fine frontrunning mood            This attitude was on display when Bauer made his usual assault on BushsChina policy Bush grinned broadly cocked his head back and pointed at Baueras if to say Bang bang Im dead NOT Bush was even more disarming whenForbes went after him with a long and squirrelly question that accused him ofincreasing the size of government in Texas lowering educational standards andsupporting a fraudulent tax cutbefore compounding the indictment by askingBush if he intended to do to the nation what he did to his own state Bush wasslow on some of the particulars of his defense He didnt remember until thesecond pass for instance that Texass SAT scores might be down because moreunderprivileged kids were taking the SAT But Bushs facial expressions andbody language made the point that Forbes was full of hot air with perfecteloquence            Thanks to CNNs split screen you could watch Bush as Forbes went after himRight away you saw the notorious smirk cross Bushs face But it was asuppressed smirk that said Im trying to hide my contempt but I cant hideit completely Then Bush turned away from the question as if resisting theeffort to laugh in the questioners face Then he looked back at Forbes hissemismirk giving way to the subtlest of eye rolls before the eye roll gave wayto a set of blinks suggesting disdain As Forbes finished his question Bushsquinted smiled broadly and gestured by opening his arms as he said So manyhalfstories so little time Forbes looked altogether different while Bushwas answering him His pained awkward expression suggested someone sucking alemon while receiving a proctologic exam Perhaps Forbes is one of thosecandidates who is better on radio than television Bush is sort of the oppositeextreme Hes most effective on TV with the TV set on mute            John McCains performance was mixed He had some effective rejoinders suchas when he told Keyes to buzz off when Keyes asked him a question about how hewould handle his daughter wanting an abortion But McCain also had some weakmoments especially in the first part of the debate when he seemed to beplaying back his greatest hits Feckless photoop foreign policy is a goodline but less good the  th time you hear it The most strikingthing to me about McCain of late is his continuing dalliance with AmericanProspect type liberalism When all the candidates were asked about thedigital dividethe notion that poor people and minorities are suffering fromtheir lack of access to computersMcCain gave an answer that could have beenAl Gores lauding efforts to connect schools and libraries to the Internet anddecrying the growing gap between the haves and havenots in America WhenBush suggested that fastchanging technology would quickly make any governmentprogram obsolete McCain interjected that it was a government program thatinvented the Internet This sort of response might be dismissed as McCainseffort to connect with New Hampshires independents who can vote in eitherpartys primary But I am increasingly getting the sense that McCains variousliberal positions represent a change of heart or at least an ongoing evolutionin his views Click hereto read William Saletans Frame Game on McCains evolution            After a hour trip back from Iowa that ended only a few hours ago Im toozonked
