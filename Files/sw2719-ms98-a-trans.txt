        do you exercise a lot   um its uh scaled back considerably uh right now my exercise is pretty much limited to uh softball league and occasional ride on the bike but uh i uh i was just recently well recently nine months ago got married and bought a house so my outside activities have been curtailed somewhat   is mowing the lawn a new exercise   yeah lawn its a forty year old house so we are doing a lot of refurbish work and uh yeah painting lawn gutters you name it  all kinds of stuff flower beds   oh my i think thats considered exercise whether you want it or not   yeah that thats true thats true its theres always something to do and uh and and uh it keeps me going   well youre you are so far ahead of me i used to uh   but     i used to walk two miles a day and i really enjoyed it   uhhuh yeah   because the two miles went fairly quickly i could do it in twenty eight minutes   yeah   and thats not stopping and talking to everyone along the way but its a lot you know its not too strenuous   right   and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything but i dont know what i did to my knee i was crawling under a desk hooking up a computer   uhhuh   and i mashed it wrong or i did something   oh gosh   and the doctor has had me on medication and she doesnt want me to walk she said thats you know while its healing youre going to mess it up so i cant walk   wow   and uh she said you know the most conservative approach you do the medicine you do the medicine again and again before you think of surgery and i dont want her to think of surgery on my knee i dont want anyone to think about that   uhhuh no that thats a tough situation   ever thats that microscopic stuff you know uhhuh not my kneecap   uhhuh     so im im being very good   yeah   but i miss it i really do and i   oh that its so aggravating to uh to have an injury like that my wife uh runs or likes to run but uh shes well we moved we moved down to the north end of Oak Cliff in the Castle Park area   oh really   yeah and she started running down there and all the hills   uhhuh   and she lasted about two weeks and her ankles couldnt take it anymore she was used to running you know flat tracks and whatnot and uh ever since that its just been real difficult its real aggravating because she starts in and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff even if she does get on flat ground so shes kind of in the same mode She was all ready to get back into it and start running uh five Ks and ten Ks and stuff this spring and she just hasnt been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape and when you want to do it its really really aggravating you know it its one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise and its another thing to to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health   i can you understand that uh   yeah   uh i dont really want to i just know i need to   well its   you know i make myself do it and if i do it okay i dont love it   uhhuh uhhuh   you know  but i will do it   sure   uh its not anything i would want to but i can really tell the difference since i have not been able to walk i have got to be so much more careful with what i do   yeah yeah uhhuh it is and you know you you   its depressing   you dont  well speaking for myself i dont sleep as well when i am not exercising and uh its really its harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff it your body just gets used to it and yeah i i dont particularly enjoy well i i used to lift weights an awful lot and stuff like that i do enjoy riding bike but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that uh i i cant say i really enjoyed it all that much but once i got used to it it was habit forming it was i felt so bad if i didnt physically i mean i just my body was was was uh tuned into that that mode and if i if i skipped it then it  kind of threw the the whole the whole system out of whack   right right boy   yeah   hopefully my my knee is a hundred percent better maybe i can get back into it   yeah thats for sure   i have ask you a question off the subject though youre in youre living in the Castle Park area   okay thats right   i grew up in Oak Cliff   did you really   yes uh just close to Methodist Hospital   okay yeah   on Candy C A N D Y   right   oh in fact i lived there oh until nineteen late nineteen fifties   okay okay   and that area is it changing back again so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them   yeah it is um were on were on a little street called Bison Trail its only about a block and a half long but its its over on the other end It its over by the far edge of uh Stephens Park Golf Course   oh i know exactly where that is   yeah its its uh you know where the little bridge is on North Oak Cliff Boulevard yeah we are just south of that little bridge back up on the hill in the trees there   yeah sure   and yeah um our street is uh an awful lot of retired people but the other half in fact our  you know one little block and a half there four houses sold last summer and three sold the summer before and everybody in their late twenties to mid thirties are buying and and starting to rebuild and fix things up again and everybody is real excited   oh thats thats wonderful that is a gorgeous gorgeous place   yeah and then oh its its a lot of fun the people are great there too our uh weve got a real active neighborhood association and uh we have well weve got four regular parties every year and we do a neighborhood recycling program and you know all that kind of stuff so its a lot of fun and it is its a really beautiful area and some some of the people um some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too are picking up some of those great big houses and theyre theyre getting them at a real bargain   well sure they are   you know theyre theyre getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty a hundred and seventy five thousand dollars   good great   and uh and theyre just going to town with them theyre people are putting in pools and and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original you know nineteen thirty nineteen forties look   oh wow   and uh it its it s really coming around i guess   i need to go over there and just drive around and look   its its worth the trip   oh im sure it must be im just we had a lovely little house over there it was like a two story   uhhuh   well story and a half really because we had a basement   okay   and the guy that built it was weird       i mean weird   yeah   its one of these really creative houses that i grew up in that nothing was on the same level with anything else   okay oh wow   and i just loved the neighborhood and i mean everyone everyone had houses like that They were all completely different   yeah uhhuh thats right   and so neat   yeah ours ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big oh i guess its twenty eight by fifteen front porch and uh next door weve got an Austin stone   uh   across the street the guy just uh it was burnt out about two years ago and and the guy moved in and completely redid it and its got oh its got a rounded front on it its all brick and hes hes landscaped his yard and hes about ready to put in a pool and things like that so yeah theres a variety you just dont see it anywhere else as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot   now why couldnt your wife run around the golf course is that not good   um oh she could a little bit we i tell you what we got into the fitness center at Methodist   oh was he   and they have a quarter mile track there so she has started doing that rather than uh rather than take off the problem is shes a school teacher and for her she cant run in the morning For her to get home and try to run at six oclock in the night in the winter time its starting to get dark and   oh   you know you dont want to she doesnt want to be out by herself anywhere in Dallas regardless whether its north Dallas or whatnot and when she goes over to this fitness center its fenced in and theres somebody in the building watching her and all that so theres a lot of consideration   yes i i really hear that you know i think you know youre in Oak Cliff   uhhuh   but im in Plano In west Plano   yeah   and we live on one of those blocks that its a neighborhood watch block we all know each other and the street doesnt go anywhere   uhhuh right   if you are on the street you better belong there   thats right   because its not a through street   thats right   and still i want to get up early in the morning and walk before this knee business and my husband   uhhuh   had a lot of heartburn with that   yeah   i mean it looked darker to him because he he was in the house with the lights on   right   when i was out walking it was more of a pre dawn type pretty but huhuh he didnt think it looked pre dawn to him it looked dark and even he was real concerned about that so   yeah yeah   its not just because you are in Oak Cliff its just because youre smart that you dont do things like that   thats right thats right it only takes one time that is its a hard lesson to learn so   thats right theres only one crazy out there you know to make any difference   uhhuh yeah yeah its you know it goes all over well we got this
