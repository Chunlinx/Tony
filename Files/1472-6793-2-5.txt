                    Background        Proteorhodopsin is a amino acid membrane protein        native to several uncultured species of proteobacteria        which are a component of marine plankton     Addition        of retinal to         E coli expressing pR was shown to        cause a reddish coloration of the bacteria with an        absorption maximum near  nm The pR contained in the        bacterial membranes was shown to act as a lightactivated        proton pump but only when retinal is present        Timeresolved UVvis studies at pH  also revealed that the        protein undergoes a photocycle similar to that of wild        type bacteriorhodopsin but with a predominance of the O        intermediate instead of M        The bR photocycle has been characterized by        spectroscopic methods as having six principal        photointermediates bR K L M N and O Each intermediate        has a distinct absorbance maximum the most studied are bR         nm M  nm and O  nm since these are the        ones that can be produced in the highest concentration at        physiological pH values Monitoring of the absorbance at        individual wavelengths after photoexcitation is used to        determine the relative concentrations and decay times of        each of these photointermediates The L  M transition in        bR is characterized by the deprotonation of the Schiff base        to Asp producing the distinctive  nm absorbance        maximum of M and by socalled fast proton release the        ejection of a proton from a different unknown residue        into the external medium on the  s time scale        depending on pH Reprotonation of the Schiff base from        Asp occurs during the M  N transition with an        absorbance maximum of  nm     The N  O transition        involves the reprotonation of the Asp from the        cytoplasmic space        Like bR pR consists of seven transmembrane helices        that include in the membrane interior all of the residues        conserved among archaeal rhodopsin proton pumps In        particular analogues of Asp Asp Arg and Lys        of bR are present in pR Conspicuously absent are analogues        for Glu and Glu of bR The latter as well as        Arg have been implicated in fast proton release In        particular mutagenesis of Glu or Glu in bR results        in loss of fast proton release      The absence of        homologs for these residues in pR leaves open the question        of whether it carries out fast H release        Experiments described here demonstrate that pR does        indeed undergo fast H release at least under elevated pH        conditions that resemble somewhat those of the        proteobacterias native open ocean environment We also        demonstrate that there is a posttranslational modification        of at least one of the three native cysteines when pR is        expressed in         E coli Both of these discoveries        were made possible through purification methods for pR        described herein                    Results                  Purification          PR was obtained in  purity assuming that values of                      and             for pR are the same as for bR          solubilized in DMPCcholateSDS mixtures at pH                  cm M and                 cm M               This assumption is actually expected to underestimate the          purity of pR produced by up to  since the pR we          expressed has  tryptophan and  tyrosine residues as          compared to  tryptophans and  tyrosines in bR from H          salinarum The absorbance of contaminant proteins was          assumed to be  for a  mgmL solution By using these          assumptions the relative concentrations of pR and other          proteins can be determined from the absorbance spectra of          the various fractions fig  The resulting purity          values correlate well with those Coomasiestained          SDSPAGE gels see

                ratio identical with that of          detergent solubilized bR Interestingly the pR appears          to be a doublet band whose relative concentrations remain          almost unchanged during purification This doublet is          also present in the lesspurified sample of pRTCM with          both bands shifted down by approximately the same amount          fig  lane C          Subsequent SDSPAGE analysis of pR samples that had          been stored for periods of time up to several months          indicate that after sitting for several weeks in          octylglucoside solution at C the largest          posttranslational modification on wildtype pR is          eliminated  presumably hydrolysed off of the cysteines           leaving only a MW band indistinguishable from          that seen for pRTCM data not shown Furthermore after          boiling for several min in gel loading solution this          cleaved wildtype protein as well as the TCM both give          an extra artifactual band near  dalton The latter          band a singlet is coincidentally at almost the same          apparent MW as the doublet from the uncleaved

the purification of          pR The           E coli expression system can          easily be used to prepare pR at  purity with similar          or less effort and time than required for bR purple

chromatography separates proteins          on the basis of hydrophobicity and has been used          previously in hR purification       As an initial          purification step the Phenylsepharose column achieved a          substantial increase in protein purity to  along with          removal of most of the lipid The final purification          step utilizing a hydroxylapatite column has been          previously used with rhodopsin     This column          proved to be more efficient as a final step in the          purification than as a preliminary one because large          amounts of contaminant protein tended to slow the flow          rate drastically This step of the purification yielded          an increase in protein purity to  The overall          yield of pR from membrane through the column          purifications is  Most of this loss  occurs          during the hydroxylapatite column                          Molecular weight differences          Bj et al reported a molecular weight for wild type          pR of  kDa based on the predicted amino acid sequence          of the protein     Its  amino acids barely exceed          the  of mature bR which has a molecular weight of           However we observed a significantly higher          apparent molecular weight  for wild type pR on          SDSPAGE gels Fig  lanes D and E Posttranslational          modification of pR must almost certainly account for some          of the observed molecular weight difference between pR          and bR Lipids or sugars covalently bound to the protein          surface would not be removed during the purification          procedure and could cause a higher apparent molecular          weight Cysteines are frequently a site of lipid          association with membrane proteins eg mammalian          rhodopsin which has two palmitoyl molecules attached to          cysteine residues Therefore we compared the SDSPAGE          gel mobility of wildtype pR to that of a cysless mutant          pRTCM The elimination of the three possible          sulfhydryl attachment sites lowers the apparent molecular          weight of the pRTCM by  Fig  lane C From          this we conclude that at least one of the three          cysteines in pR is probably modified          posttranslationally          However this by itself does not account fully for the          anomalous mobility of pR on SDSPAGE gels because pRTCM          is still approximately  higher in molecular weight          than bR according to SDSPAGE fig  lanes A  C          Only  of this can be accounted for by the V          eiptope and polyhistidine tail that are appended to the          Cterminus of pR by the pBADTOPO expression vector that          we used     There is undoubtedly a further          posttranslational modification of unknown nature                          Spectral comparisons          Bj et al reported an absorbance maximum for pR of           nm in           E coli membranes using a          difference bleaching technique to remove interfering          absorbance bands from other membrane components in the          impure pR sample     We confirmed this result using          crude           E coli membranes without detergent          present data not shown However we observed an          absorbance maximum of    nm for pR in OG at pH  at          all stages of purification Fig  Small blue shifts          were observed for pR samples in OG when measured at pH           and   and  nm respectively data not shown          For the pR samples reconstituted in DHPC which were          used for flash photolysis experiments the absorbance          maxima were similar to those measured in OG spectra not          shown A chromophore absorption maximum near  nm was          also obtained by using difference spectroscopy of pR in          crude           E coli membranes solubilized in OG          spectrum not shown However for pR measured directly          in crude           E coli membranes ie not          solubilized in OG we obtained the same value  nm as          reported previously              Solubilization in detergent presumably leads to          structural distortions of the native protein          conformation and therefore a change in the absorbance          properties of the chromophore However the direction          that            max for pR would have to shift upon          solubilization in OG is inconsistent with the pattern for          bR whose            max decreases when it is solubilized          in OG     Furthermore pR in OG showed resonance          Raman spectra D Dunmire R A Krebs and M S Braiman          unpublished data indicative of a chromophore structure          very close to native lightadapted ie alltrans bR in          purple membrane However there is one major difference          pR in OG exhibits an upshifted doublet CN Schiff base          band consisting of two components of nearlyequal          intensity These appear to correspond to the presence of          two distinct subpopulations of pR at least when          expressed in           E coli and solubilized in OG          micelles The different values of            max for pR in membrane state    and          OG solution might be related to the presence of these          multiple subpopulations but this connection remains          unclear                          Principal photointermediates of pR          Of the six principal photointermediates present in bR          four can be discerned from the timedependent visible          absorbance traces from pR in fig  along with          previously published time traces at  nm     the          resting state pR M N and O The resting state with          an absorbance maximum of  nm see above provides the          baseline spectrum for the difference time courses          reported The M intermediate of bR has an unprotonated          Schiff base group giving rise to a blueshifted            max  nm Likewise in pR an          increase in the  nm absorbance should indicate          formation of a deprotonated Schiff base and therefore          the presence of an Mlike intermediate          Interpretation of the  nm time course trace is more          complicated As in bR it likely involves decay of M to          N as well as from N back to bR The absorbance maximum          of the N intermediate in bR is  nm corresponding to a          protonated Schiff base This is not very different from                     max for the resting state of pR           nm The likely spectral overlap between pR and its own          postulated N photoproduct complicates the determination          of amounts of each that are present The slow  ms          decay observed in both the  nm and  nm time courses          indicates an equilibrium between the M and N          intermediates that remains until pR returns to its          initial resting state          Bj et al reported a strong positive nm          transient absorbance increase in suspensions of membranes          prepared from           E coli expressing pR     This          positive absorbance difference is indicative of O          intermediate formation We looked for its presence in          partiallypurified samples reconstituted in DHPC in the          pH range  Data are shown only at pH  see Fig           Our observations at pH  do not show any evidence          of O intermediate formation Fig  Only at lower pH          values was a clear positive nm absorption change          observed data not shown This is in agreement with          results on bR for which O formation is also enhanced at          lower pH values and becomes small or nearly unobservable          in the alkaline range                          Dependence of the M intermediate on pH          Deprotonation of the Schiff base linkage of the          retinal and Lys is dependent on its pK           a which changes between          photointermediate states The Schiff base readily          undergoes deprotonation in the M intermediate However          no M intermediate formation occurs below a pH of           figure  instead the O intermediate predominates              Predominance of O at lower pH values is also observed          in bR However in bR the M intermediate is detectable at          low and high pHs but has a longer lifetime at higher pH          due to a longlived equilibrium between M and another          intermediate N     It seems likely that an N          intermediate of pR is similarly in equilibrium with its M          intermediate based on the fact that the transient          positive  nm absorbance increase is smaller than the          negative  nm bleach and the time course at  nm          shows a partial return to baseline on a timescale of           s          The difference in pH dependence between the pR and bR          photocycles can likely be attributed to differences in          the microenvironment of the Schiff base and is perhaps          related to absence of Glu in pR These adaptive          differences presumably optimize the proteins to operate          at maximum efficiency in the niches that their respective          organisms occupy In the case of the proteobacteria          which in the open ocean pH  occupy a          signficantly more alkaline environment than halobacteria          perhaps the protonrelease group is simply not under any          evolutionary pressure to be capable of deprotonating in          the M state at neutral pH In this view the principal          role of E and E in bR may to modulate the pK           a of the H release group in the M          state to a value lower than the pH of the organisms          external environment                          Fast proton release in pR          Under the same conditions where M is observed pH           and in  DHPC pR undergoes fast proton release during          its photocycle Fig  The pH indicator dye Cresol Red          was used to detect pH changes in the bulk aqueous phase          These turn out to be similar to those observed for bR in          the pH range  After photoexcitation pR like bR          presumably ejects a H from a residue near its          extracellular surface decreasing the pH of the solution          When the N  O transition takes place in bR H is taken          up from the medium raising the pH once again The H          signals from pR measured with Cresol Red occur on a time          scale similar to that assignable to M and N decay          returning to baseline about  s after photolysis          There is a clear kinetic correlation between M andor          N intermediate formation and fast H release in pR The          linkage between these two phenomena is further supported          by the observation that neither a transient nm          absorbance increase nor fast H release is shown to          occur at pH  and below Nor is either observed in the          absence of a reconstituting lipid DHPC in these          experiments          In bR the ejected proton is thought to originate from          a triad of amino acids REE However in pR a          homolog of only one of these three residues the          arginine is present This raises doubts about previous          conclusions regarding the specific roles of these           residues in fast H proton release in both pR and bR In          particular the apparently obligatory roles of E and          E in fast H release in bR are not matched in pR          Therefore even in bR it is less likely that these groups          themselves change protonation state between bR and M to          provide the H released to the bulk medium Instead it          now seems more likely that E and E merely help to          lower the pK           a of the H release group from above           the apparent value for pR into the vicinity of  for          bR It also seems very unlikely that the specific          structural configuration of  carboxylic acid groups and          arginine in bR could be conserved in pR even if as          suggested previously     other surface carboxylic          acids in pR could substitute in some ways for the roles          of E and E in bR          The only way that the H release mechanism can be          strongly conserved between bR and pR is if arginine          itself serves as the principal donor group for fast H          release in both with nearby residues such as E and          E merely modulating the pK           a of the arginine in the M          intermediate However it remains unclear how the pK           a of Arg in bR could be made          sufficiently low in its M intermediate to serve as the H          release group at pH values down to           Alternatively it is possible that the fast H release          we observe from pR at pH  may differ from that in bR          One possibility is that in pR the released proton could          come directly from the chromophore counterion Asp          This would be consistent with a proposed mechanism for          fast H release that has been observed above pH  in the          bR mutant EQ     In this mutant Asp was          detected by lowtemperature infrared difference          spectroscopy to be deprotonated only in the N          intermediate and not in M     It is not clear yet          whether Asp deprotonation in an Nlike state could          account for the protonrelease kinetics of pR Fig           or whether the M intermediate itself might have a          partiallydeprotonated Asp          The reason for the requirement of DHPC in M          intermediate formation and fast proton release is          unclear Delipidated bR in octylglucoside is fully          capable of M formation and presumably proton release          although with altered kinetics      The          requirement for pR to be in lipid to show fast H release          and M formation stems either from a proteinlipid          interaction needed to establish a stable active tertiary          structure or from the need for the phosphate group in          DHPC to act as a proton release group The latter seems          unlikely due to the DHPC molecule being zwitterionic at          pH  with no proton on the trimethylmodified nitrogen          of the choline Hence the DHPC most likely interacts          with the protein to effect minor structural changes          needed to place the active site residues in their          functional configuration                            Conclusions        A comparison of the primary sequences of pR and bR at        first glance seems as to preclude fast H release as part        of the protonpumping mechanism of pR due to the absence of        residues analogous to Glu and Glu  of bR However        fast H release is indeed observed in pR under conditions        where an M intermediate is formed Glu and Glu  in bR        play a role in fast H release that is apparently not        required for the mechanism of the bR family of proton        transporters It is therefore necessary to conclude that        either the H release groups in pR and bR are        nonhomologous surface carboxylic acid residues as        suggested previously     or else that a conserved        noncarboxylic acid residue ie Arg or Asp is        the H release group in pR The higher pH requirement for        the M intermediate of pR presumably corresponds with        adaptation to the more alkaline oceanic environment in        which the proteobacteria are found        The necessity of reconstituting pR with some lipid        before it is capable of photocycling shows that the        presence of lipids facilitates pR in assuming its fully        active structure         Ecoli expressed pR has        posttranslational modifications including  daltons        of substituents at one or more of its three cysteines Such        posttranslational modifications might also play a role in        explaining the different physiological properties of pR and        bR
