       DearPrudie                                                      Ihad an experience recently that Im not sure how to deal with A friend of mydaughters was at our house and I gave her a ride home During the trip shewas asking me a lot of sex questions  such as Do you think its OK to havesex with an older man and Is it normal to play with yourself The looksshe was giving me suggested she was talking about meand her She is only but the body is quite mature When we got to her house she hugged me and gaveme a kiss tongue and all Now I cant get her out of my mind Im sure shewants to have sex with me                                       CD                        Dear C            A fewwords come to my mind  Lolita  and jail If this happened as yousay the kid is big trouble and wildly precocious Or maybe she saw AmericanBeauty too many times To protect yourself in all ways do not allow anysituation to occur where you are alone with that girl As for getting her outof your mind do understand that your daughters friends plans for you makeyou the next thing to a science experiment You would be a notch on her beltand perhaps a candidate for her father to make your life a living hellPrudie suggests you not feel flattered by this proposition and get a gripQuick            Prudie sputteringly                                             DearPrudence                                                      Ifeel a little odd asking for help with this but you seem to have the savvy toget me through this awkward situation It stands thus I am engaged to bemarried next year to a wonderful young man Were both thrilled our parentsare happy and our mutual friends havent quit telling us that they told usso This seems like all is well The problem though is bridesmaids I wantto have a fairly simple wedding but there are two people I cant imaginegetting married without not counting the groom One of them is my oldestfriend who is now going to college several states away I have always promisedher she would be in my wedding The other one is my closest friend in collegewho has been there with me through the last four tough years Theyre bothexcited about it  the thing is I dont know how I can pick one or the otheras maid of honor Is there any way I can split the title What can Ido                                       Crossing My Fingers for an Answer                        Dear Cross            Youcan do what some corporations do They have copresidents and you can havecomaids of honor The distinction between a maid or matron of honor andbridesmaids is usually a different bouquet and walking down the aisle firstSimply have their bouquets be identical and perhaps have them walk togetherAnd in conversation refer to them as comaids of honor Now wasnt thatsimple And Prudie wishes you mazelton which of course is tons ofluck            Prudie ceremonially                                             Prudie                                                      Myboyfriend and I plan to marry next year However we have realized we cantpossibly receive any gifts simply because our tiny apartment is just barelybig enough for the two of us Anyhow I dont know how to say No gifts on theinvite because presumably people would ignore it So is it appropriate to askfor say money instead Help                                       Cramped                        Dear Cramp            Noit is not appropriate to have the invitations say No gifts just moneyplease due to space Prudie will give you the secret however for turninggifts into money Take the goodies back for a store credit  cashrefunds being most unusual At some point you can select something you willhave room for Or you can use the credit to buy a gift for someone when theoccasion demands it Or you can sell the store credit at a small discount ofcourse to a friend who you know is in need of purchasing whatever Andmazelton to you as well            Prudie practically                                             DearPrudence                                                      Iwork for a small familyowned company Two of the family members frequentlyshout and swear at each other Even though their abuse is never directed at mea nonfamily member I feel uncomfortable listening to this and am ready tostart job hunting Do you have any suggestions on how to handle the shoutingDo I ignore them Shout back Thanks                                       PeaceLover                        Dear Peace            It is not a good idea toshout at ones employer In the situation you describe that privilegeapparently comes with the blood relationship This is not an unheardofphenomenon by the way with certain volatile personalities who work togetherIt is always a strain on bystanders of course but often the underlyingrelationships of the shouters can be essentially friendly It is too bad whenthe lack of control and decorum in a place of business encourages jobhunting            IfPrudie thought it would be useful she would recommend that you tell theyelling duo that their form of communication is disturbing the rest of theoffice but she intuits that the hotheads are in the habit and will not changeIf your job hunt is unproductive try earplugs            Prudie pragmatically
