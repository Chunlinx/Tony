                                 EqualOpportunity Stereotyping                        Dear Jeffrey            To be perfectly honest I would prefer Big Herring If you musthang a moniker on me that has inevitable associations to a certain part of themale anatomy I figure it might as well start with Big            Now back to our show you fuckin mook What is a mook anyway            Heres why I did the right thing in hiring you as a TV criticand why Illlet you live for now You understood Christopher better than I did AndImperioli does deserve more credit Hes taken a character whos truly dim andcallow and found a way to give him a certain hapless appeal Christopher isntjust a good explanation for why the mobs tanking though with his crank andinability even to get his Godfather references straight for chrissakehes that too Hes a teenager in an adult body trying to grow up and gettingit wrong every time Imperioli located humanity in Christopher at exactly twopoints last year First when the guy had an identity crisis over the fact thathis murdered buddy was named on TV and he wasnt and second when he tried tohelp his girlfriend switch careers from cocktail waitress to music manager Theband she was representing sucked the producer she was making nice to was justtrying to get into her pants but Christopher overlooked all that because hewanted to make her happy Of course she walked out on him but thats howeverything Christopher does turns out What hes really evolving into is aninstant anxietybooster Whenever hes onscreen and manages not to do or saysomething that gets him shot Im hugely relieved            And now as if the chronically stupid Christopher and the paranoid UncleJunior and the wily batty Livia werent enough to make Tony strung out wevegot Richie Aprile What do you make of him Heres a made man fresh out ofprison looking to fuck people up and doing a good job of it so far He appearsin Episode  and by Episode  hes jumpstarted the season The showdefinitely goes into higher gear when hes around Hes sort of a Scorsesefigurelean mean and out of control All malevolence all the time He wantsto kill a guy for no apparent reason hes wooing Tonys sister hes visitingTonys mother Hes a whirlwind of bad karma Its as if having lost the Melfimethod of making Tony seem human the writers have struck on another way to doit play him off someone really angry and crazy so that the Soprano MO comesoff as sanity itself                                              modemT connectionDownload Windows Media Player                                                         Now on to Melfi You tell me Am I crazy Am I just soft on characters whohappen to be female professionals for the obvious reasons I really like herand as you know the whole psychiatric framing device Did you Or do you hateit One of my favorite film critics Jim Wolcott hated it He dissed LorraineBracco in Vanity Fair this month saying her psychobabble soundedmemorized I like the way she spoke in those sessions carefully choosing herwords and drawing out her syllables for fear that Tony would get the wrongidea which he usually did I loved it when she uttered banalities aboutneeding to let ones elderly parents retain an illusion of control and Tonyturned that into a sneaky strategy for letting Uncle Junior think he wasfronting the crew when Tony was really running things Shes back in Episode and not a moment too soon She runs into Tony and his gang at a restaurantand flirts with them of all things much to her dismay later when she repeatsto her shrink played by Peter Bogdanovich what she said when she wavedgoodbye Toodlefuckinoo What the fuck was I thinking I loved theway she said Toodlefuckinoo as if she were channeling Tonyspeak Weregonna get some weird plot twists with that one I can tell            Do I think The Sopranos is bad for ItalianAmericans Yeah but itsequalopportunity in its disrespect for ethnic sensitivity What about theHasid who hired Tony to rough up his soninlaw and then welshed on hispayments I loved the soninlaw by the way He was so gutsy A real toughJew You have more Hasidic friends than I do Were you offended Were theyWhat about the streetwise rapper who turns out to be a college kid with asociology degree Or the black preacher on the take whom we meet in Episode of this season What about the condescending Wasps who let Tony into theircountry club exactly once then treated him like he was some kind of freak Noone comes off without stereotyping but its like Shakespeare and Shylock if Imay get all highminded on you again A good writer takes stereotypes andturns them into characters which in turns makes you reconsider thestereotypes Unless youre one of those people who wont go see The Merchantof Venice because its antiSemitic            A reader wrote in to suggest that the writers clone Livia and create a twinwhos a nun in San Francisco and sweet as a lamb and who cant believe thethings shes hearing about her nephew on TV its such a horrible smear onItalianAmericans Which strikes me as an excellent way to solve the Liviaproblem Got any other suggestions for the writers            YoursJudith Really Huge Herring
