                                 Dark and Stormy Nights            Fifteen minutes into TheGingerbread Man  the Robert Altman thriller based on a story by JohnGrisham I found myself scribbling in my notebook Robert Altman is GodHere amid the seemingly aimless hubbub the muddy narrative the looseframing and the faraway characters a sense of placeSavannahhad begun toemerge and also a freefloating anxiety No one knows whats under the surfaceof these people no one knows anything  The scary side of the cityfeatured in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil has never beencaptured with such brusque poetry and Altman seems to pull the portrait out ofhis hat            At theprecise moment that I was declaring really revisiting my reverence for thegreat director the elderly couple sitting next to me was grumbling            I cant understand a wordtheyre saying Can you understand a word theyre sayingI dont know whatsgoing onStupid movie Whats going on Do you want to go            I stifledan urge to whisper If you leave now you can catch the Matlockrerunwhich would have been snotty but not completely off the pointMatlock is what they expected and what they got was AltmansMatlock  the same sort of subnoir story line but with the camera movedback a clinical distance and the soundtrack rendered clangorous disharmonicThe Gingerbread Man is to Matlock what The Rite of Springis to the Rockettes            Its also to be honest only a fairtomiddling mystery Iguessed the endingnot just the major revelations but who would live and whowould diein the first halfhour and Im no Matlock But the movie is still adelight a fascinatingly strange and chaotic ballet set to familiar noirmotifs Altman had me hooked from the credits in which the camera cruises highabove an eerie topographyboth parched and veined with swampswhile thecomposer Mark Isham serves up offthebeat thumps and hollow brass gongs andfragments of cellphone conversations remain just on the far side ofaudibility Altman makes you work to pick up dialogue to follow the threadsto figure outalways after the factjust what peoples motivations were Hisframing is the least insistent of any major director which is especiallyradical in a genre where audiences are accustomed to having their gazedirected The actors seem caught on the fly they give performances that dontseem like performances and are the richer for it            KennethBranagh has never been finer and thats saying something As Rick Magruder aSavannah defense attorney famed for keeping scum bags out of prison hes astrutting cock a chainsmoking hothead who thinks with his pecker Thecharacter stays remote and selfinvolved and a bit of a fool and becauseBranagh never asks for sympathy I found myself giving him plenty much as Ivegiven my sympathy to another Southern peckerhead with spotty morals whos beenin the news of late Anyway its hard to tsktsk the man when his chiefmotivation is bedding Embeth Davidtz as Mallory Doss a darkeyedneurasthenic enigma with the Souths most willowy gams Seemingly terrorized byher hootingmad derelict father Robert Duvall in a hilarious cameo Dossdoffs her duds at the first opportunity and promptly has the hapless attorneyon a very tight retainer The brilliant cinematographer Changwei Gushoots her nude through a doorway of hanging beads and in closeup through afogged raindrizzled

hair thick glasses and asensibly reticent demeanor In one stroke this underrated actress takesherself out of the blondairhead class As a dissolute partyhearty privateinvestigator Robert Downey Jr

probably is Theres somethingarrogant about this directors refusal to panderbut its a splendidarrogance An Altman film is like a box of chocolates You never know whatyoure gonna getnougat or arsenic So you stay braced alert Unlike mostcontemporary cinema you dont leave an Altman movie feeling dumber than whenyou went in            Where Altman keeps you at a distance the Mexicanborndirector Alfonso Cuarn  A Little Princess  pulls you deep inside hischaracters heads Already Cuarn is one of the most accomplished subjectivefilmmakers alive Through his camera the external world becomes transfiguredby emotion so that everythingeven what might not be literally trueseemsreal  What better director to film a Dickens novel Cuarns GreatExpectations  which has been updated to Gulf Coast Florida and the New Yorkart world of the s and given a rock n roll backbeat is fluid and lyricaland thoroughly transporting Ive read the Dickens original over and over andseen all the previous adaptations yet I didnt for an instant yearn for th century Londonat least not until the movie had ended when Iwas scratching my head over why it finally seemed so unDickensianlyminiature            The goodstuff first The hero is no longer Pip but Finn who is frolicking in the wavesamong the gulls when a shackled and bloodied escaped killer Robert De Niroerupts from the water and forces him to bring food and drink and a tool forcutting chains When Finn returns the scene has an eyepopping storybookterror with its cocked frames its sharp reeds standing out from the deepblack night sky and with De Niro giving the young boy that patentedsourstomachbogeyman grimace            After the convict overture we learn thatFinnwho has a gift for drawing and paintinglives with his sister MaggieKim Dickens and brotherinlaw Joe Chris Cooper in a ramshackle house bythe gulf Joe catches fish and Maggie gets laid by other guysand splits Whathappens then is an enchanting blend of old and new as Finn is summoned to themanse of Nora Dinsmoor Anne Bancroft a filthyrich exsocialite driven madby her abandonment decades earlier by a wayward fiance But its Dinsmoorsniece Estella who becomes the focus of Finns fantasy lifeand art            Thelittle blonde is pretty but no enchantressshes too glum and snooty Growingup to be Gwyneth Paltrow makes her more bewitching but no less blank Paltrowas ever is inhumanly gorgeous like some Close Encounters of the ThirdKind creature with that elongated neck and those stringy limbs that bigface with its faintly mocking beatitude I cant decide if the woman is anactress since shes able to get by so easily without doing all that muchPaltrow certainly doesnt appear to have suffered for her art Unlike otherscreen beautiesMichelle Pfeiffer Jessica Lange Madeleine Stoweshe doesntseem to have any interesting neuroses to ply In Great Expectations  shenever makes the leap from erotic object to fleshandblood human and thatsnot just the fault of the script and director Were told of Estellas innerstruggleof the tug of war between the punishing cocktease that her aunt hasengineered her to be and her inherent decencybut the conflict isnt palpablein Paltrows paltry performance            Nor does the grownup Finn Ethan Hawke develop muchstature When an anonymous benefactor provides him with the means to travel toNew York and show his paintings at a SoHo gallery he goes somewhat mulishlyHe never becomes absorbed into the art world and its blackclad poseurs alwaysremaining a glassyeyed outsider Finns awkwardness keeps him inoffensive butit thoroughly obviates the dramatic arc thats the whole point of Dickensnovel If success doesnt change Finn for the worse then his rejection of thehigh life doesnt entail the same kind of sacrificesor come as a consequenceof some harrowing epiphany And so the movie after a miniclimax or two justcomes to an end suddenly smaller than the sum of its parts                           GreatExpectations is magical anywayjust this side of surreal Finn tells usthat Dinsmoors room smelled like dead flowers and cat piss and I mean nodisrespect when I say that Bancrofts performance evokes those same
