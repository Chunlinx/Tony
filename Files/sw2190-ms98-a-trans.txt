        oh go ahead i i am glad to talk to an expert i always wanted to know who an expert was   oh well im not an expert i just had a little ive ive seen a little pollution in my time its uh   uh   the the chemicals we were dealing with were uh a Raid repellent and uh that was really quite dangerous im not certain that that was thats thats really a pollution issue i think pollution issue is is uh is is the argument over over people catching uh things like uh respiratory disease   uh well there theres two things uh the one im interested the most i guess myself uh would be the the Freons i mean for air conditioning the one i guess thats the one im most curious about is how theyre going to replace the Freons in airconditioning that seemed to be the biggest surprise to me and whether when they replace it you know theyre going to really come up with something that is not just as bad   well the you know that thats another arguable issue and i ive seen the uh uh uh assuming you can buy into global warming i   yeah yeah i uh was uh you know where they were all concerned about that but that that it seems to be   well did you see Carl Sagan on Sixty Minutes on uh when he was talking about when if if the if the war started in in Kuwait and theyd set those uh all the   no i heard about it though   uh it was it was it was interesting but uh im just curious what he has to say now that theyve got them all lit   was that before i didnt see it was that before they actually did that or it was what   yes and his argument was uh was that that you would see a uh a year with no summer which actually happened and it it actually yes it actually happened uh   because of that you know   it was a volcano erupted and it was high enough up but uh they had some people from the national meteorological center i think it was the  which is the national anyway research people and they said that the uh that the pollution would not go high enough and its its going to be interesting to see if Carl Sagan and his billions and billions of stars may have once made a mistake but   right   the the the the the  the general the opinion among among the uh meteorologists at uh im uh member of the American Meteorological Society and   are you dont you dont work at TI   yeah i do   oh okay   but im uh i only i do that in my formalize   where do you work in research or   no im a planner a production planner   oh okay   but i i im in the active reserves as a weatherman so   no okay yeah   uh i i keep up from time to time but what the the argument is that uh that uh maybe there isnt global warming and maybe there is but um if there is uh we probably could do something about it now and if there isnt if there isnt and we do some the right things i think how do you feel about about all this smog and mess stuff on cars   yeah uh well im kind of a car buff myself i was going to ask you another question but uh i ill do that in a minute i i think that the changing you know from leaded fuel was a tremendous advantage   well do you have an older car   you know not not using no no no   i i have been working on an older car but it to yeah   really oh im a car buff too we ought to work talk about that one day uh uh   well im restoring one   i think you can use the you can use high you know the ninety two percent uh ninety two octane i dont think youll have any trouble   im not having any problem its a seventy   oh yeah yeah   and uh   no i i think uh i uh work on my own cars and uh i dont think thats a problem i thought im saying i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline   but did you have another question you said you had another question   uh oh yeah i the same thing about the war uh or related to the war on i was watching CNN and i cannot remember what station it was what did you see the advertisements uh when they talked about nuclear war what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere it is so scary that i hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster you know did you see any of those uh i it was   yeah no i didnt see that that i know that the uh thats   it must have been channel thirteen i dont recall although i thought it was on CNN oh i   well that they talked nuclear winner and and i suppose thats thats the ultimate uh pollution problem   it was a somewhat of a commercial because it came i saw it regularly and it showed that and it was really devastating and it would uh   well   how much ash would fall and and how it would essentially literally destroy the world you know   well its interesting that the Chernobyl accident uh actually um because the circulation budget as high as it went um covered a a fairly remarkable amount they did some tracers and they i i think its drawn in uh i think gets in there because i cant think of the other trace but i saw a a presentation on on that and they it went quite a long ways but i i i guess i can be a little sympathetic but you know theres some argument that in in in the blue grass of Kentucky that the Smoky Mountains that thats the uh the pine trees giving off pollution and   oh really yeah there theres probably a lot of natural things uh   but the but when you see when you get up in the morning in in Dallas and and see all that haze from west Texas is that is that pollution   yeah uh it i guess its got to be really i dont know i dont know if its air pollution its uh its dust pollution whether its natural or not i dont know   well it thats the thing is that i think i think Dallas really does have a problem in this the idea if we could get some cleaner fuel burning fuel the problem is is its like Los Angeles people dont people dont want to use mass transit so   yeah oh yeah well i live in Arlington and there there there are no buses i mean there there is the only school bus the only buses you see are school buses so   but who wants to who wants to um ride a bus   well i know it its uh you know the car is we have this big romance with the car but uh i think people are would be interested if you had one i mean   well my boss drives forty miles one way each day   yeah   and one of the guys that works with me drives forty five miles   yeah   and and they dont think it well i guess they do think something of it but um not enough to you know you consider how much um but then you get into all these issues of of whether it its the types of pollution and what its doing to your lungs and are we going to die of of respiratory so we all move out of the out of the   yeah   out of downtown so we get away from the the smog my my wife grew up in southern California and they moved out to the valley before Los Angeles uh when when the valley was clean   yeah   and now the valley is not and so people move out one more valley and   well you said you were car buff uh i think that uh all of us could use one electric car right now i mean today because i think uh   yes yes   you said people drive forty miles and fifty whatever yeah when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car but i think we all could in a family say have an electric car where my one of my daughters or my wife my wife she could use one now if they had one you know   well do you know   because they she dont even she doesnt put fifty miles a day on the car   General Motors apparently has one that theyre theyre testing i think its no its alcohol vehicles that theyre testing almost   no no youre right i i have seen them but uh they have a battery car   but they   uh i went to the auto show this past week and they did not endorse now that i think of it   suppose   and i was so interested in the auto show i didnt think to ask anybody there were no electric cars i was surprised but now that you just mentioned that   huh well the Road and Track was talking about that this apparently General Motors has some uh they apparently think theyre close   yeah i i think uh there could be a lot of people i think people close this is really were were nine years away or less i guess from the next century and i think   well there theres still a lot of research i was over in in the research lab a couple i guess its been about a month ago and saw this there have been research it was a little light that says solar solar powered research   yeah theyve got a theyve got a area over in the SE building too which is uh but its a solar uh its for uh they got got some money from a power company and its probably more generating power for you know uh electricity a hundred and twenty volt or whatever   yeah well do you work in that C building   no im actually in the south building but uh   oh well im at   i was uh im the facility so ive been in all most of the buildings anyway   oh well im in im in the C building been there for all my life   oh yeah well the the solar area is right right around from the auditorium now and they theyve got several different uh areas where theyre called solar lab   huh   its right there on the first floor you ought to walk by there   well thats been a  i know the focal plain array is they were taking space to for a long time   yeah but the solar project you know TIs been into it for years and i guess its just not uh economical yet because of the other fuels   well the problem is that gas at a dollar a a gallon you know who wants to yeah i mean we want to not pollute but uh at a dollar a gallon uh its hard to beat the amount of energy you get from   yeah ive seen some i think then again im surprised now i didnt think theyd asked anybody when i was in the auto show there was nothing uh and there was no  place for air pollution or companies or anyone there it was just pure automobiles   well i thought i saw an ad for Volkswagen that had an alcohol   there   they had one with spots on it and something i didnt go but it was it was showing they i mean uh   hum i didnt see did you go   an article no i didnt i didnt go so i wish   oh i i was uh quite impressed with all the cars you know the engines are so much smaller now and everything and theyre they all have brand new engines even General Motors uh very few only the Caprice and them and the Cadillac had eight uh the old Vs theyre all brand new engines uh of course theyre burning gasoline of course   theyve done a lot   now and uh whether you know thats one way you know uh uh for on air pollution i i i dont know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really theyve got catalytic converters everyone seem to have gone to that whether they last uh and do a good job and now that they the inspection systems are analyzing that uh well what do you think if youre in that you know if youre concerned about that i mean if youre youre youre knowledgeable on that   well there well they uh its interesting though because my cars are older and so i didnt have to if you live in Dallas County you have to have your have to have it checked and its great i had a friend with a Fiero that uh they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of terrible getting that pinned and so apparently
