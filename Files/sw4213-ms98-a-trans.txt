        all right   gun control means using two hands      yeah uh well i fill like uh there should be some gun control but uh i dont fill like you know um uh just regular normal person that just using it for hunting and stuff shouldnt have to pay for other people mistakes   oh i agree i mean i dont see any particular sporting purpose in anything that explodes when it arise   yeah   and i cant quite understand what i do you know what you a rational for a machine gun   thats true   but i mean to say that the quote assault rifle is you know a bad thing all that is is a change in a stock configuration   yeah   if you think about it   umhum well thats true   because you know they been making semi automatic classically style if you will rifle for years   yeah   and the and the only thing between the assault rifle and that is a stock is a stock change   yeah thats for sure   what can i say right     uh yeah and uh well the uh huh im trying to think what to say here   oh okay yeah i just uh you know i just cant quite understand its interesting is uh i get down to Texas quite a bit   yeah   and uh you know its interesting how when you get away from you know north of the middle of Virginia   yeah   how altitude change   yeah  different different altitude different places you know its its just like well im originally from Wyoming so   umhum   out there you always see guns because of ranchers and farmers use them all the time you know it   well im from central Virginia and its you know its not uncommon at all to drive down the road and you know theres a you know the the shotgun is in the back of the pickup   yeah   you know       and so it just you know what you get up here it gets really weird     yeah its well thats the way it is around here you know especially you know you get  closer to uh bigger cities and stuff and its   right where where are you from in Dallas   well im   i mean from Texas   im at Fort Worth which is right out right to the west of Dallas   okay yeah i flown into Dallas Fort Worth a bit so   yeah uh but you you know they they all have there problem down here too you know with guns gun control and stuff   uh   but its you know its its significant i just detected a significantly different altitude like up here you would find it very difficult to go to like most of the sporting good stores up here hardly they may carry firearms but would have to hunt for them   yeah   and you go to Texas and thats just part of the store   yeah oh i see what you are saying so   yeah you know i mean you might go you would to you know go to a major chain like a KMart   yeah   is you will have a hard time up here in a KMart finding somebody to sell you a gun if they may have three or four of them on display   yeah   when you go to a KMart in Texas in you know thats a major section of the sporting good section that all the difference im saying   oh well so when it   they dont even  totally different   yeah so in in other words they they make you wait or you   uh Virginias by county is theres no wait for a long gun   yeah   theres in some county its whatever the county wants statewide theres no wait   yeah   which is stupid because if i dont want to wait three days in the county that i live in ill drive to the next county there isnt a wait   yeah   you know   yeah i see what you are saying there   you know  i mean that you know its uh in fact they got big trouble is Washington DC is got total band on firearms   yeah   you cant own one   well yeah theyve   but theyre killing each other by you know five and six a night in that city   yeah because because they get them form the black market and stuff   well but you understand what im saying is is their gun control is a hundred percent but it doesnt work so now they say well we got to you know theyre saying Virginia and Maryland got to have gun control so they cant you cant buy gun gun in Virginia and Maryland and bring them to DC   yeah   but theyre still going to have problems though   no they just steal them   yeah well they break into somebody house and just take their guns   oh they dont break into to people houses they
