                ive uh oh uh are you there all right okay  um   yes sir im right here   im in an area where um we can uh enjoy it year round so ive actually been uh uh been out within the past couple of weeks im mainly freshwater fisherman how about yourself   well actually ive done both kinds uh im originally from the state of Virginia   umhum umhum   and uh lived uh near Virginia Beach where we could uh surf cast and uh catch a lot of things in the ocean there   do you ever did you ever do the James River   i dont believe i have fished the James River   um   theres a possibility but that was so long ago i moved here to to State College uh in nineteen fifty five and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and we have a lot of uh beautiful fresh water streams that come through this this area im in an area called Center County which is in the very center of the state of Pennsylvania   ive  ive been in that area and the trout fishings supposed to be legendary   the trout fishing is really uh beautiful as i say the the streams are oh eight ten fifteen feet wide and so forth and uh you you stand on the edge and you you cast out and you you work uh from your feet most of the time and then there are there are a few lakes of course close by   uhhuh for brookies what do you like brookies or uh rainbows or   well tell you the truth im im not uh not picky i wherever the area whatever the fish is the specialist in that area i uh i enjoy fishing for it and i try to i havent fished in several years ill have to admit   umhum   but when i do fish i do contact uh some of the local specialists   yeah   so that i can then find out the uh the type of lures that they use and where they fish and any unique uh techniques that would help you   do you fly fish or are those streams too small   uh no we fly we fly fish umhum   yeah i used to do that a little when i lived up in New York but   uhhuh   right now its uh uh bass and striped bass is the only thing that uh i go for down in Dallas in uh Texas   oh thats a pretty big fish   uh yeah theyre theyve uh the striped bass have accommodated themselves to the big fresh water lakes and theyre pretty exciting when theyre when theyre running   uhhuh   its a salt water fish in fresh water uh environment its   well well our our streams streams here are replanted with fish uh about every year   its all put and take   so that well they they they uh they have a pretty good idea of of uh what what the number of fish are in these various locations and   umhum   and they have  have certain areas that they plant you know a hundred here and a hundred there and this is of course x number of weeks or months before fishing season opens so   whats the season April to September October or something like that   that sounds about right umhum pretty close   umhum yeah whats a license cost   yeah well as i say its been several years but the licenses werent that expensive i seems to sticks in my mind five to seven dollars is about all what i remember   yeah uhhuh its about the same as Texas yeah   uhhuh and i have oh probably a a half a dozen different kinds of uh fishing poles and and fly rods and so forth and and i had been so busy in my work in these last few years that i havent had time to fish but im going to be retiring at the end of December and i i hope uh the next fishing season that i can sort of get back in and uh enjoy that that that was a really enjoyable uh thing for me to do   well i have all sons so i think im probably going to be fishing for a long time   huh i just have one son and he he lives uh out of the state now or rather in the eastern corner of it so i dont think he has time to fish either   i caught the disease from my father and im passing it on to my children its really   oh is that right   they love it yeah   oh my goodness well i i uh the disease i caught was simply because uh i was i was i was in the Norfolk Portsmouth area and people there theres theres so much water around that you you youre either boating or youre fishing   right uhhuh right right   and uh i fairly enjoyed it that time i have a small uh aluminum boat here that uh when i go on one of the large lakes that we have here that i enjoy fishing for for trout   umhum what what are the  i i dont i dont know about the lakes in central Pennsylvania are there many   from that well as i say im in Center Center County theres um there are two different size lakes about well five five to six miles from State College now these arent huge lakes from your point of view but they are probably fifteen twenty acres maybe   umhum umhum umhum   which which here is a lot of water where boats
