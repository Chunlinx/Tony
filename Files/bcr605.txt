                    Introduction        The San Francisco Bay Area reports some of the highest        breast cancer rates in the world      Within this        region appropriately adjusted breast cancer incidence and        mortality rates are highest in Marin County a small urban        county of  predominantly white nonHispanic        residents located immediately north of the city of San        Francisco Averaged over the period  ageadjusted        invasive breast cancer rates per  white        nonHispanic women were  in Marin County  in the        rest of the San Francisco Bay Area and  in the United        States as a whole     Pronounced international and        national geographic variation in breast cancer rates has        been studied extensively         and has been        attributed variously to population differences in the use        of mammographic screening diet physical activity body        size alcohol consumption and socioeconomic and        reproductive factors         However studies of        breast cancer incidence among Asian migrants to North        America have noted associations with age at migration        suggesting additional important influences of childhood or        adolescent exposures or experiences       With regard        to Marin County an earlier study by the Northern        California Cancer Center NCCC using census data suggested        that the high incidence was associated with the        sociodemographic characteristics of the county and not with        a geographically specific exposure    and that women        living in Marin County have a higher prevalence of some        recognized breast cancer risk factors such as high        education and income as well as low and late parity                    In  members of Marin Breast Cancer Watch a        grassroots nonprofit organization of breast cancer        survivors and advocates recruited researchers to help them        to investigate causes of breast cancer in Marin County more        thoroughly these community members actively participated        in all aspects of conducting this study        In this populationbased casecontrol study of women        residing in Marin County we asked about generally        recognized risk factors     and a variety of        adolescent physical psychological and social factors The        main purpose in this first report is to compare generally        recognized breast cancer risk factors as well as childhood        and adolescent socioeconomic factors and years of residence        in Marin County for women with and without breast cancer        Although it was not the purpose of this study to explain        the high rates of breast cancer in Marin County one        hypothesis of the study was that if exposures specific to        Marin County were to some degree responsible for the high        rates there one would expect women with breast cancer to        have lived longer in Marin County than control women after        adjustment for generally recognized breast cancer risk        factors The thought was that finding such a difference        would provide justification for a more detailed exploration        of exposures specific to Marin County whereas no        difference would motivate research into other explanations        Thus this initial report provides important information        for planning future studies in this and other highrisk        areas                    Methods                  Casecontrol ascertainment          Eligible cases included any female resident of Marin          County with a diagnosis of primary breast cancer between          July  and June  if under  years of age and          between July  and March  if  years old or older          at diagnosis Table  Dates were chosen to yield about           women overall  under  years of age and  aged           and over The sample size was planned with           statistical power to detect fold odds ratios ORs          between the highest and lowest quartiles of any          continuous variable fold ORs for quartile trend a          year casecontrol difference in age at menarche and          a year casecontrol difference in years lived in          Marin Names and addresses of these women and their          physicians were obtained from the cancer registry          operated by the NCCC a participant in the National          Cancer Institutes NCIs Surveillance Epidemiology          and End Results program After receiving an introductory          letter women who did not refuse by postcard were          telephoned by a study interviewer to arrange a time and          place for the inperson interview          Control women without breast cancer were ascertained          through random digit dialing RDD by using a          modification of the method of Waksberg     and were          frequencymatched to cases by age at diagnosis within           years and ethnicity To maximize the chances of reaching          residential numbers seed numbers used for dialing          included the area code plus the first five digits of the          studys cases and all cancer cases diagnosed in Marin          County in  All possible numbers other than the          cases numbers were generated and randomly sorted The          RDD contractor also generated a batch of about  random          numbers from marketing sources to increase the number of          calls to households with women aged  years and older          Randomly sorted numbers were called sequentially Two          survey research companies Survey Methods and Field          Research Corporation both of San Francisco California          conducted RDD and preliminary eligibility screening of          controls RDD was conducted from April  to August                    The University of California San Francisco Committee          on Human Research approved the study methods and          informed consent was obtained from all participants                          Interviews          The approximately hour inperson interviews were          conducted at a place of each subjects choosing Because          many questions required the recall of adolescent factors          the interview used three memory tools developed during          the pilot phase of this study a visualization exercise          a magnetic memory board and photographs of girls at          various stages of development in a variety of social          settings The magnetic memory board consisted of a sheet          with rows showing the subjects age  years the          corresponding year and memorable historic events that          occurred during each year As women went through the          questionnaire magnets with major life events such as          moves school changes births and deaths in the family          were placed in the appropriate row for the age or year in          which the events occurred All contemporary factors were          asked of cases up to or around diagnosis date and of          controls up to the date of interview The questionnaire          included factors that have been summarized elsewhere              as being either established or strongly suspected          risk factors for breast cancer Women who did not wish to          participate in the full interview were asked to complete          a brief telephone interview that included a subset of the          full interview questions          Questionnaire items pertinent to this report included          detailed residential and school histories before age           years such as location ownership or rental and dates          in and out highest level of schooling total time of          residence in Marin and

subjects age   and           years other measures of familys socioeconomic          conditions including selfassessed socioeconomic status          currently and before age  years ages at menarche and          menopause and menopausal status alcohol use and tobacco          use and exposures reproductive and breastfeeding          history family history of breast cancer type and ages          of

and height at various times in life not          including the times that the woman was pregnant or          nursing or during the first  months after pregnancy          Case interviews were conducted from December  to          September  and control interviews were conducted from          April  to September                           Data analysis methods          We computed frequencies of categorical variables and          means standard errors and medians of continuous          variables separately for cases and controls Continuous          data also were categorized into quartiles determined by          the control group distributions Analysis of variance was          used to compare unadjusted means and Wilcoxon tests were          used to compare medians of continuous variables for cases          and controls Casecontrol ORs and  CIs were estimated          for categorical and quartiled data by using logistic          regression Preliminary analyses made adjustments for          year age groups these analyses included telephone          interview respondents for variables asked in both the          full and abbreviated interviews After a review of          results of the preliminary ageadjusted analyses a          subset of the many variables was selected for inclusion          in a multivariate model these included variables that          are established or strongly suspected risk factors for          breast cancer that might confound other results and those          that were statistically significant in ageadjusted          comparisons Age was included in all models In addition          ORs for residential history variables were adjusted for          other variables included in the multivariate model but          not for each other because the various residential          variables were not mutually exclusive Multivariate ORs          were estimated with logistic regression and included only          those subjects with inperson interviews and nonmissing          data for all the variables in the model          Analyses were conducted across all age groups as well          as separately for women under  years of age and           years of age and older These two age groups were chosen          for separate analyses before any data collection because          the direction and magnitude of several important breast          cancer risk factors seem to vary by age              Furthermore we specifically chose not to analyze women          separately by premenopausal and postmenopausal status          because the many perimenopausal women do not readily fit          into either category ORs of less than  are given two          decimal places those greater than or equal to  are          given one decimal place to achieve comparable          accuracy          Residences at birth and before age  years were          grouped into eight broad geographic regions based on the          geographic variation of breast cancer mortality as shown          in the NCIs Atlas of Cancer Mortality     These          regions were Northeast Maine New Hampshire Vermont          Massachusetts Connecticut New Jersey New York          Pennsylvania Delaware Washington DC Rhode Island and          Maryland Great Lakes Minnesota Iowa Illinois          Wisconsin Michigan Indiana and Ohio Plains North          Dakota South Dakota Nebraska Kansas and Montana          South Oklahoma Missouri Arkansas Louisiana          Mississippi Alabama Tennessee Kentucky West Virginia          Virginia North Carolina South Carolina Georgia          Florida and Texas West Idaho Wyoming Utah          Colorado Arizona New Mexico Alaska and Hawaii          Northwest Washington Oregon and Nevada California          and not in the USA                            Results                  Subject ascertainment and interviews          Table shows participation rates for cases and          controls and the footnote gives details on the numbers          and disposition of calls made through RDD Ages and          ethnicities of cases and controls that completed the full          interview were very similar by study design Table           Because only  eligible women about  had died by the          time of the study we did not conduct proxy interviews          Of the  cases and  controls completing the          inperson interview complete data for all variables          considered in the multivariate model were available for           cases and  controls                          Risk factors                      Personal and family health history            As shown in Table  there were no substantial or            statistically significant differences in the            frequencies of cases and controls reporting a            firstdegree relative with breast cancer or a history            of benign breast biopsy Cases were somewhat more            likely than controls to report previous radiation            treatments for conditions other than breast cancer and            the OR was significantly elevated in women under the            age of  years Table  However on closer            inspection four cases and four of the controls reported            radiation treatments to the upper body whereas two            cases and no controls reported radiation treatment for            plantar warts            There were no differences in average or median age            at menarche for cases and controls average was               for cases and    for controls and no            statistically significant trends with age at menarche            in either age group Table  Among women under the            age of  years cases were about half as likely as            controls to have begun menarche at age  years or            older but the results were not significant Table             In both age groups cases were more likely to be            premenopausal at diagnosis than controls at a similar            age Table  Similar proportions of cases  and            controls  reported having had both ovaries            removed  of cases and  of controls had both            ovaries removed before age  years Cases were more            likely than controls to have had a history of uterine            or ovarian cancer OR    CI  but            the result was not statistically significant            Some of the associations of reproductive factors            differed by age group Among women aged  years and            older compared with women who had never been pregnant            cases were more than twice as likely as controls to            have been pregnant or parous without breastfeeding            Table  However there were no differences between            these cases and controls in average age at first            pregnancy    years for cases and               years for controls or at first birth    years            for cases and    years for controls and no            suggestions of trends with numbers of births Table             Among women who breastfed there was no difference            between cases and controls in duration of breastfeeding            mean durations    months for cases               months for controls categorized data presented in            Table  Among women under the age of  years cases            were more likely than controls to have never been            pregnant but the differences were not statistically            significant Table  In categorized data women with            three or more births or more than  months of            breastfeeding had significantly reduced ORs compared            with women who were never pregnant Table  As with            women aged  and older there were no trends evident            for and no differences in average ages at first            pregnancy cases    years controls               years or first birth cases    years controls               years            Significantly fewer cases than controls had ever            used birth control pills in both age groups Table             There were no apparent trends with total time used            compared with women who never used birth control pills            the use of birth control pills for up to  years             years  years and more than  years had ORs of              CI    CI               CI  and   CI             respectively There was also no difference with current            use versus past use            About equal percentages of cases  and            controls  had ever taken hormone replacement            therapy and there were similar percentages who had            taken combination therapy Table             Cases and controls had similar average and median            maximum lifetime heights of about  inches  cm            There were no notable differences in highest or lowest            postpubertal body mass index before age  years the            median highest body mass index for both cases and            controls was  kgm  and the median lowest body            mass index was  kgm for cases and  kgm for            controls or in lowest body mass index after age             years However in both age groups the highest body            mass index after age  years was lower in cases than            in controls the median highest body mass index was             kgm for cases and  kgm for controls            categorized data are presented in Table  A similar            result was found by using body mass index  year before            diagnosis for cases and before interview for            controls            We also conducted an analysis of perimenopausal and            postmenopausal women that stratified body mass index by            hormone replacement therapy use adjusting for other            variables in the multivariate model in comparison with            women who had not used hormone replacement therapy and            had a body mass index of less than  kgm  cases            were significantly less likely than controls to report            a highest body mass index of more than  regardless            of whether they had used hormone replacement therapy            OR    CI  or not OR               CI             Over all and in both age groups cases were more            than twice as likely as controls to have had four or            more mammograms during the period  Table             Regarding other factors related to health care access            and use all but  of cases and  of controls had            health insurance For the period  among women            under the age of  years cases were somewhat less            likely than controls  versus  to have clinical            breast exams yearly or more often whereas cases and            controls were about equally likely  of cases and             of controls to have an annual or more frequent            pelvic exam During this same period for women aged             years and older about  of cases and  of controls            reported annual or more frequent clinical breast exams            and  of cases and  of controls reported annual or            more frequent pelvic exams and pap tests                                Socioeconomic factors            Over all ages there were no meaningful or            statistically significant differences between cases and            controls for current or past socioeconomic indicators            except that cases were more likely than controls to            report their familys socioeconomic strata before age             years as upper Table  However no difference            was noted when women in this small category of women             of cases and  of controls were combined with            the upper middle category Table  The            selfreported socioeconomic status at the time of            diagnosis for cases and interview for controls was very            similar for cases and controls  of cases and  of            controls reported their status as poor working            class or lower middle  of both cases and            controls reported middle and  of cases and  of            controls reported upper middle or upper Both cases            and controls had a median of  years of education            There was some indication that casecontrol            associations of socioeconomic factors differed between            women  years and older and those under  years For            example among women aged  years and older cases            were more likely than controls to report their family            socioeconomic status as upper or upper middle before            age  years Table  Although this finding was            largely due to the small group of women classifying            themselves as upper consistent with this was the            observation that  of cases versus  of controls            reported their fathers to have been selfemployed or            business owners when the subjects were  years old              P   In contrast among            women under  years old there was a nonsignificant            inverse association with increasing selfreported            family socioeconomic status before age  years Table             Consistent with this was the observation that case            families spent significantly more time on average than            control families in rental residences before age             years    years versus    years             P   and cases were less            likely than controls to report that their fathers had a            college degree  versus              P   or that their father            held a supervisory position for example  versus             at subjects age              P                                  Religion            Over all ages significantly fewer cases than            controls were raised with no specific religion and            among women aged  and over cases were less likely            than controls to report having been raised in religions            other than Protestant Catholic or Jewish Table                                            Alcohol consumption            Women with breast cancer were significantly less            likely than control women to report having drunk            alcoholic beverages before age  years Table             Consistent with this finding was the fact that cases            also reported significantly fewer average or median            numbers of drinks than controls before age  years            median  versus              P   However women with            breast cancer reported a higher frequency of drinking            alcohol after age  years than controls and there was            a trend with increasing average frequency of drinking            irrespective of age group Table  that was            statistically significant among women less than             years old                                Tobacco exposures            Although equivalent percentages of cases and            controls had ever smoked cigarettes  and             respectively cases were more likely than controls to            report more than  packyears Table   years            was the cutoff point for the upper quartile of            packyears smoked among controls This association was            also significant for women aged  and over but there            was no trend with increasing packyears smoked below            the highest quartile Table  With regard to passive            exposure to tobacco smoke  of cases and  of            controls had ever lived in a household with a smoker            before age  years and  of cases and  of            controls had ever lived in a household with a smoker            after age  years with no trend for duration of            exposure in either age group                                Residence history            As shown in Table  there were no substantial            differences in geographic area of birth or places ever            lived before age  years among women overall or women            over age  years However among women under the age            of  years a significantly higher percentage of cases            than controls reported having been born in or having            ever lived in the Northeast or Great Lakes areas before            age  years only geographic areas with noteworthy            differences are included in the table            Over all ages and among women aged  years and            over there were no notable casecontrol differences in            the age of first living in Marin County years before            the age of  or lifetime years lived in Marin County            or lifetime years lived in the San Francisco Bay Area            Table  Among women under the age of  years cases            had lived significantly fewer years than controls in            other parts of the San Francisco Bay Area but had            similar durations of living in Marin County Table                                                  Discussion        In this article we have focused on comparisons of        generally accepted or suspected risk factors for breast        cancer including some characteristics measured both for        adulthood and adolescence Interestingly cases and        controls were strikingly similar for several factors known        to influence breast cancer risk such as family history of        breast cancer contemporary socioeconomic status age at        first birth or use of hormone replacement therapy For        instance although the overall rate of positive        firstdegree family history  among cases is similar to        that reported in other recent series      the        controls in this population had rates of family history        comparable to those of the cases One possible explanation        for the homogeneity of cases with regard to these factors        could be our focus on residents of a small relatively        homogenous and affluent area Marin County The        homogeneity of the Marin County population is supported by        recent maps showing little variation in standardized        incidence rate ratios for breast cancer among the census        tracts within Marin County            Another explanation could involve preferential        participation in the study by controls with these        recognized breast cancer risk factors over those without        these factors This seems unlikely given the high        participation rates among those found to be eligible on the        basis of RDD but it is possible that there was some        selection bias in women or households who were willing to        answer the telephone call screening for eligibility        Further studies with alternative control ascertainment        methods would be necessary to resolve this issue In        addition appropriately adjusted comparisons of these        factors in this highrisk area versus geographic areas with        lower breast cancer rates would be needed to answer the        question of how much of the excess of breast cancer        incidence in Marin County might be due to patterns of these        risk factors Such a study is currently underway A study        that uses risk factor prevalence data from this study and        other sources is also underway to estimate the attributable        proportions of breast cancer due to specific risk        factors        As mentioned above selection bias due to differential        participation by cases or controls with some risk factor of        interest is always a potential concern in casecontrol        studies In attempts to minimize this problem we sought an        abbreviated interview for those cases and controls not able        or willing to participate in the full interview The        preliminary ageadjusted analyses of individual risk        factors used all women for whom information was available        There were not any notable differences in magnitude of the        ageadjusted ORs that used all  participants and the        multivariate results based on  subjects with complete        information        Despite homogeneity in current socioeconomic status our        study suggests that among women aged  years and older        breast cancer cases might have been more likely than        controls to have grown up in more affluent families        although the results are largely due to the small        proportion of subjects reporting their familys        socioeconomic status as upper before age  years In        contrast for women under the age of  years breast        cancer cases were somewhat less likely than controls to        have grown up in more affluent families That an effect of        preadult socioeconomic status existed in the women aged         and over that was independent of contemporary socioeconomic        status as well as established reproductive menstrual and        other factors such as body size and alcohol consumption        suggests that further attention is needed to understand the        relationship of childhood or adolescent socioeconomic        factors and breast cancer        Almost all women in this study had health insurance and        whereas women with breast cancer were more likely than        controls to report having had four or more mammograms in        the period  they were about equally likely to        report obtaining pelvic exams over the same period This        suggests that women who subsequently developed breast        cancer might have had more mammograms than controls because        they had more breast problems rather than because they        were in general more regular users of cancer screening        services than controls        Interestingly in both age groups women who had given        birth but had not breastfed had a higher risk for breast        cancer than women who had never been pregnant women who        had been pregnant but not parous and women who had been        parous and breastfed although the result was statistically        significant only in those aged  years and older In        addition among women under the age of  years women who        breastfed for  months or more had significantly reduced        odds of breast cancer This finding is consistent with a        large collaborative study    showing breastfeeding to        be protective for breast cancer through hormonal or other        mechanisms That report suggested an urgent need to fully        understand the mechanisms of the protective effect of        breastfeeding so that some intervention mimicking        breastfeeding could be developed and offered to women who        have not breastfed        It is also possible that inability to lactate or        suppressing lactation after giving birth might have a        deleterious effect on breast physiology     but we did        not request this information from subjects Given the        relatively late ages of first birth in this population one        might not expect to see a protective effect of having ever        given birth because the wellestablished protective        effects of pregnancy seem to be reversed for first births        at about age  years or later      This study had a        higher percentage of nulliparous women  of cases and         of controls than a recent study conducted in the        Seattle area  of cases and  of controls            However the California Teachers Study cohort with a        similarly elevated rate of invasive breast cancer of         per  person years among nonHispanic white women        between  and  reported a similar percentage of        nulliparous women  among participants without breast        cancer in             Consistent with previous findings    was our        observation that cases were more likely to be premenopausal        than controls suggesting a later age at menopause Despite        the absence of a strong difference in age at menarche        between cases and controls in this group those women who        developed breast cancer had relatively later menopause        indicating a greater number of years of active        menstruation Starting menarche at age  years or earlier        is considered an established breast cancer risk factor and        starting menarche at age  years or older is considered an        established protective factor     In the present        study cases were somewhat less likely than controls to        start menarche at age  years or older but cases were not        more likely than controls to have early menarche A similar        lack of association of age at menarche with breast cancer        status was apparent in the large recent study by        Marchbanks and colleagues     The distribution of age        at menarche reported by control women in Marin County was        similar to that observed for women in the California        Teachers Study cohort            Disagreement remains in the literature on the direction        and magnitude of effect if any of oral contraceptives on        breast cancer risk       Despite large studies        designed to address such differences chance selection        factors changes in formulations patterns of use and        different background risk for breast cancer might account        for some of the variation in findings In this Marin County        study we found a rather strong and significant inverse        association of oral contraceptive use and breast cancer        However the lack of casecontrol differences by duration        or latency of use argues against a causal connection and        suggests that oral contraceptive use might be a surrogate        for some other protective behavior or exposure Given the        very high rate of use of oral contraceptives in this        population an alternative explanation could be that        factors or conditions contraindicating the use of oral        contraceptives might increase the risk for breast cancer        In future studies it might be worthwhile to assess why        women chose to use or not to use oral contraceptives        In addition there was no indication of large        differences in hormone replacement therapy use among cases        and controls which was similar to a recent Seattle        casecontrol study     although any use of hormone        replacement therapy was somewhat higher in the Marin        population  than in the women in the Seattle study         In addition the specificity of questions about        types of hormone replacement therapy used and the sample        size of this Marin study is insufficient to rule out the        small increased risk  observed in larger studies            or to examine in detail different hormone        replacement therapy regimens duration or age of use        Appropriately adjusted comparisons of rates of hormone        replacement therapy use in this area and geographic areas        with lower breast cancer rates would be informative        regarding the relationship of hormone replacement therapy        use to the elevated breast cancer incidence in Marin        County        Many studies have examined breast cancer in relation to        body weight height and overall body size as measured by        body mass index The general consensus has been that        increased height might be associated with increased risk        for breast cancer and that obesity might increase risk in        women aged  years or over or who are postmenopausal but        might decrease risk in women under the age of  years               Highest adult body mass index was strongly        inversely related to breast cancer status both in women        under the age of  years and unexpectedly in those aged         years and older The average highest body mass indexes        reported in this study  and  kgm for cases and        controls respectively were in the same range reported for        subjects body mass index  years previously in a recent        large US study  and  kgm for cases and controls        respectively    and participants in the California        Teachers Study in   kgm             One explanation for the finding could be that mechanisms        of weight maintenance might have contributed to the        association Because we did not ask about adult or recent        physical activity in the interview we cannot assess the        impact of these factors on the body size results In the        Nurses Health Study cohort Huang and colleagues           reported that among postmenopausal women weight gain was        consistently associated with an increased risk for breast        cancer only among women who had not used hormone        replacement therapy We found that cases had lower highest        body mass index than controls both among women who had used        hormone replacement therapy and among women who had not It        is possible in this affluent community that perimenopausal        and postmenopausal women who are not taking prescribed        hormone replacement therapy could be eating foods or taking        herbal or other nonprescribed supplements to ameliorate        menopausal symptoms that might simulate the effects of        hormone replacement therapy Unfortunately we did not        collect the data to test this possibility but such        questions should be included in future studies        Alcohol use has been increasingly associated with both        premenopausal and postmenopausal breast cancer risk             including a report from the California Teachers Study        showing that recent alcohol consumption increases risk for        breast cancer     We found that although women with        breast cancer were less likely than controls to have begun        drinking alcohol before age  years they were much more        likely than controls to consume two or more drinks per day        on average as adults That the ORs for alcohol consumption        in this study were generally higher than those reported in        other studies suggests a possible interaction of alcohol        consumption with other factors that have a high prevalence        in this population        Cigarette smoking has not been consistently associated        with breast cancer risk     The elevated OR observed        in this study for the highest quartile of packyears smoked        might be due to differential participation by controls with        a lower packyear history or differential reporting of        smoking history by cases and controls It is also possible        that smoking history was confounded by factors not measured        in this study such as physical activity        For women under the age of  years women with breast        cancer were much more likely than controls to have been        born or lived before age  years in the Northeastern or        Great Lakes regions of the USA regions that were in the        upper deciles of breast cancer mortality both for the        period  and for the period             Geocoding and other refinements of residence information        might help to clarify which areas of first or early life        residences might be associated with later risk for breast        cancer        The similar average ages of first residence and total        years lived in Marin for cases and controls do not support        but cannot completely rule out the hypothesis that there        is some agent specific to Marin County such as a        particular water source that might increase the risk for        breast cancer These findings do not imply that        environmental factors are unimportant in breast cancer        causation On the contrary our and others findings of        increased risk with frequency of alcohol consumption show        that a womans personal environment can strongly influence        her breast cancer risk In addition our result of higher        risk among women under the age of  years who lived in the        Northeast or Great Lakes regions before age  years might        suggest a role of early environmental factors        Because control women in this study had such high rates        of health insurance and use of basic screening services it        seems likely that they truly did not have breast cancer at        the time of interview This was despite a higher proportion        of controls with established breast cancer risk factors        such as family history and nulliparity than observed in        control subject groups in other recent studies Given this        observation a further intensive study of this or other        similarly highincidence populations might reveal factors        proximate to breast cancer diagnosis that could enrich our        understanding of breast cancer etiology in a highincidence        population Some provocative clues from this first analysis        suggest that some as yet unidentified correlate of oral        contraceptive use might be protective and that consuming        two or more alcoholic drinks per day might be deleterious        for women in this highincidence population We were unable        to examine the effects of other provocative exposures        previously proposed by others including exposures to light        at night    and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons            The observed early socioeconomic differences combined        with a lack of differences in age at menarche or early body        size also suggest that attention might be turned to        patterns of early infection or lack of infection and        immune response            This study is among the first reported in which        community advocates took part in all aspects of the        research process from formulating questions of interest        and questionnaire design to monitoring progress of subject        recruitment and data analysis and interpretation at regular        meetings This study provides important information for        planning additional studies to understand reasons for        breast cancer in this or other highrisk geographic areas        characterized by a socioeconomically affluent        population                    Conclusions        Women with breast cancer and controls had very similar        distributions of age of first living and years lived in        Marin County suggesting that the Countys high breast        cancer rates are probably not due to geographically        specific exposures Despite similar distributions for        several known breast cancer risk factors casecontrol        differences in alcohol consumption suggest that breast        cancer risk in this population might be modifiable This        study might be useful to communities and researchers        concerned with understanding the basis of and means of        mitigating high local or regional rates of breast cancer        Intensive study of highincidence areas might reveal other        important risk factors proximate to diagnosis
