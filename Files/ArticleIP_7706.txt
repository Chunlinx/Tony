                                 The Message Trap            Everyone agrees TheRepublicans were beaten by a lack of message            Bill Clinton pointed it outright after the election He told his staff according to the New YorkTimes  that the elections message was that people wanted electedofficials to address pocketbook issues like Social Security health careeducation and the minimum wage Newt Gingrich couldnt have agreed more Ithink we probably underestimated the need to really aggressively push a muchstronger message about cutting taxes and saving Social Security winning thewar on drugs reforming education and national defense said the speaker theday before he realized that that underestimate would cost him his job            By theweekend liberal pundits and conservative pols were joined in messagefulchorus Republicans misread the meaning of their  victory Voters wantgovernment to solve problems in education the environment child care andhealth care counseled liberal columnist EJ Dionne What we need to dounder my speakership said speaker apparent Bob Livingston is not onlyarticulate the message but to provide the legislative machinery that it takesto back it up Aspiring House Majority Leader Steve Largent chimed in Ithink the first thing that we have to do is develop an agenda that can unifyour party  We have to have Republican solutions in education HMO reformSocial Security get back to limited government lower taxes and strongdefense            Oh really            Where may I ask is theevidence that the public is hot for a party that promises activist solutions toproblems that confront it and its progeny Surely not from Election Day exitpolls The New York Times  for example queried voters about the oneissue that mattered most in deciding which House candidate to vote forEducation said an underwhelming  percent of voters And even at that howmany of those voters really had education foremost in their frontal lobesRemember that in key elections education was the trade name for a firm ofless reputable pursuit Democratic candidates in the South who activelysupported legalized gambling measures with the states share of the takeearmarked for education scored unexpected victories over antigambling GOPopponents Voters who opposed the lottery and video poker interests toldpollsters forthrightly that they were against gambling Voters who favoredlegalizing gambling said they were for education            Trailingbehind education in the exit polls were issues such as morals and ethics percent the economy and jobs  percent Social Security  percentand taxes  percent As for health care the occasion of much bipartisanhuffing and puffing about the need to save citizens from the ravages of HMOsit commanded the top interest of a mere  percent of voters That was scarcelymore than the  percent who dared the pollsters scorn by admitting outrightthat the ClintonLewinsky matter concerned them most In fact if you add thecoded morals and ethics vote to the ClintonLewinsky category it virtuallyties for first place among concerns            What the GOP would do well to keep in mind isthat at least in times of peace and prosperity most times the American publicdoesnt want the federal government to bother it People expect the governmentto keep the Social Security checks and highway money coming and run the courtsand stuff like that But sweeping reformseven when they really would beprudent for the futuremake the electorate uncomfortable Take savingMedicare for example a goal that pols from both parties like to pop into thesame sentence with curbing HMOs Theres no way to make Medicare solvent forthe long term except by raising taxes to pay for it or by letting HMOs andtheir ilk limit some peoples access to some kinds of care Pick your poisonor more wisely shut your mouth            Of course that doesnt meanthat Republicans should go back to talking about Monica or even about thatsocial agenda that makes so many voters uneasy After all American voters dolike their politicians to flatter them by pretending that they are trulyconcerned about important things like making kids smarter and safer andhealthier The GOP should take a page out of Bill Clintons playbook andpromise the public  new teachers or cops or drug enforcement agents orwhatever Never mind that the money will only pay for a fraction of that andthat by the time its spread by formula to every school or precinct it mightnot fully support a single hire Or call for another tax break to subsidizethe cost of schools or daycare centers or hiring the disadvantaged orwhatever Sure most of the subsidy will end up paying for things that wouldhappen anyway but people like the idea of tax breaks and nobody ever bothersto check on who got to pocket the lost revenue            Next time GOP recruit somemore attractive candidates who dont scare the voters with their moralisticfervor But meanwhile dont weigh yourself down with some heavybreathingmessage that ends up forcing a debate in which a lot of painful choices willinevitably be laid bare That was your strategy last January when youdeliberately scheduled only  days for voting business this year withprecisely that sort of inaction in mind And according to the polls Congresshas never been more popular than it was just a few months ago when what it wasdoing was nothing much
