        well     just just as i answered the phone there was there was a voice that came on the line and said you were suppose to you talk about capital punishment how does the law what how do the laws in the different states compare and to be restricted to certain crimes or certain circumstances or something like that   yeah uhhuh   i honestly dont know what Illinois position on capital punishment is do you know for Texas   well i know were kind of beefing it up now uh the past year or so the people that are on death row and have been for years and years and years theyre beginning to go on and executed them now We have the uh lethal injections lethal injection   uhhuh   and uh its going to take at least all ready this year three have been put to death and i think at this point i am for that as long as you know theyve had all the chances they need to have on appeals and this i dont see why they should have to and why we should have to support them for twenty or thirty years on death row that once they have been sentenced by a jury of their peers found guilty and then gone through the appeal bit then why continue   yeah i i i strongly i strongly agree i think uh well in general i think we have we have a fairly lax legal system as far as protecting the criminal   thats right   and uh and i can see the the necessity of it but uh i dont know if someones guilty and theres theres no question if if if theres is no question about it a lot of times you sentence someone to prison and there and there the jury finds them guilt then not in everyones mind its not actually settled   right i can agree with that That its   so i can i can see letting uh letting for example the judge make the call or or maybe an appeals court make the call and on this it was this not just beyond a reasonable doubt but beyond any doubt   right   and so under circumstances where its you know where there is no question about it the person actually did kill somebody and in particularly particularly in some of the more brutal cases or prevalent where theyve killed several people   yes   yeah i i totally agree i i think its kind of appalling that some one can commit murder and they know that they probably wont die for it   yes Well i know of uh at least two this year that have been put to death have uh i mean they have already they had admitted to it They i mean there was no question and yes they had been going on fifteen to twenty years there on death row   is that right   and   oh wow   uh i think probably Texas is the most lax state there is on this That it just oh wow We do everything else fast     baby thats thats probably why this was picked as one of the topics because Texas Instruments is in Texas and so   right   its in the news its not really in the news much up here i guess it was the Dahlmer case   uhhuh   that that was in the news everywhere   uhhuh   now where was that at   uh i think that was in Houston   so that was in Texas too   yes uhhuh   thats what i thought   i believe so and uh i know were going through a case right now that uh where parents starved a child to death and uh ive heard you know people wondering whether you know should these people get the death penalty or not uh i i guess i would feel strongly about that when it involves a child especially they they tied this child   uhhuh   the police found the child tied and starved and uh theres no doubt a case like that theres no doubt in my mind that these people ought to get the death penalty that uh they did it they did it knowingly   i guess that would be that would be the issue and they just tie the child and and were they were they punishing the kid and they dont realize that he was going to die or oh they did   yes uhhuh oh they the were just punishing They didnt think far enough ahead i dont guess that you know that he would actually die or that they would get caught They had two of them   well see thats i think i would think that differently they had two of them   uhhuh   two children two children   two children One did not die   one didnt huh yeah in that case he i think he could argue that i dont know if the parents were really intending to kill the kids   well could be   that would that would seem that would seem like that would that would i would have a harder time saying the death penalty was in order for that   well i dont think i would  but uh   well no i i certainly think punishment is in order but the death penalty because thats i am not sure that is homicide because they didnt i i it it certainly wasnt intentional homicide   uhhuh Well you may have a point there i its just that i guess they have gotten so much publicity here but and i have read so much about it and   yeah thats   just   that is that is a tough one   but other than that uh you know i just
