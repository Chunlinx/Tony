        okay   wonderful touch tone telephone there     uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading   uh having have uh i have a wide variety of of hobbies therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide um i get a charge out of uh Texas highway uh which uh is very colorful and uh not being a native of Texas uh but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh   oh   about the different areas of of the kind of the state by reading it   right ive read that one too i  only had a subscription once but my mother always gave me hers and i i really enjoyed you know all the little things that you find out about Texas   oh yeah its its uh absolutely its great the way that its broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things its pretty pretty neat um oh i like photography um  magazines i dont take a subscription or anything like that um things oh being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and   uhhuh   and uh kind of strange because i its not unusual to uh see um an engineering manual or something laying around the house and then ill sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it but uh  how about yourself   uhhuh well um i have an interest in art so i frequently purchase and read um books mainly on water color because thats my big interest at the moment   umhum oh thats great   and um oh i guess i like a variety of things um lots of fiction uh type books um right now im occasionally reading  on a book about uh the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and its history thats fairly interesting   umhum i bet that would be rather interesting uh thats uh selfimprovement thats thats always well thats thats kind of a hobby but it is selfimprovement uh from the standpoint of probably relaxing um   yeah i i dont know that i read anything strictly labeled selfimprovement how about you   um well i hate to yes i do         we um we have these classes we attend uh management classes then and they give you books and and the last book uh matter of fact i read was At Americas Service by Carl Albridge it talks about um who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the TI culture here at Texas Instruments   yeah   um one of its great slogans is if youre not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is   uhhuh   uh so thats all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer your my customer im your customer sort of thing um   right   every now and then im loaned the tape i can stick in the in the car cassette on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of Pat Haggerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type   yeah   actually which all you know betters yourself   yeah yeah well i guess maybe i am into some things occasionally that i dont think of in terms of selfimprovement   umhum   i mean they are but i dont label it as such   like what for example   well i dont know um i uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things but um they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself you know getting getting your yourself in gear to   umhum   uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really wanna do  convincing you that you need to get on with it   sure sure how about items like um The One Minute Manager which used to be a big okay so those are self improvements um   yes sure   our supervisor uh suddenly bought all of us a book called What Every Supervisor Should Know   um   by a main man named uh Doctor Bittel B I T T E L and its a very laymans uh uh approach towards managing different types of people and the very last chapter and i havent figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers       so its its very its interesting here again its its casual reading and its not eaten up with a lot of uh technical stuff and its really uh excellent fast reading and uh but as you say its its sometimes its difficult to to know if its you know i think if somebody wants to say okay read these ten books because these are selfimprovements i would probably be turned off to them   yeah yeah   he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and uh picked up one of them it might be a little more interesting   i dont know i im not sure i could take too much of Stephen King thats a little little little heavy for me   yeah theyre uh quite uh theyre hard to set down because its so interesting and course theyre always a little spookier than the movies but uh   yeah   its always theyre always challenging to get through one of them i have a hard time finishing books   well i guess i also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because thats what im involved in a lot at work   umhum in quality especially nowadays uh thats almost everything that comes across the the the the the airways of the   oh yeah you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other but i think sometimes the word is a little over used but   exactly exactly right yeah we we have i think we we name drop it a little too much and and dont fully understand what what what it is were saying i think its its focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and and all that kind of rolls in together there but uh   yeah yeah yeah   thats kind of part of it   okay well any other comments   uh not that i can think of um i think im under my quota a little bit i need it if i if i make a phone call or two     well we just started right   ah this is true ive enjoyed it   well you too and uh   have   goodbye   have a good day byebye   goodbye
