                okay do you have any children   uh yes i have a daughter   umhum i dont any children so im gonna have difficulty with this topic but uh what kind of things do you and your family do   oh okay um well we go out and fly kites and we go fishing and we go to movies   hm   and we go out to the farm and and uh she likes to pick flowers and look at birds   umhum hm then your kind of family is probably pretty rare now a days i dont see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that thats great   well well im divorced but thats what when shes with me thats what we do   yeah   and we color a lot and i read her stories and   umhum thats great   yep   i think uh a lot of families now for they probably dont spend enough time together you know whether theyre   yeah   whether the parents are together or divorced they dont spend enough time together and and i think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is uh being destroyed   yep   just simply because that time isnt spent just doing things like fishing and because that i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot and the communication helps you build on your uh helps just just build your family   umhum yeah and even even when i was when i was uh living with her and we did stuff then too so   umhum yeah thats pretty to me thats pretty rare   yeah i know   i think that whenever i do have children ill im gonna try as hard as i can to see see that we spend a lot of time together you know maybe just even if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make sure that everybodys not going out and doing and their own thing all the time   umhum   and you know thats good sometimes because you need to you know get away but uh i dont think you you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of of losing your family the family unit   yeah thats right because then you never get to know them either theyre all grown up and their you know   umhum yeah yeah and as i understand it i dont know i havent experienced it but you know kids these days are growing up so much faster   yeah umhum   you know once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve you know youve pretty much lost them   yeah theyre out doing stuff by that time   umhum yeah so um do you think that you do you think that your familys pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter   yeah yeah i really do because because i dont see many other this and when whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays well see other families   umhum   but not usually on the on the uh weekends we dont see very many in comparison   what do you think is the key to just bringing the American family back together what what kinds of things do you think can   well i think they ought to turn off the TV for one thing   yeah thats true thats   and and go out and do stuff you know because she always likes to do things whenever the TVs off you know shell forget about the TV completely   hm right i think thats the first thing a lot of people do and i know im guilty of it like i came in from work today first thing i did was turn the TV on because i taped the stories from earlier today   umhum right   and i like to watch them but i think thats that is a big problem television its its its too static you know its something that you can do but you theres no thinking involved no motion you know and i think i think thats another reason why people are uh so health conscious now is because Americas becoming really a couch potato society   umhum   you know people arent doing anything just sitting around you know no thinking involved and now i think i think people are trying to get out of that at least and that um you know theres a lot of um its its becoming really health conscious and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that   umhum   and thats probably good you know if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that that also helps thats also something you know family oriented that everyone can do   yeah   hm   yeah but when was uh when she was here last summer we played tennis but  she hasnt brought her tennis racket over lately   humum   and we   how how old is she   shes five   um well she has   we we just been hitting the ball on the ground   yeah yeah   she cant hit it in the air yet and then we kick the ball we play like soccer   well you still have a lot of time before she gets up in years  thats good thats good   umhum yeah   hm okay well it was very nice talking to you   nice talking to you okay byebye   okay byebye
