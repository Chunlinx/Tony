                            The pathologist makes do with red wine until an effective drug is available the        biochemist discards the bread from her sandwiches and the mathematician indulges in        designer chocolate with a clear conscience The demographer sticks to vitamin supplements        and while the evolutionary biologist calculates the compensations of celibacy the        population biologist transplants gonads but so far only those of his laboratory mice        Their common cause is to control and extend the healthy lifespan of humans They want to        cure ageing and the diseases that come with it        I would take resveratrol if it were feasible notes David Sinclair assistant        professor of pathology at Harvard Medical School in Boston Massachusetts In the meantime        he adds I do enjoy a glass of red wine about once a day It was Sinclairs laboratory        in association with a commercial partner that revealed last August how the team had        identified for the first time a group of simple organic molecules capable of extending        lifespan The most proficient of the group is resveratrol the plant polyphenol found in        red wine and its discovery as a potential elixir to combat ageing represents another        extraordinary advance in a decade of discoveries that have revolutionised the field                              These molecules will be useful for treating diseases associated with            ageing like diabetes and Alzheimers                                      Extending Life        Although the lifeenhancing effects of Sinclairs polyphenols are so far confined to the        bakers yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae  the work suggests that researchers        are only one small step from making a giant leap for humankind People imagined that it        might have been possible but few people thought that it was going to be possible so        quickly to find such things says Sinclair The field of ageing research is buzzing        Resveratrol stimulated a known activator of increased longevity in yeast the enzyme        Sir and thereby extended the organisms lifespan by  Box  Sir belongs to a        family of proteins with members in higher organisms including SIR an enzyme that        regulates lifespan in worms and SIRT the human enzyme that promotes cell survival        Figure  Though researchers still do not know whether SIRT or Sir in humans as        Sinclair puts it has anything to do with longevity there is a good chance that it does        judging by its pedigree In any event resveratrol proved to be a potent activator of the        human enzyme This might not be altogether surprising at least not now given that the        polyphenol is already associated with health benefits in humans notably the mitigation of        such agerelated defects as neurodegeneration carcinogenesis and atherosclerosis        The study came out from a pretty big gamble recalls Sinclair who used the human        enzyme to screen and identify molecules that he expected would also stimulate those related        enzymes in lower organisms Unlike SIRT these related enzymes are known to increase        longevity when activated usually by restricting the organisms calorie intake Not only        did they find a whole collection of related polyphenols that activate Sir from humans         but we put them onto yeast justbeing the simplest model and amazingly they did what        we were hoping they would do recalls Sinclair But it was a real long shot        Now theres great eagerness in the Sinclair laboratory to complete and publish related        research notably by replicating the yeast work in higher organisms We have very        promising results in         Drosophila  which is a huge jump from a yeast cell says        Sinclair So were very encouraged by that Publication of these results is imminent The        team has also quickly broadened its horizons and is already testing the polyphenols on        mouse disease models We think we may have tapped into a cell survival and defence        programme and that these molecules will be useful for treating diseases associated with        ageing like diabetes and Alzheimers says Sinclair He hopes to publish the diabetes        results by mid and those for Alzheimers by the end of the year Harvard and BIOMOL        Research Laboratories its commercial partner based in Pennsylvania have already filed a        patent application for the use of synthetic related molecules to combat diseases of        ageingan application Sinclair adds very much linked to the polyphenols paper        Theres been a radical shift in attitude towards ageing says Sinclair Before the        s people thought that we were a lot like cars that we would just rust and        breakdownnothing we could do about it The new idea is that there are pathways that can        boost our defences against ageingthe ageingcanberegulated discovery  that genes can        control ageing and that there are pathways that we can use to slow down the process        he says If thats trueand it really seems to be true for a lot of organismsif its true        for us it really means that there is hope that we will be able one day to find small        molecules that can alter these pathways                    How Long Could We Live        Sinclair expects to see such developments within his lifetime but he ridicules the        notion that humans will experience anything like the  extension to lifespan of his        cultured yeast Itll be great if we can just give people an extra five years and have        less disease in their old age and make it less painful he says We wont be seeing any        Methuselahs around he insists        On his side are James Vaupel one of Europes leading demographers and Marc Mangel a        mathematical modeller at the University of California at Santa Cruz Since  life        expectancy has been going up at  years per decade and will continue at this rate maybe        a little faster says Vaupel head of the Laboratory of Survival and Longevity at the Max        Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock Germany Women in Japan currently        have the highest average life expectancy of  he notes So the figure could be  in        six decades but not  Theres remarkably little people can do even if they want to        live as long as possible he says Give up smoking lose weight dont drive when drunk        install a smoke detector take regular exercise suggests Vaupel who insists he does them        all as well as taking vitamin supplements                              You look at these worms and think Oh my God these worms should be            dead But theyre not Theyre moving around                          Mangel sees the problem of assessing the limitations of ageing research as fairly        straightforward Mathematical models he says could solve it by linking demographic        properties and physiological developments Weve had a separation of the biology of ageing        and the demography of ageing and they need to come together again notes Mangel whose        personal antiageing regime involves taking a dose of antioxidant chocolate with a good        feeling        But Cythnia Kenyon whose laboratory reported in October that it had generated a fold        increase in the lifespan of its nematodes is not so sure about the limitations You look        at these worms and think Oh my God these worms should be dead But theyre not Theyre        moving around Once you get your brain wrapped around that  then you start thinking oh        my goodness so lifespan is something you can changeits plastic Then who knows what the        limit is Cynthia Kenyon has recorded video clips of the superstars of her lab         Caenorhabditis elegans  to show how longlived mutant nematodes        are as vigorous as normal young adults Videos         Warming to the theme Kenyon hypothesises If youd asked me many generations ago when        we were actually common precursors of worms and flies Cynthia you have a twoweek        lifespan do you think that you could live longer And if Id told you Well I think        our descendants will live  times longer youd have said Oh come on But we do        It happened she notes        Who knows what you could do in people Kenyon muses I dont want to go on record        saying that its not possible in people because I dont see why it wouldnt be Im        certainly not imagining that my company in the next few years is going to come up with a        compound that can make people live to be  That seems just preposterous So the        timescale is millions of years No not necessarily she insists because once we        understand the mechanism then we can intervene and see what we can accomplish                    Signalling Life and Sweet         Kenyon professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California at San        Francisco is among the key contributors responsible for showing that a single gene and        subsequently many genes can change an organisms lifespan                  It is inconceivable  that a lifeextending therapy will ever be developed that is          able to extend life independent of every other change                In a seminal paper published a decade ago Kenyons laboratory showed that mutations in        the         daf gene doubled the lifespan of the nematode         C elegans          daf encodes a receptor that is similar to those for insulin and        insulinlike growth factor IGF in humans this hormone receptor normally speeds up        ageing in worms but the mutations inhibit its action and enable the organisms to live        longer Before the results appeared there was a very negative attitude towards ageing        research recalls Kenyon Since then and especially over the past few years in response to        later findings graduate students have been scrambling for a chance to work in her        laboratory You cant believe the differencethere was such resistance to it she says         daf made a huge difference But then so did her subsequent research in        the field        Among her most significant findings is the identification of many more longevity genes        the results published in July derive directly from her early work on         daf  We discovered that in order for longlived worms to live so        long they need another gene called         daf  recalls Kenyon         daf is kind of the opposite of         daf  in the sense that it promotes longevity and youthfulness  so we        call it sweet          daf encodes a transcription factor that controls the expression of        more than  genes They dont do just one thing they do many things says Kenyon They        can act as antioxidants to prevent damage from oxygen radicals as chaperones to        prevent misfolded proteins from forming aggregates as antimicrobials to protect against        bacteria and fungi and as metabolic agents        So the picture that emerges is that the way the insulinIGF hormone system produces        these enormous effects on lifespan is by coordinating the expression of many genes that do        different things to affect lifespan each of which on its own has only a small effect        notes Kenyon Its as though         daf and         daf  the regulators would be the conductors of an orchestra They        bring together the flutes and the violins and the French horns each of which do different        things and they make them all work together in concert        Kenyon is unequivocal about the bottom line Now we have a whole set of genes whose        biochemical functions we can be working on to understand more about the actual mechanisms        of ageing Complementary results in flies and mammals persuade her to be more explicit        The common ancestor of worms flies and mice must have had an insulinIGFlike hormone        system that controlled ageing And that ability has been maintained So the question is        has that ability been lost in humans I think its quite likely that it will also        function in humans but there isnt a direct demonstration yet that thats the case        Nevertheless the discoveries about the role of the insulinIGF pathway in ageing have        had a profound impact on her own lifestyle which includes a tendency to discard the bread        from sandwiches and eat only the toppings of pizzas Box  Im on a lowcarb diet I        gave my worms glucose and it shortened their lifespan The diet makes sense because it        keeps your insulin levels down she says        Caloric restriction extends lifespan of mice and so does the insulinIGF pathway        she notes Indeed starting a lowcalorie diet at any point in adulthood appears to help        fruit flies live longer according to research in Britain published last September What        we dont know for sure in mice Kenyon continues is whether the two pathways are        different or the same        While much ageing research focuses on these two influences she says that there are        another two areas of investigation Her laboratory reported in December  that        inhibiting the respiration of mitochondria in developing worms increased longevity but        that it had no effect in adult worms for reasons still unexplained she says Further        microarray analysis is underway to pinpoint whether the cause simply lies downstream of the        insulinIGF pathway or whether it is something different altogether                    The Price of Life        Then theres research looking at the effects on lifespan of changes to an organisms        reproductive system For Kenyon such work often involves a battle to convince sceptics        that longevity is not a tradeoff with fertility Four years ago her laboratory reported        that killing germ cells increases the lifespan of worms by  but only because she        stresses it affects endocrine signalling and not because it prevents reproduction Further        research published last year showed quite clearly she says that ageing and reproduction        are controlled independently of one another And as for her recent work on infertile worms        which lived six times as long as normal following the removal of their entire reproductive        systems she says If we could intervene in the hormone signalling pathways directly we        think the animals would still live six times as long as normal but would be fertile as        well        Jim Carey is one of those tradeoff sceptics He is a population biologist at the        University of California at Davis and his research on the effect on life expectancy of        replacing the ovaries of old mice with ovaries from younger mice is intended to complement        Kenyons work But he insists that an honest discussion of lifespan extension must include        consideration of tradeoffs Many manipulations that extend lifespan in model systems        whether genetic or dietary for example ignore or gloss over the side effects such as        permanent sterility huge weight loss distorted organtobody ratios or major behavioural        aberrations he notes It is inconceivable to me that a lifeextending therapy will ever        be developed that is able to extend life independent of every other change he concludes        All life systems are interlinked and hierarchically integrated at all levels so to talk        about life extension using analogies with a car warranty concept is wrongheaded        Another tradeoff sceptic takes a different tack As Armand Leroi puts it During        occasional periods of involuntary celibacy I have thought well I may not be getting laid        but at least I shall live to a miserable and solitary old age Leroi an evolutionary        biologist at Imperial College of Science Technology and Medicine in London offers an        optimistic appraisal of the chances of finding a cure for ageing in his new book about the        effects of genetic variety on the human body He sees ageing simply as a collection of        curable diseases There is no obvious impediment to that advance nothing to make us think        that human beings have a fixed lifespan
