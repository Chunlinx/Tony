              Dear       Have you noticed your friends mentioning Fountain Square lately It      seems that everywhere I go people are making positive observations about      how our community is on the upswing This shift in our neighborhood image      is very satisfying after fifteen years of concerted efforts by SouthEast      Neighborhood Development SEND to reverse community decline      In  community residents and organizations banded together to form      the organization which is now called SEND SENDs redevelopment efforts      have played a major role in rebirth of Fountain Square directly      investing more than  Million into affordable housing commercial      development and beautification project since  This investment has      resulted in the renovation and sale of  homes to homebuyers of modest      means and in the rehab of more than  affordable high quality      apartments More than  low income home owners often senior citizens      have been able to remain in their homes thanks to home repairs supported      by SEND More than  businesses have been able to expand and employ more      residents Two hundred atrisk neighborhood youth have gained work and      life skills to overcome the appeal of gangs drugs and school drop out      which constantly threaten their future These direct investments by SEND      have been a catalyst encouraging millions more in investments by      residents and businesses who now hold hope for the neighborhoods      future      While the trends of decline are reversing our work is far from      complete Thousands of residents still live in substandard conditions      our teen pregnancy rate is the highest in the state only onethird of      residents have high school diplomas and half of our residents have      little hope of participating in community improvements because they do      not own their home      We need your help to continue our work particularly as we enable area      families with low incomes to become home owners The cost of creating      these homes far exceeds what our buyers cm pay so we rely on grants and      individual donations to keep them affordable I hope you will take this      opportunity to make a contribution to support SENDs homeownership work      As a bonus we are now able to offer donors of  or more a State of      Indiana Neighborhood Assistance Program NAP  tax credit This means      that half of your contribution will be returned to you through State tax      savings while the entire donation amount will remain deductible on your      Federal taxes Most donors of  will actually be contributing less      than  while SEND benefits from the entire gift However these tax      credits are only available for a limited time so we ask that you act      soon if you would like to use them      Please join us as we continue to rebuild this historic neighborhood      into a place of pride and community strength Feel free to call me if you      would like more information on the NAP tax credit program or any of      SENDs programs      Yours in Service      William G Taft Executive Director
