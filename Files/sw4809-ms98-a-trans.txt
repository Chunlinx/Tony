        i guess what        this brings to mind is uh um my chief complaint is then uh        the priority thats given to kids   thats what comes to mind anyway          well i dont know i guess uh i think one of the biggest changes thats taken place over the last twenty five years anyway is um uh        uh both parents working and the   umhum      the uh mechanisms havent really been in place to get to give kids all the attention they need   yeah   so i think that uh and i think were so reaping the        um results of that in uh   the consequences   a lot of problems yeah i mean i dont blame people for um both going to work um both parents going to work        its tough not to for a lot of people        but its been i think that may be the single        biggest social change in the middle class anyway thats uh that has uh uh had a lot more repercussion that people every thought   yeah yeah my wife and i have gone through a couple of decades together were both on our early forties   um   um  weve been married uh twenty two years so we sort of grew up together and um just had children uh so we have a four year old and a two year old   umhum   and uh for the first eighteen years of our marriage um we were two income carriers and all that so we had a pretty full lifestyle and   umhum   and having the children we decided to uh to go into one income so i work and she stays home   tough isnt it   and and its you know the the ideal value system is is to motivate it there   our situation   because it it suddenly is something that uh that we thought long and hard about   our situation is very much very similar        Mary  were both professionals and  used to working and we decided that when we had kids that we would uh have somebody home until they were uh well into school   umhum   its difficult especially its not so much        difficult financially i dont think as it is uh culturally in that its um uh kind of expected i think i think its difficult on my wife not to be um   umhum      professionally identified and that sort of thing   umhum      but i really feel like its been worth it for the kids and when i look around i think uh im im pretty glad we made the decision we did   yeah yeah weve you know experienced a lot the the turmoil of the uh sixties and seventies and uh i think we we were part of that um looking for new value systems and having uh  a vision of the way the world was going to be when we were you know in middle age which i guess we are now   and then all of the sudden the kids come along               yeah that too but uh i just think that uh right now were experiencing a lot of disappointment with uh our generation and and uh the way things havent really changed and i think that uh you know our personal difficulties are reflected in a lot of the unrest right now were seeing with respect to politics       yeah   yeah i i think uh        you have to be um i dont want to make it uh more dramatic but you have to be kind of cultural really if you want to put your family first and uh   umhum   um to sort of uh put a cap on things that you can really have and enjoy and just go ahead and        um do whats right by your by your family   yeah   and i dont i i dont see a lot of support out there i see        a lot of people um voting down school taxes and um   umhum   uh well a degree of the eighties was i think uh maybe the most disappointing social phenomena that i witnessed      yeah      because i really did see   you see it in um magnified about twenty times         yeah i mean uh maybe double that again in the east coast   really   uh yeah  and were were both from the mid west were both from Saint Louis and uh experienced  but we spent the entire eighties out here and uh   um   were just thirty miles outside of Manhattan   umhum   and uh its very different than the mid west its   i guess the i guess the  the epicenter of that uh      yeah yeah i mean it you know the the kids around here   stuff in the eighties   uh you know think theyre poor if they cant get a Polo shirt every week   umhum right   it its its a different perspective and uh you know we got caught up in that we we we had you know a real decade of hay day       an uh now were retrenching like a lot of the rest of the country       uh particularly because you know we chose to have a single income and um   um   also working uh in a large corporate setting and that has become unsettled in the last
