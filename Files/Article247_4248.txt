                                 Why Paycheck Protection Is Bunk            George W Bush has been saying that he doesnt support comprehensivecampaign reform without paycheck protection In a Des Moines debate earlierthis month he told John McCain                                             Heres my worry with your campaign reform plan Its going tohurt the Republican party John The Democratic Party is really the DemocraticParty and the labor unions in America And my worry is is that you do nothingabout whats called paycheck protection We do nothing about saying to laboryou cant take a laboring mans money and spend it in the way you seefit                                       As Bush made clearer than perhaps he meant to his primary concern aboutpolitical spending by unions isnt that it rips off union members its that itusually goes to Democrats But lets assume Bush had made a principled argumentrather than a partisan one Is it wrong for unions to spend union dues onpolitics without first getting the consent of each member            Tom Geoghegan a labor lawyer and author of The Secret Lives of Citizens  told Chatterbox Ofcourse not What people dont understand in this country he explained isthat unions exist for political action When workers cant getbenefits from their bosses he said they try to get them from Congress SocialSecurity for example was collectively bargained at the national level Theirony he pointed out is that the vast majority of working Americans whoarent duespaying union members get a free ride whenever labor gets abill passed that expands government benefits for union members and nonmembersalike You might call it paycheck protection in reverse To read a                  Slate                article by Geoghegan elaborating on this argument clickhere            But what if a union member happens to be a Republican and doesntlike seeing his dues spent to help elect Democrats or to expand governmentThis question was raised in  by Harry Beck a member of the CommunicationsWorkers of America who sued his union because it was using his dues to helpelect Hubert Humphrey who lost incidentally even though labor was a muchbigger force in American politics than it is today In  the Supreme Courtruled that union members could demand a refund when their dues were used forpolitical purposes against their wishes But the decision didnt make it easyin any practical sense for union members to get their money back and theNational Labor Relations Board dragged its heels for several years on thematter In practice usually the only way a union member could really get hisunion to stop using his dues for political purposes was by quitting theunion            Paycheck protection became a big conservative rallying cry after the election because labors unexpectedly strong clout scared Republicans todeath Now some form of paycheck protection has been adopted in fivestatesWyoming Idaho Washington state Ohio where it was later struck downin court and Michigan A California ballot initiative on paycheck protectionin  failed slowing the movements momentum no states adopted paycheckprotection in  But Oregon has a paycheckprotection measure on the ballotin             Its instructive to examine one reason why paycheck protection failed inCalifornia Opponents neutralized the business community by threatening tosponsor a similar measure requiring corporations to getstockholders  permission before engaging in political activities JoseMoreno a spokesman for the opponents to the ballot initiative explained toDavid Corn of The Nation that a gentlemans agreement was worked outwith the corporate community to lie low Conservatives naturally have triedto argue that stockholders dont merit the same rights bestowed onunion members by paycheckprotection measures Isnt it touching howmuch more conservatives care about working people than they do about WallStreet speculators Here is John Fund of the Wall Street Journal seditorial page making the case in  in the Web magazine IntellectualCapitalcom                                             Opponents of Paycheck Protection argue that it is not balanced unlessstockholders are also given the right to vote on whether or not a corporationcan make political expenditures Once again the Supreme Court has spokendefinitively on this In First National Bank of Boston v Bellotti in it noted The critical distinction here is that no shareholder has beencompelled to contribute anything The shareholder invests in a corporation ofhis own volition and is free to withdraw his investment at any time and for anyreason In most of the country workers can be required to join a union or payunion dues as a condition of employment                                       But the point isnt whether people who own stocks live more comfortable andindependent lives than people who belong to unions clearly they do The pointis whether the same inconvenient principles of direct democracy that are usedto inhibit labor should be used to inhibit capital Clearly they shouldifnot by the Supreme Court then by the legislative branch which rightly has abit more leeway to decide how to achieve social justice            As it happens McCain says he supports both paycheck protectionand stockholder protection But Ron Nehring director of nationalcampaigns for Americansfor Tax Reform a conservative group thats pushing paycheck protectionvery aggressivelyand whose leader Grover Norquist has discussed the issueextensively with George W Bushsays what McCains for isnt really paycheckprotection Nehring says its mainly a codification of the  Supreme Courtdecision and wouldnt put much more burden on unions to prove theyve gotmembers permission to spend money on political causes In  Sen DonNickles attached to a campaignfinance bill a paycheckprotection amendmentthat purported to require unions and corporations to get membersand stockholders to sign off on political spending But corporationsenjoyed a huge loophole The stockholders had to do so only if they wereassessed special dues or fees If the loophole hadnt been there you can besure Fortune  companies would have been out in force lobbying against itThe amendment failed as did the overall bill and when the bill came up for avote again this year no similar amendment was offered This suggests thatpaycheck protection will likely live on more as a rhetorical excuse forRepublican opponents of campaign reform than as an actual cause
