                    Background        Glycosaminoglycans GAGs are negatively charged        polysaccharides derived from an amino hexose They are        structural and functional modulators of extracellular        matrices that play important roles in CNS development and        repair They exhibit both stimulatory and inhibitory        influences on neurite outgrowth and survival Evidence        demonstrates the ability of heparin sulfates HSs to bind        to growthtrophic factors and selectively regulate such        factors receptors      They can act as coreceptors        of growthtrophic and survival factors to regulate cell        behavior andor restrict diffusion and create a relatively        high local concentration of ligand        Pigment epitheliumderived factor PEDF is an        extracellular neuronal differentiation and survival factor        for cells derived from the retina and CNS It induces        neuronal differentiation in retinoblastoma cells protects        retina neurons including photoreceptors from death by        apoptosis and other insults and has a morphogenetic effect        on photoreceptor cells        It also has        neurotrophic effects on neurons from the cerebellum        hippocampus and spinal cord          In the        intact retina this factor is identified as a secreted        protein associated by ionic interactions with the        interphotoreceptor matrix      where GAGs are the        major polyanionic components        Biochemically PEDF is a kDa glycoprotein with        structural homology to members of the serineprotease        inhibitor serpin superfamily      However it has        no inhibitory effects on proteases Its neurotrophic        activities are independent of its protease inhibition        potential but dependent on its interaction with        cellsurface receptors         PEDF has high        binding affinity for cellsurface receptors in human        retinoblastoma Y cells K                   d            nM which is mediated by interactions between a        region spanning amino acid positions  of the PEDF        polypeptide and the extracellular domains of the receptor        protein     Blockage of these interactions inhibits        the PEDF neurotrophic effects PEDF also has binding        affinity for GAGs such as heparin heparin and        chondroitinsulfates but this affinity is fold lower        than for the receptor eg K                   d           M for the heparinPEDF interactions             The binding to GAGs is mediated by ionic interactions        between an area clustered with positively charged lysines        of PEDF and the negatively charged GAGs In the PEDF        spatial structure the putative GAG binding domain is        distinct from and nonoverlapping with the neurotrophic        active region             Because PEDF coexists with GAGs in extracellular        matrices and has binding affinity for them it is of        interest to investigate the role of GAGs on PEDF activity        Given that binding to cellsurface receptors is the first        step in the biological activity of PEDF we used human        retinoblastoma Y cells and their conditioned media CM        as sources of functional PEDF receptors and extracellular        matrix components respectively to examine the GAG content        in CM and their effects on PEDF ligandreceptor        interactions The data suggest that heparan sulfate        participates in the formation of a PEDF binding complex        with its cellsurface receptor and constitutes a positive        modulator for the PEDFreceptor interactions                    Results                  Complex formation between PEDF and components in          media conditioned by retinoblastoma cells          To determine whether PEDF interacts with components          in media conditioned by retinoblastoma cells CM we          used an ultrafiltration assay In this assay soluble          PEDF of kDa is filtered through a membrane with an          exclusion limit of MW  however it is retained          upon formation of a complex larger than this limit              The binding reactions were with a given IPEDF          concentration and CM Incubations were at C to minimize          enzymatic degradation of proteins and glycosaminglycans          during the reaction We found that  of IPEDF was          retained by the membrane in the presence of concentrated          CM compared to only  retention in the presence of          defined medium nonconditioned medium concentrated in          an identical fashion Specific retention termed PEDF          bound was calculated by subtracting the retention in          defined media from that in CM Figure shows that PEDF          was specifically retained when mixed with soluble          conditioned media and the value for PEDF bound increased          proportionally to the concentration factor of the media          Fig A Interestingly protease treatment of the CM          did not abolish the binding Fig B These observations          revealed that the retained forms in the CM were PEDF          complexes  kDa and that the majority of these          complexes were formed with soluble CM components other          than proteins                          Heparin and HS in the conditioned media with          affinity for PEDF          GAGs and polyanions in the CM were fractionated by          anionexchange column chromatography followed by          PEDFaffinity column chromatography Fig  The GAG          content was followed by staining with Toluidine BlueO          Fig CDE The final fraction CM PEDF contained          components with binding affinity for PEDF that stained          with Toluidine BlueO and migrated as high molecular          weight GAGs          To determine the type of sulfated GAG in the media we          designed a spectrophotometric assay using heparinase and          heparitinase specific degrading enzymes for heparin and          HS respectively Fig  The activities of both GAG          lyases reached a plateau by one hour of incubation Figs          AC and the degradation of GAG substrates between           g was linear Both CM and CM PEDFcontained substrates          for heparinase and heparitinase Figs BD The amount          of GAGs was determined by comparison of the amount of           hexuronate produced with CM samples to the standard          curves with commercial GAGs The estimated content of          GAGs in CM varied between  gml for heparin and          between  gml for HSlike molecules among media          conditioned by three different batches of Y cells The          estimated GAG content in CM PEDFranged  gl and           gl for heparin and HS respectively Similar          assays were followed with chondroitinase ABC but its          substrates DiS dermatan and DiS in CM were below          detection limits These results demonstrated that CM and          CM PEDFcontained heparin and HSlike molecules          demonstrating that Y cells produced GAGs with binding          affinity for PEDF                          Media conditioned by retinoblastoma cells enhances          the IPEDF binding to cellsurface receptors          We have demonstrated previously that biologically          active IPEDF binds specifically competitively and          with high affinity to cellsurface receptors of Y          cells     Because the reaction conditions were          identical to those used for biological assays the          binding reactions were performed in the presence of media          conditioned by the cells for  hours CM We          investigated the effect of components of the CM a source          of extracellular matrix on the PEDFreceptor          interactions using CM and nonconditioned defined media          in radioligand binding assays Comparison of reactions in          the absence and presence of CM showed that the specific          PEDFbinding to Y cellsurface receptors was fold          higher with conditioned medium than with defined medium          Fig  Note that with the binding method used the          amount of IPEDF retained in CM without cells is the          same to the amount of nonspecific IPEDF binding          reactions with cells and in the presence of fold          molar excess of unlabeled PEDF     indicating          retention by PEItreated glassfiber filters of          PEDFreceptor or GAGPEDFreceptor complexes rather than          PEDFGAG Similar results were obtained when the          cellbound IPEDF was separated by centrifugation          rather than filtration through glassfiber filters and          comparing reactions with CM versus those with  BSA in          PBS data not shown These observations showed that a          components secreted by retinoblastoma cells enhanced          the PEDFreceptor interactions                          Effect of GAG lyases and chlorate on IPEDF          binding to cellsurface receptors          To deplete the Y cell cultures of HS and          heparinlike GAGs we used heparitinase and heparinase          respectively The cultures were pretreated with each GAG          lyase before using them in radioligand binding assays          The morphology and viability of the cells were not          affected with the GAG lyase treatments Figure Ashows          that specific IPEDF binding decreased significantly          in heparitinase treated cultures compared to untreated          controls and less drastically in heparinase treated          ones Hyaluronidase treatment to deplete the cultures of          hyaluronan did not have an effect on the binding These          results demonstrated that removal of heparinHS from the          cell cultures decreased the PEDF binding to receptors on          Y cells Chlorate is a competitive inhibitor of          ATPsulfurylase and inhibition of GAG sulfation in cell          cultures can be achieved by pretreatment of the cultures          with  mM sodium chlorate     The effect of          undersulfated GAGs on the PEDF binding to its receptor          was examined Cells pretreated with sodium chlorate did          not show changes in viability or morphology however the          treatment resulted in a decrease in the specific          IPEDF binding to about  relative to untreated          controls Fig B Sodium sulfate was used to recover          the loss of GAG sulfation by chlorate increasing the          binding to  maximal with  mM sulfate additions The          data revealed that inhibition of sulfation of GAGs          reduced the PEDF binding to cellsurface receptors of          Y cells with about  of specific inhibition Thus          these observations implied that HSheparin might play a          functional role in the binding of PEDF to its          cellsurface receptor                            Discussion        It has been proposed that the GAGbinding property of        PEDF provides the molecular basis for its association with        extracellular matrices and may serve to localize PEDF        activity in the retina and CNS      However the        present results point to direct effects these        polysaccharides might have on the biochemical interactions        between PEDF and PEDF receptors on the surfaces of cells        that respond to this neurotrophic factor We have shown        that the binding of PEDF to receptors in retinoblastoma        cells is enhanced by the presence of extracellular        heparinHSlike GAGs which can be found in the culture        medium of retinoblastoma cells The fact that the binding        of PEDF to cell surfaces decreases with heparinHS        depletion implies that heparinHS molecules might act as        cofactors for PEDFreceptor interactions Interactions        between PEDF and extracellular GAGs can also explain the        complex formed by PEDF with CM even after protease        treatment of the latter The PEDFheparinHS complex may        somehow facilitate encounters between PEDF and its        receptor         eg  by inducing a conformational        change in PEDF which might accelerate the ligandreceptor        interactions In addition the receptor may also form a        complex with heparinHS to facilitate interactions with the        ligand        To our knowledge this is the first report on the        production of GAGs by retinoblastoma cells We found that        these cells produce HSheparin secreted into the culturing        media The retina and malignant solid tumors also produce        the sulfated GAGs           Although HSs are        mostly found as proteoglycans associated with the basal        lamina or the plasma membrane the presence of HSs in the        culturing medium might be a result of shedding or release        of their extracellular domains from the cell membranes as        soluble components Cellassociated HS proteoglycans can        undergo regulated shedding from the membrane into the        soluble extracellular matrix or culturing medium converting        the membrane anchored molecules into soluble effectors             In the conditioned media of all the tested batches of        retinoblastoma cells we detected heparin and HS with        binding affinity for PEDF The estimated concentrations of        these GAGs in the media may vary with cell density and        conditioning time However under the conditions used they        were within the linear range of HSPEDF complex formation                 EC            gml            The fact that depletion of heparinHSlike GAGs from the        culturing media results in inhibition of PEDF binding to        cell surface receptors points to functional roles for these        GAGs such as those of positive modulators of PEDFreceptor        interactions In this regard we observed that depletion        from the Y cell cultures of heparin with heparinase was        lower than those depleted of HS with heparitinase        suggesting that the retinoblastomaderived HS was more        effective than the retinoblastomaderived heparin This        observation can be explained by structural compositional        and functional differences between heparin and HS GAGs        GAGbinding proteins can be differentially sensitive to        variations in GAG structure     GAGs produced among        different cell types have structural and compositional        differences and structural changes in GAGs are known to        occur in cells undergoing morphological differentiation        andor malignant transformations        Thus in        the native retina or other tissue modulation of the        PEDFreceptor interactions may depend on the expression of        GAGs which occur during development and pathological        conditions        Our data offer interesting possibilities of regulation        of the activity of PEDF The ratio and amount of production        of heparin and HS by cells bearing PEDF receptors may be an        important mechanism to control the activity of PEDF as is        the modulation of the rate of expression of PEDF receptors        The data obtained so far on the action of PEDF on different        cells may have not considered the presence of these        cofactors in the media The binding of GAGs to PEDF that        modulate the binding of these factors to its receptor opens        also the possibility that different GAGs may modulate        differently the affinity of PEDF for its receptors by        increasing or even decreasing it in some cases Finally        the fact that the GAG and receptor binding regions are on        opposite regions of the PEDF molecule suggest the        possibility of the existence of PEDF mutants or engineered        variants that having lost or decreased GAGbinding        capabilities still show high affinity for the PEDF        receptor in a way not dependent upon GAGs content or        composition These possibilities are discussed under the        consideration that some of them may have important        implications if PEDF or molecules derived from it are to        be used in the future as therapeutic agents        The primary consequence of reducing the heparinHS and        its sulfation was to minimize a binding site required for        PEDF activity Although GAGs store PEDF in the        extracellular matrix     a more direct mechanism        appears necessary namely its participation in the binding        of PEDF to its receptor In a spatial structure of PEDF        the heparinHS binding domain of PEDF maps to the opposite        side of the neurotrophic active region     allowing        distinct and nonoverlapping interactions with heparinHS        on one side of the protein and with the neurotrophic        receptor on its opposite side Our data suggest that the        intrinsic affinity of the cell surface receptor for PEDF        appears low whereas the heparinHSPEDF complex is        recognized with high affinity In addition a direct        interaction between the receptor and GAGs may also be        necessary Although details of the mechanism remain to be        revealed it is clear that heparinHS is required for the        first step of the neurotrophic activity of PEDF namely the        encounters with its receptor at the cell surface The        differentiation and survival of cells in vivo may be        regulated not only by the expression of PEDF and its        receptor but also by the temporal and spatial expression of        GAGs                    Methods                  Materials          Heparin purified from bovine

active radioligand IPEDF and Y          cells    by a widelyused method with a mechanism of          retention of receptors on polyethyleniminetreated          glassfiber filters based mainly on ionic interactions              Polyethylenimine binds strongly to glass which is          negatively charged and integral membrane proteins tend to          be acidic The resultant polycationic          polyethyleniminecoated glass can retain cell membranes          due to their negative charges Because binding of          cellsurface receptors to polyethylenimine filters is          rather insensitive to ionic strength the ionic          phenomenon is thought to be supplemented by hydrophobic          forces and hydrogen binding     The method used with          Y cells and radiolabeled PEDF has been described          before in detail     Briefly cells cultured          overnight in serumdeprived medium at C were          transferred to icewater bath for  minutes before the

       The presence of GAGs was assayed using specific GAG          lyases           ie  the presence of heparin HS          and chondroitin sulfates with heparinase heparitinase          and

GAG lyase Samples were depleted of          proteins by protease treatment to avoid interference in          absorbance readings of the product For heparinase and          heparitinase reactions
