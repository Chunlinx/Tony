        okay   yeah how many children do you have   i have four   and i have three what do you have boys girls   i have uh three boys and one girl the girls adopted   i have uhhuh i have two girls and one boy   yeah   do you have grandchildren yet   uh yeah i got two grandchildren   oh i got ahead of you there i got three and one on the way       no but uh i know when my children were growing up we did spend a lot of time together   yeah uh   uh school activities and my my boy was in hockey   yeah   and of course the girls uh and and uh myself we rooted you know we didnt participate but we did a lot of family things together   yeah   we had animals for the children you know our horses and that kind of thing and uh school activities type stuff   yeah yeah my kids were involved in sports   uhhuh   football and baseball and   uhhuh   whatever   did you find the time to attend   but uh oh yeah   oh yeah we did too   when they were growing up we did we were out in the middle of a desert out in Ridgecrest California   i think thats kind of the key dont you   huh   i think thats kind of the key   yeah   is to not be in the big city   yeah there wasnt a lot of other things for them to do   right   and uh so when when they participated in sports or whatever well uh all nearly all the parents went   and yep we did that too and the children where um when in fact when my youngest was about two we decided to get out of the city and go to the country   yeah   i mean its not as vast a country as like you know where you people are from because i lived in Abilene for a little while   yeah   and uh i know what nothing is when i moved out there   yeah   you know it the city itself is great but i mean you go in the in the uh car for a drive and you could see nothing for miles and miles and miles   we came back when they were teenagers   uhhuh   and of course uh then they came to the big city as teenagers and that the time with them wasnt as much as it was when they were out there in the small   yeah   town out in the middle of the desert   uhhuh but they at least they had the background   yeah   and the the home uh the family type unit you know and i think when kids have that they dont  get into as much trouble or seek to   right   you know do other things that are really not good for them you know   yeah gosh our our kids were fortunate they had good good other kids to play with   yep same here   uh maybe its not like it is nowadays really when theres so much uh some drugs and everything else   no no i know im so happy that i had mine had mine when i did and that im not having them now i think about it   yeah i would not want to raise a a child today   no no   from scratch you know from start   and plus i think that the uh mothers the husbands and wives both having to work   yeah   its not a matter of choice anymore i think most people   no its a necessity   yeah   its a   and uh it that takes so much time away from your kids   yeah yeah i well uh   of course at the at the time i worked third shift to be with my kids during the day   yeah   you know and then uh my uh husband was with them at night   yeah   so they were always with a family member you know   yeah   and babysitters and uh day care and all that stuff kids dont really bond anymore   yeah   the mothers arent there   well i i i told my wife that uh i dont know what young kids just starting out nowadays especially if they have uh have some children if if theyre trying to buy a house both of them have to work in order to pay for a house   oh yeah yep   uh and the kids really spend more time at school or with a babysitter then they do with their parents   exactly but you know uh i wonder by the time they get through paying out for all the day care center and everything else is it really worth all that   yep   rather than to wait until the children are like in school   yeah   and then go for that type of goal i think that too many people want everything now   yeah yeah i told   like we had to save and plan and   uhhuh   do without and that kind of stuff where its now the credit cards and   yeah   i mean they just go and buy it you know   yeah well kids nowadays they want to start out with a   exact   three bedroom brick house   yep   and when we started out well we started out in first of all in an apartment and then rented a a duplex   exactly sure   and then went from a duplex to a little old two bedroom frame house   thats my point and and i think that they should like learn how to crawl before they walk   but uh uhhuh   its its too much it and its too accessible   yeah   and they get into it and theyre over their heads i think thats why theres so many divorces too   yeah   because the money becomes uh an issue the children become an issue the jobs become an issue and its like you know whats left   yeah   just to argue and that type of thing you know   uhhuh im im i really feel for young parents nowadays   i do i do   i i just dont uh see how   theyre like between a rock and a hard spot   yeah   it really is awful i think maybe the company should do more with day care centers and that type of thing it might bring families closer   yeah   or mothers to children you know because theyre able to spend some time   yeah they brought that up at TI i dont know how many times to to uh have a day care   at yeah   for working mothers but uh TI never has seen fit to do it   no huh   but there are a few companies here in Dallas that do   yeah i think thats great because i mean you know you you its less guilt you feel knowing that you have to leave them everyday if you can go in and see them for ten or fifteen minutes around a lunch hour or   yeah   just know theyre close by   yeah   you know its its very hard well it was nice chatting with you   well do you work at a Attleboro or does your or your husband   yes i do i do no i do   oh you do   yeah   okay   i work in uh building twelve in Attleboro   oh well of course i always see
