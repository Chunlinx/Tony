                                  The Party of Buchanan            Before Republicans toss Pat Buchanan for sayingthat the United States should have stayed out of World War II they shouldlisten to some of their own rhetoric about more recent foreign policycontroversies No one but Pat is saying in  that we were wrong to help stopHitler but leading Republicans are saying things today that lead you to wonderwhat they would have been saying in             Buchanans new book A Republic Not anEmpire  chronicles how generations of woollyheaded idealists repeatedlydragged the United States into pointless overseas conflicts Buchanan contendsthat Nazi Germany posed no real threat to Americas vital interests after and that Franklin Roosevelt either bumbled his way into the world war ordeceitfully conspired to get the country embroiled in a war it need not havefought Click for                   Slate               s assessment of the books historicalaccuracy            Sen John McCain ofArizona declared that anyone who repudiates our involvement against NaziGermany obviously does not reflect the views of America much less theRepublican Party and invited Buchanan to leave the GOP Elizabeth Dole saidshe was appalled Over the past week or so many Republicans have concludedthat Buchanans threat to join the Reform Party was no threat at all His viewsare too extreme and unconscionable for him to remain a Republican George WBush believes Buchanans views are extreme and unconscionable but thinks heshould stay in the party anyway            Whats really striking though about Buchanans ideas isnot how different but really how very similar they are to the foreign policythinking that dominates the congressional Republican caucus If you start withthe foreign policy assumptions held by most Republicans on Capitol HillBuchanans central argumentthat Nazi Germany didnt threaten Americas vitalnational interests after is not that far off the mark            What Buchanan actuallysays is this By the end of  after the worst of the Battle of Britain ithad become clear that the Germans would not be able to mount a crosschannelinvasion of Britain If the Germans couldnt invade the United KingdomBuchanan asks how could they credibly pose a threat to the United Statesthousands of miles across the Atlantic FDR who had a broad conception of hiscountrys national interests did not have much trouble answering thatquestion But if you agree with Buchanans highly constricted view of thenational interest its not a bad point            Buchanans premise is as a continental nation America hasfew vital national interests beyond our own shores and still fewer outside ourown hemisphere A corollary is that Americas membership in internationalorganizations imperils the national interest by threatening to drag the countryinto needless conflicts overseas Another corollary is that mere humanitarianconsiderations should play little or no role in decisions about when tointervene in faraway places America cant be the worlds policeman or its            All this sounds a lotlike what congressional Republicans have been saying since the end of the ColdWar Just a few months ago neoisolationist Republicans were arguing that theUnited States should stay out of Kosovo because we had no vital interests inthe peace and stability of southeastern Europe Texas Sen Phil Gramm insistedthat the Kosovo war should not have been fought because the President hadnever made a convincing case for putting the lives of Americans at risk in awar where we have no vital national interest at stake House Majority Whip TomDeLay of Texas fulminated on the House floor that NATO is starting to resemblea powerhungry imperialist army and he claimed that the crisis in Kosovoposes no security threat to American people our territory or our welfareMany of these same legislators routinely declare that American liberties andsovereignty are being stolen by bowtied bureaucrats at the United Nationsand the World Trade Organization and even by foreign generals in NATO            Beyond situational sound bites Buchanan and the Republicanleadership share the same underlying theory of the nations foreign policyLiberal internationalists believe that there is a moral dimension to ourleadership in the international community They also believe that internationalorganizations on balance reduce future threats to our vital interests Thisoften means anticipating future threats at one or two stages of remove andrecognizing that our values and our interests though not identical are notwholly separate either But many prominent Republicans prefer a policy ofavoiding international commitments and keeping a robust national defense instore for any power that directly threatens our territory or our citizensGenocide in another part of the world may be tragic Regional instability onsome other continent may be something to keep an eye on But unless our accessto strategic natural resources is threatened or bullets actually start flyingour way its simply best not to get involved            As Buchanans bookaccurately notes this isolationist mentality has deep roots in the RepublicanParty Sen Robert Taft tried to keep the United States out of World War II inthe late s and then sought to restrain Americas overseas commitments inthe early Cold War years Before the advent of modern weaponry one of thecentral tenets of the isolationist catechism was that Americas status as acontinental nation flanked by two great oceans gave us the luxury of doingwithout all the treaties and alliances that countries such as France or GreatBritain had to bother with At midcentury when internationalism was at itszenith it was commonly thought that a mixture of technology and Americasgreat power status had made such thinking obsolete But the impulse remains Itis actually one of the key motivators behind the conservative obsession with anational missile defensea technological fix that would conveniently replacethe oceans in allowing the United States to avoid a lot of proactive foreigninvolvement            The case for not acting until you have to was put mostvividly by Senate Assistant Majority Leader Don Nickles of Oklahoma in aremark that also captures the hardnosed attitude regarding humanitarianconcerns During Kosovo Nickles said publicly that he had told PresidentClinton I dont think that we should begin bombing unless and until the Serbsreally begin a very significant massacre            Isolationist sentimentsdont prevent DeLay and Co from saberrattling and given the belligerentstands they often take toward countries like China or Cuba petulantunilateralists might be a better term for them Whether or not this attitudeis morally vacant and ultimately selfdefeating as its critics charge itshard to see how anyone who seriously holds these views whatever you call themcould really have had much to argue about with the America Firsters in the lates            Not all Republicans think this way The WeeklyStandard has been eloquently critical of Republican neoisolationism and ispushing something called National Greatness conservatism a program ofmuscular American engagement around the globe The mainstream GOP foreignpolicy establishment Eagleburgers and Scowcrofts and the like still espousesa trimmeddown realist variant of internationalism And some of the GOPsincreasing antiinterventionism can be ascribed to hysterical dislike ofPresident Clinton rather than to principled belief and is likely to wane whenhe is gone But as of now the majority of the congressional partytheRepublicans who actually run for office and get electedembraces a theory ofnational interests that is very similar to the one in Buchanans newpageturner            The main difference between these congressionalRepublicans and Pat Buchanan is that none of them have been thoughtful enoughto apply their beliefs to World War II or politically foolish enough tomention it if they have
