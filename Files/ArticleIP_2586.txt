                                 Bound in Chains            In November  an emailletter began to circulate on the Internet detailing the dangers of a viciousharddriveeating computer virus called Good Times Recipients were urged toforward the email to their friends Computer authorities promptly debunked theletterthe virus did not exist Soon a revamped Good Times message appearedon the Net warning of an n th complexity infinite binary loopadevice as fictional as it is impressivesounding Even though this note wasdebunked it continued to propagate as wellintentioned computer usersforwarded it to their friends and colleagues Netizens translated it into otherlanguages and it appeared around the world It was read over a radio broadcastin Malta Eventually a parody arrivedit too was widely circulatedAccording to the Good Times FAQ Web page Its no longer accurate to speakof comebacks and outbreaks of Good Times Its just therepart of thelandscape like kudzu and dandelions            Ofcourse chain letters like the Good Times email predate the Internet In the th century prayer chains encouraged the faithful to pray forsomeone in need and extend the chain A wellknown postal chain the St Judeletter claims a  inception date It promises luck to those who forward itand calamity to those who dont The US Postal Service estimates that thechain has circled the globe at least nine times Prayer chains also thrive onthe telephone as callers dial friends and acquaintances and ask them to prayfor someone in needand then ask them to make the same request of theirfriends and acquaintances            The St Jude letter is a mind virus says OliverGoodenough of Vermont Law School Goodenough and Richard Dawkins the notedDarwinist have written about the survival techniques of the St Jude letterand other chain mail for the scientific journal Nature  In their viewthese information parasites seek to infect host brains The most fit mindvirus is the one that is forwarded replicated to prospective infecteesLess fit letters are not forwarded and so die Some potential hosts areinoculated against chainmail viruses by excessive exposurethey simply ignorethe letters            In the old days there weremeasurable costs to extending the chaintimeconsuming handcopying orexpensive photocopying or the price of postage But thanks to virtually freeemail the velocity of chain mail has accelerated on the Net and successfulchains now billow into huge tumorous entities in a matter of weeks            The Good Times email cribsits evolutionary strategy from the old postal chains A Utah man received thisletter and threw it away Nine days later he died By invoking fear anddisaster the Good Times email finds a soft spot to infect Anxiety about aharddisk crash is never far from computer users minds            Greed isalmost as good a parasitic strategy as fear The ubiquitous Make Money Fastemail recasts the classic pyramid scheme as escam Send  to the names onthe list add your own name to the bottom and reap your windfall later TheMMF Hall of Humiliation Web site traces the Make Money Fast chains to theirorigins and lists addresses and phones of the alleged originators requestingthat you spam them            Pitted against the evolutionary strategies offear and greed we find a genre of chain email that employs compassion Surelyyouve received the Jessica Mydek letter birthed on America Online Itreads            LITTLE JESSICA MYDEK ISSEVEN YEARS OLD AND IS SUFFERING FROM AN ACUTE AND VERY            RARE CASE OF CEREBRALCARCINOMA THIS CONDITION CAUSES SEVERE MALIGNANT BRAIN            TUMORS AND IS A TERMINALILLNESS THE DOCTORS HAVE GIVEN HER SIX MONTHS TO LIVE            AS PART OF HER DYING WISHSHE WANTED TO START A CHAIN LETTER TO INFORM PEOPLE            OF THIS CONDITION AND TOSEND PEOPLE THE MESSAGE TO LIVE LIFE TO THE FULLEST AND            ENJOY EVERY MOMENT A CHANCETHAT SHE WILL NEVER HAVE FURTHERMORE THE            AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY ANDSEVERAL CORPORATE SPONSORS HAVE AGREED TO DONATE            THREE CENTS TOWARDCONTINUING CANCER RESEARCH FOR EVERY NEW PERSON THAT GETS            FORWARDED THIS MESSAGEPLEASE GIVE JESSICA AND ALL CANCER VICTIMS A CHANCE            It is abeautiful vision A dying girl spreads a noble message across the world Allreaders need to do to fill cancerresearch coffers is click a button The oneproblem of course is that Jessica Mydek is as fictitious as ann th complexity infinite binary loop The American Cancer Societydisavows any involvement with the letter            The Jessica Mydek email succeeds because it promises thereplicator instant karma So does the Save NPR letter which claims thatpublic broadcasting is in peril Its modest request is that recipients puttheir names at the bottom of the list and forward it to friends Eventuallythe letter states the email petition will be collected and presented toCongress and the president Never mind of course that public broadcastingisnt under attack that NPR receives little of its support directly fromCongress and that NPR spokespeople say the letter is useless            Web sitesthat campaign against chain mail complain that junk email wastes Internetbandwidth reduces productivity and exploits human emotions But lets notforget the upside to the chains They make you feel as if the click of yourmouse has saved your neighbors hard drive healed sickly Jessica Mydek andrescued poor little NPR Jessica Mydek may not be real but the emotionshowered on her is and the millions of emails containing her name suggestthat the impulse to do good on the Net could be harnessed            Craig Shergold was a genuine Jessica Mydek ayearold with cancer In  he began a conventional postal chain letterasking that greeting cards be mailed to Atlantas Childrens WishFoundationhis goal was to break the Guinness World Record He did it in twoyears receiving  million cards and his cancer went into permanentremission            Then the chain moved to theInternet and people continued to send cards even though Craig asked them notto By  he was clearing  cards a week and stopped counting at million total cards The foundation needed a donated warehouse and  fulltimestaff to handle the mail which it simply recycled            Last month I got a chainemail requesting greeting cards for Craig Shergold I forwarded it to friends
