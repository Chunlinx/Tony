                okay uh well since i initiated the call i guess ill start off first uh number one i have absolutely no problem with random testing uh i spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job and i feel i would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for particularly airline pilots and the such id feel much more comfortable than i do now based on what ive been hearing in the newspapers so i really dont have a problem with it   yeah uh i dont either i uh ive never worked i dont work at home right now i stay home with my children um but my husband works and they do have that at at his place of employment and neither of us have a problem with it weve particularly like you said with the things that the airlines and and such its uh its a scary thing to know that uh you just dont know what people are doing uh before they go to work   umhum   so and the the advertisements on television lately have been so um thereve been so many you know theres uh   yeah   just about like train train train wrecks and things like that that i feel like probably just for our own safety and when were traveling and things that would be something id like to know thats going on   yeah i well i happen to be uh my job is im supervisor of personnel safety for the worlds largest paint company so i its very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause this type of thing  and even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs and we at the present time do not have random testing and i am pushing towards that i i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide   um   they shouldnt have a problem with it   right   and if they are trying to hide something then i have to know that because were talking were talking major liabilities not only with themselves but with other employees   umhum   and i really you know they theyre talking about sports sports personalities and all this type of thing but i would much much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested   yeah   on a random basis i i have a real fear of that at some point somethings going to happen and theyre showing it with AIDS so why you know they should they ought to start doing something with the drugs  so i really have no problem with it   yeah well its its unfortunate i think that everyone doesnt have that opinion um some people just yeah ive heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel its an invasion of privacy and things like that but uh in the long run it seems to me its kind of like what they keep talking about the um the AIDS testing with doctors or dentists and things and how that you know they feel thats not fair and whatever but   umhum   you know those kind of things too id like to know myself it wouldnt be in my opinion i ive had a lot of dental work done and the last dentist didnt even use gloves at all so   yes oh really   that kind of yeah and uh so that kind of thing really kind of concerns me um but   well that scares me because if this thats the way they are i if i were a dentist id wanna be protected too   well you would think so that is  because well and i worked for a dentist and thats uh you know you you come in contact with a lot of of blood and things like that and   umhum   its real real dangerous i i would think but with all the accidents   umhum   just with with uh everything happening  just airlines just drive me crazy people are afraid to fly now you know just because they dont know what their  pilots been doing and and things like that and   right umhum   i dont know     well you where youre located i i do know Texas Instruments has random drug testing   uhhuh   and i think theyve had it for several years and their program they had i dont think had a lot of uh problems associated with it but uh my brotherinlaw happens to work there and it it sounded very positive and i i think its great i i would like i would encourage it im pushing our company towards that and also   well and you know if they do find someone who who is uh having a problem with drugs then they can get them the help that they need as opposed to just letting the problem go on with without any uh support   right exactly   and and whatever because a lot of people seems like would probably obviously are trying to hide that uh from their employer and friends and family and things and   umhum   too many people are just dying particularly in our area i dont know what the crime is like where you are but the crime rate here is just astronomical   right ours is changing yeah ours ours is changing its increasing i live in a  i live in a very nice suburb and its its its unbelievable what what whats going on and the drugs the selling of drugs its just its just too loose its too free   umhum i just got a piece of paper the other day uh that now they have these i i have two little very little children under two and i got a piece of paper from from my husbands office its talking about these uh drug tattoos now   umhum really   that they have got that look like it looks like a sticker and its for kids
