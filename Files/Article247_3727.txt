                                 Nobel Committee High on Grass            The New York Timesand LosAngeles Times lead with the radiation leak from an uncontrolled chainreaction at a uranium processing plant not far from Tokyo that hospitalizedthree workers contaminated dozens more and forced  nearby residents tostay indoors The Washington Post seems to think that George W Bushscriticism of GOP budget proposals that defer tax credits to lowincome earnersis more importantit runs that story across five columns at the very top whiletucking the nuke puke underneath Nobody else fronts Bush USA Todaygoes with the Census Bureaus finding that household earnings reached recordinflationadjusted levels last yeara median of  The new statsindicate particularly strong income surges in the South and the suburbs andamong children and Hispanics The LAT fronts the story while theWP and NYT stuff it Most of the income headlines muddy the realnews point somewhat The LAT says CENSUS REPORTS BROAD US GAINS ININCOME and the NYT online at least has RISING INCOMES LIFT  MILLIONOUT OF POVERTY The WP  seizing on the  million poor children citedin the report somehow manages to come up with a headline saying in part thatPOVERTY CHANGES LITTLE USAT bigprints it best POVERTY AT YEAR LOWThe LAT and WP front and the NYT reefers Gunter Grasswinning the Nobel Prize for Literature            The Japanese accident was caused say the papers when too muchuranium was poured into a purification tank This is not the only simplemistake leading to a big one in the news today the papers all cover NASAsadmission that the reason the Mars Orbiter was lost last week was that someengineers did calculations for the mission using pounds and feet while othersused the metric system The consensus among the papers is that the Japanesemishap is nowhere near as environmentally threatening as either the meltdown atThree Mile Island or the far worse Chernobyl catastrophe However theLAT quotes a nuclear safety expert saying that the three most seriouslyhurt workers may have received more radiation than their counterparts atChernobyl and maybe as much as the victims of the atomic bombings of Hiroshimaand Nagasaki            The NYT emphasizes that the incident may well have political as wellas real fallout noting that Japanese commentators are already predicting astrong public opinion backlash against industry and the government which wasseen by many Japanese as responding to yesterdays events rather slowly            All the papers report that in response to yesterdays AP story about analleged US massacre of Korean civilians in the early days of the Korean warfronted by the NYT and LAT  the Pentagon has promised toundertake a thorough investigation The WP frontpager on this statesthat for five years the US Army brushed aside these very allegations andthe LATs front effort calls the militarys current stance an abruptaboutface            Only the WP fronts Russias launching of a major ground offensiveinside Chechnya yesterday the NYT reefers it The Russian governmenthas cloaked the operation in secrecy saying only that ground fighting isalready underway and indeed says the Post  that some Russian troopshad been fighting just inside the Chechen border for two weeks The Wall Street Journal reports that in a speech today StatesStrobe Talbott will urge Russia to end indiscriminate bombing in Chechnya andto ease off on roundups of Chechens in Moscow while offering US help incombating Russias growing terrorism problem            The WP and NYT report inside that despite the likelihood of apresidential veto the House yesterday passed a bill that would establish newcriminal penalties for anyone who injures or harms a fetus while committinganother federal offense The politically loaded aspect of the bill explain thepapers is whether or not it establishes a measure of legal standing forfetuses that could be used to chip away at Roe v Wade            The WP reports inside on the Jesse Ventura interview in the newestPlayboy  In the interview Ventura takes a Nietszchean line on organizedreligion calling it a sham and crutch for the weak and says the chargesagainst naval aviators in the Tailhook scandal were much ado about nothingThe comments were condemned by the Reform party chairman but were defended bythe partys Minnesota chairman            A letter to the WP points out a worthwhile approach to the currentgun imbroglio thats not been mentioned much the availability of increasinglyeffective nonlethal weapons such as electronic stun devices and chemicalsprays effective at much greater ranges than earlier versions The writer isabsolutely right and his observations might have carried more rhetorical impactif the paper had told readers via an ID line that he is a former governmentresearcher in this area            The WP reports on but hardly seems to notice the irony in theOffice of Thrift Supervisions decision to budget  in government fundsso that OTS employees can in the coming months celebrate the offices tenthanniversary at various outings including a jazz brunch cruise down thePotomac The paper quotes an OTS official saying We consider it reasonableconsidering what OTS employees have gone through in those  years but neverbothers to tell the reader what those hardships were
