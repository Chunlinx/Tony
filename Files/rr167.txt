                    Introduction        Cystic fibrosis CF is a generalized exocrine disease        resulting from the defective regulation of epithelial        chloride ion transport within various organ systems most        importantly the lungs        This dysfunction can        arise from a variety of mutations within the cystic        fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR gene on        chromosome  which encodes the transmembrane pump        responsible for regulating transepithelial ion levels              This defect is associated with an increased viscosity        of the airway surface fluid and according to some studies        an altered salt concentration      These and other        pleiotropic effects of the CF gene abnormality increase the        susceptibility of CF patients to bronchopulmonary bacterial        infection by opportunistic pathogens                Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most        common pathogen recovered from the lungs of CF patients             This predisposition to         P aeruginosa infection has been        attributed to several factors For example an increase in        asialoGM          glycoproteins on the apical surface of        CF airway epithelial cells provides greater opportunity for        adhesion by the type IV pili of         P aeruginosa              Furthermore the first extracellular domain of wild type        CFTR has been found to act as a         P aeruginosa specific receptor        which is involved in the clearance of         P aeruginosa from the airways via        epithelial cell desquamation       a process        greatly impaired in the CF lung Other conditions that abet        colonization of the CF lung include impairment of the        mucociliary escalator and macrophagemediated        phagocytosis by the viscous airway secretions If elevated        salt concentrations exist within these secretions             they would inhibit  and defensins endogenous        antibacterial peptides produced by neutrophils and airway        epithelia respectively          This last        point is still under review as recent evidence suggests        that CF airway surface fluid may be isotonic not hypertonic                   In recent years         Burkholderia cepacia has become the        second leading cause of death in patients with chronic        granulomatous disease CGD The phagocytes of such        patients are deficient in their capacity to kill organisms        by oxidative means because of a defective NADPH oxidase                     B cepacia also poses a threat to        patients with CF either cocolonizing those already        infected with         P aeruginosa or as the sole        infecting agent      Although rates of colonization        can vary widely between  and          B cepacia is isolated from sputum in        only  of patients with CF              B cepacia  a very diverse species        has been divided into several classes of bacteria ie        genomovars collectively referred to as the         B cepacia complex Genomovar III is        the most common         B cepacia genomovar isolated from CF        patients accounting for approximately  of         B cepacia isolates in CF patients        Genomovars II and V have also been recovered from CF        patients     Of critical concern are         B cepacia s transmissibility from        one patient to another and its propensity to give rise to        the         B cepacia syndrome which results in        a rapid decline in pulmonary function      The        ability of         B cepacia as well as         P aeruginosa to cause chronic        bronchopulmonary infections in CF patients is exacerbated        by their intrinsic or acquired resistance to many        conventional antibiotics Peptide antibiotics including        protegrins are currently under consideration as novel        agents for treating pulmonary infections in CF        patients        Antimicrobial peptides are synthesized either        nonribosomally or ribosomally     Protegrin PG        a  kDa cationic octadecapeptide RGGRLCYCRRRFCVCVGRamide        was originally isolated from porcine leukocytes    and        falls into the latter category We selected it for this        study because it is rapidly bactericidal functions well at        elevated physiological salt concentrations such as those        that may occur in the CF lung and has a broad spectrum of        activity       PGs antiparallel hairpin        structure and antimicrobial activity in physiological and        elevated salt concentrations are maintained by its two        intramolecular cystine disulfide bonds                 The antimicrobial spectrum of PG includes         Chlamydia trachomatis          Candida albicans          Escherichia coli          Fusobacterium nucleatum Haemophilus        ducreyi          Listeria monocytogenes          Neisseria gonorrhoeae          Porphyromonas gingivalis          Prevotella intermedia          P aeruginosa  and         Staphylococcus aureus                         This study tested the hypothesis that the relative        sensitivity or resistance of         P aeruginosa and         B cepacia strains to PG correlates        to the extent of peptide binding A previously described        twostage radial diffusion technique designed for peptide        antibiotics was used to determine susceptibility Binding        of protegrins to intact         P aeruginosa and         B cepacia cells and to purified        lipopolysaccharide LPS and lipid A prepared from these        organisms was measured by three different techniques                    Materials and methods                  Bacterial strains and growth media          Two sets of genetically related           P aeruginosa strains were studied          Strain M a serumsensitive mucoid isolate from a CF          patient contains short Oside chain LPS while its          serumresistant derivative MSR which is also          mucoid has long Oside chain LPS     Strain FRD          is a mucoid CF isolate    and FRD is its          spontaneous nonmucoid derivative               P aeruginosa ATCC strains           and  are nonmucoid strains with long Oside chain          LPSs N L Schiller unpublished results We also studied                    B cepacia ATCC strains  and           as well as three clinical strains isolated from          patients with CF in Vancouver Canada kindly provided by          David P Speert University of British Columbia These          strains included C genomovar IIIa           B cepacia epidemic strain marker          BCESM positive cable pilin subunit gene A cable A          negative C genomovar IIIa BCESM

   with shaking in trypticase soy broth TSB          BectonDickinson Microbiology Cockeysville MD                          Protegrin          PG was prepared as previously described    and          was approximately  pure PG was dissolved in and          diluted with filtersterilized acidified water           acetic acid supplemented with  human serum albumin          Sigma St Louis MO The albumin in the PG vehicle          helped reduce nonspecific adsorption of protegrins when          the stock solutions were serially diluted               These PG stock solutions were filtersterilized prior          to storage at either C for short term  months          or C for longterm storage                          Radial diffusion assay          The twostage radial diffusion assay protocol as          described by Steinberg and Lehrer    and Lehrer           et al     was altered by          supplementing the underlay agar with  mM NaCl to          ascertain PGs ability to kill           P aeruginosa and           B cepacia at an elevated salt          concentration These assays were interpreted as described          below The sample wells received  l of PG various          concentrations or its vehicle We analyzed the radial          diffusion assay results in two ways In one we          calculated the lethal concentration C           L  as described by Hultmark           et al      from wells          surrounded by net clear zones of  to  mm In the          other we defined the minimal active concentration MAC          as the lowest concentration of PG that produced a          measurable totally clear inhibition zone around the          well                          Whole cell binding assay          Binding of PG to intact cells was measured with a          monoradioiodinated variant of PG This protegrin          variant differed from PG in two ways Phe replaced          Tyr in the protegrin domain and an Nterminal          glycinerich hexapeptide extension GGGYGG with a single          tyrosine residue was present In this report the modified          peptide and its monoiodinated variant will be called          GGPG and IGGPG respectively The full sequence of          GGPG is GGGYGGRGGRLCFCRRRFCVCVGRCONH             In preliminary experiments we          determined that PG GGPG and IGGPG exhibited          virtually identical antimicrobial potency and kinetics          data not shown          GGPG was iodinated with NaI or Na I Pierce          Rockford IL by the iodobead method               Unincorporated NaI or Na I was removed by solid phase          extraction on a SepPak C Plus Cartridge IGGPG was          purified from uniodinated and diiodinated GGPG by          reverse phaseHPLC Vydac Hesperia CA Binding assays          were done with stationary phase           P aeruginosa  or           B cepacia  both typically at             CFUml The bacteria were incubated with          IGGPG at  C for  min at pH  in a  mM          Trisacetate buffer containing  mM NaCl  TSB and           BSA Samples were layered over  ml of a cushion          composed of  parts of dibutyl phthalate and  parts of          diisodecyl phthalate density              and centrifuged at          approximately             g  After removing the supernatant          and phthalate oil the base of the tube was severed with          a razor blade and the stub which contained the pellet          was recovered for radioactivity counting                          LPS and lipid A extraction and analysis          Bacterial LPS was isolated according to the protocol          of Darveau and Hancock    with some modifications as          described below Strains were grown overnight in TSB          collected via centrifugation             g for  min at C and suspended          in a pH  buffer  g of wet weight bacteria ml of          buffer that contained  mM Trishydrochloride  mM          MgCl              gml DNase I and  gml          RNase I The slurry was passed twice through a French          Press set at  lbsin  DNase and RNase were again          added and the mixture was incubated at C for  hours          Then to each  ml of suspension the following were          added  ml of  M tetrasodium EDTA in  mM Tris          buffer  ml of  SDS in  mM Tris buffer and           ml of  mM Tris buffer The preparation was mixed and          centrifuged at             g for  min at C to remove the          peptidoglycan Protease Sigma P at  gml was          added to the supernatant and incubated at C overnight          with agitation On the next day  M MgCl            in  ethanol was added and the          suspension was cooled to C before centrifugation at                      g for  min at C The resulting          pellet was resuspended in  SDS  M tetrasodium EDTA          in  mM Tris buffer and sonicated This solution was          incubated at C for  min and cooled to room          temperature before protease  gml was added and          incubated overnight at C After reprecipitation the          following day with ethanol the pellet was resuspended in           mM Tris buffer and centrifuged at             g for  hours at C in the          presence of  mM MgCl             The final LPS extract was          suspended in  ml dH            O and dialyzed overnight against dH            O to remove any residual salt and          SDS prior to being lyophilized Contamination of the LPS          samples by protein represented no more than             as estimated by measuring the dry weight and protein          concentration with the BioRad Protein Assay Kit Nucleic          acid contamination was considered to be minimal due to          the repeated DNase and RNase treatments LPS preparations          were diluted using the PG vehicle prior to assaying          with PG          Lipid A was extracted from isolated LPS preparations          via acid hydrolysis      Isolated LPS  mg          was suspended in  ml of a  acetic acid solution and          heated in a water bath to C under refluxing          conditions for  hours Once the lipid A was hydrolyzed          it precipitated out of solution and was extracted with          five sequential  ml aliquots of chloroform Lipid A          extracts were collected and washed three times with  ml          aliquots of dH            O before being lyophilized Lipid A          was dissolved in  dimethyl sulfoxide DMSO which          was diluted to  with the PG vehicle before          application in the radial diffusion assay          In order to measure the ability of LPS and lipid A to          bind PG we modified the two stage radial diffusion          assay so that we could ascertain the amount of LPS or          lipid A in ng that reduced the antimicrobial activity          of  ng of PG by  percent called the effective          concentration  or EC             Briefly  l of a  gml          PG solution and  l of LPS or lipid A at various          concentrations based on their dry weight were combined          and added to the radial diffusion wells After a hour          incubation a nutrient rich overlay gel was poured and          the plates were incubated overnight The following day          zone diameters including the wells were measured in mm          Since the height h of the underlay gel was always           mm the zone diameters were converted to volumes cleared          of viable bacteria with the formula for the volume of a          cylinder V r h Since the  mm diameter sample well          was devoid of both bacteria and peptide its volume           l was subtracted from the gross clear zone volume  r          h to derive the net volume rendered free of bacteria          As will be shown below this net volume was a linear          function of the amount of PG placed in the well for          amounts of protegrin between  ng well                          Surface plasmon resonance          Binding of LPS or lipid A to PG was assessed with a          Biacore  system BiaCore AB Piscataway NJ a very          similar approach was used to study LPS binding by peptide          domains of horseshoe crab factor C     This          innovative technology uses surface plasmon resonance to          study biomolecular interactions in real time Briefly          the binding takes place on a small chip coated with a          thin layer of metal It is monitored by monochromatic          ppolarized light whose electric vector component is          parallel to the plane of incidence Under these          conditions the intensity of the reflected light is          markedly reduced at a specific incident angle producing          a sharp shadow This phenomenon is called surface          plasmon resonance SPR and the incident light angle at          which the shadow is observed is the SPR angle          Detection of the SPR angle depends on changes in the          refractive index RI of the medium on the nonilluminated          side of the chip Since this RI depends on the mass          concentration of macromolecules at this surface          monitoring the SPR angle provides a realtime measure of          changes in the surface concentration The SPR spectrum is          a plot of the SPR angle against time and displays the          interactions progress at the sensor surface The SPR          signal is expressed in resonance units RU and  RU          is equivalent to a change in surface protein          concentration of about  ngmm or of about  mgml in          the bulk protein concentration          In our study LPS and lipid A samples from           P aeruginosa  and           B cepacia  were immobilized          on a hydrophobic HPA sensor chip BR Biacore AB          that was found in our preliminary experiments to          provide an optimal matrix for LPS and lipid A The          surface of HPA sensor chips is composed of longchain          alkanethiol molecules that form a flat quasicrystalline          hydrophobic layer that facilitates hydrophobic adsorption          of liposomes or micelles on a userdefined polar lipid          monolayer The chip was precleaned and conditioned by          washing twice with  mM noctyl glucoside Sigma          Chemical Co To immobilize the LPS  l of a  mgml          LPS preparation was dispersed in  mM NaCl containing           mM HEPES buffer pH  and passed across the chips          surface for  min at flow rate of  lmin Lipid A was          dissolved and immobilized similarly except that its          concentration was reduced to  mgml Residual unbound          LPS and lipid A were washed away with  M HCl and  M          NaOH BSA  mgml was used to detect nonspecific          binding on the surfaces coated by LPS or lipid A PG          binding was measured by observing the change in the SPR          angle of the sample bound to the chip as  l of PG           M  M  M  M  M and  M flowed over          the sample for  min at a rate of  lmin These PG          solutions were also prepared in  mM NaCl containing           mM HEPES buffer pH  Each binding study was done in          triplicate and the chip was regenerated between trials by          washing it with  M HCl and  M NaOH                            Results                  Activity of PG on P aeruginosaand B          cepaciastrains          The C           L and MAC for PG on           P aeruginosa and           B cepacia were determined in          twostage radial diffusion assays Table  The mean C           L of PG for the six           P aeruginosa strains was           gml and the mean C           L for the five           B cepacia strains was  gml          a fold difference The mean MACs for           P aeruginosa and           B cepacia were  gml and           gml respectively The C           L and MAC values for           P aeruginosa and           B cepacia differed significantly                     P exact   when the data were          analyzed by the MannWhitney test          We also compared two sets of genetically related           P aeruginosa strains          MMSR and FRDFRD Whereas the LPS of strain          M has a very short Oantigen side chain LPS from          strain MSR has a very long Oantigen side chain          However despite these differences both strains had          comparable C           L and MAC values Similarly          comparison of the alginate producer FRD with FRD its          spontaneous nonmucoid derivative revealed that both          strains had very similar C           L and MAC values                          Intactwhole cell binding          Incubation of IGGPG with intact           P aeruginosa  PG sensitive          and           B cepacia  PG resistant          cells demonstrated a marked difference in protegrin          binding between the two strains Fig  When the          bacteria were exposed to  g IGGPG ml          approximately sixfold more protegrin molecules bound to           P aeruginosa than to           B cepacia  and at an IGGPG          concentration of  gml  times as many protegrin          molecules bound to           P aeruginosa  Another factor also          merits mention in this regard By light microscopy the           B cepacia cells appeared larger          than the           P aeruginosa cells By electron          microscopy we found that the mean cross sectional          diameters and lengths of           B cepacia  cells were           m   m The corresponding values for           P aeruginosa  cells were           m   m Assuming a cylindrical structure for both          we calculated that the surface area of the           B cepacia cells  m  was          approximately  larger on average than that of           P aeruginosa  m                           Binding of PG to LPS and lipid A          To compare binding of PG to LPS and lipid A from           P aeruginosa  and           B cepacia  we devised a          simple bioassay based on the radial diffusion assay As          shown in Fig  for protegrin amounts between  and           ng the volume of underlay gel that was rendered          completely free of viable bacteria was linearly related          to the amount of peptide introduced into the well By          mixing a constant amount of protegrin within this linear          range with graded amounts of purified LPS and lipid A          we could readily determine how much of these ligands were          needed to reduce the activity of  ng of PG by           the EC            values The results of our assays          with LPS and lipid A purified from the strains we used in          the above IGGPG binding studies are shown in Fig A          The EC            values for LPS isolated from           P aeruginosa and           B cepacia differed by fold           ng versus  ng while the EC            values for lipid A isolated from          the same strains differed by approximately fold           ng versus  ng          To ascertain if these findings were representative we          prepared LPS and lipid A from another pair of bacteria            P aeruginosa FRD and           B cepacia C and repeated the          studies The EC            values for both LPS and lipid A          obtained from           P aeruginosa FRD were each           ng The values for           B cepacia LPS and lipid A were          estimated as approximately  ng for both Fig B a          difference of fold when compared to           P aeruginosa FRD LPS and lipid          A                          Surface plasmon resonance studies          We also used SPR spectroscopy to compare the binding          of PG to LPS and lipid A purified from           P aeruginosa  and           B cepacia  Injection of LPS          or lipid A from both strains was stopped when the          increase in RU of both reached  Loosely bound          molecules were washed away by increasing the flow rate to           lmin followed by two oneminute short pulse          injections of  mM NaOH Injections of  mgml BSA          prepared in the eluent buffer were passed across the LPS          or lipid A coated surfaces for a fiveminute period and          showed an increase of around  RU whereas the same          amount of BSA passed across the uncoated noctyl          glucoside washed surface showed an increase of roughly           RU This demonstrated that the surface of the chip          was fully covered by LPS or lipid A Since similar          amounts of these ligands had bound to the chip the          response unit differences seen at concentrations between           and  M indicate that approximately twice as much          PG bound           P aeruginosa lipid A as bound          lipid A from the           B cepacia strain Fig  Binding          differences were less marked when we studied LPS from          these organisms Fig  Although up to one third more          protegrin molecules bound to           P aeruginosa LPS than to           B cepacia LPS at protegrin          concentrations of  M these differences disappeared          when we tested higher PG concentrations At  M PG          LPS from           P aeruginosa and           B cepacia bound PG equally            response units Equal binding was also seen at  M          PG   response units                            Discussion        In this study we compared the sensitivity of         P aeruginosa and         B cepacia strains to protegrin PG        with the ability of the intact bacteria and key components        of their outer membranes LPS and lipid A to bind this        peptide The indices of susceptibility C         L and MAC values obtained from our        radial diffusion assays established that         P aeruginosa was considerably more        sensitive to PG than         B cepacia  We also found that at        any given peptide concentration many fewer protegrin        molecules bound to intact         B cepacia and its lipid A than to        the corresponding         P aeruginosa preparations In model        systems the ability of protegrins to permeabilize        membranes shows pronounced concentrationgating an        indication that it is influenced by the density of bound        protegrin molecules per unit area of membrane     As        prior quantitative studies of peptide binding are few in        number some readers may be surprised to note that Fig        shows many millions of protegrin molecules are bound to an        average bacterial cell even at concentrations around the        minimal active concentration To acquire an equivalent        density of surfacebound PG molecules         B cepacia needed exposure to much        higher concentrations of PG than         P aeruginosa  Thus it is a        reasonable inference that the relative resistance of         B cepacia to PG is a consequence        of the smaller number of protegrin molecules bound per unit        area of bacterial surface        Earlier studies have shown that certain structural        differences in the LPS of Gramnegative bacteria correlate        with their susceptibility or resistance to antimicrobial        lipopeptides          Particular attention        has been given to alterations of the outer membrane that        could modify binding to the cell surface For example        sensitivity to the antibacterial lipopeptide polymyxin B is        affected by the PmrAPmrB regulon which mediates        substitution of aminoarabinose on the  phosphate of        lipid A      By reducing the negative charge of        lipid A this modification decreases its electrostatic        interaction with cationic peptides Resistance to polymyxin        B is also imparted by the absence or masking of critical        binding sites required for polycationmediated        permeabilization of the outer membrane     Thus        attachment of polymyxin B to         Yersinia enterocolitica is reduced by        steric hindrance generated by the size andor branched        shape of the outer core region of its LPS macromolecule            Additionally resistance to cationic peptides can be        due to cytoplasmic clearance of the antimicrobial peptide        by an efflux pump eg         Yersinia resistance to polymyxin B        caused by the RosARosB efflux pumppotassium antiporter           and         Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistance to        protegrin PG via an energydependent efflux system termed        mtr            Given the notorious resistance of         B cepacia to conventional        antibiotics     its relative resistance to PG was not        unexpected What bacterial properties influenced        sensitivity to protegrins Certainly the striking        correlation with the extent of protegrin binding must be        one of these Our studies with genetically related         P aeruginosa strains did not        implicate the length of the Oantigen side chain as a key        factor Furthermore genetically related         P aeruginosa strains that differed        in alginate production were equally sensitive to PG Both        results were somewhat surprising since long Oside chain        and alginate molecules should both bind PG Perhaps        limited alginate production under our experimental        conditions explains its failure to influence susceptibility        to PG Additional studies focusing on the influence of        alginate on PG activity in a biofilm model are in        progress        Why did fewer protegrin molecules bind to         B cepacia than to         P aeruginosa  Our radial        diffusionbinding and SPR studies strongly implicated lipid        A as a prime suspect in the case The acyl chains of lipid        A form an integral part of the outer membrane bilayer and        electrostatic or hydrophobic binding of protegrin to lipid        A could easily disturb the organization and acylchain        packing of the outer membrane both vital in maintaining        its integrity and barrier function Accepting a direct        proportionality between measured plasmon resonance RU and        the extent of peptide bound to the sensor surface the        responses shown in Fig indicate that at saturation         M lipid A from         B cepacia bound almost exactly        onehalf as many protegrin molecules as lipid A from         P aeruginosa  How might this be        rationalized        Lipid A typically contains two phosphate groups one on        each glucosamine residue In the lipid A of         B cepacia  one of these phosphates        is modified by a phosphodiesterlinked        aminodeoxyarabinose residue      It is        noteworthy that a previous study reported that the        phosphate content of         B cepacia LPS was only onethird of        that of         P aeruginosa     If most of the                P aeruginosa lipid A phosphates are        unmodified and if these phosphates are principal protegrin        binding sites then one would expect exactly the results        shown in Fig  This is also consistent with the        suggestion made in a recent report showing that cystic        fibrosis isolates of         P aeruginosa had lipid A isoforms        derivatized with aminoarabinose or palmitate that these        structural modifications could enhance resistance to        cationic antimicrobial peptides     Although the acyl        chains of lipid A might also provide alternative binding        sites for protegrin the orientation of lipid A on the HPA        sensor chip butterside down probably removes them from        consideration at least under our study conditions        The core and outer polysaccharide regions of LPS should        provide additional binding sites including the carboxylate        moieties of KDO or KO        DglyceroDtalooctulopyranosylonic acid     This        could explain why         B cepacia LPS binds about as much        PG as         P aeruginosa LPS Fig  especially        at peptide concentrations of  M which allow binding        to lower affinity sites This interpretation helps explain        why Fig suggests that         B cepacia LPS binds protegrin less        effectively than the corresponding         P aeruginosa preparation while the        SPR results in Fig show that         B cepacia and         P aeruginosa LPS bound equivalent        amounts of PG at high  M protegrin        concentrations To resolve these seemingly discrepant        results it is important to recall that in SPR assays the        sensor chips were constantly bathed with a fixed protegrin        concentration ranging from  M and that in radial        diffusion assays the wells received a fixed initial amount        of protegrin  ng In the latter assays the peptide was        dispersed in a total volume of  l making its maximal        initial concentration approximately M  well below the         M concentrations needed to saturate LPS Moreover        in addition to binding the LPS or lipid A molecules we        added to the well some of the initially added protegrin        could diffuse radially into the underlay gel Both initial        binding and radial diffusion will decrease the        concentration of free ie unbound protegrin that        remains in the well and further skew its binding towards        higher affinity binding sites on lipid A        Although our data clearly establish the presence of a        reduced number of binding sites for protegrin in lipid A        from         B cepacia  as compared to lipid A        from         P aeruginosa  they do not identify        the cause of this phenomenon These alterations could        result from aminoarabinose substitutions on the lipid A        from other changes that reduce the number of ionbinding        sites or from changes that affect hydrophobic interactions        or membrane insertion Additional studies that characterize                B cepacia LPS and lipid A can help        pinpoint the exact structural differences that relate to        the relative resistance of         B cepacia to protegrins and to        endogenous antimicrobial peptides of humans                    Conclusion        Our studies demonstrate a correlation between protegrin        sensitivityresistance and protegrin binding in         P aeruginosa and         B cepacia  and support a hypothesis        that the relative resistance of         B cepacia to protegrin is due        principally to a reduced number of protegrin binding sites        on the lipid A moiety of its LPS                    Abbreviations        BSA  bovine serum albumin CF  cystic fibrosis CFTR
