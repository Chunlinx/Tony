                    Background        DNA microarray experiments simultaneously measure the        expression levels of thousands of genes generating huge        amounts of data The analysis of these data presents a        tremendous challenge to biologists and new tools are needed        to help gain biological insights from these experiments        Although the data are generated for individual genes        examining a dataset on a genebygene basis is time        consuming and difficult to carry out across an entire        dataset One way of accelerating the pace of data analysis        is to approach the data from a higher level of        organization This can be done using datadriven methods        such as hierarchical clustering and selforganizing maps           which identify groups of genes with similar        expression patterns A complementary approach is to view        the data at the level of known biological processes or        pathways Identifying those groups of biologically related        genes that are showing a large number of geneexpression        changes will create an informative description of the        biology that is occurring in a particular dataset making        it possible to generate new hypotheses and identify those        specific areas of biology that warrant more detailed        investigation        One tool that assists in the identification of important        biological processes is GenMAPP Gene MicroArray Pathway        Profiler   a program for viewing and analyzing        microarray data on microarray pathway profiles MAPPs        representing biological pathways or any other functional        grouping of genes When a MAPP is linked to a        geneexpression dataset GenMAPP automatically and        dynamically color codes the genes on the MAPP according to        criteria supplied by the user GenMAPP is a useful starting        point for pathwaybased analysis of geneexpression data        but there are several critical requirements to be met        before this tool can be used to identify correlated        geneexpression changes across all biology On a practical        level pathwaybased analysis of microarray data needs to        be automated so that all possible pathways can be        explored Identifying correlated geneexpression changes in        an individual pathway is often interesting but it is        necessary to know if the geneexpression changes seen on a        particular pathway are unique to this pathway or are        occurring in many other pathways Equally important to        automation is expanding the pathway information that is        digitally represented GenMAPP currently has over  MAPP        files depicting various biological pathways and gene        families but this is still only a small fraction of all        known biology   Several other pathway programs such as        KEGG   EcoCycMetaCyc   Pathway Processor which        uses KEGG   and ViMAc   are available for        integration with microarray data analysis but these        programs focus on welldefined metabolic pathways and like        GenMAPP would benefit from a broader base of pathway        information        To address this issue we have used information        available from the Gene Ontology GO Consortium   The        GO Consortium is creating a defined vocabulary of terms        describing the biological processes cellular components        and molecular functions of all genes The GO is built in a        hierarchical manner with a parentchild relationship        existing between GO terms Curators at the public gene        databases are assigning genes to GO terms to provide        annotation and a biological context for individual genes        In addition to providing gene annotation GO also provides        a structure for organizing genes into biologically relevant        groupings These groupings can serve as the basis for        identifying those areas of biology showing correlated        geneexpression changes in a microarray experiment While        GO has been used to annotate microarray data both by hand        and by some software packages     there has been        no automated way to use it for pathwaybased analysis        We have developed a tool called MAPPFinder that        dynamically links geneexpression data to the GO hierarchy        For each of the    as of May   GO        biological process cellular component and molecular        function terms MAPPFinder calculates the percentage of the        genes measured that meet a userdefined criterion This is        done for each specific GO node and for the cumulative        total of the number of genes meeting the criterion in a        parent GO term combined with all of its children giving a        complete picture of the number of genes associated with a        particular GO term Using this percentage and a         z score see Materials and methods        the user can rank the GO terms by their relative amounts of        geneexpression changes MAPPFinder therefore generates a        geneexpression profile at the level of biological        processes cellular components and molecular functions        rapidly identifying those areas of biology that warrant        further study Figure         MAPPFinder and GenMAPP are both available freeofcharge        at                      Results and discussion                  The MAPPFinder browser          Viewing the MAPPFinder results as a ranked list is          informative but it does not take full advantage of the          fact that GO is arranged in a hierarchy MAPPFinder also          presents the results in the context of the GO hierarchy          Figures a a showing the entire hierarchy          colorcoded by the percentage of genes changed Users can          step through the hierarchy expanding those branches of          the tree that are showing gene expression changes moving          from broad terms to more specific categories Often the          ranked list of terms will show many interrelated terms          and it is necessary to view the results in the hierarchy          to identify the relationships among them For example          the terms RNA metabolism RNA processing mRNA          processing and mRNA splicing appear as upregulated in          Table  However the tree view Figure a clearly shows          that mRNA splicing is a child term of both RNA splicing          and mRNA processing which are in turn child terms of RNA          metabolism Similarly the terms main pathways of          carbohydrate metabolism catabolic carbohydrate          metabolism and glycolysis also appear as          downregulated in Table  The MAPPFinder browser Figure          a shows that glycolysis is related to main pathways          of carboyhydrate metabolism through the hierarchical          relationship between these terms          The MAPPFinder browser also provides three search and          navigation functions First the user can search by a          keyword or an exact GO term name Second the user can          search by a gene identifier to find which GO terms the          gene is associated with For example searching for the          gene alphamyosin heavy chain using its SWISSPROT          identifier MYHMOUSE or its MGD identifier MGI          finds the GO process terms striated muscle contraction          cytoskeleton organization and biogenesis protein          modification and muscle development Third the user          can expand the GO tree automatically to show all nodes          with a minimum number of genes or minimum percentage of          genes meeting the criterion or with a minimum           z score The terms meeting the          filter are highlighted in yellow to clearly indicate the          results of the search          Once the GO terms of interest have been identified          with MAPPFinder the user will want to know exactly which          genes are associated with these terms and exactly which          genes are being differentially expressed This can be          accomplished using GenMAPP Selecting a GO term in the          MAPPFinder browser automatically builds a MAPP containing          the genes associated with that GO term and all of its          children and opens this MAPP in GenMAPP Figure bshows          the MAPP generated by selecting the GO term glycolysis          in the MAPPFinder browser The genes on the MAPP are          colorcoded with the same criteria used to calculate the          MAPPFinder results significantly increased and decreased          at the day embryo time point Clicking on a gene on          the MAPP opens a back page containing annotations          geneexpression data and hyperlinks to that genes page          in the public databases By integrating GenMAPP and          MAPPFinder it is possible to seamlessly move from a          global geneexpression profile at the level of all          biological processes components and functions to a          detailed description of the geneexpression levels for          the specific genes involved For example a closer          examination of the glycolysis MAPP indicates that          hexokinase I is upregulated in the day embryo and          isoforms II and IV are downregulated as compared with          the adult heart This is consistent with hexokinase I          being the predominant isoform in the embryonic heart                                     Expanding MAPPFinder beyond GO          GO is a good starting point for analyzing microarray          data in the context of biological pathways but this is          by no means the only way to group related genes Instead          of representing each GO process as an alphabetical list          on a MAPP it would be more useful to represent the          relationships between these genes as a fully delineated          pathway As a start in this direction GenMAPPorg            has created over  MAPPs depicting metabolic pathways          signaling pathways and gene families MAPPFinder can          incorporate any MAPP file into its analysis to augment          the GO hierarchy For the FVB benchmark developmental          dataset we have run MAPPFinder on an archive of  mouse          MAPPs available from   see Additional data files for          the complete results These results for the day          embryonic time point agree with the GO results showing          that the expression of genes involved in the metabolic          pathways tricarboxylic acid cycle  of  genes          measured           z score of  and fatty acid          degradation  of  genes measured           z score  is significantly          decreased In addition the significantly increased          criterion identified genes encoding ribosomal proteins           of  genes           z score  and genes involved in          the cell cycle  of  genes           z score           The archive of MAPPs provided by GenMAPP is in no way          comprehensive The growth of this archive depends on          assistance from the entire biological community Our hope          is that as MAPPFinder users see the added utility of          viewing the GO biological processes as fully delineated          pathways they will use GenMAPP to organize the gene          lists into more descriptive biological pathways Figure          cgives an example of how the genes from the GO term          glycolysis can be rearranged using the tools in GenMAPP          to depict the full pathway showing the direction of the          enzymatic cascade metabolic intermediates and cellular          compartments GenMAPPorg is currently accepting          submissions of new MAPP files MAPPs contributed by the          community will be included in the downloadable MAPP          archive                          MAPPFinder is a necessary complement to current          analysis tools          By approaching large datasets from a higher level or          organization MAPPFinder helps to ease the data analysis          and shorten the time necessary to gain a biological          understanding of the microarray data MAPPFinder has          greatly expanded current pathwaybased tools by using the          large amount of annotations available from the GO This          broad analysis will help identify biological processes          that have not yet been implicated in a particular          experimental condition and begin to make connections          between biological processes previously thought to be          unrelated          MAPPFinder is available for yeast mouse and human          data We plan to extend the program to many of the other          species that are in GO and updates will be available at                                       Materials and methods                  Geneexpression data          The publicly available mouse microarray dataset the          FVB benchmark set for cardiac development maturation and          aging was obtained from the CardioGenomics Program for          Genomics Applications   These data compare healthy          mouse hearts at different time points during development          using male and female FVBN mice Specifically this          dataset examines heart tissue from day embryos          day neonatal mice week mice week mice and adult          mice at  months and  year Our analysis focused on the          day embryonic time point and the control adult mice          Three Affymetrix UA version  arrays were used for each          time point For the embryonic time point three hearts          were pooled for each array because of their small size          To improve the statistical power in our analysis the          month and the year mice were combined into a single          group of normal adult mice Signal intensity values were          obtained with Affymetrix MAS  software Signal values          less than  were raised to  and the log base  was          taken Log folds were determined from the average of each          time point when compared with the average of the combined          control group           P values were calculated with a          permutation           t test The statistical analysis          was done using the multest package of the R statistical          programming language   These data were imported into          GenMAPP and the resulting GenMAPP Expression Dataset          file gex was exported to MAPPFinder          MAPPFinder requires a userdefined criterion for a          meaningful geneexpression change In this case we          combined a fold change with a statistical filter to          determine significance We are using a fold change of          greater than  with a           p value of less than  to define          a significant geneexpression increase and a fold change          of less than  with a           p value of less than  to          define a significant geneexpression decrease To          determine the overall number of geneexpression changes          in each GO term an additional criterion of a fold change          greater than  or less than  and a           p value of less than  is used          data not shown          It is important to note that while we have used          geneexpression data generated from Affymetrix GeneChips          data from other microarray platforms and other techniques          such as SAGE serial analysis of gene expression can be          used equally easily                          Linking the expression data to Gene Ontology          MAPPFinder builds a local copy of the GO hierarchy          using the three ontology files Process Component and          Function available from GO   The directed acyclic          graph DAG structure of GO   allows a node to be a          child of multiple parents This makes the navigation          visualization and computation of the MAPPFinder results          more difficult than if the GO were stored in a classical          tree structure To ease the programming necessary to          implement the MAPPFinder algorithm the DAG structure was          converted to a classical tree For each node of the DAG          that contained multiple parents multiple copies were          inserted into the tree representation of the GO using          local identifiers to handle duplicate GO terms This tree          structure maintains the true path rule enforced in the          GO DAG structure MAPPFinder handles this conversion          internally and to the user the GO hierarchy seen in the          MAPPFinder browser will be identical to that seen in          other GO browsers          The links between the GO terms and the genes in the          expression dataset are made with the geneassociation          files   These associations are taken from the          European Bioinformatics Institute   for human genes          the Mouse Genome Database MGD   for mouse genes          and the           Saccharomyces Genome Database SGD            for yeast genes Currently the genes in the input          data must be identified with GenBank SWISSPROT or SGD          identifiers          MAPPFinder uses a relational database to link the          expression dataset to the geneassociation files The          MAPPFinder database relates geneexpression data to the          appropriate geneidentifrcation systems for each species          Figure  For human data the geneassociation files          use SWISSPROT identifiers requiring a          SWISSPROTtoGenBank relational table to link datasets          using GenBank accession numbers to the GO annotations          For yeast data the geneassociation files use SGD          identifiers A SWISSPROTtoSGD relational table is also          included for expression datasets using SWISSPROT          identifiers For mouse data the GO geneassociation          files use MGD identifiers requiring a GenBanktoMGD          relational table and a SWISSPROTtoMGD relational          table MAPPFinder takes advantage of the fact that MGD is          also related to UniGene allowing additional ESTs that          are not in the MGDGenBank relational table to be used as          gene identifiers With this intermediate step many more          GenBank identifiers can be linked to GO annotations          Currently there is no direct relationship between          SWISSPROT and UniGene so a similar intermediate step          was not used for human data                          Calculating the MAPPFinder results          MAPPFinder calculates the percentage of genes measured          within each GO term that meet a userdefined criterion          and this measurement is known as the percent changed          MAPPFinder also calculates the percentage of the genes          associated with a GO term that are measured in the          experiment and this measurement is known as the percent          present Calculating the percent present is necessary to          determine how well represented a GO term is in the          dataset          The GO geneassociation files   are potentially          problematic because they treat each GO term          independently removing the implicit parentchild          relationship As a result looking at the GO terms          individually is often uninformative because the number of          genes associated with any one term is smaller than the          actual number of genes involved in that process          component or function To address this issue we          calculate the nested percentage for a parent term with          all its children below it in the hierarchy By combining          the child terms with their parent the results          incorporate genes associated with the entire branch of          the hierarchy providing a much more accurate          representation of the number of genes involved in that          process component or function As more specific branches          of the GO are examined the denominator of the two          equations will become smaller and the user can find their          desired level of specificity One complication that          arises from this method is that in some cases a gene is          associated with both the parent and child terms or          multiple child terms When the percentages are calculated          for the subtree we ensure that each gene is only          counted once so that genes with multiple annotations are          not weighted more heavily          Another complication that arises while calculating the          MAPPFinder results is the issue of multiple probes of the          same gene on the array In this case the features or          duplicate genes are clustered to one unique gene If any          of the instances of this gene on the array meet the          userdefined criterion then that gene meets the          userdefined criterion The number of unique genes is          also used to calculate the           z score meaning that the          statistics are based only on a single occurrence of each          gene in the dataset          A statistical rating of the relative geneexpression          activity in each MAPP and GO term is also provided It is          a standardized difference score            z score using the expected value          and standard deviation of the number of genes meeting the          criterion on a GO term under a hypergeometric          distribution The           z score is useful for ranking GO          terms by their relative amounts of gene expression          changes Positive           z scores indicate GO terms with a          greater number of genes meeting the criterion than is          expected by chance Negative           z scores indicate GO terms with          fewer genes meeting the criterion than expected by          chance A           z score near zero indicates that          the number of genes meeting the criterion approximates          the expected number Extreme positive scores suggest GO          terms with the greatest confidence that the correlation          between the expression changes of the genes in this          grouping are not occurring by chance alone           P values are not assigned to the GO          terms or MAPPs because while such a standardized          difference score could approximate a normal           z score for an individual MAPP the          lack of independence between GO terms and the multiple          testing occurring among them most certainly makes the          normal           p value for such a           z score unreliable As a result           p values are not assigned to the GO          terms and MAPPs          The           z score is calculated by          subtracting the expected number of genes in a GO term or          MAPP meeting the criterion from the observed number of          genes and dividing by the standard deviation of the          observed number of genes The equation used is                    or                    where           N is the total number of genes          measured           R is the total number of genes          meeting the criterion           n is the total number of genes in          this specific MAPP and           r is the number of genes meeting          the criterion in this specific MAPP          Therefore if two GO terms contain the same number of          genes the term with the greater number of genes meeting          the criterion will receive a higher score Dividing by          the standard deviation adjusts for the size of the GO          term ranking a GO term or MAPP with a large number of          genes meeting the criterion higher than a GO term or          MAPP with the same percentage of genes changed but          fewer total genes          The MAPPFinder results are generated in the GO browser
