                                 The Order of Things            Two summershows side by side at the Museum of Modern Art introduce littleknown figureswith close ties to the Abstract Expressionist generation Enter Door No  andyoure inside the strange spider web and polka dot domain of Yayoi Kusama aflamboyant Japanese artist who worked in New York during the s Choose DoorNo  and make yourself at home in the American sculptor Tony Smiths moreaustere but equally odd architectural spaces These are smallish intenseshows that aim as curator Robert Storr writes in the Smith catalog to whetthe appetite of the general public Viewed together they reveal surprisingaffinities between two versatile and ambitious artists whose early childhoodtraumas inspired them to try to redesign the world            Kusama the lesser knownof the two is the more accessible and eyecatching artist and the more in tunewith our time Born in  in Tokyo as a child Kusama suffered fromhallucinations that she was being overwhelmed by proliferating dots and netsObsessive repetitive patterns entered her work early on Determined to takeNew York by storm she wrote to Georgia OKeeffea female artist who hadsucceeded in the maledominated New York art worldfor advice OKeeffeinitially puzzled by the young Japanese artists ambitions told her to showher work to anyone willing to look at it Kusama arrived in  with a coupleof thousand small drawings and watercolors mainly of OKeeffelike multiseededflowers in vibrant colors Looking down from the top of the Empire StateBuilding at the crowds below Kusama realized that she needed to do somethingmore spectacularlike a bomb she saidif she wanted to attract notice Sheextended the net patterns of the flowers across huge canvases creating thewhiteonwhite Infinity Net paintings that remain among her most beautifulcreations and along with color variants were favorably compared at the timeto the decentered allover paintings of Jackson Pollock              By  Kusama had begun covering familiar objectsanarmchair a stepladder a rowboatwith carefully sewn phalluses  These monochrome accumulations as repetitively patterned as the infinitynets have a deadpan wit quite different from Claes Oldenburgs squishilytheatrical hamburgers and lipsticks with which they were sometimes shown inearly Pop Art exhibitions Like the polka dots the proliferating penises wereaccording to Kusama an attempt to contain her fears by representing them Iwas scared of penises she blandly remarked at the press opening Kusamas affair with Joseph Cornell documented in Utopia Parkway  DeborahSolomons recent biography of Cornell has a peculiar aptness The manterrified of womenwho enclosed movie goddesses and ballerinas in littlefantasy boxes and nicknamed Kusama YouyouImeets the woman scared ofmen            A kindred ambivalencemarks Kusamas Food Obsession sculptures inspired she claimed by the imageof all the food a person consumes in a lifetime passing by on a conveyor beltKusamas pastaencrusted clothing may have a link as curator Lynn Zelevanskysuggests with eating disorders which were barely discussed at the time Butsuch objects as the bronzed  have a mod glamour undiminished by thepassage of time            By the mids Kusama was experimenting with ways toinsert her own image into her work She had herself photographed nude exceptfor high heels and polkadot stickers then superimposed the image over one ofher accumulations of phalluses In such works she seemed to be toying with maleexpectations of the Asian femme fatale By the late s Kusama had turnedfrom these ambiguous engagements with the male gaze to more attention grabbingperformances In  she staged wellpublicized nudeins at MoMAs sculpturegarden and at such Vietnam Warera hotspots as the Board of Elections A film called Kusamas SelfObliteration  on view in a side gallery atMoMA gives a sense of what these occasions may have felt like Kusama clothedin a kimono dabs paint on her nude models who begin to dance in comicselfconsciousness then escalate to a loud acid rock soundtrack intoorgy            Kusamas performancepieces always ended the same way with the arrival of the cops They got her onthe cover of the New York tabloids but they didnt pay the rent Her paintingsand sculptures with their use of body parts and food anticipate the work ofsuch current artists as Cindy Sherman and Kiki Smith Tony Smiths daughterbut they failed to attract the financial and institutional backing Kusamaneeded She remained desperately poor during her New York sojournanotherreason perhaps for her obsession with foodand returned to Japan in where she lives by her own choice in a Tokyo mental hospital that has aspecial emphasis on art therapy Today Kusama is a cult figure in the Japaneseavantgarde recognized not only for her art but for her novels as wellgothicfables of sexual violence set in New York with titles like The HustlersGrotto of Christopher Street which ends with a suicidal leap from theEmpire State Building and The Burning of St Marks Church             Tony Smith less wellknown than his drinking buddiesJackson Pollock and Mark Rothko is nonetheless hardly

sculptorfollowed the initials of his nameAnthony Peter Smith He came to sculpture late but the ambition to reshape theworld was there from the start reaching backas in Kusamas casetochildhood trauma Born in New Jersey in  Smith was the grandson of thedesigner of the standard fire hydrant and grew up among engineers such as hisfather He contracted tuberculosis at about age  and for several years livedalone in a little prefabricated house in the backyard so the rest of thefamily would be protected from contagion The previous year during a familytrip to the worlds fair in San Francisco Smith had seen an installation ofPueblo Indian cliff dwellings Back home in his quarantine shack he spent longhours fashioning pueblos out of medicine boxes and covering them withpapiermch adobe            Such primitivizing fantasies made him particularly wellsuited when he was groping for a profession to the organic architecture ofFrank Lloyd Wright with whom Smith studied and worked during the late sSmiths  or so completed buildings mostly houses are obviously indebted toWright in their lightfilled eaves and open geometrical forms The threeinterlocked buildings of the circa  are daringly

for these paintings seeing themas the first successful attempt to systematize the allover paintinginvented by Pollock and Rothko The art critic Lucy Lippard discerned adifferent impetus in these buoyant pictures labeling the peanut shaped formsas testiculara sign Storr adds of the ballsy ethos of Smithsgeneration of male artists            Back in the States Smithas interested in nets and

Central Parkdemonstrates the unsettling possibilities of tetrahedral shapes where thetriangular faces have a dynamic lightness lacking in rectangularly basedstructures The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation has helpfullyadded a note that the work is not intended to promote cigarette smoking            A polymath and anautodidact with no degree beyond high school Smith had too many ideas Thesexual pulse of a lot of his objectsThere is something erotic in all mywork Smith admittedis evident in loud titles for sculptures like She WhoMust Be Obeyed and Jims Piece  He constructed almost as manyphallic shapes as Kusama and filled his notebooks with erotic doodlingscomparing the sex organs of humans and flowers or depicting ChristSmith wasa Catholicwith breasts            Smiths political ideas are more elusive He adopted anupbeat American organicism derived from Henry David Thoreau and Walt WhitmanTheres nothing on record as far as I know to link him to his mentor Wrightsnotorious sympathy for Hitler and fascism But some of Smiths doodles andoffhand remarks give one pause One of the drawings on view at MoMA is adiagram of the races with the Jews identified as circumscised  sic cut off from Earth In another drawing from  Smith develops his personalsymbol the spiral cross which is really nothing but a relaxed swastikaTraveling in Germany after the war he felt an uneasy admiration for HitlersHaus der Kunst exhibition hall in MunichAs you may have guessed he wroteto the painter Barnett Newman the thing as a whole was very like the churchdesign I sent youand for Albert Speers gigantic stadium at NurembergSuch remarks inspire Storrs rather defensive observation that unlike fascistart and architecture Smiths sculptures and buildings were insistently builtto human rather than superhuman scale            It may be that grandioseschemes for redesigning society inevitably flirt with repressive politics Orperhaps the New York art world in which Kusama ran aground required such atoughguy mentality to survive Either way Smiths work unlike Kusamasseems locked into its time The inflexible architect leaves behind a whiff ofAyn Rand his twisted metal hulks suggest the ruins of uninhabitable placesWalking through Smiths fantasy world of black steel I found myself drawn tosome of his softer more tentative objects like the handmade plaster webcalled Wingbone from his daughter Kikis collection or a pencil sketchof confused sperm tangled up in a traffic jam with the caption WillJackson Pollock affect our cars These it occurred to me had the Kusamatouchanarchic whimsical looking for a perch to call home
