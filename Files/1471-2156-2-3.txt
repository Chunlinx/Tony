                    Background        CFEOM is an autosomal dominant disorder that has been        linked to the pericentromere of chromosome  flanked by        marker DS on the p arm and DS on the q arm           The clinical phenotype consists of congenital        bilateral ptosis and external ophthalmoplegia with the        eyes partially or completely fixed in a hypotrophic or        downward position On autopsy CFEOM patients appear to be        lacking the superior division of cranial nerve III which        innervates the levator and superior rectus muscles          Whether this disease is caused by a primary defect in the        nerve or the muscle remains unclear The disease was        initially linked to an  centiMorgan region spanning the        centromere of chromosome  and then further refined to a        critical region of  cM    Yeast and bacterial        artificial chromosome YAC and BAC contigs have been        generated and a positional cloning approach to identify the        CFEOM causative gene is ongoing        Sarcospan is a member of the dystrophin associated        protein complex present in skeletal and extraocular muscle            Sarcospan is most tightly associated with the        transmembrane sarcoglycan subcomplex mutation of which        causes autosomal recessive limb girdle muscular dystrophy        LGMDCF       Primary mutation of           sarcoglycan leads to a variable degree of secondary        instability of sarcospan and the nonmutant sarcoglycans        Sarcospan is homologous to the tetraspanin superfamily        members of which have been shown to facilitate both        integralmembrane and membraneproximal protein        interactions involved in many different cellular processes          Sarcospan had previously been identified as Krag a        gene that is coamplified with Kiras in the Y murine        adrenal carcinoma cell line    Portions of the        genes genomic structure were elucidated at that time and        the gene was localized to chromosome p        Given the genomic localization of sarcospan in the        critical region defined for CFEOM and its association        with other proteins known to be involved in muscular        diseases sarcospan has been proposed as a candidate        disease gene for CFEOM   We have refined the        previously published genomic structure of sarcospan more        fully and screened for mutations in six families with        CFEOM We have also generated antibodies that recognize        human sarcospan and examined extraocular muscle samples        from CFEOM patients        We find sarcospan to be unmutated in all six CFEOM        families studied and sarcospan immunoreactivity to be        identical in control and CFEOM extraocular muscle        Sarcospan is also shown to map electronically to BACs that        are considered to be outside of the CFEOM critical region        These data make it unlikely that sarcospan or other        dystrophin associated proteins are involved in the        pathogenesis of CFEOM                    Results                  Genomic organization of the human sarcospan          gene          Five independent clones were isolated from a human          genomic phage library using hybridization probes that          covered the entire coding region of sarcospan Primers          within the coding sequence were designed to cross the two          known intronexon junctions and other hypothesized          junctions The sarcospan open reading frame is encoded by          three exons The first exon contains  base pairs bp          of coding sequence and is extremely GC rich  The          second exon as previously determined is  bp in          length The third exon is very large and includes the          last  bp of coding sequence and over  bp          untranslated region UTR                          Analysis of the CFEOM critical region          Based on its cytogenetic localization and expression          pattern sarcospan is a candidate gene for autosomal          dominant CFEOM Initially to determine whether          sarcospan was contained on YACs or BACs spanning the          CFEOM critical

of the YACs and BACs while sarcospan primers          were not data not shown                          Mutation Analysis          Although the coverage of the YAC and BAC physical maps          was nearly complete only direct sequencing of CFEOM          patient DNA would yield definitive results about the          status of the sarcospan gene in CFEOM Primer pairs to          amplify all of exon  and the coding portions of exons           and  were designed Because of the large UTR present          in exon  a primer pair was designed to amplify the          coding portions of the exon including the  splice          junction and  bp of  noncoding sequence Figure                    Two affected individuals from each of six families          with CFEOM were analyzed by direct sequencing No          mutations or polymorphisms were found                          Immunofluorescence Analysis          Samples of CFEOM affected and unaffected extraocular          muscle were analyzed for the pattern of sarcospan          staining Muscle was simultaneously stained with          antispectrin antibody so that the samples membrane          integrity could be assessed and a comparison could be          made between the levels of sarcospan in normal and CFEOM          samples All samples showed normal sarcolemmal staining          no abnormalities were observed Figure                           BAC Mapping of Sarcospan          Comparison of the sarcospan coding sequence GenBank          accession number AF to the human genome sequence          revealed that sarcospan

httpsequenceaecomyueduchrQARMpdf thus          placing sarcospan outside of the CFEOM critical          region                            Discussion        The critical region for the congenital eye movement        disorder CFEOM has been reduced to a  cM region at the        centromere of human chromosome    In an effort to        identify the gene which when mutated gives rise to CFEOM        a combination of positional and candidate gene approaches        has been undertaken The sarcospan gene is composed of        three exons that are located on human chromosome p        and the sarcospan protein has been shown to be an integral        component of the sarcoglycan complex            Mutations in any one of the other four members of this        complex have been shown to cause muscular dystrophy As the        extraocular muscle is one of the few muscles spared in        Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy the dystrophin associated        protein complex present in extraocular muscle may respond        differently to mutation of the complex than other striated        muscle    By virtue of its genomic localization and        expression in extraocular muscle sarcospan is a candidate        gene for autosomal dominant CFEOM We therefore chose to        study sarcospan more closely within the context of this        disease        Immunofluorescence data showed comparable patterns of        sarcospan staining in CFEOM and control patient samples        implying that there was no haploinsufficiency altered        accumulation or increased degradation of the sarcospan        protein in these patients Direct sequencing of the three        coding exons of sarcospan in CFEOM patients confirmed that        they were normal rendering alteration of the sarcospan        protein as the primary genetic defect in CFEOM unlikely        This conclusion is supported by the electronic localization        of sarcospan to BACs outside of the CFEOM critical        region        The normal staining pattern of sarcospan in the        autosomal dominant CFEOM patient muscle indicates that the        primary genetic mutation is likely to be found in another        unrelated gene Patients with autosomal dominant limb        girdle muscular dystrophy type C caused by mutations in        caveolin    or autosomal recessive LGMDB caused        by mutations in dysferlin show normal dystrophin and        sarcoglycansarcospan complex staining patterns          Sarcospan immunoreactivity is altered in both Duchenne        Muscular Dystrophy and the sarcoglycanopathies LGMDCF        and appears to be very sensitive to disturbances in the        dystrophin associated protein complex   Thus the        finding that sarcospan is normal in CFEOM patient muscle        suggests that sarcospan itself and the rest of the        dystrophin associated protein complex are not involved in        the pathogenesis of the disease        A sarcospan null mouse has recently been generated and        appears to display a normal phenotype   This does not        however rule out the possibility of sarcospan playing a        primary role in a muscle disorder There may for example        be a homologous tetraspanin protein that compensates for        the absence of sarcospan in mice but not in humans There        is of course also a difference between complete absence        of a protein and a protein with an altered sequence This        may hold especially true as sarcospan appears to be member        of the tetraspanin family of proteins which have been        described as molecular facilitators alterations of such a        proteins sequence could affect the proteins with which it        interacts We are therefore expanding our patient analysis        to include patients with other forms of muscular        abnormalities including unlinked muscular dystrophies        The effort to identify the CFEOM disease gene is        continuing with analysis of other genes and expressed        sequence tags from the critical region at the centromere of        chromosome                     Conclusions        The DNA sequence analysis and protein immunofluorescence        results that show sarcospan to be normal in CFEOM        patients combined with the localization of sarcospan to        BACs that are outside of the CFEOM critical region make        it unlikely that sarcospan is involved in CFEOM                    Materials and Methods                  Screening of Human Genomic DNA Library          Two hybridization probes spanning the entire sarcospan          coding sequence were generated by PCR amplification of          sarcospan cDNA amplifying  bp          ATGGGCAAGAACAAGCAGCCACG and          TTTCATAGAAAATTGAATACATGTCC and  bp          GGGCTGGGATCATTGTCTGCT and          GGAATTCTTAGATCTTTTGCTGGGG The bands were excised          from  lowmelt agarose and  ng of DNA were labeled          with  PdCTP using the Life Technologies Random          Primers DNA Labeling System A human genomic phage          library Clontech was screened by hybridization with the          radiolabeled products according to standard protocols

Determination of intronexon boundaries          Five unique partially overlapping genomic phage          clones were identified Phage DNA was sequenced with exon          specific primers on an ABI automated sequencer Acquired          data was analyzed with the Sequencher software          Genecodes The intronexon borders were defined by          divergence of the cDNA and genomic sequences and by          their adherence to splice donor and acceptor consensus          sequences                          Patient material          Genomic DNA extracted from blood was used to screen
