                    Background        The fly visual system is characterized by its        repetitive retinotopic organization of four layered        structures the lamina the medulla the lobula and the        lobula plate Every layer is composed of thousands of        columns each of which contains the same number and types of        neurons    In contrast to our detailed knowledge        about the anatomy of these columnar elements not much is        known about their visual response properties except for the        large lamina monopolar cells      Due to the small        diameter of the fibers intracellular recordings are hard        to accomplish in most cases      Thus most data        on columnar neurons arise from deoxyglucose activity        staining which however cannot easily be assigned to        individual cell types      Nevertheless        there exists anatomical evidence for at least three major        parallel processing streams in the fly optic lobes           the first two pathways arise from receptor cells R        which are connected through lamina cells L and L and        transmedulla neurons to the lobula plate These two        pathways are thought to be involved in motion processing        The third pathway receives input from retinula cells R and        R and by way of lamina cells L projects mainly to the        lobula This pathway is supposed to be involved in the        processing of form and color        Amongst the beststudied cells of the fly visual system        are the large lobula plate tangential cells LPTCs which        due to their large diameter axons about  microns are        relatively easy to record from intracellularly LPTCs also        possess a large dendritic arbor on which they receive input        from numerous columnar elements arising presumably from the        medulla and the lobula for review see    Many of        these LPTCs do not produce regular action potentials but        rather respond to excitatory or inhibitory stimuli by a        graded shift of membrane potential             Typically LPTCs respond to visual motion in a        directionally selective way They depolarize when        stimulated by preferred direction motion and become        inhibited by motion along the opposite or null direction        According to our current view their direction selectivity        is produced by the antagonistic action of local elements        tuned to opposite directions of motion   These input        elements are thought to be only weakly selective for the        direction of motion The direction selectivity of the LPTCs        is enhanced to such a high degree as it is observed in the        electrical responses solely through the subtractive        inhibition taking place on the dendrites of the LPTCs        Evidence for this type of input arrangement comes from        pharmacological experiments where the inhibitory input is        blocked by PTX Under these conditions the preferred        direction response is enlarged and the response to null        direction is inverted resulting in an excitation          However all conclusions pertaining to the response        properties of the input elements to the tangential cells        are based on indirect evidence only since for the reasons        outlined above only few intracellular recordings exist        from them        Another line along which to identify these input        elements could be their transmitter system Here the        tangential cells have been shown physiologically to possess        at least two different transmitter receptors on their        dendrite a cholinergic receptor with a typical nicotinic        pharmacological profile and a aminobutyric acid GABA        receptor    Antibodies against the ARD subunit of        nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nAChRs    and        the RDL subunit of the GABA receptor   in         Drosophila allowed us to investigate        the distribution of these receptors in the fly visual        system        In the following we will present immunocytochemical data        of antibody staining against nAChRs GABA receptors and the        inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA itself The distribution        of immunoreactivity in the fly visual system for these        receptors and GABA is analyzed and the putative        pharmacology and cell types of the motion pathway are        discussed                    Results                  Distribution of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor          immunoreactivity          We tested  different monoclonal antibodies which          originally were generated against           Drosophila nAChR subunits for their          crossreactivity in the blowfly           Calliphora erythrocephala  Two of          these antibodies were directed against ligandbinding          subunits ALS and D whereas the third was directed          against a structural subunit ARD of the           Drosophila nAChR             Initial screening of ALS and D sera showed no          crossreactivity in western blots when           Drosophila and           Calliphora brain homogenates were          compared data not shown Immunohistochemical staining          with the ALS serum also failed to show immunoreactivity          in brain cryostat sections from           Calliphora in contrast to positive          controls made in           Drosophila data not shown          Western blots with the ARD antibody mab D revealed          multiple bands in           Drosophila and           Calliphora brain homogenates at          approx  kD Fig a These are thought to          correspond to the the ARD subunit which migrates at          about  kD in denaturing gels and some proteolytic          degradation products   In the           Calliphora lane an additional band          appeared at approx  kD of unknown origin It might          represent a hetero or homodimer of the subunit or          crossreactivity with D a novel subunit which          migrates at  kDa and is associated with ARD             Crossreactivity is however not observed in           Drosophila Fig a            Successful immunohistochemical staining with the ARD          antibody in           Calliphora depended strongly on the          fixation method Fixation with  paraformaldehyd          prevented positive immunoreactivity in           Calliphora brain tissue In          contrast fixation with FAA a mixture of formaldehyde          ethanol and acetic acid resulted in clear ARD          immunofluorescence in neuropilar regions of the visual          system Fig b This staining pattern could be          attributed to the binding of the primary antibody as          shown by the control without the primary antibody in          figure c ARD immunoreactivity in the visual system of                    Calliphora was clearly restricted          to the synaptic neuropils the medulla the lobula and          the lobula plate The inner chiasma a fiber tract          between these three neuropils and the layer of somata          posterior to the lobula plate did not show immunopositve          staining for ARD Fig b The medulla revealed a          multilayered pattern of ARD immunoreactivity Fig b          a with a concentration of immunopositve signal in the          inner medulla The layers with the terminals of the          lamina monopolar cells L and L layers  and           showed higher levels of immunoreactivity than the layers          containing the terminals of lamina monopolar cells L and          of photoreceptors R R Fig a Especially layer           showed the highest levels of ARD immunoreactivity in          most of the analyzed sections The lower level of ARD          immunoreactivity in layer  with the terminals of          photoreceptor R was not surprising as fly photoreceptors          R and R are known to be histaminergic               Layer  with the terminals of the R photoreceptors          in contrast shows some ARD immunoreactivity The          serpentine layer which consists mainly of fibers had          also a decreased level of ARD immunoreactivity Fig          b a All three layers of the inner medulla were          highly immunoreactive Layer  was somewhat weaker          stained which might be due to a lower cell density in          this layer compared to layers  and  Layer  contains          the dendritic arborizations of the T cells which are          presumed to represent input elements to the lobula plate          tangential cells            Both lobula and lobula plate showed high overall ARD          immunoreactivity with a less pronounced layering than the          medulla Fig b The most posterior layer of the          lobula containing the T cell dendrites was clearly          distinguished from the rest of the lobula Fig b T          cells project to the lobula plate and are thought to be          another type of input elements to LPTCs    The          lobula plate showed high levels of ARD immunoreactivity          Fig b whereas the fibers in the inner chiasma          contained almost no immunoreactivity The distal part of          the lobula plate appeared to be divided into two          immunoreactive layers which each might be further          subdivided into two more sublayers Fig bleft side          These layers would correspond to the functional          representation of preferred motion direction with the          LPTC responding to vertical motion in the two posterior          layers and LPTCs sensitive to horizontal motion direction          in the two anterior layers    Several profiles of          large LPTCs were visible in the lobula late At the          posterior edge of the lobula plate the main dendrites of          the VS cells appeared as black and round crosssectioned          profiles in this horizontal section Fig b These          profiles were not surrounded by ARD immunoreactivity on          their side facing away from the lobula plate suggesting          that the main dendrites have a lower density of nAChRs          than the higher order branches of the dendrites deeper          within the neuropile Figure cgives a magnified view of          the lobula plate with a clusters of dense ARD          immunoreactivity arrow heads close to the VS cell          dendrites The massive presence of ARD immunoreactivity          emphasizes the importance of nicotinic cholinergic          neurotransmission in the fly visual system                          Distribution of RDLimmunoreactivity          The RDLantibody is directed against the RDLsubunit          of the           Drosophila GABA receptor In a          previous study this antibody proved useful for the          demonstration of GABA receptors in the           Drosophila central nervous system            Crossreactivity of the serum could also be shown          with GABA receptors in the mushroom bodies of the          blowfly           Calliphora erythrocephala   In          the present study we were also able to identify          significant RDLimmunoreactivity in the visual system          of           Calliphora Figs ac when          compared with control sections Figs bd RDL          antibody preabsorbed with fusion protein          RDLimmunoreactivity was present in a layered          organization in the medulla and the posterior lobula          Fig a Labeling in the lobula plate was more evenly          distributed Compared to the ARDimmunoreactivity the          RDL immunoreactivity was not restricted only to          neuropilar regions but could also be found in perikarya          surrounding the neuropils Figs a asterisks distal to          the medulla posterior to the lobula plate and in the          inner chiasma The location of the RDLimmunopositive          somata in the inner Fig a and outer chiasma Fig c          arrows as well as the layered distribution of          RDLimmunoreactivity in the medulla matches well with          medulla amacrine cells   neurons that interconnect          multiple columns in one layer          The most prominently labeled layer in the medulla was          L In this layer several GABAergic tangential neurons          are found see below as well as the presumably          GABAergic centrifugal C neurons   In addition to          L there were two more strata weakly labeled in the          outer medulla a very thin portion of layer L and          perhaps the proximal layer L The posterior layers of          the lobula showed a similar pattern for          RDLimmunoreactivity as they do for          ARDimmunoreactivity Fig ae including the most          posterior layer containing the dendritic ramifications of          T neurons The lobula plate also showed significant          RDLlabeling although distinct layers do not appear as          clearly as with the ARD antibody In summary GABA          receptors seem to be widely present in the           Calliphora visual system                          GABAergic elements in the visual system          With the data presented on the distribution of GABA          receptors in the visual system of           Calliphora  we were interested in          the corresponding distribution of GABAergic neurons          Although detailed accounts on GABA immunohistochemistry          already exist in the literature      we          wanted to make direct comparisons in our tissue material          Furthermore some uncertainty remained in the studies          cited above about the identity of columnar GABAergic          elements namely Ycells   connecting the medulla          with the lobula and lobula plate          The monoclonal GABA antiserum which we used produced          a staining pattern that was very similar to the results          published in previous studies on the visual system of          house and blowflies     indicating a specific          binding of the antibody In particular we confirmed the          GABAimmunoreactive somata of putative C cells fine          GABApositive profiles in the vicinity of VSdendrites          and a bundle of large GABApositive axons at the proximal          border of the lobula plate which were interpreted before          as HS axons            GABAergic elements were found in all neuropils of the          visual system In the medulla several layers distal and          proximal L L contained GABA immunoreactive tangential          neurons   Fig a The arrowheads in figure          aindicate profiles of such tangential neurons that are          shown in figure bin a whole mount preparation of the          distal medulla The GABA immunoreactive somata in the          inner chiasma probably correspond to the centrifugal C          neurons There were also a few GABA immunoreactive somata          in the soma cluster posterior to the lobula plate A          cluster of GABA immunoreactive somata could be observed          in the distal part of this area between the distal tip of          the lobula plate and the medulla data not shown          The lobula plate contained a high density of fine GABA          immunoreactive profiles especially in the anterior part          The main dendrites of VS cells were surrounded and          contacted by many of these GABA immunoreactive profiles          Fig a          The inner chiasma contained GABA immunoreactive fibers          Fig ac The horizontal section of the inner chiasma          in Fig cshows the organization of fiber fascicles          containing thick GABA immunoreactive fibers Although          observed before   the projection of these fascicles          has not been described so far There were two types of          these columnar fiber fascicles The first type  denoted          here as type   projects directly from the medulla into          the lobula plate The second type type  of fascicles          contained fibers of columnar neurons projecting from the          medulla to the lobula Figure dillustrates these two          types of fascicles in a frontal section from the          posterior part of the brain at the level of the lobula          plate Type  fascicles which run parallel to the plane          of section at this location project from the posterior          medulla to the distal lobula plate Type  fascicles from          the same part of the medulla run orthogonal to the plane          of section to connect to the retinotopically          corresponding part of the lobula and appear as          crosssectioned profiles From this section it is clear          that only type  fascicles contained GABA immunoreactive          profiles Thus the pathway between medulla and lobula          contained GABAergic elements while the pathway between          the medulla and the lobula plate most likely did not          Fig edepicts a thick axonal element in type  fascicles          almost in full length in the inner chiasma connecting the          medulla and the lobula According to Meyer et al            these thick axon profiles presumably represent Ycells          However we were unable to positively identify any          bifurcations in these axons projecting to the lobula          plate Although the fiber in figure cseemed to have a          side branch close inspection revealed that this branch          originates from a fiber in a different fascicle Figure          dshows the large profile of a LPTC probably of an HS          cell As seen for the VS cell dendrites in figure a          this profile apparently had contacts to fine GABA          immunoreactive blebs too                            Discussion                  Distribution of nicotinic receptors          Our staining pattern for nicotinic acetylcholine          receptors as demonstrated with the ARD antibody          resembles very closely the pattern observed originally in                    Drosophila   Before the          availability of antibodies against nicotinic          acetylcholine receptors of dipteran flies cholinergic          pathways have been analyzed by more indirect methods          mainly by immunocytochemistry against choline          acetyltransferase ChAT an enzyme of the acetylcholine          metabolism    or autoradiography of          Ibungarotoxin binding    The ARD subunit          was shown to be associated with a distinct class of          bungarotoxin binding sites in the           Drosophila CNS   ChATpositive          neurons would act complementarily as input elements of          ARD immunoreactive elements However because of the          wide abundance of acetylcholine in the insect CNS it is          likely that ChATpositive neurons also possess nAChRs In          fact the distribution patterns of ChAT in the lobula          plate the lobula and the inner medulla are virtually          identical with the pattern we observed with the ARD          antibody In the outer medulla most layers match for the          pattern of immunoreactivity to ChAT and ARD with          exception of the terminal layer of L lamina monopolar          cells which shows no ARD immunoreactivity but is          reported to be ChAT immunopositive in           Drosophila   In accordance          with the ARD data there is also no labeling with          Ibungarotoxin in the L layer of the           Drosophila medulla   It should          be noted however that layer  in the medulla with the          dendrites of T neurons and the posterior layer of the          lobula with the dendrites of T neurons are slightly          weaker in their ARD immunoreactivity than their          adjacent neuropil layers In contrast the ChATlabeling          in these two layers is much more intensive than that of          the adjacent layers            The dense ARD labeling in the lobula plate did not          allow the mapping of nAChRs to individual LPTCs However          the concentration of ARD immunoreactivity in the region          of the VS cell dendrites at the posterior border of the          lobula plate is in accordance with our earlier findings          of nicotinic receptor responses in these neurons                                     Distribution of GABA receptors and GABAergic          neurons          In our study the strongest GABA receptor          immunoreactivity is in layer  L of the medulla The          most likely columnar GABAergic element in this layer is          the C cell type    The C cells have a          presumably centrifugal projection back to the lamina and          also arborizations in the medulla layers  L  and           T We found RDL immunoreactivity in all these          layers however to a lesser extent than in layer           Another possible source of GABA in the outer medulla are          cells that form horizontal connections between columns          GABA positive tangential neurons which are also found in          layer  and amacrine cells which spread multiple          columns The location of the cell bodies of deep medulla          amacrine cells matches with the GABA immunoreactive          somata in the inner chiasma The stratification patterns          of these amacrine cells in turn matches with the RDL          immunoreactivity pattern in the medulla GABAergic          medulla tangential and amacrine cells are of special          interest for considerations of crosscolumn inhibitory          interactions in the processing of visual motion          information see below          As outlined earlier lobula plate tangential cells          LPTCs respond to cholinergic and GABAergic stimulation          Our work and that of others show the presence of          GABAergic profiles in the direct vicinity of LPTC          dendrites However the identity of the columnar          GABAergic cell types providing GABAergic input to LPTCs          remains still elusive So far Ycells were assumed to be          the most likely columnar GABAergic cell type             These statements however have to be evaluated with some          caution because neither of these references presents          direct evidence for GABAergic Ycells In           Drosophila  Ycells are          characterized by thick fibers   which is in          accordance with our observations of GABA immunoreactive          fibers in the inner chiasma However we were not able to          identify any bifurcated GABA immunoreactive fibers as          one would expect in the case of Ycells T cells which          are direct columnar input elements to some LPTCs            are unlikely to be GABAergic because the fascicles          connecting directly between medulla and lobula plate did          not contain any GABA immunoreactive fibers The other          columnar cell type that is most likely to provide input          to LPTCs are T cells originating in the lobula            From our results we cannot eliminate T cells as          candidates of GABAergic inputs to LPTCs The Ycells          though also remain likely candidates                          Possible role of GABA in motion detection          In the original model of motion detection direction          selectivity was proposed to arise in several consecutive          processing stages    In the first step the          retinal luminance levels of adjacent photoreceptors          interact with each other in a nonlinear way after one of          them is temporally lowpass filtered This process is          repeated in mirror symmetrical fashion In a second step          the output signals of both operations become subtracted          from each other Finally the outputs from all these          local units are spatially pooled to result in a          directionally selective wide field response With respect          to our present picture of the cellular implementation          the second and third processing step is thought to be          realized on the dendrites of the lobula plate tangential          cells while the first step of motion detection ie the          nonlinear interaction probably takes place in small          columnar neurons of the medulla andor lobula          The presence of GABA receptors in layers of the          medulla that take part in motion detection argue for a          role of GABAergic transmission in the input pathway of          lobula plate tangential cells Therefore GABA seems not          only to play a role in the subtraction stage of the          motion detection process    but is probably also          involved in the nonlinear interaction between neighboring          retinal locations In model simulations such a          nonlinearity was accomplished by eg a multiplication            or a logical AND NOT gate   As has been shown          such a computational task could be implemented at the          cellular level by shunting inhibition                            Comparison of immunostaining with activitylabeling          studies in Drososphila          Our understanding of motion processing on the cellular          level in the medulla is compared to the lobula plate          very incomplete In particular the location and          implementation of the nonlinear multiplicative          interaction between the input channels remains elusive as          outlined above Few attempts have been made to resolve          this problem with intracellular recordings from medulla          neurons      Another approach that has been          taken was to label the activity in neuropils by means of          Hdeoxyglucose   Visual motion stimuli ie          rotating bars around the fly lead to a characteristic          labeling pattern in the medulla Under these conditions          layers  L  L and  L showed increased          Hdeoxyglucose uptake Layers  and  of the proximal          medulla also were radioactively labeled   This          demonstrates the participation of these layers in the          transmission of relevant information for the processing          of visual motion Comparing this to our results from the          cholinergic and GABAergic receptor immunocytochemistry          the L pathway layers  and  is the most likely to          carry the relevant input signal for the nonlinear          interaction through the medulla                            Conclusions                  Putative cellular constituents of the fly motion          pathway          In earlier studies two main candidates were proposed          to constitute the elementary motion detector of the fly          visual system the T and the T cells both types also          called the bushy Tcells     The reason why          these cells are so suggestive candidates is that i both          of these cells come in  different subtypes each of          which ramifies in a different layer of the lobula plate            ii Hdeoxyglucose measurements using  cardinal          directions of motion up down left right revealed a          specific staining pattern of exactly these  layers in          the lobula plate   Furthermore LPTCs occupy with          their large dendrites preferentially those layers in the          lobula plate which correspond to these different          directions of motion   In one case a direct          synaptic contact has been demonstrated at the EM level          between a Tcell and the dendrite of an HScell            Taken the available immunocytochemical evidence presented          in this paper together with what is known about the          anatomy of columnar elements and the physiology of LPTCs          the following picture about the cellular implementation          of motion detection in the fly visual system can be drawn          in the most parsimonious way The first major step of          motion detection ie the nonlinear interaction between          input channels is realized on the dendrites of Tcells          and the input elements of T cells in the proximal layer          of the medulla by a combined cholinergicGABAergic          mechanism This results in weakly directional signals for          each of the four cardinal directions of motion split into          a cholinergic pathway providing direct excitatory input          onto the LPTC dendrites through Tcells and an indirect          GABAergic pathway relayed through the posterior layer of          the lobula via Tcells providing inhibitory input to          LPTC dendrites Thus the second step in the computation          of direction selectivity ie the subtraction is          mediated by the opponent interaction between T and T          cell input on the dendrites of each LPTC Finally these          signals become integrated by the LPTC dendrite At          present this proposal is highly speculative but may          proof useful to be challenged in the future by          electrophysiological or optical recordings from several          of the putative constituents of the motion detection          circuit                            Material and Methods                  Antibodies          We used several different antibodies to map the          distribution of nAChRs GABA receptors and GABAergic          neurons respectively The monoclonal ARD antibody mab          D was raised against a structural subunit of the nAChR          from           Drosophila   In the           Drosophila nervous system mab D          produces exactly the same staining pattern as that          observed with polyclonal antisera against the ARD nAChR          subunit   We also used the monoclonal antibody ALS          mab D and a
