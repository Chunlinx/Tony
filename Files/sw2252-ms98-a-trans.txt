        well what is your view do you consider the Soviet Union a threat   i dont know that its so much a military threat anymore as a   well you know its its its real confusing right now to know what kind of a of of a threat it is i guess it it takes awhile to to get used to something   sure   you know if if they have completely changed  the place has completely turned that much around to where theyre not you know not what they used to be uh   right its its hard to to know anymore if its uh a threat one way or another because uh it used to be so so  much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell you know rank and file in behind it   umhum   and now that with Gorbachev is introducing more i guess freedoms or expressions of freedom it doesnt look as though you know everybodys following the same pattern and uh the the people who are you know the staunch military conservative people you never know well Gorbachevs future is like whereas whereas in the past it was seen as you know whoever was   yeah yeah   the head of uh the communist party was seen as you know untouchable   yeah i think you know the the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so uh dramatic that you almost think now wait a minute you know were getting uh sucked into something here you know if if somebodys about to   umhum   to clobber you the first thing they do is sort of say well you know were were ashamed were not going to do that anymore and uh   yeah exactly   um you know id id like to think that that isnt true but uh i i you know the evidence is that uh you know hes hes let some some stuff go you know the east German situation its just the whole thing is so incomprehensible you know if id have been asleep for five years and read it in a book id say no no no that didnt couldnt have happened that way   right   right well it its amazing just because of the drain its been on you know both economies that our economy is of course been able to uh withstand that a little better   umhum   but uh the Russian economy they you know they i dont know what the percentage is but i heard it one time its just some ungodly number just to support the military machine   umhum umhum   and finally you know who knows maybe theyre finally waking up and saying you know we cant afford this uh the US isnt the threat that weve always made them out to be you know even if theyre saying that beneath the doors   umhum   but its hard to think that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period even if it is you know the best thing in the long run it just steps on too many peoples toes who are comfortable with the way the situation is   yeah yeah yeah i i think you know what id have to i i guess i guess to answer the question directly im still just a a little bit you know leery of the whole thing what i havent seen is the uh you know a great stepping back in the military situation you know its its one thing you know to let us go ahead and   umhum right   sort of disarm and you know i even had a thought once that the whole Iraqi thing mightve been just a a deal to go ahead and let us uh you know expend some   expend   some military hardware of course it didnt turn out that way and uh uh that that may have been a a a kind of far out way of thinking about it i dont know   uhhuh well its interesting anymore the worlds getting so small that it doesnt seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism philosophy that that was here in you know twenty years ago   umhum yeah   uh but of course the people who have challenged that or tried to do on it have  have not been world powers so its easier for us to say you know to an Iraq you know uh you cant do this get back you know or were going to force you whereas you know if the Soviet Union wouldve   i dont know yeah or or we can do something about it yeah   who knows what taking over Mongolia or or something like that who is really will weve been more just rhetoric uh rather than going in there officially uh or you know physically and try to to remove them   umhum yeah well the the China situation you know the when it looked like that thing was was turning around and then all of the sudden it was like somebody in the in uh Red Square or wherever said okay and thats enough and the tanks came in and you know pretty much took care of that and   uhhuh exactly yeah uh that personally i dont see as Gorbachev as being maybe a threat and i think hes actually honestly trying to do some change   umhum   but i dont believe that he in this first pass around you know being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either   yeah well this would be like if somebody was elected president of the United States and suddenly took off toward you know just some some pretty hard by the socialism and uh   umhum   you know the the reaction you know the the economic well the uh the social structure of the Soviet Union you know it its its coming apart at the seams   uhhuh   you know and ive heard people say well you know its just like the American Civil War will there be a union or not well no its not the same sort of a thing at all because that the whole Soviet system was put together under total force you know there was no as as we are seeing now with a lot of those areas wanting out of it you know they uh nobody voted you know a lot man those people didnt vote to become part of the Soviet Union they had no choice   right umhum yeah that was always kind of interesting people you know a lot of my friends have a taken  the stance of you know these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away and im thinking more of it from a nationalistic you know if im a Soviet and if part of you know south lets say South Dakota wanted to succeed you know succeed am i going to stand for that now i realize that the origins are are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with   yeah umhum   uh and that they may have been forced im not that familiar with their future but i you know i its easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than uh a volunteer or willingness to join but   yeah there there was uh the whole thing was put together you know by force theres theres no no real question about that and some of the countries that were forced in at the later dates is the three Baltic countries you know came in in the forties   umhum umhum   and uh its well its not that they came in its they were conquered by the Germans  and then the Russians even took it back from the Germans and never bothered to give it back you know so thats a a little different situation   and then just never given back yeah well that whole uh the whole idea idea if you look at the Russian history and i guess all countries the way it used to be is the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer   umhum   and that was the whole idea of why they had so many buffers and maybe you know more and more people are seeing or countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isnt going to help you you can like i guess like with uh Israel is a perfect example the reason they have the Angolan Heights and the   yeah   the uh all their buffer area is between Jordan and uh the Sinai and and Lebanon was just as a buffer but you know as you can see with the the scuds go right over there   umhum yeah they dont really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers   yeah theres theres very little that that buys you anymore in todays technology   i knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to Germany that said thats the safest place in the world because if a war starts all the bombs are going to go right over Germany and theyre going to land in other places you know thats going to be the safest place to be  yeah   thats probably very true very thats very interesting never thought of that   yeah yeah well uh i i guess what theyd have to do to uh i really dont know you know in in the uh in you know i hope that whats happening is exactly the way it appears you know some reason or other   umhum   you know is is uh its kind of a strange thing weve been trying to make something like this happen for so long that when it finally happens you say whoa wait a minute you know whats uh whats whats really happening here   nobody knows to do is it real uhhuh   but you wonder how well this thing Boris who was it Boris Yeltsin the guy thats running the uh or evidently was elected president of the Soviet for the Russian republic which is i guess the   right  exactly   uh the biggest   i get confused between all the which is the Soviet provinces versus what are the the Russian provinces versus what are   umhum well in the center but you got uh the the great big area thats just was traditionally known as Russia and then all these little nationality groups around it you know that were you know was there nineteen of them or or whatever you know and these were all the Soviet autonomists   umhum   you know they had some real fancy names for them a matter of fact when the uh   right   yeah what i read when the uh the uh United Nations was setup in in San Francisco one of the first things the Russians wanted to do was bring in each one of the uh of these you know republics as a separate country you know so thered be thered be nineteen rather than one   oh as a as a vote sure sure   and uh the United States said well thatd mean we get to bring in forty eight you know and uh that sort of you know they backed down on that       died down on that i thought it was interesting that recently here the Warsaw Pact no longer exists as a militory military force but its merely an economic now   yeah well i wonder if that  whether uh whether whether get shot by something thats called uh an economic force or whether its called a military pact you know its all you can change the name of something but i wonder if its still   well yeah i mean at yeah exactly   exists although ive seen some evidence that you know the uh the Russian soldiers   umhum   well  the funny thing there is theyre not particularly welcome back home because theres theyre having a housing shortages now what do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by uh Bulgaria and and Czechoslovakia and now all of a sudden theyre going home and somebodys got to pay for their   exactly and and all the well thats what theyre saying the whole problem you know with if we were to demilitarize Europe  what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there   yeah well thats not   whats going to happen to the economies that are no longer have uh a million plus people in the industry you know in each country from the US   yeah
