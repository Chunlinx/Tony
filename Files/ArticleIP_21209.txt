                                 The Killers            The comedy AnalyzeThis requires little analysis It plays like a slapstick fever dream Itboasts essentially a single joke the one about the Mafia kingpin Robert DeNiro who goes to a Freudian psychiatrist Billy Crystal to cure his panicattacks The introspection that this process entails flies in the face ofeverything we know and cherish about gangster movies Hotheaded crime bosseslike Scarface and Little Caesar are attractive vessels for our fantasiesbecause they dont think through the moral consequences of what they do Theywant they take They get mad they get even Most of us enjoy seeing theirrealworld counterparts stripped of their illgotten gains at the movieshowever were shameless hypocrites We love the gangsters vitality hischarismatic demonstration that with big guns and even bigger balls everythingis permissible So whats the point of psychoanalyzing the id            Laughs of coursebigones The juxtaposition of macho bloodletting with touchyfeely explorations ofselfdoubt The incongruity of watching De Niros Paul Vitti a Gottilike mobboss being counseled to phone a rival gangster Chazz Palminteri who hastried to have him whacked and communicate his feelings I feel anger for thesake of closure Freud of course is hardly touchyfeely but AnalyzeThis is funny enough to be forgiven its muddling of therapeutic modes Thescript by Harold Ramis also the able director Peter Tolan and thebrilliant playwright Kenneth Lonergan  This Is Our Youth  must havebeen a tagteam effort Its structure is repetitive but each scene begins witha joyous blast of comic energy The gangsters hooligans continually disruptthe personal life of the psychiatrist Ben Sobel whos on the verge ofmarrying a straitlaced TV newswoman Lisa Kudrow They track him to MiamiBeach where hes plucked from his suite in the middle of the night to treathis patients sudden impotence They kidnap him from his wedding ceremony onpain of death Each impromptu session ends with the patients exclamations ofreliefYou got a gift my friend Yes you do A load is off my shouldersYoure goodfollowed a short time later by the return of the mobstersanxiety and another forced appointment You did nothing for me            For all its comic exaggeration almost no gangster orFreudian clich is left unparodied Analyze This ends up affirming theefficacy of psychoanalysis more than any picture since Spellbound It turns out that both Sobel and Vitti are staggering under the legacyof powerful fathers giants in their fields of psychoanalysis and racketeeringrespectively So Sobel has to fire a gun and Vitti has to get in touch with hisblubbery inner childshticks that sound more offensively pat than they playlargely because Crystals handling of a pistol and De Niros bawling like ayearold seem like sensible therapies for each actor  In the last fewyears Crystals highprofile hosting chores have made his hunger for approvalseem too sweatily transparent Playing the straight man becomes him and whenhe finally has a chance to cut loosein a climactic speech before a meeting ofthe crime families where hes forced to pose as Vittisconsigliere his macho vamping jumbled with Jerry Lewis stammers had melaughing so hard that I almost needed supplemental oxygen            De Niro is borderlineappalling Once the most unaffected actor of his generationthe mostmagnetically selfcontainedhe has evolved into the movies most shamelessham To every part he brings an allpurpose dyspepsia As Frankensteinsmonster his sour expression was so ingrained that you had to conclude that themad doctor had misaligned his intestines resulting in a steady stream of acidreflux His grimacing convict in Great Expectations seemed less in needof food and shelter than of a swig of Maalox His Vitti in Analyze Thishas the dodgiest gastrointestinal tract of all At the best of times he wincesin repose appearing ulcerous in the throes of a panic attack he might bestruggling with an Alien like parasite about to burst through his chestThe miraculous thing is that De Niro still has his timing Ive never met apsychiatrist clumsy enough to use the words Oedipal conflict with a patientlet alone to explain it by invoking Sophocles but this dumb bit is worth it towatch De Niro blanch shake his head in disgust at the thought of Oedipus andhis mom and exclaim Fuckin Greece            Its a testament to the hilarity of Analyze Thisthat its going to survive comparisons to The Sopranos the rich andexuberantly tragicomic HBO series Working from some of the same impulses asRamis and company creator David Chase has fashioned an elegy to a vanishingworld of familyoriented crimeand an exploration of the dislocation thatits passing evokes in sometime boss Tony Soprano James Gandolfini Lopingaround his overdecorated New Jersey manse in an open bathrobe GandolfinisSoprano is part muscle and part flab with no connecting sinews He carries histension in his shoulders so that even when hes sweet he suggests a man on theverge of snapping Arrested between thought and action Gandolfini still bearstraces of childlike befuddlement in his doughy face he cant begin to figureout why the foundations of his world have become so illusory AnalyzeThis is a hoot but The Sopranos really sings                           Lock Stock  Two Smoking Barrels isthe laborious title of an even more laborious Cockney action movie that somepeople think is the cats pajamas crossbred with the bees knees It combinesthe music video syntax of Trainspotting with the jokey nihilistbloodletting of Pulp Fiction  Youre supposed to root for the haplessamateur crooks over the platoons of murderous professional ones and to watchas with farcical precision the bad guys end up accidentally blowing oneanother away As someone who has written Feydeauesque farce I can tell youthat its no easy feat But the real trick isnt bringing disparate groups ofpeople into slapstick alignment its figuring out what to do with them oncetheyre all assembled The writerdirector Guy Ritchie doesnt need to botherwith sorting them out at the end because theres nothing left but piles ofcorpses Now why didnt I think of such an easy way out
