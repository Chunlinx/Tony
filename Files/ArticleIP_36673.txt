                                  Flushed            Todays decision by the South Carolina SupremeCourt to outlaw the states  billion video poker industry is the mostremarkable defeat for gambling in memory Other states have blockedgamblingas Alabama did by defeating a lottery referendum this weekbut thismarks the first time in  years that a state has outlawed gambling anduprooted a living industry            The South Carolina decision is a triumph forantigambling activists who have been hammering the Palmetto state for yearsYet weirdly it is also a victory for gamblingat least the kind of gamblingthat Americans want            To understand why youhave to realize how ugly the South Carolina video poker industry is Those whohave not visited South Carolina recently dont know what a favor the SupremeCourt has done the state Gambling everywhere in America has produced its shareof social disarray and political sleaziness but nothing remotely equals SouthCarolina whose poker industry was built on lies legal chicanery and justplain crime            Most Americans dont realize South Carolina even has legalgambling yet it has  places to gamblemore than any state and threetimes as many as Nevada It has  gambling machines more than all butthree states South Carolina isand there is no other word for itblighted bygambling About onequarter of all South Carolina retail businessesoffer gambling Every place you can think of that might have gambling hasgambling Convenience stores bars restaurants bowling alleys truck stopsetc are fogged with cigarette smoke and filled with people who dont havemuch money playing games they cant win for five   hours at a stretchIm not exaggerating I have seen this Video poker operators grossed million last year and their take has been growing  percent annually And allthis has occurred in a state that never intended to legalize gambling            The video poker industryfinessed itself into existence South Carolina law clearly banned gambling Butin  as a favor to a big local businessman a state senator stuck a tinyamendment in the back of a gigantic budget bill The amendment erased twowordsor propertyfrom an obscure South Carolina law It passed without anydebatepublic or privateand without legislators knowing what they had doneIt legalized video gambling allowing game owners to pay jackpots to videopoker winners It wasnt until  that the state even realized what hadhappened            Having legalized itself through the backdoor the industryproceeded to duck skirt or break every law passed to control it When thestate banned big jackpots by forbidding machines to pay more than  to aplayer in a day poker operators ignored the law They continued to offermultithousand dollar jackpots If a gambler hit the jackpot he was simply paid a day for as many days as it took to empty the pot            When the state bannedcasinos by limiting operators to five machines on one premises operatorssurmised that premises meant essentially anything with a wall and a doorThen they jammed  or  or  machines into a single building and subdividedit into endless fivemachine closets They call these places with a sicksense of euphemism video malls More dismal casinos you cannot imagine Atone video mall where I spent several days the only food on offer was TootsieRolls Unlike virtually every other state with gambling South Carolina doesnot tax gambling revenues does not forbid children to play the machines anddoes not ban felons from owning them Gambling experts call it the Wild Westof gambling            The video poker industrys latest trick was buying itself agovernor After Republican Gov David Beasley tried and failed to ban videopoker last year the industry went to war against him It spent at least millionand almost certainly a lot moreto defeat Beasleys reelection bidBy one estimate video poker supplied more than  percent of Democraticgubernatorial candidate Jim Hodges war chest plus another million from asingle poker operator on his own antiBeasley operation plus another millionor more in soft money for the Democratic Party The chairman of the stateDemocratic Party is the leading lawyer for the poker industry Beasley apopular Republican governor in a thriving Republican state lost to alittleknown uncharismatic Democrat The poker money swamped him            But despite Hodgesvictory the backlash against video poker grew The overwhelming image ofAmerican gambling is of Vegas glamour but the new reality is conveniencegambling This is the industry euphemism for the infiltration of gambling intoeveryday life which is indeed convenient for the businesses that make millionsoff it Traditionally Americans have separated gambling exiling it to thedesert of Nevada the horse track or the beach But convenience gambling hasbrought it next door in the form of video gambling in places such as MontanaSouth Dakota and Louisiana and in the form of scratchoff lottery games allover the country South Carolina is by far the most extreme example ofconvenience gambling            Experts deplore convenience gambling It is extremelydangerous to addicts Every trip to the store becomes a temptation Videopoker which is fast and requires skill is known as video crack because itis by far the most addictive form of gambling According to the only study ofSouth Carolina gamblers the state seems to have a problemgambling rate twiceas high as Nevadas Convenience gambling also addicts businesses SouthCarolina hooked previously independent gas stations convenience stores barsand restaurants on gambling dollars            Most alarminglyconvenience gambling exacts huge social costs in the form of addiction andfinancial hardship without providing any economic benefit Unlike casinogambling convenience gambling does not bring with it hotels restaurantstourists or good jobs There is no pretense that this is about tourism orabout a nice night out or this is entertainment This is hardcoregrabthepaycheck gambling said Tom Grey founder of the National CoalitionAgainst Gambling Expansion when I interviewed him about South Carolina thisspring for Harpers             Todays decision is the culmination of the antipokerbacklash This summer the legislature ordered a Nov  referendum to decidethe status of poker once and for all The law specified that if the referendumwere ruled unconstitutional poker would be banned in July  South Carolinahas no referendum right so the Supreme Court canceled the vote and upheld theban            Its unfortunate that the Supreme Court voided thereferendum because it deprives voters of the opportunity to throw out thepoker industry themselves And there is little doubt they would have done soThe antipoker campaign has galvanized the state like no issue ever hasVirtually every church in the state the top strategists from both parties thestate chamber of commerce and thousands of grassroots organizers bandedtogether to defeat poker The most recent poll suggested that the antipokerforces would win in a rout More than  percent of voters favored banningpoker and only  percent wanted to keep it            Poker was a like ahouseguest that was unwelcome in the first place that stayed too long and wasreally obnoxious People just want it gone says Glenn Stanton who runs theantigambling Palmetto Family Council            Video poker is not gone yet The industry has a magnificentaptitude for escaping defeat It has used suits and lobbying and more suits tostymie previous efforts to restrict it There is no doubt the industry will askthe legislaturepoker usually asks with thousands of dollars in campaigncontributionsto reconsider the ban            The irony of the South Carolina fight is that videopokers death may actually help the gambling industry For the past few weeksrumors have been circulating in South Carolina that Nevada casino owners weresubsidizing the antipoker campaign The American Gaming Association has spokenout against the states gambling anarchy and for good reason The gamblingindustry wants to be the gaming industry Casino owners have carefullycultivated a familyfriendly lawabiding image They loathe South Carolinawhere gambling is criminal ugly and unpopular            Kill video poker inSouth Carolina and you erase the biggest stain on gamblings image Thebusinesses
