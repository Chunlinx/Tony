                    Background        The luteinizing hormone receptor LHR plays a        fundamental role in ovarian responsiveness to pituitary LH        The LHR consists of a  residue extracellular domain        which contains six Nlinked glycosylation sites            Posttranslational changes in glycosylation and        phosphorylation result in several LHR variants migrating        between  and  kDa                           Lower molecular weight forms  and  kDa        species appear to represent a glycosylated extracellular        domain expressed in mammalian cells truncated receptor        and retain hormone binding specificity They are not        secreted from cells but remain trapped intracellularly            In addition to various glycosylated LHR variants        western blotting also yielded a  kDa band representing        an LHR dimer     LH binds to LHR variants with        different affinities and highest affinity appears to be        associated with the fully glycosylated receptor  kDa            Chorionic gonadotropin CG which is important for        corpus luteum CL rescue and maintenance of pregnancy        also binds to LHR although with a fold lower binding        affinity compared with that of LH            The mouse antirat LHR monoclonal antibody mAb clone        B was developed against purified rat LHR     The        antibody showed immunoreactivity with rat granulosa cells        of mature preovulatory follicles ovarian thecal and        interstitial cells granulosalutein cells of developing        mature and regressing CL and with testicular Leydig cells        and no reactivity with rat kidneys     During the last        ten years affinity purified B antibody has been used in        several immunohistochemical studies        To        our knowledge however no analysis of the B antibody by        western blot has been reported        In porcine ovaries LHR expression was detected in        granulosa and theca cells of preovulatory follicles but        not in granulosa lutein cells of the mature CL     In        human ovaries LHR expression was also detected in        granulosa and theca cells of preovulatory follicles but        mature CL showed strong expression in luteal cells which        disappeared during luteal regression CL from early human        pregnancies showed various intensities of LHR expression        from weak to intense on the surface and in the        cytoplasmic regions of luteal cells            LHR expression was also detected in nonpregnant human        uterus glandular and luminal epithelial cells stromal        cells myometrial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells        syncytiotrophoblast of midterm but not term human placenta        fetal membranes and decidua     human and rat brain             rat prostate      human trophoblast and        syncytiotrophoblast from early pregnancies     porcine        fallopian tubes and umbilical cord      ovarian        decidual endometrial and luteal macrophages             and ovarian cancer cell cultures and tumor tissues                   Beside its involvement in the regulation of ovarian        function the LHR appears to be involved in some additional        effects LHR immunoreactivity in porcine fallopian tubes        was confined to the epithelium and smooth muscle cells and        in vitro LH treatment caused relaxation of the oviduct            Also LHR stimulation plays a role in the induction and        maintenance of myometrial quiescence       Since        smooth muscles belong among important compartments of the        pelvic floor high LH levels after menopause might be        involved in the increased incidence of pelvic floor        disorders a common condition in postmenopausal women            Since the brain was reported to express functional LHR             there is also a possibility that high LH levels        in aging individuals may in some way participate in the        development and progression of neurodegenerative process of        several degenerative neurological diseases including        Alzheimers disease        The aim of the present study was to investigate        subcellular LHR distribution and determine LHR protein        variants identified by B mAb in various rat human and        porcine tissues During cellular differentiation a        transition from cytoplasmic to perinuclear surface        nuclear and no LHR immunoreactivity was detected In        protein extracts from rat porcine and human ovaries six        distinct LHR bands were observed migrating between  and         kDa                    Materials and Methods                  Rats          Rats of the CIIZV strain born and maintained in the          Laboratory of Biology

tissues mature CL MCL lane  showed LHR          bands similar to that in mature porcine CL Very strong          expression of all six LHR variants was detected in the          fallopian tube FT lane  which is the site of first          contact with the developing embryo secreting CG a signal          required for CL preservation          Placental chorionic villi CV lane  also showed six          distinct bands similar to those detected in the rat          human and porcine ovaries However time  and early and          late trophoblast cultures derived from the same placenta          lanes  showed additional high molecular weight LHR          variants  kDa possibly LHR homodimers              which were barely detectable or undetectable in other          tissues including placental CV Moreover there were          additional bands detected in trophoblast cultures            and  kDa species and a lack of a  kDa variant          as compared to the luteal FT and CV protein extracts          The  kDa species probably a partially degraded form          from LHR turnover     was observed in placental          cultures lanes  and pelvic floor compartments          lanes           We also investigated cultures of placental mesenchymal          cells MC which are always associated with trophoblast          cultures      and amniotic fibroblasts FB          Placental mesenchymal cells showed a prominent LHR band          at  kDa lane  Note the virtual lack of other          bands characteristic of trophoblast cultures Placental          amniotic fibroblasts showed two distinct LHR bands          migrating at  and  kDa lane  Similar  and           kDa species were distinctly expressed in trophoblast          cultures          Western blot analysis of pelvic floor compartments          showed strong expression of  and  kDa species in          protein extracts from the vaginal wall VagW lane           which consists of vaginal epithelium longitudinal and          circular smooth muscle cell bundles and connective          tissue A less prominent band was detected at  kDa          Three similar bands were also found in human levator ani          muscle and fascia lanes  and  These observations          indicate that pelvic floor compartments represent          potential targets for the LHCG effect Absorption with          porcine ovaries resulted in severe diminution of B          reactivity with rat porcine and human tissues in western          blots Fig Bvs A          Altogether these data indicate that the B antibody          identifies six LHR protein variants showing distinct          expression in rat porcine and human tissues including          human placenta with some variants also detected in human          female pelvic floor

     levels in postmenopausal women do not contribute to the          relaxation of the pelvic floor and hence to the          increased incidence of pelvic floor disorders in these          females We investigated connective tissues and muscular          compartments of the pelvic floor in order to determine          cellular equivalents to LHR bands detected in western          blots and possible cellular targets for the LH          effect          Strong cytoplasmic and nuclear LHR immunoreactivity          was found in smooth muscle cells in the vaginal wall          Fig Avs ctr

  Additional pelvic floor structure the levator ani          fascia was studied and exhibited nuclear LHR          immunoreactivity in principal cells fibroblasts white          arrowhead Fig D and other mesenchymal cells with          rounded nuclei full arrowhead most probably resident          macrophages see below Mesenchymal cells in levator ani          muscle also showed LHR immunoreactivity full arrowheads          Fig Eand F In addition nuclear LHR staining was          also detected in levator ani striated muscle fibers some          of which were centrally abnormally located in this          sample white arrowheads Fig Eand F Note unstained          muscle vessels v accompanied by LHR stromal cells          Distribution of resident macrophages as shown in Fig          GHI suggests that rounded mesenchymal cells showing          LHR immunoreactivity in pelvic floor connective tissues          might be represented by this type of cells Note          association of some resident macrophages with vasculature          v          These observations indicate that principal components          of the pelvic floor smooth muscle cells fibroblasts and          striated muscle fibers which are responsible for pelvic          floor integrity are potential targets for LHCG hormonal          effects Additional cells exhibiting LHR immunoreactivity          in pelvic floor connective tissues appear to be resident          macrophages                          Human brain Figure           Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimers          disease also show increased incidence in aging          individuals Therefore a question arises if the rise in          LH reflecting diminution of sex steroids can also          contribute to the initiation and progression of          neurodegeneration We studied LHR expression in the gray          matter of the human parietal lobe cortex Strong LHR          immunoreactivity was associated with small cells with          flattened nuclei yellow arrowheads Fig A and          numerous spiny processes full arrowhead Adjacent nerve          cells were unstained green arrowheads Fig B but          distant

of mesenchymal          mesodermal origin Yet Fig Mindicates that these          cells do not express CD of monocytes and primitive          tissue macrophages     This suggests that they are          highly differentiated dendritic type cells Figure          Dshows diffuse expression of Thy in the cortex          identified with antihuman Thy antibody Figure Eis a          control using the antirat Thy antibody not reacting          with human tissues          These data indicate that microglial cells and some          nerve cells in the gray matter of the human brain cortex          may be influenced by LHCG proteohormones Yet loss of          gray matter from areas of the parietal and temporal lobes          is the most obvious consequence of Alzheimers disease                                          Discussion        Our observations indicate that the B antiLHR antibody        reacts with rat porcine and human tissues In western        blots the B antibody identifies six distinct bands        migrating between  and  kDa and this reactivity with        protein extracts from all three species diminishes when the        antibody is preabsorbed with porcine ovaries We also show        changes in subcellular LHR distribution during        differentiation of various cell types To our knowledge        LHR expression in fibroblasts striated muscle cells and        microglial cells CD resident macrophages in the        central nervous system is presented for the first time We        also report tissue differences in vascular LHR        expression        During cellular differentiation subcellular LHR        distribution changed from granular cytoplasmic to        perinuclear surface and nuclear staining virtually no        staining was detected in stem cells and most differentiated        and aged cells Yet cell surface staining was observed        only on classic LHCG targets granulosa and theca cells of        preovulatory follicles and mature luteal cells but also in        the vaginal epithelium This indicates that these cells are        prepared for the selective accumulation of LHCG signals        from the circulation        There was also a striking difference in vascular LHR        expression between ovaries and other tissues In ovarian        and also striated muscle vessels the LHR expression was        virtually absent Fig A A J while other tissues        investigated including uterus brain skin and vagina        showed distinct vascular LHR immunoreactivity We also        reported previously that in the rat the endothelial LHR        expression is absent in testicular vessels and vessels in        other tissues involved in LHCG transport into pituitary        and from the blood kidney     Saturation of LHR in        ovarian targets may be dependent on the precise delivery of        small amounts of circulating LHCG from the blood into the        extravascular space A receptor mediated endothelial        transport of hCG has been suggested to represent a model        for general involvement of specific receptors in transport        of other plasma proteins      Yet application of        this theory on our data will indicate that the LHCG will        be delivered to the uterus brain skin and vagina rather        than to the ovary Hence the opposite mechanism should be        considered  endothelial LHR expression may suppress the        transport of LHCG from vessels to the extravascular space        The LHCG molecule is smaller than that of albumin or IgG        ie proteins exhibiting ubiquitous distribution so there        is no need to enhance rather only prevent LHCG transport        to inappropriate sites Binding of LHCG to endothelial        cells expressing LHR may prevent LHCG transport from        circulation by electrostatic forces and the lack of        endothelial LHR expression may be associated with LHCG        transport mediated by a general mechanism involved in        protein exchange            We report that normal term placentae show virtually no        LHR expression in trophoblastic syncytium while syncytium        of some abnormal placentae immature phenotypes exhibits        LHR immunoreactivity This resembles high LHR expression in        first trimester placenta     which is a source of high        hCG levels     Yet hCG levels fall during the second        trimester and elevated maternal midtrimester hCG is        associated with higher rates of maternal and neonatal        complications pregnancyinduced hypertension        preeclampsia gestational diabetes and perinatal death                      Hence some abnormal term placentae appear to preserve        syncytium in a younger state accompanied by high secretion        of hCG In contrast vascular LHR expression was detected        in sinusoids of chorionic villi from normal term placentae        but was virtually absent in all abnormal placentae If the        vascular LHR expression represents a barrier for hCG        transport from chorionic villi to the fetal blood see        above lack of this barrier may cause high levels of fetal        hCG resulting in perinatal morbidity and mortality            regardless of normal or abnormal hCG production        Western blot analysis of placental villi and trophoblast        cultures indicates that cultured trophoblast cells show        additional bands including  kDa species possibly an        LHR homodimer     Although the  kDa species        persisted in late cultures other additional LHR variants        diminished This suggests an activation of isolated        trophoblast cells and enhanced LHR synthesis with formation        of additional glycosylated LHR variants particularly in        time  and early cultures When compared to chorionic        villi trophoblast cultures showed stronger  and  kDa        species characteristic for cultured fibroblasts Indeed        it has been reported that differentiation of cultured        trophoblast is associated with activation of accompanying        fibroblasts            Early differentiation of granulosa luteal and other        cell types expressing LHR was associated with cytoplasmic        LHR immunoreactivity reflecting receptor synthesis prior        its surface expression In addition the CL of pregnancy        the function of which is highly dependent on CG also        showed cytoplasmic expression Hence it is possible that        high levels of circulating LHCG eg during pregnancy        and after menopause may influence not only cells with        surface LH expression but also cells with cytoplasmic and        perhaps exclusively nuclear LHR expression pelvic floor        compartments including striated muscle In other words        cells lacking surface LHR may not be influenced by        temporary increase of LH production during the preovulatory        period of the ovarian cycle due to the cell membrane LHR        barrier and the LH effect is probably also prevented by        the vascular LHR barrier Yet high CG levels during        pregnancy may pass the cell membrane barrier and act        through the cytoplasmic LHR in the CL of pregnancy and        other cells with cytoplasmic expression and such effect        could be enhanced if the vascular LHR barrier is absent         abnormal placentae of aged phenotype and similar putative        agerelated vascular changes in other tissues        But the LHCG action through the cytoplasmicperinuclear        and nuclear LHRs opens a possibility of more direct LHCG        action within the cells which may not require a classic        second messenger pathway cyclic AMP dependent signaling        mechanism involvement or this system can act through the        intracellular LHRs Evidence is accumulating that a number        of other factors modulate the actions of gonadotropins in        the ovary and testis via activation of alternative        signaling pathways and via LHR protein variants and        alternative second messenger pathways for the transmission        of the LHR activation effect exist which may not include        stimulation of cyclic AMP levels         A        question also arises if the nuclear LHR expression in        terminally differentiated cells eg striated muscle        fibers may not indicate a possibility of the direct effect        of LHCG on modulation of protein synthesis reflecting        certain effects of sex steroids on their nuclear        receptors        LHCG causes a relaxation of smooth muscle cells which        express LHR      Fig A The data presented also        indicate that additional principal cell types in the pelvic        floor show LHR expression including stromal and fascial        fibroblasts and striated muscle cells This is associated        with relatively high expression of LHR protein in western        blots and a fully glycosylated  kDa species in        particular Interestingly strong  and  kDa proteins        expressed in cultured fibroblasts were not detected in        pelvic floor lysates but a distinct  kDa band from        mesenchymal cells was apparent We speculate that a  kDa        species in the pelvic floor is a result of interaction of        resident macrophages with pelvic floor fibroblasts        The hCG secreted by trophoblastic syncytium during        pregnancy may play an important role in the physiologic        adaptation of the body and preparation of the pelvic floor        for labor in particular However when compared to hCG LH        has a fold higher LHR binding affinity            Consequently high LH levels after menopause may cause        pathologic relaxation of the pelvic floor resulting in        pelvic floor disorders        Strong LHR expression in microglial cells in the brain        cortex is of particular interest Microglial cells are        resident macrophages in the central nervous system and LHR        expression has been described in other types of human        resident macrophages ovary decidua endometrium and        corpora lutea      Pathological activation of        microglia has been reported in a wide range of conditions        such as Alzheimers disease cerebral ischemia prion        diseases multiple sclerosis AIDS dementia and other        degenerative neurological diseases      Some of        these degenerative diseases are associated with advanced        age and high levels of circulating LH High LH levels might        pass the presumptive LH barrier of brain vessels expressing        LHR or vascular LHR expression might diminish with age as        in abnormal term placentae Yet elevated maternal        midtrimester chorionic gonadotropin is associated with        fetal cerebral blood flow redistribution and adverse        perinatal outcome     In addition estrogens which        are known to cause a diminution of high LH levels in        postmenopausal women have been reported to be effective in        the prevention and treatment of Alzheimers disease              Microglia belong among cells of the mononuclear        phagocyte system     Since CG increases secretion of a        variety of cytokines by monocytes and induces their        inflammatory reaction and phagocytic activity               high LH levels in aging individuals may also activate        resident macrophages in the central nervous system and        contribute to the development of Alzheimers disease and        other inflammationmediated neurodegenerative diseases        Outside of the area occupied by microglial cells in the        grey matter of the cerebral cortex weaker LHR expression        was also detected in some nerve cells This suggests that        such nerve cells could be directly influenced by LHCG        proteohormones with unknown consequences while the nerve        cells among microglial branching processes are protected        from such an effect                    Conclusion        In conclusion our observations concur with and expand        current knowledge on LHR expression in gonadal and        nongonadal tissues reported by other investigators We show        that the B antibody identifies six distinct LHR protein        variants in three different mammalian species Subcellular        LHR localization varies during cellular differentiation In        contrast to the theory on the role of vascular hormone        receptors in preferential pick up of circulating hormones        there may be no need to enhance selective pick up rather        only prevent LHCG transport to inappropriate sites        Abnormal placental LHR expression may play a role in the        development of abnormal pregnancy and fetal outcome and        expression of LHR in the pelvic floor compartments suggests        that high LH levels in postmenopausal women may contribute        to pelvic floor relaxation and increased incidence of        pelvic floor disorders High LH levels in aging individuals        may also participate in the development of        inflammationmediated neurodegenerative diseases including        Alzheimers disease
