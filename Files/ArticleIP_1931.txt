                                 Paradigms of Panic            There were warning signsaplenty Anyone could have told you about the epic corruptionabout tycoonswhose empires depended on their political connections and about politiciansgrowing rich in ways best not discussed Speculation often ill informed wasrampant Besides how could investors hope to know what they were buying whenfew businesses kept scrupulous accounts Yet most brushed off these wellknownvices as incidental to the real story which was about economic growth that wasthe wonder of the world Indeed many regarded the cronyism as a virtue ratherthan a vice the signature of an economic system that was more concerned withgetting results than with the niceties of the process And for years the faintvoices of the skeptics were drowned out by the roar of an economic enginefueled by ever larger infusions of foreign capital            Thecrisis began small with the failure of a few financial institutions that hadbet too heavily that the boom would continue and the bankruptcy of a fewcorporations that had taken on too much debt These failures frightenedinvestors whose attempts to pull their money out led to more bank failuresthe desperate attempts of surviving banks to raise cash caused both a creditcrunch pushing many businesses that had seemed financially sound only monthsbefore over the brink and plunging stock prices bankrupting still morefinancial houses Within months the panic had reduced thousands of people tosudden destitution Moreover the financial disaster soon took its toll on thereal economy too As industrial production skidded and unemployment soaredthere was a surge in crime and worker unrest            But why am I telling you what happened to the United States years ago in the Panic of             Anyone who claims to fullyunderstand the economic disaster that has overtaken Asia proves by that verycertainty that he  The truth is that we have never seen anything quite likethis and that everyonefrom the country doctors at the International MonetaryFund and the Treasury Department who must prescribe economic medicine to thoseof us who have the luxury of irresponsibilityis groping frantically formodels and metaphors to make sense of this thing The usual round of academicand quasiacademic conferences and round tables has turned into a sort ofrolling rap session in which the usual suspects meet again and again to tradetheories and occasionally accusations Much of the discussion has focused onthe hidden weaknesses of the Asian economies and how they produced fertileground for a financial crisis the role of runaway banks that exploitedpolitical connections to gamble with other peoples money has emerged as theprime suspect But amid the tales of rupiah and ringgit one also hearssurprisingly oldfashioned referencesto Charles Kindlebergers classic book Manias Panics and Crashes  and even to Walter BagehotsLombard Street  Asias debacle a growing number of us now thinkis at least in part a soupedup modern version of a traditional stylefinancial panic            The logicof financial panic is fairly well understood in principle thanks both to theold literary classics and to a  mathematical formalization by DouglasDiamond and Philip Dybvig The starting point for panic theory is theobservation that there is a tension between the desire of individuals forflexibilitythe ability to spend whenever they feel like itand the economicpayoff to commitment to sticking with longterm projects until they arefinished In a primitive economy there is no way to avoid this tradeoffif youwant to be able to leave for the desert on short notice you settle for matzoinstead of bread and if you want ready cash you keep gold coins under themattress But in a more sophisticated economy this dilemma can be finessedBankBoston is largely in the business of lending money at long termsayyear mortgagesyet it offers depositors such as me who supply that moneythe right to withdraw it any time we like            What a financial intermediary a bank orsomething more or less like a bank does is pool the money of a large number ofpeople and put most of that money into longterm investments that areilliquidthat is hard to turn quickly into cash Only a fairly smallreserve is held in cash and other liquid assets The reason this works is thelaw of averages On any given day deposits and withdrawals more or lessbalance out and there is enough cash on hand to take care of any differenceThe individual depositor is free to pull his money out whenever he wants yetthat money can be used to finance projects that require longterm commitmentIt is a sort of magic trick that is fundamental to making a complex economywork            Magic however has itsrisks Normally  financial intermediation is a wonderful thing but nowand then disaster strikes Suppose that for some reasonmaybe a groundlessrumormany of a banks depositors begin to worry that their money isnt safeThey rush to pull their money out But there isnt enough cash to satisfy allof them and because the banks other assets are illiquid it cannot sell themquickly to raise more cash or can do so only at firesale prices So the bankgoes bust and the slowestmoving depositors lose their money And those whorushed to pull their money out are proved rightthe bank wasnt safeafter all In short financial intermediation carries with it the risk of bankruns of selffulfilling panic            A panicwhen it occurs can do far more than destroy a single bank Like the Panic ofor the similar panics of    and  that mother of allbank runs which much more than the  stock crash caused the GreatDepressionit can spread to engulf the whole economy Nor is strong longtermeconomic performance any guarantee against such crises As the list suggeststhe United States was not only subject to panics but also unusuallycrisisprone compared with other advanced countries during the very years thatit was establishing its economic and technological dominance            Why then did the Asian crisis catch everyone by surpriseBecause there was a halfcentury from the s to the s when they justdidnt seem to make panics the way they used to In fact weby which I meaneconomists politicians business leaders and everyone else I can thinkofhad pretty much forgotten what a good oldfashioned panic was like Wellnow we remember            Im notsaying that Asias economies were fundamentally sound that this was acompletely unnecessary crisis There are some smart peoplemost notablyHarvards Jeffrey Sachswho believe that but my view is that Asian economieshad gone seriously off the rails well before last summer and that some kind ofunpleasant comeuppance was inevitable That said it is also true that Asiasexperience is not unique it follows the quite similar Latin American tequilacrisis of  and bears at least some resemblance to the earlier LatinAmerican debt crisis of the s In each case there were some serious policymistakes made that helped make the economies vulnerable Yet governments are nomore stupid or irresponsible now than they used to be how come the punishmenthas become so much more severe            Part of the answer may be that our financialsystem has become dangerously efficient In response to the Great Depressionthe United States and just about everyone else imposed elaborate regulations ontheir banking systems Like most regulatory regimes this one ended up workinglargely for the benefit of the regulateesrestricting competition and makingownership of a bank a more or less guaranteed sinecure But while theregulations may have made banks fat and sluggish it also made them safeNowadays banks are by no means guaranteed to make money To turn a profit theymust work hard innovateand take big risks            Another part of theanswerone that Kindleberger suggested two decades agois that to introduceglobal financial markets into a world of merely national monetary authoritiesis in a very real sense to walk a tightrope without a net As long as financeis a mainly domestic affair what people want in a bank run is localmoneyand guess what the government is able to print as much as it wantsBut when Indonesians started running from their banks a few months ago whatthey wanted was dollarsand neither the Indonesian government nor the IMF cangive them enough of what they want            I am notone of those people who believes that the Asian crisis will or even can cause aworld depression In fact I think that the United States is still despiteAsia more at risk from inflation than deflation But what worries measidefrom the small matter that Indonesia with a mere  million people seems atthe time of writing to be sliding toward the abyssis the thought that we mayhave to get used to such crises Welcome to the New World Order            If youmissed our previous link to the sidebar click
