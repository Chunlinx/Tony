alchemized into sensitivity Takethe Paul Reiser character on Mad About You  Hes whiny and feminizedbut women tell me they find him doting and caring me I just see the whinyfeminized part            Reiserscharacter on Mad About You  Paul Buchman is supposed to be ItalianWhen Paul and Jamie get married its a nondenominational ceremony Is heJewish Thats left up in the air You might say Well he sounds Jewish orThe actor is Jewish or Mel Brooks and Sid Caesar played his uncles butthat skirts the issue which is how Jews are portrayed on television To thatend you might say that the conspicuous absence of Jewish issues is theproblem But the complaint in the article is not that TV shows feature too fewmale Jews If it were Mad About You would just be one more in a line ofshows presenting evidence of that Your complaint is about how Jewish men areportrayed on television Mad About You is not all that useful asevidence precisely because Jewish issues are absent from the show

to Jews marrying gentiles in My Nanny Problemstrikes me as almost racist and definitely xenophobic Although he did notoffer any reasons for his stance the only plausible ones would run along thesame lines as those offered for white people not marrying blacks or Asiansetc It is patently offensive on almost all levels I cannot imagine anythingof this sort being allowed in any magazine of decent stature if it were DavidDuke or Louis Farrakhan upset about an interracial couple on television I havebeen a reader of                   Slate                almost from the inaugural issue and whileI am rarely disappointed with what I read any more of this sort of BS may costyou a potential subscriber And even if that were not an issue I am stilldisappointed with the editorial staff for allowing

QWilson and James Howard Kunstlers Dialogue on cars with interest Wilson certainly seems tohave both the better case and the more reasonable tone Nonetheless there issome merit in Kunstlers complaints about the ills of sprawl            May Ipoint out that sprawl is to a large extent the fault of our current local taxsystem If we replaced the current property tax on land and buildings with atax falling solely on the value of land vacant lots in cities and along theroads leading out of them would be built upon instead of held for speculationThen people could live closer to where they work and shop burn less gasolinewhen they commute by car and more often be able to walk A denser populationwould also make mass transit more feasible             NicholasRosen                                       TheTalking Cure                        I wasirritated at Christopher Benfeys criticism in TrueConfessions his review of Ted Hughes Birthday Letters  of theidea that Sylvia Plath might have been helped by a psychiatrist Is it reallysuch a strange idea that a suicidally depressed person might benefit fromtreatment of some kind I suspect Benfey feels that her early death by suicidewas somehow ordained and has something to do with her status as a poet Thisis the kind of sentiment that contributed to her death and to Hughes manyyears of silence             DanKrashin Honolulu
