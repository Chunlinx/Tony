              well how do you think womens roles have changed   well that kind of caught me by surprise its kind i think i think that they have changed drastically i mean i think about people like my mother who you know gave up their careers and stayed home to raise kids and um you know played a really subservient role in the family and i just dont see that anymore at all   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   even women who do stay home to raise families i think that they are still thought of as equals in in the role you know as far as the role in the family and society goes   well i i uh just in my lifetime i know that the role of women has changed drastically also my mother when she began having her family she quit her job and stayed home until   uhhuh   im the youngest in my family until i was uh in junior high school old enough to care for myself when i got home from school   um   but i think that uh the changes in the next twenty years will probably be just as drastic you youll see more women CEOs and more women holding public offices   yeah definitely i think the biggest problem uh the biggest change that needs to be made is the way that women are paid   oh i agree   i mean you know its just the statistics are just staggering that when they make like you know sixty cents on the dollar for what men make for the same jobs and that i mean i can get really angry about that   yeah it its probably all it its the role of women is is in an evolutionary stage so we im sure it will eventually evolve to where it is equal it just hasnt reached that point yet because women uh havent   yeah   been in positions similar to men for that many years relative to how long men have had those types of positions   well thats true but you know im a single parent trying to raise a child and it really upsets me not to be paid you know the same for my job now i dont see that so much in my job but i know in other professions um i know that its true i know you know friends of mine that are affected by that and uh just you know its just not fair   no its not fair   i dont know what to do about it   well theres not much you can do except for yourself individually and and stand up for your salary i mean for what you want in your own job and if if its not going to work out go find some place that will do what you want to do   yeah yeah and then too i think that you know i think a lot of women who have been forced into the workplace unwittingly just because it you know to raise a family nowadays it takes two incomes they have to work and then i think the majority of the time they get still get stuck with most of the you know running the house type chores you know taking care of the kids and you know arranging their schedules and being responsible for those types of of things i know that i do know some men that that participate quite actively um you know in in things but i know a lot that dont so its just a real shame you know i think when you look at the changing role of women you have to look at the changing role of men too because theyre directly related   uhhuh well i think it during this in this evolutionary theory that i have here that men will eventually evolve around to where they participate more in the home because when it gets to the point to where that the house is dirty and the kids are dirty and and moms not home shes at work men are going to gradually learn how to do those kinds of things   yeah   well they may yeah i think eventually but some men dont see some men just dont care   well at i the the the generations that are being raised now by working mothers i i are are a little more in touch with   yeah   the household chores and duties and what has to be done so i think over a couple of generations time it will all change because its really been uh my generation   yeah i i agree with that   grew up for the most part with mothers in the home but again my generation plan of women plans on working and not being at home   uhhuh yeah   so it will be my children who really make big changes i think because that they will probably the majority of children now are at home without their mothers well or in some type of a day care or something because so many women work now   right in day care yeah i agree i uh you know its fun being single its like i almost have to work right now im at home because i am recovering from surgery but uh   uhhuh   you know i really resent that in that i dont have that choice to be able to stay home with my child but uh i guess as long as you are single you have to support yourself nobody else is going to do it for you   yeah yeah   so   well how do you feel about women in public office do you think that thats going to grow and how far do you think thats going to go in the next ten years or so   well i think that that theres more you know there is definitely more women in public office uh i think its going to be a long time before we see a woman president uh i dont think thats going to happen in the next ten years i dont   uhhuh   think thats going to happen in the next twenty years but uh you know i think that theres progress and im not very political so i dont really know you know any i dont know any statistics on you know how many women run for public office and how often theyre defeated   yeah i dont know any statistics either but its its probably going to be the same type of situation that that uh the black people have gone through it took them well black men long time to to get up to the pay scales of the white man and now i think it its feasible for a black man to be president   yeah yeah i think we will see a black a black man as president before we see a woman president   uhhuh and since since this evolution or this this progression of black male salaries and all that was all before women were heavy in the work place i women will probably go through the same type of deal   uhhuh same type of battle yeah   type of deal its just further down the road   yeah uh i dont know i think a lot of um states are uh do you live in Texas you know because we now we have a woman governor and of course Dallas i do you live in Dallas   yes uhhuh   no i live in San Antonio   in San Antonio well   we have a woman mayor   do yeah yeah you do now  and uh we have a woman mayor now too in Dallas and Houston has had a woman mayor for a long time because i used to live there too   yeah yeah well Texas had a woman governor a hundred years ago or whatever Ma Ferguson   oh did they oh i didnt know that   yeah yeah i think it was Ma Ferguson i know Texas had a woman governor   huh was she elected or was it something that   i think she was im not sure it was a hundred or so years ago so i i dont know im not real up on past history or anything   uhhuh thats interesting i didnt i i i didnt know that       but uh   i im thinking it might have been the kind of deal where her husband was governor and he died or something   yeah thats right why i asked if she was elected or if it if it was something that was passed passed down to her through through the ways that the laws work   im not sure   but uh im surprised i really am surprised you know that major cities you know especially in a state like Texas would elect a woman governor   yeah   and uh like i said i really have no interest in politics its just not my field but uh you know being a woman i dont know even that i would vote for a woman in the high offic e   i wouldnt now because i dont know of one thats thats equipped to handle   i certainly i wouldnt have voted for Ann Richards for governor and uh i cant say that i would vote for a woman president now   no i why i didnt but uh   we might see a woman vice president that wouldnt surprise me and then of course if something happened to be uh im sorry yeah if something happened she would be president but it would not be something that she were elected to   uhhuh the the problem im sorry go ahead i uh i just i dont think a woman president is anywhere in the near future if not just for the just for American prejudice   uhhuh   the world several major countries in the world that we deal with all the time dont respect women as business people so a woman president would be   is that right   laughed at by other countries because they wouldnt respect her as a business person   nope what about  Margaret Thatcher wasnt she fairly she was i thought she was real well  real well respected     she was but i dont think that England deals as heavily with with like for instance the Arab countries i dont know all the details of it but i i know that for instance in Saudi Arabia women are just   uhhuh oh yeah   and in uh my mother has done business in Germany and it was very difficult for her going over there because they just dont have very many business women   uhhuh   and and the men basically see a business woman and ask them to go get coffee or something its just its very difficult to be well respected and and Margaret Margaret Thatcher had been in office it was probably very difficult for her at first but     yeah   well she comes from a a country where the model
