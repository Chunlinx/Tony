                    Background        Opioid receptors ORs like many other G        proteincoupled receptors GPCRs are capable of        signalling via the family of mitogen activated protein        kinases MAPKs It has been postulated that activation of        these kinases allows GPCR agonists to modulate such diverse        molecular events as cell proliferation differentiation        and survival     To date all three cloned opioid        receptor types   and the closely related nociceptin        receptor have demonstrated the ability to signal through        their heterotrimeric G proteins G         i or G         o  to at least one type of MAPK              Among the members of this family that are activated by        opioids are the two extracellular signalregulated protein        kinases p MAPKERK  and p MAPKERK     and the        p protein kinase     However the precise mechanism        by which OR stimulation produces an increase in MAPK        activity is still unknown and under investigation        While receptor cell and tissuespecific differences        almost certainly exist and appear to make any single        mechanism of ERK activation unlikely certain generalities        have begun to emerge For example ERK activation by GPCRs        is predominantly a Rasdependent event one that utilizes        many of the upstream protein intermediates ie Shc Gab        Grb mSOS and MAPK kinase MEK known to be used by        singletransmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs like        the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR for a review        see     When ERKs are activated after EGFR        stimulation an essential event is the sequential tyrosine        phosphorylation of these intermediate proteins and their        binding to the tyrosine phosphorylated EGFR before the        GTPloading of Ras For the GPCR model the tyrosine        kinases involved and the site of this multiprotein        complex formation is less clear For a number of GPCRs        including the lysophosphatidic acid LPAR            adrenergic                    AR    and  and OR receptors            the activation of a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase of        the Src or focal adhesion kinase FAK    families are        involved However the question of what plasma        membranespanning protein serves as the scaffold for Shc        binding and beyond remains to be answered        Two possibilities have emerged as potential sites of        tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent scaffold building        in response to GPCR stimulation which results in ERK        activation the GPCR itself or a coexpressed RTK ie        the EGFR that would act as a surrogate We and others and        we have reported that  and opioid receptors become        tyrosine phosphorylated after agoniststimulation             Tyrosine phosphorylation of a membranebound protein is        an essential step in ERK activation because it creates        SHbinding domains that allow Shc and other proteins to        associate into a multiprotein signalling complex The        mutation of one of the tyrosines YF in the OR or the        presence of the Src inhibitor PP significantly reduces        tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor and its ability        to activate ERKs      However a small degree of        OR agonistmediated ERK activation remained in cells        expressing the YF mutant receptor suggesting that a        second mechanism or an additional tyrosine could be        involved These data suggest that the tyrosine        phosphorylation of GPCRs may allow them to signal ERKs in        the absence of RTK or FAK phosphorylation by acting as        their own scaffolds        However the majority of the published studies have        focused on the hypothesis that GPCRs must work in        cooperation with RTKs ie the EGFR to produce ERK        activation Studies by Daub et al    and Luttrell et        al    have demonstrated that stimulation of LPAR G         iq coupled and           ARs G         s coupled respectively results in        the transactivation transphosphorylation of coexpressed        EGFRs For example both EPA and isoproterenol increase the        tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR which appears to be        required for ERK activation since the presence of        kinasedeficient EGFR mutants or the kinase inhibitor        AG prevents both responses It is hypothesized that        transtyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR creates protein        phosphotyrosine binding sites that act as a surrogate        scaffold for ERK activation     Since ORs share many        similarities with LPAR and           ARs in the way they activate the ERK        pathway      we chose to examine whether RTK        transactivation occurs and is a necessary aspect of        opioidmediated ERK activation                    Results                  DSLET and EGF induce ERK phosphorylation in          ORexpressing HEK cells          We have shown that opioids increase the          phosphorylation of ERKl in HEK cells when the mouse          wild type WT OR is stably expressed      The          concentrations required to observe DSLETmediated ERK          phosphorylation EC              nM Figure a are consistent          with those reported for other ORmediated events          including G protein activation and adenylyl cyclase          inhibition      Moreover no change in total ERK          expression was observed concomitantly with ERK          phosphorylation in any of our experiments data not          shown Pretreating the cells with PTX  ngml or          the specific OR antagonist naltrindole  M          completely blocked the DSEETinduced increase in ERK          phosphorylation Figure b These results suggest that          DSLET utilizes a G           i coupled OR to stimulate ERK  and           We then took advantage of the HEK cell lines          endogenous expression of the EGFR to examine this          receptors ability to activate ERKs Similar to DSLET          EGF  ngml produces a robust activation of ERKs in          ORexpressing HEK cells after a  minute treatment          Figure a PTX did not attenuate EGFmediated ERK          activation Figure a although this response was          completely blocked by the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG           M Figure a Conversely DSLETinduced ERK          activation was unaffected by AG suggesting that          different tyrosine kinases are involved in opioid and          EGFdependent MAPK activity Figure b DSLETmediated          ERK activation was significantly inhibited by the Src          kinase inhibitor PP  M Figure  PP also had a          significant inhibitory  reduction effect on MAPK          activation by EGF Figure                           DSLETinduced ERK activation does not produce          hyperphosphorylation of the EGFR          Our next experiments were designed to examine whether          the EGFR becomes tyrosine phosphorylated during ERK          activation by DSLET As stated in the introduction          several GPCRs including the EPAR             AR and substance P SPR                increase EGFR phosphorylation during the course          of ERK activation and it is believed that in these          instances this event is an initial step in the          progression of the MAPK cascade Our laboratory has          previously reported     that opioids induce          tyrosine phosphorylation of the OR and it appears that          this is catalyzed by the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase          Src However transphosphorylation of the EGFR after OR          activation has not been reported WTORexpressing          HEK cells were exposed to increasing concentrations          of either DSLET  nM or EGF  ngml for          five minutes to induce ERK activation As stated earlier          either DSLET or EGF increased the appearance of          phosphorylated ERK in a time and concentration dependent          manner A portion of the lysates used to measure ERK          activation was used to immunoprecipitate the EGFR or OR          to determine their degree of tyrosine phosphorylation          After immunoprecipitation of the FLAGtagged OR or the          EGFR with the appropriate antibodies we found that only          DSLET induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the OR          whereas only EGF potentiated EGFR phosphorylation Figure            M DSLETinduced tyrosine phosphorylation of the          OR was inhibited by naltrindole PP but not by AG          Figure  These results suggest that transactivation of          the EGFR does not play a role in OR phosphorylation or          ERK activation by opioids                          Determining whether a coexpressed RTK is          structurally necessary for ORmediated ERK          activation                      EGFR downregulation does not affect            DSLETmediated ERK activation in HEK cells            Despite the lack of direct evidence that DSLET            induces the transactivation of coexpressed RTKs it is            possible that the EGFR in some way contributes to ERK            activation by opioids It is possible that RTKs and            GPCRs share important protein intermediates that are            required during ERK activation Therefore we wished to            determine what effects the downregulation of the EGFR            would have on ERK signalling via the OR HEK            cells expressing the WTOR were exposed to EGF             ngml for  hours in order to downregulate and            desensitize the endogenous EGFR After chronic EGF            treatment the cultures were washed with serumfree            media and then exposed acutely  minutes to either            EGF  ngml or DSLET  M to stimulate ERK            phosphorylation In EGF pretreated cultures acute EGF             ngml was unable to increase the expression of            phosphoERKs compared to mediaexposed controls Figure             This lack of response appears to be due to the            downregulation of EGFRs from these cells as confirmed            by immunoblots using the antiEGFR antibody data not            shown However DSLETmediated ERK activation was            unaltered in identically pretreated cultures            In cells pretreated with DSLET  M  hours to            induce downregulation of ORs     DSLET  M            was no longer able to activate the ERK cascade but the            ERK response to acute EGF  ngml was unchanged            compared to mediumtreated controls Figure  These            results indicate that a reduction in the function and            density of endogenous EGFRs has little effect on            opioidmediated MAPK cascades and suggests that the            enzyme cascades that control OR and EGFRmediated            ERK activation are separate                                DSLET activates ERK even in a cell line devoid of            the EGFR            C glioma cells have been used as host cells for the            transfection of several GPCR types and have the            advantage of expressing high levels of ERK while being            devoid of the EGFR In C glioma cells that express the            mouse OR DSLET produced a concentrationdependent            increase in the appearance of phosphoERK  and             DSLETmediated ERK activation in COR cells was            completely inhibited by either pretreatment with PTX            or naltrindole data not shown In contrast EGF was            unable to elicit ERK activation at any concentration            tested up to  M Figure  Furthermore the EGFR            antagonist AG had no effect on DSLETmediated ERK            activation which eliminated the possibility that these            antagonists produced nonspecific inhibitory effects            Figure                                 Potential of endogenously expressed insulin            receptors IR and PDGFR to act as surrogate protein            scaffolds during ERK activation by opioids            However C glioma cells express additional RTKs            including insulin IR and plateletderived growth            factor PDGFR receptors It is possible that these            sites can be used as surrogate scaffold proteins during            ERK activation and we explored the possibility that            opioids induce the transphosphorylation of these two            RTKs At concentrations of  M neither DSLET DADLE            nor DPDPE were found to increase the tyrosine            phosphorylation of the IR or the PDGFR whereas insulin             ngml or PDGF  ngml induced significant            tyrosine phosphorylation of these sites Figure             Moreover we pretreated COR cells with the IR            antagonist hydroxynapthalenylmethylphosphonic            acidtris acetoxymethylester HNMPAAM                M or the PDGFR            antagonist tyrosphostin   M before the            addition of DSLET  M Despite the presence of these            catalytic RTK inhibitors opioidmediated ERK            activation was not significantly altered in comparison            to untreated cultures Figure  Furthermore            immunoprecipitation of the OR followed by            immunoblotting using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies            revealed that these inhibitors did not attenuate            tyrosine phosphorylation of ORs after DSLET treatment            Figure  The results presented herein strongly            suggest that transactivation of RTKs does not make a            significant contribution to DSLETinduced ERK            activation in at least two different cell lines                                      Discussion        With the first evidence that GPCRs could signal via the        MAPK cascade many investigators have looked for a common        mechanism of activation that could be applied across        receptor types Unlike the better understood mechanism        whereby singletransmembrane RTKs eg EGFR IR or PDGFR        stimulate ERKs      no single sequence of events        appears to hold among GPCRs even when they are expressed        in the same cell line For instance studies from two        laboratories reported marked differences in the way the           adrenergic receptor           AR activates ERK  and  in HEK        cells In one study the           AR activates ERK through its        coupling to a PTXsensitive G         i protein and subsequent Ras activation            while in another ERK phosphorylation occurred in        a PTXindependent and a G         s  and cAMPdependent fashion            Furthermore these studies indicate that the same receptor        may activate ERKs via one mechanism when it is endogenously        expressed and via another when it is transfected into a        cell line            Despite numerous reported differences it does appear        that diverse GPCRs share common mechanistic themes during        ERK stimulation including the tyrosinephosphorylation of        Shc and its complexing with Grb mSOS recruitment the        GTPloading of Ras and Raf activation leading to MEK        phosphorylation     However the progression of each of        these downstream events after GPCR stimulation depends        first on the tyrosine phosphorylation of a membranebound        protein that will be used as a scaffold which will bind        the other proteins eg Shc Grb Gab mSOS etc            Moreover the exact identity of the tyrosine        kinases involved in this initial step appears to vary        among receptor types with RTKs nonreceptor protein        tyrosine kinases PTKs or FAKs being involved in        particular instances            In this report we questioned whether the EGFR acts as a        surrogate scaffold during ERK activation through the OR        as it appears to do for several other GPCRs     To act        as a surrogatebinding site for complex formation the        literature states that this protein must first become        tyrosinephosphorylated     Tyrosine phosphorylation of        the EGFR is apparent after agonist stimulation of the           AR COS           AR COS insulinlike growth        factor IGF COS substance P and the        lysophosphatidic acid receptor LPAR     In addition        each of the aforementioned ligands also increases ERK        phosphorylation when the proper receptor is expressed in        these cell lines ERK activation and EGFR phosphorylation        via each of these receptors was inhibited by prior exposure        to the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG        However the Src inhibitor PP or the expression of a        dominantnegative Src mutant will reduce GPCRmediated        transphosphorylation of the EGFR and GPCRmediated ERK        activation to varying degrees partial to total        suggesting that at least two different tyrosine kinases can        be involved     Src was found to coimmunoprecipitate        with the phosphorylated EGFR in COS cells exposed to        either LPA or EGF     These authors reported that the        autophosphorylation of Y in the EGFR does not occur        after LPA exposure suggesting that cSrc is the principal        tyrosine kinase in this instance and not the EGFRs        intrinsic tyrosine kinase Src has also been found to        coimmunoprecipitate with the agoniststimulated           AR during the period of ERK        activation     Our previous work     suggested        that a Srclike protein tyrosine kinase was primarily        responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the OR and        ERK activation induced by DTLET when the receptor was        expressed in CHO or HEK cells because both responses        were blocked by the presence of  M PP The seemingly        dominant role of Src in opioidmediated ERK stimulation is        strengthened in the present report because of considerable        evidence that the EGFR antagonist AG was unable to        reduce DSLETmediated ERK activation This suggests that        the EGFR has minimal if any involvement in the        opioidactivated ERK cascade It is possible that the dual        coupling of the LPAR to both inhibitory G         i  and stimulatory G          and G         q  G proteins is a reason for these        differences        In this report we have presented considerable evidence        that ORs and EGFRs activate ERKs independently without        the need for transphosphorylation of a coexpressed RTK We        used C glioma cells transfected to stably express the        mouse OR to examine ERK activation by opioids in a        line that does not express the EGFR to confirm our results        obtained in the receptor downregulation experiments We        observed that DSLET activated p mapkand p mapkvery        robustly in this cell line C glioma cells do express        growth factor receptors that bind PDGF and insulin        However neither of these proteins has been reported to act        as a surrogate scaffold during ERK activation by nonopioid        GPCRs     In the present report DSLETmediated ERK        phosphorylation was unaltered by the presence of the IR or        PDGFR antagonists HNMPAAM          and tyrosphostin  respectively It        is probable that the OR in C glioma cells also acts as        its own platform for the binding of Shc etc since the        OR also undergoes agonistmediated tyrosine        phosphorylation in this particular cell line Kramer et        al unpublished observations similar to what we        previously reported for the OR expressed in Chinese        hamster ovary or HEK cells      Thus in at        least two different cell lines HEK and C glioma we        have significant evidence that transactivation of an        endogenously expressed RTK is not required for ERK        activation through opioid receptors        While the EGFR does not appear to be phosphorylated        during DSLETmediated ERK activation it is possible that        the EGFR is somehow involved in this response when it is        present Buist et al    reported that        endogenouslyexpressed LPA and endothelin ET        receptors in SKNMC cells do not activate ERKs unless the        EGFR is coexpressed although each GPCR is functional as        evidenced by their ability to increase intracellular Ca         In the presence of the EGFR ligand activation of LPA        and ET receptors did not increase EGFR phosphorylation        even though both the LPA and ET receptors stimulated ERK        activity by fold over basal     Specifically key        protein intermediates may be physically associated with        endogenous RTKs in HEK cells and therefore        downregulation of the EGFR may negatively affect ERK        phosphorylation by opioids To examine this we induced        significant downregulation of EGFR density and function by        exposing ORHEK cells to  ngml EGF for  hours        Functionally these cells are no longer capable of        activating ERK  or  in response to  ngml EGF Figure        whereas this concentration produces a strong effect in        nonpretreated cells Conversely DSLETmediated ERK        phosphorylation is actually greater in chronicallytreated        EGF cultures to that observed in cells not previously        exposed to high EGF concentrations This may represent a        compensatory effect to counteract the loss of function of        an important growth factor receptor In a similar        experiment a hour exposure to DSLET  M induced        significant OR downregulation and an almost complete        loss of DSLETmediated ERK phosphorylation MAP kinase        activation by a  minute exposure to EGF was unaffected by        OR downregulation These results taken together        suggest that GPCRs and RTKs can act as independent        regulators of MAP kinase cascades although interactions        between the two receptor types may exist in certain        cases        In conclusion we report that the OR agonist DSLET        induces significant ERK activation in the absence of any        increase in phosphorylation of the coexpressed EGFR in        HEK cells HEK cells endogenously express the EGFR        and EGF produces robust ERK activation concomitant with        EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation Immunoprecipitation studies        showed that the OR becomes tyrosine phosphorylated after        exposure to DSLET but not to EGF These studies were        repeated in ORtransfected C glioma cells which do not        express the EGFR In these cells DSLET was still able to        induce ERK activation Additional studies showed that the        two RTKs which are present in C glioma cells IRs and        PDGFRs had no apparent role on ERK activation by a        opioid agonist Furthermore inducing downregulation of        either the EGFR or OR by chronic agonist treatment has        little effect on ERK activation by the other receptor in        HEK cells suggesting that these pathways are distinct        These results demonstrate that opioidmediated ERK        activation occurs independently of EGFR        transphosphorylation and that the tyrosinephosphorylated        OR may serve as
