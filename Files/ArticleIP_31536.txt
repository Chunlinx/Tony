                                  The Love Bloat            A day doesnt go by that I dont read in the press or some Microsoft customer sidles up to me  or even my girlfriend saysHey Shuman why is Microsoft software so bloated so full of junk sucking upmegs of space on my hard drive hogging memory and taking forever to load Thetoolbar buttons look like they were lifted from the cockpit of an F Mygrouchy critics are ramping up again as the very large Office  softwaresuite hits the stores Shuman why dont you and the other boy developers atMicrosoft write some trim and tight code            Well ladies andgentlemen Im going to let you in on a little secret The problem withsoftware today is not that it is bloated The problem is that its notbloated enough                        What is bloat Bloat is the American dream bigger betterand everywhere all at once Supersize it From VCRs to food processors to FordExpeditions industry has historically provided consumers with features tohave  not necessarily to use How many of you have programmed your VCRMinced carrots with your Cuisinart Or gone offroading in your SUV            Why should software beany different Do you really think software developers add features just forfun like some cackling tormentor If only that were the case Sadly it isyou the customer who demands bloat forever clamoring for new featuresSoftware companies take your wish lists seriously and then make them happenIts like the violenceinthemedia argument We hate it but we buy it            Now I dont deny that software is getting um alarminglylarge A complete installation of Office  requires  megabytes ofharddisk space This compares to the puny installation requirement of  megsto  megs of harddisk space for a similar array of DOS applications circa WordPerfect Lotus  dBase Crosstalk etc            But thanks to Moores Law and its corollariescomputer power continues to double every  months and prices keep fallingMost computer users want to do fancy new things with their speedyPentium chips and mongolarge hard drives not just run their old applicationsfaster So if computers are getting more powerful shouldnt we developersharness that capacity            The antibloat whinerswould have you believe that Microsoft is coercing them into using ourextralarded software products I call their bluff The elegance of the Windows operating system is that it runs practically every application from the DOSdays and all those goofy Windows  programs If you want to run unbloatedlegacy programs such as WordStar for Windows or Bitcom for DOS instead of newapplications be my guest Also you lovers of legacy applications should knowthat one of the reasons Windows  and Windows  are so bloated is so thatthey can run the old applications            It is precisely because users can ignore the new releasesfrom Microsoft or Lotus or Corel that the software industry works overtime toadd new features to software features that will convince users to spend on an upgrade to do the same computing as theyre doing now only with morebells and whistles and excitement The day that Microsoft fails to convince youto upgradeie to buy a product that the malcontents call bloatedis theday that Redmond becomes a ghost town            Most bloatware complaintscome from users who own  to yearold machines They dont understand thatthe new bloated versions of software are meant for the new megahertzmachines and the wickedly fast machines to come in the next monthsincluding gigahertz computersnot their Pentium  doorstops Orthe complainers single out features that they never use such as AutoSummarizein Word or the Journal feature in Outlook that can slow even the fastestcomputer to a crawl My advice to these complainers Turn these features offor ignore them            Having praised bloat let me confide that when I worked onthe Microsoft Outlook team bloat was my biggest enemy A mean boss named Biffroutinely yelled hurtful things at me when I wrote indulgent fat code becausehis bosses wanted programs to load and work quickly Outlook SWAT teams swoopeddown daily to reduce the size of our code I remember endless hallwaydiscussions about how to balance the demand for lean and quick code against thebloat required to add new and nifty features We were ultimately successfulIf you compare Outlook  to the first version Outlook  youll see a vastimprovement in performance and stability Youll also see a lot more coolfeatures such as HTML mail and Preview Pane to name but two            The struggle betweenconcise code and bloated code plays out under the threat of a deadline If oursoftware is occasionally too fat we developers fall back on the same excusephilosopher Blaise Pascal offered three centuries ago for his verbose lettersI have only made this letter longer because I have not had the time to makeit shorter            If youre truly antibloat theres a whole subgenre ofdainty lowbloat computers out there for you The PalmPilot and Windows CEhandheld devices They pack a lot a power into little boxes but lets not kidanybody Sometimes you can make do with a bicycle but other times you need acar A fast car A fast car with a big noisy engine and a bonecrushing CDsound system A Bloatmobile            I began this column with the provocative thesis thatsoftware isnt anywhere near bloated enough By that I meant that if wesoftware developers were really doing our jobs instead of resting and vestingour stock options word processors would have already bloated into percent reliable voicerecognition software Your computer would have fused thefunctions of your telephone television and fax machine into one seamlesswhole Your computer would have become the instantly searchable repository ofall your correspondence financial transactions data searches and phoneconversations Plus it would be making smart connections between your data andactions For instance it will tell me Hey Shuman you can get a better autoinsurance policy from GEICO Or Hey Shuman lay off the fatty fried foodwhy doncha You want to get bloated or something
