                            Jonathan Mann founder of the World Health Organizations Global Program on AIDS and        untiring advocate for justice for people with HIVAIDS addressed the United Nations        General Assembly in   His speech characterized the three major phases of an        HIVAIDS epidemic After the initial silent spread of virus came the outbreak of ill        health The final stage he saidthe stage of social impactis marked by stigma grinding        down its victims with shame and isolation        Manns tragically short life was devoted to protecting all who stood to be diminished by        illnessrelated stigma and the erosion of elemental human rights  Why were stigma and        human rights so essential to the work of a medical doctor fighting an infectious        disease                    Fear of Stigma Fuels the HIV Epidemic        Stigma is of utmost concern because it is both the cause and effect of secrecy and        denial which are both catalysts for HIV transmission Fear of stigma limits the efficacy        of HIVtesting programs across subSaharan Africa because in most villages everyone        knowssooner or laterwho visits test sites  While in some places the advent of free        and accessible antiretroviral therapy has offered hope and encouraged people to go for        testing  stigma remains a barrier to testing even where treatment is available         Without HIV testing an essential first step to treatment years may go by while people who        are infected transmit the virus to others When individuals finally become ill and seek        care treatment as a prevention strategy has lost much of its potential effectiveness        Fear of stigma can cause pregnant women to avoid HIV testing the first step in reducing        mothertochild transmission  It may force mothers to expose babies to HIV infection        through breastfeeding because the mothers do not want to arouse suspicion of their HIV        status by using alternative feeding methods  Fear of stigma and the resulting        denial may even inhibit condom use in HIV discordant couples Further evidence of how        stigma leads to denial is the way in which newspaper obituaries avoid mentioning HIVAIDS        as a cause of death        HIVrelated stigma directly hurts people who lose community support due to their real        or supposed HIV infection Individuals may be isolated within their family hidden away        from visitors or made to eat alone  These repercussions may or may not be simple acts        of heartlessness They may be a wellintentioned but ignorant attempt to preserve the        family In the community the entire family may be sanctioned because one member is ill in        an impoverished society with no safety net of public services this can be ominous for        everyone         In many African villages an individuals and a familys life is closely intertwined        with others The same people have lived closely together for several generations and there        are few secrets Inside families caregivers may be largely concerned about contracting HIV        through casual contact and outside they fear the gossip that can greatly affect everyones        social standing Neighbors and other customers for instance may refuse to purchase        vegetables or poultry from someone associated with HIV  In impoverished areas this        can devastate a familys chances of economic survival        The language used to describe people living with HIV such as she is an HIV he is a        walking corpse clearly conveys stigmatizing attitudes A particularly powerful example of        stigmatizing language is found in parts of Tanzania where an HIVpositive person is called                nyambizi  or submarine implying that the HIVpositive person is        stealthy menacing and deadly         People living with HIV can also experience a form of internalized stigma Figure         Even without the burden of externally imposed social opprobrium those living with a        serious illness can face an enormous and painful inner struggle They may eventually cease        to be who they were instead becoming a unitary person with an illness ormore damningan        ill person a thing in which personhood and illness have completely fused The        philosopher Simone Weil characterized this assault of illness upon the self with the        classical Greek notion of the soul        Malheur affliction stamps the soul to its very depths with scorn and        disgust         The combination of external stigma and internal oppression of the self may impose a        heavy burden In our experience of working with people with HIV in Africa the result of        this burden is often a downward spiral marked by fatalism selfloathing and isolation        from others And by shaming and silencing the very people who could credibly speak for HIV        prevention and provide care for HIVpositive others stigma fuels the HIV epidemic        consigning more people to suffering and death                    Stigma in Society        Stigma is part of the attitudes and social structures that set people against each        other It impedes any countervailing forces for social equality Certainly since Erving        Goffmans seminal work on stigma in the early s stigma plural stigmata has been        recognized as an attribute that is significantly discrediting and it is known as a        potent and painful force in individual lives  Fueled by prejudice and appealing to it        stigma functions to diminish the person or group being targeted Some commentators since        Goffman have particularly examined stigmas broader social functioning They have noted        that while subordinating individuals or groups in society the stigmatizing process also        reinforces hierarchical patterns of privilege where those at the top of a stratified        society are preeminent over and sometimes predatory upon others at lower levels                To see this perhaps more clearly think of certain religious settings where punishment        theories of illness causation are in force  One such outlook presumes an aroused        deity or ancestor bringing illness upon a person in retribution for an offense This notion        stigmatizes people struggling with their illness It blames their sickness upon        misbehaviors while at the same time it rationalizes privileging the well over the ill        Punishment theories authorize communities to isolate or purge the impurepeople whose        illness or imagined sinfulness would contaminate the wholewhile reassuring that virtue        and social status will protect the righteous        Clergy and other religious leaders are as susceptible as any to the temptation to        exercise power over others This imbalance of power is facilitated by such structured        inequalities within churches as the preeminence of clergy over laity of men over women        and even by the presumed superiority of the more spiritual over the less so Under the        influence of western missionaries many African Christian organizations still promote        evangelical formulae in which it is taught creation was originally good but then the        fall of humankind occurred which is bad and finally redemption is available only for        the chosen This theological approach warrants valorizing or stigmatizing people as saved        or sinner pure or impure us or them and it strengthens the broader social        stratifications within which stigma flourishes What is weakened is the opportunity to        apply healing insights from the rich Christian legacy of compassion liberation and hope                            Gender and HIV        In much of subSaharan Africa women are a subordinate group who are expected to become        pregnant bear children and fulfill the sexual desires of their husbands without        hesitation  Such traditional assumptions sometimes reinforced by the missionary        religions greatly benefit men while predisposing women to HIV infection Often husbands        carry HIV while barrier methods of disease prevention such as condoms are proscribed        perhaps most vigorously by maledominant religious organizations        In addition to womens subordinate status in many societies they are also frequently        stigmatized as the vectors of HIV transmission despite overwhelming evidence to the        contrary In Malawi the term for a sexually transmitted disease regardless of its origin        is womans disease  Husbands have beaten andor abandoned wives thought to be        HIVpositive despite the fact that many women contract the virus from their husbands Some        women are subject to violence if they refuse a sexual overture ask their husband to use a        condom or request an HIV test If a husband should die the wifes inlaws may seize her        inheritance  A woman exhibiting the independence needed to protect her health and        selfesteem risks the disapprobation of her family and of the community        Men are the clear winners of this arrangement in both social and economic terms and        many widows and their children dispossessed or not struggle against enormous odds simply        to survive Public attitudes stigma among them help to sustain the entire unjust        system                    Stigma and Human Rights        We marvel at the prescience and lucidity of Mann a doctor who was dedicated to treating        the whole personboth the physical ills and the emotional distress attendant upon these        ills including the stigma inherited from or imposed by societies where the oppression of        some fortifies the privilege of others Mann respected the healing potential of social        justice in general and of human rights in particular He knew that a society in which        multiple injustices routinely occur is itself not well and he knew that widespread respect        of human rights made less room for stigma and its harmful consequences                  Respect of human rights makes less room for stigma                The way to tackle social oppression of any kind is to introduce strategies that address        underlying conditions of poverty racism and sexism that support such oppression  This        approach should be bolstered by sufficient legal and policy mechanisms to protect people        subject to stigma and the erosion of human rights in general  The same mechanisms        should be functional and accessible to all        To be effective all HIV interventions should include an analysis of how stigma        functions how it enhances dominance and subordination in society how it is that some win        and others lose in the pernicious struggle for preeminence and why it is that such a        social scheme perversely flourishes in the first place         Enlightened HIV prevention and care interventions Figure  will empower the        stigmatized through health education that lifts selfblame and shifts opprobrium to        external selfserving forces While teaching respect for all through a more just society        these interventions will help people who are stigmatized to critique unjust societal        dynamics and challenge assumptions and warrants of privilege        A tall order Maybe but Mann asked all of usthose struggling with illness and the        presumably healthyto make societies as healthy as their individual members
