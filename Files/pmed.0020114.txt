                            There are  million cases of malaria each year worldwide causing one million deaths        Around  of these deaths occur in Africa mostly in young children One of the greatest        challenges facing Africa in the fight against malaria is drug resistance resistance to        chloroquine CQ the cheapest and most widely used antimalarial is common throughout        Africa and resistance to sulfadoxinepyrimethamine SP the firstdeveloped and least        expensive alternative to CQ is also increasing in eastern and southern Africa These        trends have forced many countries to change their treatment policies and use more expensive        drugs including drug combinations that will hopefully slow the development of resistance        One avenue of research is to identify combinations that minimize gametocyte emergence in        treated cases and prevent selective transmission of parasites resistant to any of the        partner drugs        In this months         PLoS Medicine Colin Sutherland and colleagues tested two leading        combination therapies in children with uncomplicated malaria One regimen was an        artemisininbased combination consisting of artemether and lumefantrine coartemether        trade names CoArtem and Riamet The other was a combination of CQ and SPcurrently under        consideration in several African countries largely due to its low cost In this        randomized controlled trial  children with acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria were        given either a combination of CQ and SP or six doses of coartemether  received CQSP        and  received coartemether and their blood was tested for infectivity to mosquitoes        seven days after treatment During follow up at seven  and  days the team found that        children treated with coartemether were significantly less likely to carry gametocytes in        their blood than children treated with CQ and SP compared with         Altogether the sixdose regimen of coartemether was highly effective at reducing the        prevalence and duration of gametocyte carriage The numbers of gametocytes and the        infectiousness to mosquitoes at day  were also reduced compared to a combination of CQ and        SP said the authors Other studies have already shown the potential of coartemether        combination therapy to both cure malaria and reduce gametocyte carriage acknowledged the        authors However this study is the first to demonstrate the treatments potential to        markedly reduce the infectiousness of patients to mosquitoes and has done so in a        subSaharan African setting with highly seasonal transmission and where asymptomatic        infections are common        Do the results mean coartemether should be introduced as a firstline treatment for        malaria in Africa The authors are hesitant and suggest there might be compliance issues        with the sixdose regimen The requirement of oily food for adequate absorption might also        lead to inadequate drug levels in the blood of many treated individuals        The authors suggest that coartemether as a firstline treatment is not likely to reduce        overall transmission of         Plasmodium falciparum within the community but rather would        reduce selective transmission of resistant parasites in treated patients Hence        coartemether could have a public health benefit by reducing the impact of drug        resistance
