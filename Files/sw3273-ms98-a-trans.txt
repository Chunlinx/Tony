                uh how do you feel about this topic   um i think its just fine  but um i just worry about some things that show up as drugs that arent like ive heard poppy seeds come up to be like opium i think theyre in the same family   right   and just little things like that that um you might get in big trouble for and just because you ate a roll with poppy seeds on it you know   right i understand completely you know i i feel the same way   umhum   you know i i believe in drug testing   umhum   you know theres nothing wrong with that because something like that if you work in some some types of some type of situations that makes it um makes you unmanageable or something like that that you could either hurt yourself or somebody else   umhum umhum   uh i might really agree with it you know if they tell you before you come into employment like when youre going to get hired   umhum umhum   you know i dont see anything wrong with them telling you that you might have to go through one and and then sometimes i have a hard time understanding the random   um   you know the ill pick you out and ill pick you out and ill pick you out   well random   and you go through the drug test   random i heard was to make it fair so they wouldnt think youre just picking on somebody   whats that now   ive just heard that the random testing like drawing a name out of a hat or whatever is just so they cant be accused of you know picking on someone in particular that theyre suspicious about you know   uhhuh uhhuh yeah thats true   but um because i work at a school and they were thinking about doing that   thats true were they   yeah but even though they were i mean whos to say its random or not you know   right and whos to say if its for sure   they could just uhhuh they could be saying its random and they could be not random   uhhuh   so   yeah where i   you cant prove prove that   yeah where i was hired they made us sign something saying that we could be um put through one at any time   huh   and we were like okay   umhum   but we did have to sign that   umhum   but um   well i just worry uh you know i dont care so much about well i mean they can theyll get fired whether they do their job or not you know if the drugs affect their job that much but   right   um i just worry about people that have jobs that could hurt other people like bus drivers and   right   stuff like that   or air traffic controllers   yeah exactly or pilots or   right or even somebody on a line you know that could run machinery or something like that   umhum umhum   yeah thats how i feel too   umhum   i dont know have you been in Dallas a long time or   umhum about twelve years   about twelve years   umhum   i just moved here and then South Dakota is very seldom   hum   that you see a drug test   umhum   but   i think like if you work in defense like i know people have had to have drug tests for that and   uhhuh   but then they have like a secret clearance   uhhuh   but um then i know people that work at um you know normal companies and   uhhuh   some do and some dont require drug testing you know if it affected the work they might you know wonder but its not required   because i was really surprised because i i go into my major is in accounting   umhum   and ive looked at an accounting positions   umhum   and definitely a  a position ive applied for has either come up   umhum   or you know they wont make you go through one   hum even to change position   which was a real surprise whats that   to change positions   no to get a position i just moved here in June   oh umhum   and uh from South Dakota and i was real you know shocked to here how many that did   umhum   you know from where im from its not that popular or that much i think   hum so a lot more here i guess because its a big big city or   yes yeah you know like Dallas has got more people than the whole state of South Dakota   and were closer to Mexico   yes  thats very true     uhhuh   and um you know i guess i never was awakened to it you know i knew it was out there but i knew you know i didnt know it was to a an extent   umhum   and uh im glad its there you know but um     umhum   it was just something that i come across that i wasnt really you know used to but you know i i feel fine with it you know thats not a problem   umhum umhum me neither     and uh   but im theres some people that i think theres a cheerleader thats suing a school for wanting to drug test her and i havent heard if shes going to win or not but um like a high school   uhhuh can high can a high school do that   but because hum   can a high school do that   um i think because it shes in the extracurricular thing cheerleading   uhhuh uhhuh   they they said they could but um i think shes going to try and use like the constitution against them   uhhuh   saying its an invasion of her privacy or something like that and  and i dont know she might win im not sure i havent heard   uhhuh yeah ive never heard of a high school asking a student to do that i guess   umhum   huh that is that in Dallas or   umhum umhum   thats in Dallas   oh the high school that shes from   yeah uhhuh   um no i think its out further west maybe California or something umhum   oh really huh   i thought see i teach so i thought you meant where i teach   oh you do teach   uhhuh in Richardson in Richardson   oh really   umhum   um my brother is the Admissions Director at UTD   hes the what   the Admissions Director for UTD   oh umhum   so i kind of know something about Richardson but   umhum   yeah   how neat so hes um decides if the students
