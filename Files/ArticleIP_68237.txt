attempting to cause strife between the Arabs and the Jews in Algiers Whenvisiting Washington Churchill fired off a series of telegrams to hisgovernment colleagues in London proposing in one of them that de Gaulle beeliminated as a political force He called the general a vain and evenmalignant man and added He hates England and has left a trail ofAnglophobia behind everywhere Roosevelt was a little kinder De Gaulle maybe an honest man but he has the messianic complex he wrote
