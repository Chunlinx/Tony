                            Adverse side effects viral resistance and the high cost of antiretroviral therapies        remain obstacles in the way of turning HIVAIDS into a manageable chronic disease        Structured treatment interruptions STIs in individuals who have good viral control on        therapy have been proposed as a strategy for overcoming these obstacles The initial hope        that STIs would help patients achieve greater viral control has so far not been supported        by data from clinical trials but interrupting treatment has also been proposed as a        strategy to reduce the cost of longterm therapy and drugassociated toxicity        Luis Montaner and colleagues now report results from a randomized trial of         participants  on their second to fourth regimen  on regimens containing        nonnucleoside reversetranscriptase inhibitors who received either continuous therapy for         weeks or three successive treatment interruptions of two four and six weeks followed        by a final openended interruption for both groups        The study was designed to be able to detect a difference of four weeks or greater        between the two groups for the time to viral rebound during the openended interruptionthe        primary outcome No difference between the two groups was seen median time for the group        on continuous treatment was four weeks and for the STI group was five weeks        Secondary outcomes included serious adverse events disease progression acute        retroviral syndrome therapy failure or opportunistic infections at any point in the        study changes in CD count on therapy immune reconstitution changes CD recall        responses and CD navememory T cell distribution and detection of viral mutations There        were no studyrelated serious adverse events in either group and no increase of therapy        failure in the STI arm CD counts fluctuated between the start and end of each monitored        treatment interruption but levels recovered after resuppression of virus with retention        of recall responses throughout Viral resistance was detected in both groups in seven of         patients in the continuous treatment group and ten of  patients in the STI group but        it was more commonly detected  versus  in the STI group during the openended final        interruption even though all subjects suppressed virus upon reinitiating the same        therapy        Possible risks and benefits of STIs remain controversial but data from this and other        published trials do not support shortterm clinical benefits of treatment interruptions        However because they do not see increased therapy failure and find preservation of immune        function in the STI group the authors conclude that in light of the possibility of        reducing costs and drugrelated toxicity additional trials of STIs are warranted        Particularly important in the debate over the safety of STIs is whether the detection of        resistant mutants should be of concern The authors point out that all participants were        able to resuppress the mutant virus when they resumed their previous drug regimens but        state that it remains undetermined to what extent resistant mutations are a signal for        future therapy failure Moreover viral replication and reboundwhich eventually occurred        in all participantsis seen by some researchers as inherently detrimental and these        experts argue that treatment interruptions are unsafe and their use should be        discontinued        What seems clear is that STIs have no place outside controlled clinical trials and that        questions regarding longterm safety remain unanswered At least a dozen additional trials        that examine STIs are currently recruiting patients and will help answer these        questions
