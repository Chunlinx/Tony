                    Introduction        RA is an autoimmune disease that is characterized by        persistent local and systemic inflammation            Aggressive forms of RA are thought to be driven by        Tlymphocyte activity leading to the rapid erosion of bone        and cartilage Activated Tm are found in the perivascular        regions of the inflamed synovium and T cells accumulate in        the synovial fluid     It appears that memory T        cells retain the potential to traffic through the synovium        and lymphatics and recirculate in the blood as evidenced        by the increased numbers of activated memory T cells found        in the blood of some RA patients     It is not        known however whether Tm migrate into the synovium and        undergo activation and further differentiation or whether        activation occurs in regional lymph nodes before migration        into the inflammatory site                In vitro studies    have        demonstrated that synovial CD T cells proliferate poorly        and produce decreased levels of IL in response to mitogen        or antigen as compared with peripheral blood T cells from        healthy individuals or RA patients Although such findings        suggest that synovial T cells might be partly anergic more        recent studies have indicated that the T cells found in the        RA synovium were postactivated cells Synovial T cells were        activated as assessed by expression of CD ligandCD        and were also efficient helpers for Bcell immunoglobulin        production       Previous studies in animal        models    suggested that a balance exists between        immunoregulatory IFNproducing Th cells and        ILproducing Th cells Dominance of either subset can        result in a chronic disease state Moreover induction of        Th cells in a Thmediated disease model of        collageninduced arthritis led to amelioration of        autoimmune disease   Thus it is possible that in RA        there is biased differentiation of IFNsecreting        proinflammatory Th CD T cells and insufficient        differentiation of immunoregulatory ILproducing Th        cells        Human memory T cells acquire the ability to secrete IL        late during         in vivo differentiation Our previous        studies and work by others have demonstrated that all of        the         in vivo differentiated ILproducing        T cells reside within the mature memory CDRO  CD         subset of CD T cells     Thus early memory        CDRO  CD  CD T cells cannot secrete IL after a        brief         in vitro stimulation Previous        studies    suggested that early memory T cells        represent an uncommitted precursor population from which        both ILproducing and IFNproducing effector cells can        be generated The RA synovium appears to contain an        increased number of phenotypically mature memory T cells as        compared with the blood However the majority of memory T        cells found in the synovium bear the phenotype of early Tm                 Therefore the present study was undertaken to examine        the cytokine effector status of synovial memory T cells and        the functional status of immature memory cell precursors of        cytokineproducing effector cells For these experiments        Tm were isolated from the blood of normal subjects and        from RAPB RASF and RAST Intracellular cytokine expression        was assessed by flow cytometry immediately after isolation        and a brief         in vitro stimulation or after         in vitro priming designed to generate        ILproducing effector T cells        The results suggest that a deficiency in the generation        of adequate numbers of regulatory ILproducing effector        cells in the synovium might be a contributing factor to the        perpetuation of chronic inflammation                    Materials and methods                  Antibodies

The data shown          were obtained from  RA patients age range           years Matching blood and synovial fluid were obtained          from six patients Peripheral blood alone was obtained

 Results                  Enrichment of IFNgamma producers in freshly          isolated RA synovial CD CDRO T cells          Initial experiments delineated cytokine production by          freshly isolated CD CDRO T cells obtained from          matching samples of RAPB and RASF A representative          sample is shown in Fig RA patient The majority of          peripheral blood T cells from RA patients secreted IL          alone whereas fewer cells secreted IFN alone or in          combination with IL By contrast the CD T cells          isolated from the synovial fluid demonstrated a          significant increase in the percentage of cells that          produced IFN alone or in combination with IL whereas          a decrease was observed in the percentage of cells that          secreted IL alone Few cells from peripheral blood or          synovial fluid produced IL          Matching samples obtained from the peripheral blood          and synovial tissue of RA patients were also assessed for          cytokine expression Fig  RA patient  As was          observed in the synovial fluid memory T cells isolated          from the synovial tissue contained a decreased percentage          of ILproducing cells and an increased percentage of          IFNproducing cells Thus T cells isolated from the          rheumatoid synovial tissue and fluid demonstrated a          polarized Th cytokine profile          As a control the cytokine profiles of Tm from normal          adult volunteers were examined Fig  normal As          observed for blood from RA patients the majority of          cells produced IL alone whereas fewer cells produced          the combination of IL and IFN Relatively infrequent          cells expressed a highly polarized phenotype by producing          either IFN alone or IL alone          A compilation of the frequency of cells that produced          each cytokine from a number of donors is shown in Fig           After a brief           in vitro stimulation the majority          of Tm obtained from normal donors            n   produced IL alone             mean  SEM Fewer cells produced the combination of          IL and IFN    Relatively infrequent cells          expressed a highly polarized phenotype by producing          either IFN    or IL alone    Less than           of the cells produced the combination of IFN and          IL          Cytokine secretion profiles of freshly isolated Tm          obtained from RAPB            n   also demonstrated that most          secreted IL alone    whereas fewer cells          produced IL in combination with IFN    There          was no significant difference between the normal T cells          and RA T cells for these two groups Of note there was a          significant            P   increase in the          percentage of cells that secreted IFN alone compared          with normal cells    versus    whereas there          was no difference between normal blood and RAPB in the          number of cells that secreted IL alone    or in          the frequency of those rare cells that produced the          combination of IL and IFN             There was a significant decrease in the number of          cells isolated from RASF            n   that produced IL alone             when compared with normal blood            P   or RAPB            P   T cells Moreover an          increase was observed in the number of cells that          secreted the combination of IL and IFN             which was significantly greater than the percentage of          the same subset in normal blood            P   or RAPB            P   The percentage of          RASF cells that produced IFN alone    was also          significantly increased over the percentage of such cells          in normal blood            P   or RAPB            P   T cells          Significantly fewer cells produced IL alone    as          compared with normal blood            P   or RAPB            P   T cells whereas no          significant difference was observed in the number of          cells that produced the combination of IL and IFN                      RAST Tm            n   also contained a decreased          percentage of ILsecreting cells    which did          not differ significantly from that in the RASF but did          differ significantly from that in normal blood            P   and RAPB            P   The percentage of          cells that produced both IFN and IL    did not          differ significantly from that in RASF but was          significantly greater than the frequencies observed in          normal blood            P   or RAPB            P   In RAST    of          cytokine effectors secreted IFN alone This was not          different from the percentage found in RASF but was          significantly greater than the percentage of          IFNproducing cells in normal blood            P   or RAPB            P   There was no          significant difference in the number of synovial tissue          cells that produced IL alone    or IL and IFN             as compared with RASF normal blood or          RAPB          Thus T cells isolated from RAST and RASF demonstrated          a decrease in ILproducing cells with a concomitant          increase in IFNproducing cells when compared with          normal blood and RAPB Tm                          Rheumatoid CD T cells demonstrate defective          responsiveness to differentiation signals in vitro          Peripheral blood and synovial Tm were than examined in          an           in vitro culture system in order to          determine the relative capacity of differentiation          signals to modulate cytokine production Our previous          studies with normal T cells   demonstrated that this          system effectively generates polarized IFNproducing or          ILproducing effector cells Fig shows the composite          cytokine profiles of CD  CDRO T cells obtained from          cultures primed with antiCD and cytokines in the          absence or presence of antiCD mAb As seen in Fig           stimulation of normal T cells after priming with          antiCD alone resulted in a significant decrease in the          percentage of IL producers  versus  compared          with cells immediately stimulated after isolation and a          significant increase in the percentages of IFN           versus  and IL producers  versus  After          priming with a low dose of antiCD Fig  middle          panel the percentage of IL producers decreased          further and the percentage of IFNsecreting cells          increased As previously shown the generation of          ILsecreting cells was optimally induced by priming          with antiCD alone and was inhibited by costimulation          with antiCD mAb            T cells derived from RAPB demonstrated a distinct          pattern of responsiveness Whereas the percentage of          ILsecreting cells decreased after           in vitro priming with antiCD as          compared with freshly isolated cells  versus  a          greater decrease was observed after priming with low dose          antiCD  and the cells were resistant to further          modulation by higher concentrations of antiCD Of note          the loss of IL production by           in vitro primed RA T cells was less          marked than observed with normal T cells An increased          percentage of IFN producers was observed after priming          and the peak response was achieved in the presence of low          concentrations of antiCD  versus  Again the          induction of IFN production in RAPB memory T cells was          less than noted in normal blood ILproducing cells          were generated from RA memory T cells by stimulation with          antiCD and these were inhibited by the presence of          antiCD mAb The percentage of IL producers           generated from RA memory T cells was less than was          generated from normal T cells           T cells from RASF primed with antiCD exhibited a          decrease in the percentage of ILproducing cells           versus  and an increase in the percentage of IFN          secreting cells  versus  as compared with freshly          isolated cells Synovial fluid T cells were deficient in          the ability to generate ILproducing cells  which          was in contrast to the blood Whereas RAPB T cells were          refractory to priming by high concentrations of antiCD          mAb the synovial fluid T cells responded to antiCD in          a dosedependent manner T cells derived from synovial          tissue were also relatively refractory to           in vitro priming as compared with          normal blood T cells Synovial tissue T cells contained          an increased percentage of IL producers  versus           and a small decrease in IFN producers  versus           after           in vitro priming with antiCD          Importantly ILsecreting cells  versus  could be          generated from synovial tissue memory T cells after           in vitro differentiation although          in lesser numbers than from RAPB and normal blood          Priming in the presence of antiCD reduced the          percentages of ILproducing and ILproducing cells          while increasing the percentage of IFNsecreting          cells                          Effect of antiIFNgamma antibody on the          generation of ILsecreting effector cells from RA          synovial fluid T cells          In order to determine whether cytokine production by          rheumatoid T cells was resistant to modulation in the           in vitro priming cultures because          of the secretion of IFN the           in vitro priming was also carried          out in the presence of antiIFN antibody As shown in          Fig  the addition of increasing concentrations of a          neutralizing antibody to IFN had little effect on the          generation of cytokineproducing cells from either normal          synovial fluid or RASF CD T cells Then we examined          whether the combined effects of antiIFN antibody and          IL could influence the effector phenotype of cells          isolated from the synovium As shown in Table  Tm were          isolated from matching RAPB and RASF and were cultured          under conditions that optimized the generation of          ILsecreting effector cells   RAPB Tm generated a          marked increase in the percentage of ILproducing cells          when primed with the combination of IL and antiIFN          antibody In contrast T cells from the synovial fluid of          the same patient generated virtually no ILproducing          cells and few ILproducing cells despite supplemental          IL and antiIFN antibody          As a control cell growth during the priming cultures          was monitored in the presence or absence of antibody to          IFN and IL As shown in Fig  synovial Tcell          growth was not inhibited by the addition of antiIFN          antibody or IL These data suggest that RAPB Tm have          the capacity to generate ILproducing or          IFNproducing effector cells whereas memory T cells          from RASF are inhibited in their capacity to become          ILproducing effector cells Further studies indicated          that antiCD mAb and cytokines enhanced synovial fluid          Tm growth approximately fourfold above the initial input          cell number Synovial fluid T cells cultured in medium          alone underwent a fourfold reduction in cell number          whereas cells cultured with cytokines alone increased in          number by an average of twofold data not shown These          data further support the conclusion that synovial fluid T          cells were responsive to signals delivered by the          combination of antiCD and cytokines                            Discussion        RAST and RASF were deficient in ILsecreting cells as        compared with RAPB after a brief         in vitro stimulation Thus mature        ILsecreting effector cells were found to be decreased in        the RA synovium but not in the blood        There are at least three major mechanisms by which IL        production might be inhibited in the RA synovium One        mechanism could be through the selective recruitment of        IFNproducing effector cells For example it has been        suggested that the T cells found in the RA synovium have        been selectively recruited on the basis of expression of        chemokine receptors   Thus T cells found in the        rheumatoid synovium express CCR whereas T cells found at        sites of parasitic infection express CCR and CCR           However the role of chemokine receptor expression in        the recruitment of T cells to these sites is unknown This        possibility cannot be the full explanation of the current        observations in light of the finding that synovial tissue T        cells had the capacity to differentiate into ILsecreting        effector cells in         in vitro cultures Thus some        synovial cells remained responsive to IL and        antiCDmediated signaling in the priming cultures A        second mechanism for suppression of IL production in the        rheumatoid synovium could be through regulatory signals        received in the local microenvironment This remains a        likely possibility because studies in murine models have        shown that only the most highly differentiated T cells        obtain a polarized cytokine secretion profile that cannot        be altered by external stimuli   A third possibility        is that precursor cells of IL producers rapidly migrate        out of the synovium perhaps being unresponsive to        retention signals        Although the exact mechanism that is operative in the RA        synovium remains to be elucidated our ongoing studies are        focused on determining the phenotype and response defect of        these highly polarized Th cells        Tm isolated from rheumatoid blood or synovium contained        increased numbers of cells with the capacity to produce        IFN after a brief         in vitro stimulation compared with        the same subset isolated from the periphery of normal        donors A strong mitogenic stimulation was employed in        order to obtain the maximum cytokinesecreting potential of        the effector population We have previously demonstrated        that staining for intracellular cytokines correlated with        cytokine secretion   However intracellular cytokine        analysis proved to be a more sensitive method for detecting        cytokines such as IL and IL and also made it possible        to determine the percentage of cells producing each It        should be noted that longer incubations did not result in a        substantial increase in the number of cytokinesecreting        cells detected in this assay These studies corroborate        previous studies that demonstrated that synovial T cells        are enriched in IFNproducing cells on initial isolation          The results suggest that these memory cells appear        to have undergone biased differentiation into Th cells        perhaps as a result of signals received in the synovial        microenvironment The small increase in the number of        IFNproducing cells found in rheumatoid blood may well        reflect the recirculation of memory T cells previously        activated in the blood           Tm were used for these studies because it has been shown           that the majority of CD cells in the RA synovium        are of the memory subset Therefore a potential concern        was that the         in vitro priming protocol might        select for cells that are already committed to IFN or        IL production rather than generate new effector cells        In humans however highly polarized effector T cells arise        late in the differentiation pathway     Whereas        early memory T cells identified by the CDRO  CD        phenotype have the potential to secrete IL and IFN        these cells cannot produce IL and few produce IFN in        the absence of IL    Only mature memory cells        identified by the presence of CDRO and the loss of CD        cellsurface expression have the capacity to secrete IFN        or IL alone We have previously shown that the         in vitro priming protocol used in the        present study induces the differentiation of early        uncommitted CD  CD memory T cells into ILproducing        effector cells   Thus it was hypothesized that the        uncommitted early CD  CD memory cells that were        isolated from the RA synovium or blood maintained the        capacity to differentiate into ILproducing effector        cells The majority of T cells that are found in the RA        synovium belong to the early memory subset   Therefore        the defective generation of IL producers from RA synovial        fluid under conditions that induced ILproducing effector        cells from blood memory T cells suggested that the        rheumatoid microenviroment played an important role in        selecting or modifying the precursor effector memory        population        CD is expressed by most human T cells and is thought        to be critical for Tcell differentiation CD is also        important during Tcell receptormediated activation IL        production and the prevention of anergy   Recent        studies     have indicated that there were        increased numbers of CD  CD T cells in the periphery        and synovium of RA patients Therefore the lack of        expression of CD on RA CD T cells represented a        potential explanation for the abnormal memory Tcell        differentiation observed in RA blood and tissue and the        deficiency in ILproducing effector cells from the        synovial fluid after         in vitro priming However CD         CD cells are a minor subset of T cells representing        less than  of peripheral CD T cells from the most        chronically active RA patients versus less than  from        healthy control individuals   and are therefore        unlikely to account for the broad defect in memory Tcell        differentiation found here We have observed that CD         CD cells in the periphery represent a unique subset that        is restricted to the CD  CD population Davis L        unpublished observation As noted above although there        were increased numbers of welldifferentiated CD  CD        cells in the RA synovium these cells represented the        minority of Tm   Therefore the inability to modulate        effector cell responses in RASF samples could not be        explained by the absence of CD Moreover RASF T cells        were capable of cell growth in response to antiCD mAbs        and cytokines This finding is in agreement with previous        studies   demonstrating that the CD signaling pathway        was intact in RA synovial CD T cells        The present studies also demonstrated that synovial        fluid Tm lacked the capacity to generate ILsecreting        effector cells in numbers similar to those found in the        periphery Our previous studies   demonstrated that        IL was required during the         in vitro priming cultures to generate        ILproducing effector cells from nonILproducing early        memory precursor cells Therefore one concern in the        current studies was that RA T cells might require exogenous        IL to generate ILproducing effector cells        An additional concern was that IFNproducing effector        cells might inhibit potential IL precursors from        differentiating or expanding in these cultures although        previous studies     demonstrated that IFN        indirectly affected the generation of ILsecreting cells        through the activities of antigenpresenting cells It        should be noted that antigenpresenting cells were depleted        from the memory Tcell population before priming in the        present studies and therefore this possibility was only a        minor concern        Both the addition of IL to the priming cultures and        the presence of antiIFN antibody ensured that potential        ILsecreting precursor populations had optimal conditions        for differentiation Blocking IFN activity during         in vitro priming with a neutralizing        antiIFN antibody had little effect on the number of        IFNsecreting effector cells detected on subsequent        restimulation Moreover the availability of IFN had        little impact on the generation of either subset Thus the        inability to generate ILproducing effector cells from        RASF precursor cells was not simply explained by the        presence of IFNproducing effector cells or the lack of a        subset of fully differentiated ILproducing T cells in        the initial memory cell population Recent studies          have suggested that there is an intrinsic defect in the        development of ILproducing effector cells in RA        patients Therefore it is possible that the apparent        disordered differentiation of effector cells becomes more        marked at inflammatory sites such as in the rheumatoid        synovium           It is interesting to note that both IL production and        IL production appear to be downregulated in RASF T cells        Previous studies   have shown that mature memory CDRO         CD  CD T cells isolated from the blood have the        same capacity as early memory CDRO  CD  CD T        cells to produce IL In the RA synovium IL appears to        be downregulated   It should be noted that IL        production was not decreased in T cells obtained from        osteoarthritic joints   In addition Tm obtained from        other tissues such as inflamed tonsil expressed levels of        IL that were similar to those in blood Davis L        unpublished observation Therefore migration into tissue         per se does not induce downregulation        of IL production Recent studies   have attributed        the lack of IL production by synovial CD T cells to a        defect in the Tcell receptormediated signal transduction        cascade However in the present studies we made use of        stimuli that bypassed the early steps in the Tcell        receptormediated signaling cascade and found that there        was defective IL production in cells stimulated        immediately on isolation from the RA synovium whereas        these same cells were completely competent for IFN        production Thus it is interesting to speculate that IL        and IL are downregulated in the rheumatoid synovium by        some active repressor mechanism induced by the synovial        microenvironment Although recent studies have indicated        that redox balance alterations were critical in determining        whether cells can produce IL    it is not known        whether this influences IL production or has it been        determined whether readjustment of redox balance in RA        synovial T cells could correct the deficiency in IL        Few studies have used similar techniques to assess        cytokine production in blood synovial tissue and synovial        fluid obtained from RA patients Immunohistology is        routinely carried out on synovial tissue sections whereas        enzymelinked immunosorbent assays are employed to        determine cytokine profiles of serum and synovial fluid              Therefore it has remained difficult to        determine the potential impact of these compartments on        Tcell function in rheumatoid inflammation In the current        studies RA T cells from all three compartments produced        increased amounts of IFN on immediate stimulation        However the cytokine profiles diverged when assessed after                in vitro priming Whereas synovial        tissue Tm were deficient in IL producers compared with        matching blood these cells retained the ability to        generate ILproducing effector cells In this regard        recent studies   have suggested that synovial tissue        cells were selectively responsive to IL produced in the        synovium because IL induced increased production of        IFN but not IL and IL Those studies support the        hypothesis that the synovial microenvironment may play a        role in skewing T cells toward a Th phenotype The finding        that ILproducing effector cells could be generated from        synovial tissue T cells once removed from that environment        suggests that all of the cells were not yet terminally        polarized to Thlike effector cells Importantly synovial        fluid T cells appeared to have been more affected by the        synovial microenvironment than synovial tissue T cells        because regardless of the         in vitro priming conditions these        cells yielded increased percentages of IFN producers and        were deficient in IL producers        The present data suggest that synovial fluid T cells are        those that have passed through the synovium whereas        synovial tissue T cells are a mixed population of recently        migrated cells and those that have been retained in the        synovium Whether the inability of synovial fluid memory T        cells to generate IL producers is the result of        activation differentiation or prolonged exposure to the        synovial microenvironment the data clearly indicate that a        majority of synovial fluid memory T cells appear to be        polarized IFN effector cells        In summary the present studies show that RA blood and        synovial T cells contain increased numbers of polarized        IFN effector cells RA synovial T cells also demonstrated        a deficiency in the ability to generate ILproducing        effector cells The diminished ability to generate IL        effector cells from synovial T cells         in vitro suggests that the rheumatoid        microenvironment alters Tcell effector function and        thereby perpetuates the chronic inflammatory disease        state
