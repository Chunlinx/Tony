                                  SethGets Smoked                        I normally find                  Slate               s work to be analytically sound and faithful to the factsHowever Seth Stevensons High and Mighty of July  could not be more inaccurate            First to suggest that theproblem with heroin is that it is illegalforcing addicts into criminalityisdead wrong Heroin is criminal because it is deadly not vice versa The vastmajority of heroin addicts criminality aside cannot adequately sustainthemselves in society For this reason heroin maintenance programs inSwitzerland have been forced to create a government subsidized job categoryprofessional addict The Swiss give these addicts not just heroin but asalary housing medical care and in many cases even a dog and money tosupport the dog Why Because these addicts cannot hold down a job and formany heroin is deadly            If children see what heroinuse is really likenot the somewhat benign face Stevenson puts on ittheywont use this deadly drug To this end one of the other ads in the NationalYouth AntiDrug Media Campaign shows an attractive woman who as the ad rollsbegins to strip away her makeup She ages before your eyes becomingincreasingly haggard and ill looking Finally she removes her artificialteethone of the outcomes of heroin use is the loss of teethand she showsjust how glamorous heroin use is not This is real life            Second Stevensons repeatedreferences to marijuana are medically inaccurate Take a look at recent medicalevidence            A PET brain scan of aregular marijuana user shows that marijuana changes the chemistry of the brainto render vast sections of the brain less active Moreover marijuana smokecontains countless known carcinogens and the lung smoking of marijuana toachieve a high adds to the problemthe smoking equivalent of mainlining cancerinto your body Smoking just five or more joints a day produces the same lungdiseases as smoking a full pack of  cigarettes a day            However it doesnt endthere Babies born to mothers who smoke marijuana during pregnancy have anelevenfold increase in nonlymphoblastic leukemia The most consistent findingfrom the literature on employee marijuana use is its association with increasedabsenteeism It is also associated with increased accidents higher turnoverlow job satisfaction counterproductive behavior withdrawal and antagonisticbehaviors and higher use of employee assistance programs and medicalbenefits            Stevenson alsomisunderstands the current ad campaign The author says the campaign targetschildren and he is right However the campaign is also largely focused onadults One of the core messages of the campaign is that parents and otheradult mentors need to talk to children about the real dangers of drug use            The onearea where Stevenson has it correct is that it is increasingly hard to educateyoung people about the real dangers of drug use Unfortunately for all hiscouching language Drugs can be awful and care the author is part of theproblem not the solution Inaccuracies like those discussed above whichdownplay the dangers in drug use send our young people mixed messages andincrease distrust Against this backdrop it is easy for young people to not buythe facts about drugs The bottom line is We can disagree about policies in ademocracy however our disagreements should be based on facts This articlelargely failed that measure             RobertHousman Chief policy adviser Strategic Planning Office of National DrugControl Policy                           SethStevenson responds                                       I applaud RobertHousmans lust for facts No one benefits from propaganda based on scaretactics rather than the truth                                       But Housmans facts arenot facts and his assumptions are misleading While his claims of increasedchild cancer rates have been refuted see the excellent Marijuana MythsMarijuana Facts for a debunking of the study that produced this figure anddirect refutations of each of Housmans other factual claims they are moreimportant irrelevant Obviously pregnant women should not smoke potjust asthey should not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol As for Housmans litany onemployee marijuana use each of those effects increased absenteeismincreased accidents higher turnover low job satisfaction etc will show uptenfold in relation to employee alcohol use Without doubt constantintoxication of any form will hurt ones work capacity And then this Smokingjust five or more joints a day produces the same lung diseases as smoking afull pack of  cigarettes a day Funny I dont see the government arrestingpackaday cigarette smokers or lobbying to criminalize tobacco                                       To besure there are real dangers of drug use just as there are real dangers ofalcohol and tobacco use Lets be honest with our kids about all of theminstead of terrorizing them with exaggerations and lies                                       TheStraight Dope                        While youwrite eloquently regarding your controlled drug

Seth Stevensons High and Mightypractically endorses legalization of heroin and the free use of marijuana amongteenagers In the article you mentioned how Republicans are hypocritical intheir diatribes against illegal drugs and their resistance to slamming BigTobacco From a perspective you have a point but I would rather be busykeeping an illegal  dangerous substance out of the reach of my kids thanjumping on the bandwagon to tax the crap out of my fellow citizens who smoke alegal substance I also would rather see my coworkers smoke cigarettesthan use marijuana or heroin Marijuana alters the brains chemistry to producehallucinogenic effects while nicotine only satisfies the addiction thesmokers body feels Would you want the person driving behind you to be high onmarijuana or on nicotine The chances of himher plowing into you while underthe influence of nicotine are far less than being high on marijuana            Heroin isa drug that can kill you on the very first try and most heroin addicts didntstart out shooting up with needlesthey were smoking pot as teenagers             Scott Hicks                                       RealityCheck                        Re SethStevensons

someone who no onewould have ever thought to have been a drug user Personally I dont give aflip what kind of action anyone takes to warn people against the use of drugsbecause they are killers

teacherwhich is surely the profession most indoctrinatedwith antidrug propagandain a small Texas town For me theres an inherentstupidity in the absoluteness of the Just Say No campaign which insists thatdrugs and alcohol are completely intolerable in a society where bothespecially the latter are so prevalent How can we preach such an absolutemessage to kids all day at school or on television and expect them to ignoreour social behaviors every evening It has become uncomfortable for mom and dadto enjoy a beer or cocktail at the end of the day lest junior regale them withthe evils of drug and alcohol use Whats wrong with a society where supposedlyrational adults have to sneak around to enjoy a drink within the walls oftheir own home             Pam Ferguson

presidentialprotection has become absurd but even Plotz fails to ask outright the mostimportant question What makes the presidents life so valuable In ademocracy after all citizens lives are supposed to be equally valuableDuring the Cold War it was feared that a presidential assassination might setoff a nuclear exchange so by protecting the president the Secret Service wasat least arguably protecting us all But nobody worries about that sort ofthing nowadays and yet the president is more tightly protected than at theheight of the Cold War Perhaps the Secret Service is really protecting

can muster about Patrick Quigleys July  article Server Time Out isthat he is simply ignorant of the facts of rural life            In conservative Texas wehave a Telecommunications Infrastructure Fund for schools and librariesdreamed up by a Republican state senator among others that antedates theerate and is far more generous with the telcos money            I work for a public librarysystem in central Texas not even the most rural part of the state with members My system and the Texas State Library provide access to a number ofrather expensive databases that few libraries can afford to purchase on theirown The smaller poorer libraries benefit most as their communities wouldotherwise not have access to such resources The most costeffective way todeliver this service to our libraries is via the Internet            I have spent a good part ofthe past several weeks trying to get any kind of non Internet accessfor two of our libraries that have the misfortune of not having an ISP in theirlocal calling area Ironically thanks to the heavy hand of big bad stategovernment they can get an affordable ISDN line but as ISPs are notregulated there are no ISPs where the ISDN lines terminate            Quigley should try gettingDirecPC out in the boonies In the first place getting service at the rate hequotes requires a dialup phone line connection to an ISP for the upstream linkthere is a muchhigherpriced twoway service Second while in theoryHughes provides a DirecPC LAN service TIF generously provided two computersfor these libraries I asked several times for pricing and conditions back inApril and I still havent heard anything more than that it would probably beseveral hundred dollars            In short while the marketprobably will work quite well in providing good telecommunications in denseurban areas very little has changed over the past few years in the rural areasI work with I stopped believing the hype about satellite cable or xDSLrollouts in rural areas some time back            I cantresist saying it Quigley is an armchair theorist spouting snide opinions aboutcircumstances of which he obviously has little firsthand knowledge His letthem eat cake attitude is insulting and offensive             Bob GainesCentral Texas Library System                           PatrickQuigley responds                                       I findit upsetting that someone could so quickly lose faith in the possibility oftechnological innovation in an industry that has been around for less than sixyears While it seems as if all our technological problems would be solved ifwe simply regulated the industry let me remind you that it took at least sixyears for even the VHSBetamax argument to be solved Economists everywherewould frown on the idea of ghettoizing an industry that is only in itsinfancyto do so would irrevocably cripple its progress and make thepossibility of lower costs almost nonexistent Your complaints eg no localISPs lack of choice in satellite technology are exactly the reasons that theerate would not work Without these innovations which only the market canproduce the Internet connection cost will remain exorbitant even with theerate discounts Second the assumption that the Internet industry will allbut ignore the needs of the rural population is absurd The latest censusfigures show that  percent of the US population lives in rural areastosuggest that the industry will ignore almost one quarter of the US market isinane at best                                       Addressyour email to the editors to
