            okay   uh do you have any particular um ideas about our funding of AIDS research   yes yes i think its important that we uh either make a special tax for it or implement the money toward that away from other areas its going to be such an amazing insurmountable insurmountable you cant even imagine the cost its going to cost to take care of these people and and if they can find a resource of course they can cut the pain and suffering but if anything the cost theyre going to save a well fortune just implementing that money toward that   do you think its more important than cancer or something else simply because the the numbers are so large   yes i do oh well cancer the numbers are larger   okay   um however AIDS has the opportunity to become to become larger than cancer within a very quick time   because my thought leads to you know i have uh school age kids   umhum   uh i think a a a good amount of money ought to go to the education which they they doing seem to be doing   umhum i i agree   uh because i think you want to stop it before it gets to you know its not the kind of thing you can reverse if youve got to stop it before it starts   umhum   something inside inside me upsets me to think that therere therere lots of diseases in in my husbands family theres a genetic disease   umhum   why arent people making a stink about that and you know and curing you know making this gung ho rally to cure that   i think its because the sheer numbers i really think its that   its a scare also   it is uh AIDS is a major topic right now its trendy in the news its in everybodys point of view but until youve really worked with it and seen it thats thats the difference it is it is   oh im sure its devastating and and there there is a real scare scare a real fear you dont know     umhum     you know how dangerous it could be i had answered a uh job ad for we have a local VA hospital down here   umhum   and they said they needed a lab assistant and im working parttime now im a substitute teacher   right   uh but you know i get called sporadically and they needed this lab assistance in the neighborhood and said you didnt have to have experience im really an artist but i figured oh you know ill find out what it is and she she very casually said well think about whether you want to this because there are lab animals and blah blah blah and the um you might be exposed to AIDS in the animals but you know youd have gloves and this and that and it did make me flinch it did make me not want to do that   well i remember the first time i worked with an AIDS patient i was terrified i have to admit it and i know educationally wise everything im supposed to know   imagine how they feel right   and it still scared me   sure but i get you know these these were lab animals im not crazy about rats to begin with i mean but heres humans and you can feel compassion for them   thats true but youd be surprised how many nurses dont   oh i dont know   it im not kidding i   yeah i guess it people will do anything you know just because its a job and they have to make a salary but   i i work in a public a county hospital and uh well first of all most of those nurses there are LVNs because the pay is bad for them   uhhuh   and they dont they dont have many RNs and very few BSNs   hm   so   the care is shoddy   the care is shoddy yes uh the compassion is low the hours are long and theres a lot of people so they tend to isolate them and leave them for a large amount   right yeah how can you feel when theres a sign on your door you know i is it   huh   there theres usually a sign on the door saying quarantined or something you know or     yes theyre in isolation   sure   they certainly are   im sure a big part of it is uh they they suffer mentally as well as physically   they definitely do they definitely do   yeah you know it it just when i when i see a headline that says that were giving twenty five billion to Russia because you know they need to eat better and then weve got so many problems at home   i know and we our debt i im just so concerned   what where is this you know my husband says well theyre printing up more you know i dont know where where is it coming from do they ask us   i know where are they spending it i know       who who are i mean where are they spending this money you know   well i dont know how we could spend it when we owe so much i dont understand   me either   you know you would think it balances you know you dont have it you cant spend it but we seem to its a mystery   umhum yes we do yes we do   uh so i guess youre saying you think we should spend more for AIDS research   um i   im not i dont really know what we are spending actually   uh thats exactly what i was going to say i dont really know how much were spending it may be one of those things that takes twenty years to find anyway or fifty   well well i hate to think theres a you know it seems that anytime a bureaucracy works on something they waste a lot of money on administration costs   oh i know   and a study of how to do this can cost millions of dollars     instead of just trying it     right right uh     i dont know um   i imagine
