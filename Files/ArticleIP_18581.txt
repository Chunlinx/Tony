                                  Win Place and No            Sandra LoosemoreCBS SportsLines figure skating writer  has a missionShe wants to overturn the sports new scoring system            The traditional system came under fire after theGreat FlipFlop of  at the European Championships In the mensfreeskating event five competitors had skated and the first three placeswere held by Alexei Urmanov Viacheslav Zagorodniuk and Philippe Candeloro inthat order The final contestant Andrejs Vlascenko placed dead lastbut inthe process he managed to bump Candeloro up to second place denyingZagorodniuk a silver medal            For Loosemoresexplanation of how the old scoring system worked and how it caused the GreatFlipFlop click here             International Skating Union Chairman Ottavio Cinquantadecreed after the championship that the scoring system must be revised toprevent flipflops When the new system was announced in July  Cinquantarejoiced that the problem was solved so that henceforth if you are in frontof me you will remain in front of me            Loosemore has raisedseveral cogent objections to the new system First it is more complicated thanthe old system Second contrary to Cinquanta it wont stop flipflops Infact Loosemores computer simulations suggest that it will make flipflopsmore common not less            What should the ISU do Economist Kenneth Arrow hacked thisproblem five decades ago with his Arrow Impossibility Theorem which provesthat no reasonable scoring system can preclude flipflops The wordreasonable incorporates the ISUs commitment to basing final outcomes only onthe order in which the judges have ranked the contestants rather than on theirexplicit numerical scores            When Arrow was layingthe foundations for his future Nobel Prize he was concerned not with rankingfigure skaters but with ranking social priorities But Professor Michael Stobof Calvin College points out that the problems are identical Judges maydisagree about whether Zagorodniuk is better than Candeloro Voters maydisagree about whether a Star Wars defense system is better than a tax cut Inorder to name winners the ISU needs a scoring system to amalgamate the judgesopinions into a single ranking In order to take political action the UnitedStates needs a social choice mechanism to amalgamate voters many preferencesinto a single list of priorities            It might appear that the United States can afford moreambiguity than the ISU Members of Congress can get away with cheerfullyendorsing multiple conflicting goals and declaring them all top prioritieswhereas at the end of the day the ISU must declare who gets the gold who getsthe silver and who gets the bronze But the fact is that at the end of theday political decisions do get made as surely as skating medalists getchosen The government either cuts taxes or it doesnt Although the politicalprocess is far more complex than anything the ISU might devise the decisionsit arrives at are just as unambiguous            Arrow set forth two desiderata for any social choicemechanism First unanimity when it occurs should be respected If all thejudges rate Zagorodniuk ahead of Candeloro then Zagorodniuk should come inahead of Candeloro If  percent of the voters prefer Clinton to Dole thenDole should not be president This criterion is the easy one I doubt that anysport or any polity has ever violated it            Arrows second dictum isthat there should be no flipflops If A ranks ahead of B then the entry of athird candidate C should not overturn that ranking Simple majority votingfor example notoriously violates the noflipflop criterion Its easy toimagine an election where Clinton is initially ahead of Dole but a third partyentry by say Jesse Jackson pushes Dole ahead of Clinton This can happeneven when Jackson runs a distant third as long as he takes more votes fromClinton than from Dole Arrows goal was to eliminate such anomalies with amore sophisticated voting system            With a bit of elementary mathematics and a lot of keeninsight Arrow was forced to a sobering conclusion If a reasonable votingsystem is one that respects unanimity and precludes flipflops then thereare no reasonable voting systems with one exceptionthe system thatpicks one voter and makes him a dictator            In figure skating thatmeans the only system that could satisfy Cinquanta is a system with only onejudge Actually you could have as many judges as you wanted as long as youignored all but one of them In politics it means that if you cant tolerateflipflops youd better start getting comfortable with absolutedictatorship            Is there any way around Arrows dire conclusion Well hisproof does leave one loophole If the number of voters is literally infinitethen the conclusion can be overturned In that case there arenondictatorial voting systems that both respect unanimity and eliminateflipflops However and this can be proved mathematically although suchsystems exist none of them can be explicitly described This observation seemsunlikely to be applicable either to figure skating or to constitutionalgovernment            Another avenue is toobserve that although every reasonable system allows flipflops some allowmore flipflops than othersand we can try to design a system that allows asfew as possible Loosemore argues that the old scoring system is superior inthis respect while Cinquanta asserts the opposite I havent studied the issueclosely enough to take a firm stand but based on what Ive seen my money ison Loosemore            A third approach is to accept flipflops as part of lifeand get on with designing a voting system that meets other reasonablecriteria But the people who get excited about this kind of project tend to getcarried away In  the American Mathematical Society wanted to elect aslate of four officers from a list of eight candidates The rules for countingballots filledin the words of the societys secretarythirtythree pages ofdefinitions rules interpretations and examples Having supplied memberswith a summary of those rules the secretary felt compelled to append thisnote Please do NOT correspond with the writer about the ambiguities that areunresolved in the above abbreviated description Instead refer to AppendicesIV and V where eleven pages of rules appear to leave no ambiguities            Loosemore might not like Cinquantas new scoringsystem but she can be thankful that it wasnt designed by the AmericanMathematical Society
