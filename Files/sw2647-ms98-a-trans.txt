          okay i guess ill start um one uh big thing that the advise that i would give to a parent to give to his or her child is to let their let their child experience college in a kind of general sense i like large colleges because i went to University of Texas at Austin they have fifty thousand students there and i feel like that now if i went if i had gone to a small college that only had a couple of thousand that i wouldnt have have gotten as much exposure to different people and different uh i dont know different languages different cultures and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students   thats interesting i went to a smaller school  of probably three thousand thirty five hundred and i i i thought that was the best experience in that   umhum uhhuh umhum   we had more oneonone since we seemed to know everyone on campus and we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and   hum   and backgrounds and so forth so i thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number um   hm umhum   one of fifty thousand i was one of three thousand and and you know different perspectives i uh but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of sort of thing   right umhum yeah yeah yeah i i could see i could see that point i could see how it would be im sure your classes were a lot smaller um because like we would have biology classes that did main courses that everyone has to take i mean hundreds of students in this class so actually yes you were a number   yeah   but um i i just i dont know im thinking in a sense of uh just being exposed to more it just seems like in a larger college you i dont know youre exposed to so many more people from all over the world and im sure a lot of people come to you know small colleges also but just that theyre more of of the different cultures there not that it not that its better but im just saying that i think that big   uhhuh yeah thats one thing to definitely consider   uhhuh uhhuh i think uh a lot of a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college a lot of the students that i talked to even here in Waco they go to Baylor um they or theyre considering going to Baylor theyre also considering going to UT Austin but one of the big no no is because of the fifty thousand students and i have to tell them that just like just Waco like i live in Waco its a large city i can still function in my own kind of area in my own group i have a job i have my friends and im really not as as concerned about the entire city so when you go to a big   uhhuh   a big university youre not as concerned about the entire university but your group of friends your classes your interests your clubs and things like that   yeah i think thats probably key to me is not so much the size of the school but what what are the particular needs of   umhum   the students and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this um larger university setting some of the students um when i was when i was teaching school   umhum   would not have been comfortable with that they needed uh at at least at first   umhum umhum right   they needed a smaller setting that that was more like family where they could get oneonone from from teachers professors and so forth and then after a year or two move on to   right umhum   a little bit bigger pond where where when they had a little more selfconfidence built up oh yes i can do this oh ive done this before its just in a bigger setting and so maybe to me   umhum umhum right   the key would be what what are what are the childs the the students needs and what what school or schools can best meet those those needs besides education you you you can expect   umhum umhum   all of them with uh uh uh accreditation accreditation to give the education but its these other things that you and i are are keying off on that that are really more of an education that but theyre the things that dont show up in   uhhuh on paper umhum exactly thats thats one important thing that i think about school im im not a kind a person that i didnt i i was kind of a B student i guess youd say and i didnt really   thats right thats right   i was  i strived strived to be an A student but it wasnt like a real priority to my my priority was just   right   being as worldly as i could possibly be  getting into as many organizations as i could possibly could and and one other point i was going to make was that i can understand i can see that probably if i had gone to a smaller school i would probably have more friends   um   because you like you said you know you know everybody knows everybody and so you probably come out of it knowing and by friends i mean like contacts for when you get out of school   yeah   um you know you just you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with more so at a small college then a large college you may have gone to school with them but you wouldnt you wouldnt know them uh   umhum yeah   i guess let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college   i guess i guess now ive been out for i im im older than you ive been out for twenty one years and i was looking at an annual last night uh something had sparked it sparked a question and i went to a   uh umhum umhum   small private school um and it was church related and i got to looking at my class of sixty nine   umhum umhum umhum   and i realized that even though that schools two hundred miles from here and ive lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty years where i go to church now there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as i and it its neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same   wow umhum   memories if not the same education education in you know we we werent all out to be teachers or or whatever so we didnt have the same classes but we had a common thread something that still ties us together twenty odd years later   umhum right wow thats great   and its its its kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things   umhum   those are what i carry beyond just that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at TI   right right   i have something more important to me than that   thats great thats great yeah thats what i thats basically what i and when i first ive been out of college only two years now so its still pretty fresh on my memory um   uhhuh   but now that im out when i went into school my parents told well my father okay let me let me go back to my my sister now is is in college and my father was really interested in getting her in a school that   uhhuh   would look good on her on her uh diploma etcetera and so forth and and i kept pushing her towards   uhhuh   just kind of U UT or a larger school and it was just a big conflict between us because my father wanted the academics and i wanted her to get the life experience out of it and so it was you know she went the academic way because shes a straight A student which is yeah yeah yeah so she you know thats probably   uhhuh i was going to ask who won   you know what she what she wants anyway but that was the big deal and   in in that case uh regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed and finding a school that that met her specific requirements and and made the best fit for her   right right and that thats another point is that the a parent should tell their child to be or or to give their child the leeway to choose their school not so much choose the school for them but you know kind of guide them along but let them more or less choose what they need and what theyre going to do   yeah i think it helps uh uh now my grandfather was going to pay if i went to uh whats now UT Arlington because it was there in my hometown i could live at home but i chose to go to another school   umhum right   and even though he was pleased that it was a church related school he was not willing to pay any at all even the same amount of money and and i think i value my my education more because i had to work for it   hum right umhum   and because i knew all along thats what i wanted even even though i had to buck the family in order to to do what i needed to do   umhum right well that was pretty courageous   so um i i guess i guess it was it was my mothers support that got me through it that and ten years of of uh loans  after i got out   yeah oh yeah yeah i im im dealing with the loans right now  so so oh yes very every every month  that memory just shoots back in my mailbox   sounds familiar huh your its very fresh in your memory well uh yeah yes well sorry about that Tanya   so oh well i guess ill get over it  but oh yeah yeah okay   im sure it was worth it though if if nothing else because i work in training at TI now if nothing else just   uhhuh   those experiences beyond and and including your educational classes that help give you the selfesteem to do and achieve whatever you set your mind on   umhum umhum   and the you you made the right choice in going to a school that met all of your needs to make to give you the the potential to do whatever you wanted   right because when you when you do want when you do finally graduate that thats what you need the most im finding out now that what im needing the most now is not smarts not what i can do on paper its stamina courage uh words it   young lady you have gotten your education then thats thats right   yes im needing you know myself im needing to rely on myself and i think i learned a lot of that in school too   yeah
