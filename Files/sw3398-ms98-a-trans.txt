            hello   hi my name is uh Donna Donahue and i live in Plano Texas   hi   hi my name is Lowell and i live in Raleigh North Carolina   oh okay um do you wanna start or would should i start   go right ahead   okay um i would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in we have um three children and um they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports soccer and baseball and well my little girl goes to tap dance and my little one goes to preschool and um im home with the children just do a lot of running around it seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type i dont know life um what about you   im im single and i i live in a town home here in Raleigh and its pretty typical of the other town homes in the area there we we have a lot of town homes here   uhhuh uhhuh okay umhum   as well as single family homes and at the time that i bought this one it was just a a much better arrangement for me personally im not home a lot i travel a great deal with my job and   umhum   so it was easier to have a home that didnt exactly that somebody else looks out for the maintenance   was sort of maintenance free yeah oh yeah well um that that sounds that sounds pretty good because i know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends not so much now but to um maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds and its a lot of work owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it its   it certainly is   sometimes i think um it would be nice to have a town home with not having all that responsibility     well if you ever get one be sure the walls are good and thick because if theyre not you can hear i thats the main thing when i was shopping for one i wanna make sure i couldnt it i couldnt here my neighbors and it was so i bought one thats more like living in a once youre inside you dont know youre in a town home   right oh that sounds lovely   it is theyre kind of built on a cattycornered instead of right side by side so you dont actually hear anybody next door to you   umhum umhum so in in your area then theres probably a lot of um career type people that have those type homes and uhhuh and um   yes definitely   the area that were settled in is um definitely young young families with with kids theyre still doing um a lot of building in the neighborhood so the people that move here seem to move from all over the country which were from um the Northeast and um seems like a lot of people just dont also also dont have any family around so it um also gives you a common bond when you dont have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors and you know um but um thats i   well we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees   umhum   people who dont wanna the heat of Florida but dont want the heat of the northeast the cold of the northeast so they settle sort of in between   right right umhum now its um is it very very wooded around where you are there lots of pretty trees and yeah   yes as a matter of fact this is a uh this particular community that i live in is very wooded   oh how pretty   it is nice it   i do miss that um around here in Plano there are very few trees and its pretty flat and and kind of barren and thats the only thing that we dont like about living in Texas is we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall and and um uh  the landscape is much different here in Texas than it is you know in the North um or even where you are   uh we definitely have a lot of trees here   a lot of leaves to rake up too i bet   yes but fortunately the home owners association does all that yeah     does that well see thats another plus   yes i dont have to worry about that and this is the time of year were starting the leaves are all falling now   thats right thats right they are im gonna get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done we just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but not not much just just a little kind of just in more of a makes a little bit of a mess for a few weeks then if you didnt do anything about it then theyd probably the leaves would just blow away so its not too bad   right   okay do we have to speak for a certain amount of time okay okay well it was really nice speaking to you   no i dont think so it was good to speak with you too   okay and have a happy Thanksgiving   thank you you too bye bye   bye bye
