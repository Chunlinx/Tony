lead Justice Department attorney in the Microsoft case has loweredthe hourly fee that he is charging the government The column asks whether thisis legal if Boies motive was to keep his share of the work            Theanswer can be found in the definitive rhyming opus on antitrust law RWGrants Tom Smith and His Incredible Bread Machine             Youregouging on your prices ifYou charge more than the restBut its unfair competitionIf you think you can charge lessA second point that we would makeTo help avoid confusionDont try to charge the same amountThat would be collusion            In short Boiesreduction of his fee constitutes unfair competition Of course if hed lefthis fee unchanged that would be collusion though in this case hed becolluding with himself and would eventually go

Michael Kinsleywrites in  But not just on antitrust We have two Borks for probably anysubject Give the man a retainer or the proper ideological cause and he readilywill tailor his views to the needs of the moment            I interviewed Bork several years ago for my bookThe Wars of Watergate  His role in the Watergate affair has in allfairness been badly distorted Never mind In our conversation he spoke veryforcefully against the special prosecutor now independent counsel statuteYou cannot bag a case in the Justice Department he told me Too manylawyers who like to talk to too many reporters He was absolutely right ofcourse            Fast forward to  and beyond An independentcounsel to investigate President Clinton Of course And Judge Kenneth Starrto conduct the investigation Of course said Bork who appears as a regularcast member in those situation comedies that pass as talk shows every nightvigorously extolling the virtues and honesty of Judge Starr            Kinsley comes close tothe real reason for rejecting Bork for a seat on the Supreme Court The man hasthe intellectual honesty of a hired gun Which he has truly become                           Stanley I Kutler

is right to say that Robert Borks current posture on the Microsoftantitrust case represents a departure from his yearold book on antitrustlaw            But since when is alawyer expected to actually possess the views he espouses on behalf of hisclients If the Kinsley Doctrine is that a client can only select a lawyer whohonestly believes in the legal arguments of the client then Bill

on David Plotzs Dispatch  from the Dec  House Judiciary Committeehearing            Plotz writes Yesterday I called Lindsey GrahamRSC admirable I apologize  This afternoon Graham reveals himselfand he does it in such a calculating way that I wonder whether everything hehas done till now has been pure performance As the final speaker on the finalday of hearings Graham unleashes a  minute harangue about Clintonian evilClintons true crime is not perjury or adultery Graham shouts its that heplanned to destroy Monica            Isnt the most reprehensible aspect of Clintonsconduct from a moral point of view the fact that he either orchestrated orknowingly permitted the resources of his position and office to be used in anattempt to destroy the reputations of those who have accused him ofmisdeeds            The story of the sexual activity is disturbinggiven the power imbalances between the participants but the story is a tawdryone and most wellmannered people would just as soon not have to hear aboutit especially since the victim is not making any complaint            The lying can be viewed as a natural human failingwhich most people it appears are ready to forgive            Lying under oath is a more serious matter but it ismore serious for institutional reasons rather than purely moral ones As thehead of state and a living symbol of a system which in the name of justiceimposes laws upon and claims the right to exercise coercive power over allAmericans the president has a special dutyhigher than that of an ordinarycitizento abide by the rules that the system imposes One of the mostimportant rules for the whole justice system is the penalty against perjury Itis only right that Congress should take that issue seriously            But from a purely moralpoint of view is it not utterly despicable for the president of the UnitedStates to use the power of his office to destroy the reputation of a person forthe sole purpose of ensuring that that person will not be believed when shetells the truth Such conduct may not be a high crime or misdemeanor It maynot even be illegal But it is surely a moral abuse of the powers of thepresidency that should not go unnoticed                           Kenneth J Tyler               Vancouver British Columbia                           Jocks of theWorld Unite You Have Nothing To Lose but Your Scholarships                        Jim Naughtons  has missed the forest for thetrees He complains that a few powerful schools are aligning themselves to takea larger slice of the revenues generated by bigtime college athletics andbemoans the small colleges whose athletic programs will be destroyed bythis            What Naughton has missed is that the entire NCAAsystem is corrupt making millions of dollars off student athletes who canteven accept plane fare from alumni to visit family            Thats the real travestyof college sports Arguing which schools should keep the huge revenuesgenerated by athletes really misses the point                           Anthony LapadulaRedmond Wash                           Address youremail to the editors to lettersslatecom You must
