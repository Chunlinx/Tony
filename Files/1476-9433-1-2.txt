                    Background        In  Nowell first described lymphocyte activation by        mitogenic lectins to result in blastic transformation and        subsequent mitosis which are complex cellular events that        require several days to evolve     More than  years        later we have advanced considerably in our understanding        of the cellular and molecular events responsible for these        phenomena Now with the genomic revolution we are poised        on a new threshold of discovery in that it is finally        feasible to begin to identify the genes that are        responsible for such complicated cellular processes        However it is now necessary to develop an experimental        approach that will rapidly and accurately facilitate the        discovery process        With the description of lymphocytederived growth factor        activities in the s and s it was realized that        activated lymphocytes secrete soluble factors that are        critical for subsequent lymphocyte proliferation             Moreover in  it was demonstrated that monocytes or        macrophages serve as necessary accessory cells for the        lymphocyte activation process     Then in the early        s several reports indicated that mitogen or        endotoxinstimulated macrophages release soluble lymphocyte        activating factors LAFs that also amplify the activation        process      Accordingly lymphokines and monokines        which collectively came to be known as cytokines became        prime research subjects for those interested in lymphocyte        activation      However it was not until the s        that the cell surface and soluble molecules responsible for        the complex cellular changes of lymphocyte activation were        identified        With the isolation of the lymphocytederived molecule        responsible for T cell Growth Factor TCGF activity which        came to be known as interleukin  IL      and        discovery of IL receptors ILR     it could be        shown that mitogenic lectins and specific antigens        triggered an initial activation event which was analogous        to the activation of cell cycle competence by        serumstimulated fibroblasts and resulted in transition        from the G          to the G          phase of the cell cycle             However just as in serumstimulated fibroblasts this        initial activation event did not result in lymphocyte        proliferation Instead it appeared that the initial        activation of cellular competence triggered by the        mitogenic lectins was amplified by the LAF activity which        became known later as IL and led to the secretion of the        lymphocytederived IL and the expression of ILRs             The subsequent interaction of IL with the ILRs        then stimulated blastic transformation and progression        through G          and into the S phase of the cell        cycle followed by mitosis     Furthermore detailed        studies indicated that successful activation of the ILR        is a quantal ie allornone event that depends on        surpassing a threshold of a finite number of ILILR        interactions       This threshold corresponds to        surpassing the restriction R point in the mid to late G                 phase of the cell cycle first        described by Pardee for serumactivated fibroblasts            Accordingly activation of lymphocyte proliferation was        realized to require at least  signals one delivered to        the T cell via the lectin another supplied as a soluble        factor by accessory macrophages and a third contributed by        the ILILR interaction        With the discovery of the T cell antigen receptor TCR        in       it was possible to demonstrate that        the first signal is delivered via antigenic activation of        the TCR     Subsequently discovery of accessory        costimulatory molecule expression by helper T cells        Th revealed that activation solely of the TCR itself was        insufficient to fully activate IL gene expression and T        cell proliferation Instead in the mid s it was found        that the activation of costimulatory molecules like CD        expressed by T cells via ligands such as B expressed by        antigen presenting cells APC deliver additional signals        that synergize with those emanating from the TCR and        result in maximal IL gene transcription     As well        CD activation stabilizes IL mRNA transcripts        prolonging IL mRNA life span     Thus in addition        to soluble macrophagederived products cell surface        molecules expressed by APCs also contribute to the         ndsignal attributed to the APCs        The molecules responsible for the contribution by the        soluble macrophagederived LAFs still remain obscure even        today Initially the nomenclature of IL and IL was        created to delineate the sequential action of an assumed        single macrophagederived soluble factor IL which        promoted the production of a single lymphocytederived        factor IL       However the molecular nature        of the LAF activity was never fully elucidated even after        the isolation and identification of multiple        mitogenendotoxinstimulated macrophagederived products        such as IL IL IL IL and Tumor Necrosis        Factoralpha TNF It is probable that         all of these macrophagederived        soluble factors together make up the activity originally        ascribed to LAF Accordingly it is obvious that addition        of a polyclonal activating ligand such as        phytohemagglutinin to peripheral blood mononuclear cells        PBMCs leads to the activation of soluble        macrophagederived and lymphocytederived activating        factors and the almost simultaneous activation of multiple        cell surface receptors signaling pathways and        transcription factors that ultimately all contribute to        lymphocyte activation        Stimulation of the various receptors expressed by T        cells and APCs results in the activation of distinct and        also redundant signal transduction pathways and in the        activation of distinct as well as redundant transcription        factors Accordingly it has been assumed that triggering        any of these receptors should result in the expression of        distinct as well as redundant cellular genes Until        recently the identification of large numbers of genes        triggered by distinct ligands has been difficult owing to        the cumbersome methods available for gene identification        Cochran and Stiles were among the first to use differential        cloning methods to identify PDGFregulated genes in        fibroblasts     These investigators focused on the        expression of immediateearly PDGFstimulated genes by        activating the cells in the presence of inhibitors of        protein synthesis such as cycloheximide thereby preventing        the expression of secondary genes        Subsequently Zipfel and coworkers employed subtractive        hybridization to isolate and differentially clone        immediateearly genes activated via the T cell antigen        receptor in the presence of cycloheximide     A total        of  novel TCRinduced immediateearly genes were        isolated but most were not identified at the time in that        DNA cloning and sequencing methods were tedious and time        consuming        New differential cloning methods were developed        subsequently including differential display            sulfhydryl labeling and affinity purification of        newlysynthesized transcripts     representational        difference analysis     and serial analysis of gene        expression     Each methodological advance has        improved both the sensitivity of detection of        differentially expressed genes as well as the speed with        which the genes may be identified However the development        of DNA microarray technology which allows rapid        interrogation of thousands of genes and the detection of        gene expression at frequencies even less than  in         has now greatly facilitated such experimentation             This communication represents our initial efforts to use        DNA microarrays in a reductionist approach to begin to        identify the genes expressed as a consequence of triggering        each individual ligand during lymphocyte activation        Because the ILILR interaction is discrete molecularly        and leads to a very finite quantal decision to undergo        blastic transformation DNA synthesis and mitosis we have        focused our first efforts on identifying ILregulated        genes expressed by normal human T cells                    Results                  Detection of ILregulated genes in peripheral          blood mononuclear cells PBMCs          Responses of PBMCs to IL are complex involving          direct effects of IL on gene expression by T cells B          cells and NK cells as well as secondary effects mediated          by additional cytokines and transcription factors          expressed by these cells in response to IL To identify          the maximal number of ILregulated genes PBMCs          comprised of  CD lymphocytes with smaller          fractions of monocytes B cells and NK cells Table           were examined The cells were preactivated for  hr          with antiCD to induce T cell IL receptor expression          then washed and rested for  hr prior to          restimulation with IL for  hr              Five independent experiments were performed with PBMCs          from different donors to identify ILregulated genes          represented on the Affymetrix UAv oligonucleotide          array A comparison was made between the preactivated          rested cells and those restimulated with IL for  hr          The expression levels were analyzed using DNAChip          Analyzer software     with normalization to the          average chip signal intensity for each experiment and a           thpercentile value cutoff for absent genes          Approximately  of the  probe sets were detected          above background Using the criterion of p   for          the difference of means between the two groups a total          of  of these  probe sets  were identified          as putative ILresponsive genes A complete list of all          ILresponsive genes identified in PBMCs and T cells can          be found in the attached file ILregulated genes          Additional File           IL target genes in human PBMCs and T cells This file          contains expression data for ILregulated probe sets          detected on the Affymetrix UAv array using samples          prepared from human PBMCs and purified T cells These are          the probe sets depicted in Figure A          Click here for file                          Detection of PBMC genes already known to be          ILregulated          The expression patterns of  genes already known to          be ILregulated which were represented by  distinct          probe sets on the array were used to determine the range          of expression parameters that might be most likely to          identify bona fide ILregulated genes Table  As          negative controls glyceraldehydephosphate          dehydrogenase GAPDH and actin were used as examples of          genes that do not change expression levels under the          experimental conditions used their expression levels          were indeed constant without or with IL treatment             and    fold change respectively By          comparison the  selected genes showed ILinduced          changes in expression levels ranging from   fold          ILR probe set at to fold TNF at          The subtractive differences in fluorescent intensity          ranged from    cmyb sat to  CR          sat Four of the genes cmyb CR flt ligand          TNF were detected with more than one probe set and          these replicates were in fairly good agreement It is          worthy of note that there is not a correlation between          the subtracted difference and the fold change in gene          expression levels This is likely due to the fact that          there is a wide range in the abundance classes of RNA          transcripts derived from different genes from as few as           copy per cell to several thousand copies per cell              The signal intensity of a particular transcript          detected on an oligonucleotide array would thus be          directly related to this abundance level Therefore the          subtracted change in signal intensity would be profoundly          affected by the absolute number of cellular copies of a          given transcript By comparison the fold induction is          independent of absolute transcript copy number                          Detection of additional ILresponsive PBMC          genes          Based on the results obtained with known IL target          genes the criteria used to identify additional bona fide          ILregulated genes in these samples were set at           fold change with a subtracted difference in          fluorescent intensity   and a significance level of          the difference between the means of the two treatment          groups of p   Of the  probe sets that met the          standard of p     also met the          additional criteria of either fold change   or          subtracted difference   while only  probe sets           met all three criteria          These  probe sets represent  unique genes           ILinduced genes and  ILrepressed genes that can          be segregated into  functional groups Figure shows the          fold induction and subtracted differences in expression          levels of these probe sets Among the           apoptosisregulating genes bcl caspase  and DRAK are          all induced by IL while the expression of Toso is          suppressed It is noteworthy that the IL induction of          bcl would be expected to promote cellular survival          while the IL regulation of the other three genes would          be expected to promote apoptosis Additional          ILresponsive genes include those encoding  cell          surface proteins  cytokine and chemokine receptors as          well as  signal transduction mediators  genes          involved in cellular metabolism and biosynthesis  cell          cycle regulators and  transcription factors          ILsuppressed genes include lymphocyte antigen           inositol trisphosphate kinase B and cdcB as          well as transcriptional regulators MAXinteracting          protein  CBPpinteracting transactivator inhibitor          of DNA binding  Id glucocorticoidinduced leucine          zipper GILZ and zinc finger protein ERF All of          the  already known ILregulated genes Table  were          also identified in this gene cohort thereby yielding           newly identified ILregulated genes expressed by          PBMCs after  hours of IL stimulation                          ILregulated immediateearly genes in T          cells          The PBMC populations used in our initial experiments          included NK cells monocytes and B cells as well as T          cells In addition cytokines including TNF TNF and          flt ligand were induced by IL as detected by the          arrays so that the IL effects could be mediated by the          action of these intermediary cytokines on other cells in          the mixed population or as well by the           transcriptional targets activated by IL Therefore to          identify the direct IL targets in T cells we used          CDdepleted CDselected T cells which were             CD cells The PBMCs were preactivated with antiCD          for  hr the T cells purified and rested for  hr          prior to restimulation for  hr with  nM IL In          addition  gmL cycloheximide CHX was included to          block protein synthesis so that only immediateearly          ILregulated genes were detected CHX has been shown to          both elevate and prolong the expression of many          transiently induced transcripts      so that the           hr IL stimulation in the presence of CHX should enable          detection of genes induced within minutes as well as          hours Samples from  independent experiments with          preactivated rested cells or cells treated with CHX          alone were combined for data analysis and compared to          cells treated with IL  CHX          As depicted in Figure A using only the criterion of          significance level of p   for the difference          between the means of the two groups  probe sets were          identified as ILregulated immediateearly targets in          the pure T cells Of these probe sets  were also          detected in the ILstimulated PBMCs As shown in Figure          B when a second standard was included either a fold          change   or a subtracted difference    probe          sets  were expressed as immediatelyearly genes in          purified T cells and of these  were also          ILregulated in PBMCs However when all  criteria          were applied Figure C a total of only  probe sets           were found to be immediateearly ILregulated          genes in T cells Twentythree of these  probe sets          were among the  probe sets identified previously as          meeting all  criteria in the experiments with PBMCs          Figure  By comparison the control genes actin and          GAPDH showed    and   fold change          respectively          The  probe sets represent  ILregulated          immediateearly genes Therefore only  of the genes          discovered to be ILregulated in PBMCs are actually          immediateearly direct IL targets in T cells These          direct IL immediateearly target genes included  genes          that were suppressed DSIPGILZ the zinc finger protein          ERFTisd Toso and cdcB Notably of the           ILinduced genes we had already been identified           previously as IL targets using differential colony          hybridization CR CR CR CR     while the           other known IL stimulated target genes included TNF          the ILR and the antiapoptotic gene Bcl Thus only           genes were newly identified as ILinduced          immediateearly T cell genes including the signaling          proteins SLP and RGS the transcription factors IRF          and XBP and  miscellaneous genes DKFZpF          mitofilin cAMPspecific phosphodiesterase B          CMPNacetylneuraminate monooxygenase and the aryl          hydrocarbon receptor          In addition to the  probe sets in common with those          identified in PBMCs  others were detected as          ILregulated immediateearly targets in the purified T          cells Figure C These probe sets met all three of the          criteria of  fold change subtracted difference            and p   in T cells but were not ILregulated          in PBMCs These probe sets represent  unique genes and          are presented in Figure  Notably only three of these          were induced while the remaining  were all suppressed          in response to IL  CHX          Of the remaining  probe sets identified in PBMCs          Figure C  showed changes in expression levels in T          cells with p   although either the fold change          was less than  or the magnitude of the change was          less than  Table  These  probe sets are derived          from  unique genes and most likely represent bona fide          IL targets since the group includes the genes          JABSSISOCS flt ligand ILRp caspase  and          p which have already been reported as ILinduced          genes If these genes are also included  of the           unique genes  identified in PBMCs are ILregulated          immediateearly genes in pure T cells          Similarly of the  probe sets identified as meeting          all  criteria only in pure T cells  showed differences          in expression with p   in PBMCs Table  These          include linker for activation of T cells Tcellspecific          transcription factor  STAT ILR PAS serthr kinase          lmfa domaincontaining protein and an unknown gene          designated DKFZpD Notably all of the other genes           were suppressed by IL in the PBMCs as they were          in the T cells although they did not meet the          significance value of p   in the PBMCs                            Discussion        Lymphocyte activation is initiated by specific        antigenreceptor interactions and aided by accessory        molecules However subsequently cytokine and cytokine        receptor expression ensue and the cytokines ultimately        drive the clonal expansion and functional differentiation        of the antigenselected lymphocyte populations IL was        initially identified by virtue of its T cell growth factor        activity and IL is now recognized as the pivotal        cytokine in promoting mature peripheral T cell        proliferation      Therefore to initiate the        identification of the genes responsible for lymphocyte        activation we chose first to delineate the genetic        mechanisms of IL action Using oligonucleotide arrays of        known genes to identify ILregulated genes in human        lymphocytes a total of  unique genes were found to        change expression within  hr of IL stimulation of PBMCs        These genes could be segregated into functional groups        including cell surface proteins cytokine and chemokine        receptors as well as signal transduction mediators        cytokines genes involved in cellular metabolism and        biosynthesis cell cycle regulators and transcription        factors        In order to define the criteria that we used to sort the        microarray data in this series of experiments we were able        to take advantage of previous reports of  known        ILregulated genes By assessing the characteristics of        the changes in expression of these known IL targets we        were able to define a range of both foldinduction and        subtracted difference that encompassed all of these genes        When applied to the total data set these criteria were        likely to identify additional meaningful ILregulated        genes Since  of these genes had already been reported to        be ILinduced genes our DNA array experiments identified         additional ILregulated genes expressed by PBMCs        However only  of these genes were found to be        ILregulated immediateearly T cell genes        It is important to discriminate these results from other        analyses of T cell activation that have employed antigen        receptor activation as opposed to IL The TCR and IL        receptors activate some shared signaling pathways such as        the RasRafMAP kinase and PIkinase pathways            However there are differences such as the JakStat        pathway which is unique to the cytokines     and the        CaCalcineurin pathway which is activated by the TCR        These signaling pathways culminate in the activation of        specific transcription factors so that there must be both        shared target genes as well as genes unique to antigen or        IL signaling As TCR signaling induces the expression of        IL as well as other cytokines and their receptors the        ultimate T cell response is an amalgam of both antigen and        cytokine receptortriggered events        This point is well illustrated by the report of Teague        et al     who used microarrays to identify murine T        cell genes induced         in vivo by SEB stimulation after         and  hours Again cytokine and cytokine receptor genes        were induced during these time intervals so that the        entire spectrum of genes identified included both antigen        and accessory moleculeactivated as well as        cytokineregulated targets Similarly Ellisen et al           used DNA arrays to monitor ConAinduced genes in human T        lymphocytes over a time scale ranging from  to  hours        Inducible genes included IL and TNF as well as the        ILR ILR and ILR Thus at the time points used in        this study many of the genes detected were likely        regulated by these cytokines as well as Con A In a similar        vein Herblot et al    used a subtractive approach to        identify  genes induced by IL but not IL in a murine        T cell line They further demonstrated that while         in vitro  ConA could induce        expression of the IL target genes in T cells from IL         mice the genes were not induced by ConA treatment of T        cells from IL mice Thus ConA induces IL and ILR        expression and the cytokine drives expression of        additional specific target genes Recently Riley et al           and Diehn et al    described genes regulated by        the TCR and the costimulatory receptors CD ICOS and        CTLA over a time course of  hours Once again        numerous cytokines including IL are strongly induced        within  hr such that a number of the observed regulated        genes are likely cytokineresponsive targets Finally        Gonzalez et al    have described murine genes induced        after  hr IL stimulation which likely include direct        targets of IL as well as genes induced via IL        regulated cytokines        Therefore to discriminate between the distinct genes        induced by each ligand that contributes to the overall        response initiated by antigenic stimulation it is        important to use cycloheximide to identify immediateearly        genes regulated by the TCR and costimulatory receptors vs        IL In addition the genes activated by TCR        costimulatory receptors and IL must be distinguished from        those activated by IL IL IL and TNF as well as        the genes regulated by the Tolllike receptors TLR all        of which have been identified as mediators of lymphocyte        activation events that were previously ascribed to LAF        Moreover as IL itself induces the expression of numerous        cytokines and receptors it is important to discriminate        the direct IL targets from those induced secondarily        through these intermediaries Thus it is worthy of        reemphasis that of the  genes regulated by IL in        PBMCs only  were found to be bona fide ILregulated        immediateearly genes in purified T cells        In addition to imparting positive activating signals        that result in cell cycle progression IL has also been        found to promote negative feedback phenomena Thus it is        especially intriguing that IL suppresses the expression        of many genes both among PBMCs in the absence of CHX as        well as in purified T cells in the presence of CHX The        suppression of the expression of these genes may well be        important in mediating the feedback downregulatory        phenomena        The highaffinity IL receptor is comprised of three        subunits   and       The  chain is specific to        IL while the  chain is shared among IL IL IL        IL and IL     The  chain of the ILR is also a        component of the IL receptor in conjunction with a        specific ILR  chain     The sharing of these        receptors by multiple cytokines raises the question of how        the ligands can trigger specific responses in the target        cells Several signaling events including the activation        of Jak kinases  and  are shared among the common         chain cytokines     Other signaling events such as        the activation of Shc Gab SHP and MAPK are shared        among IL and  but not the other common  chain        cytokine receptors and Tyr  of ILR appears critical        for these events     Despite these signaling        similarities it is clear that the biological properties of        IL are unique among the common  chain cytokines as the        other cytokines cannot compensate for IL in the IL        knockout mouse     In addition IL appears uniquely        critical for the development of NK cells as evidenced by        the phenotypes of IL    and ILR            deficient mice Thus there must be a means whereby IL        and IL as well as the other common  chain cytokines        trigger distinct intracellular signaling pathways and        target genes Therefore identification of each of the        cytokinespecific target genes should shed light on the        issue of specificity amongst the common  chain        cytokines        Complete classification of the genes expressed as a        consequence of distinct ligandreceptor interactions during        lymphocyte activation will also provide a powerful tool for        the assessment and treatment of immunological disorders            In addition to defining the target genes of specific        cytokines and cell surface ligands it is possible to        further subdivide the genes based on the specific signaling        proteins and transcription factors that govern their        expression For example through the use of STAT mice        Ihle et al have been able to identify those IL target        genes that require STAT      Similar approaches        with mutant signaling proteins knockouts or        overexpression systems enable such dissection of the        signal transduction pathways leading to specific target        genes Thus each ligandreceptor pair will ultimately be        linked to a specific signature of target genes derived        from the signaling pathways and transcription factors        activated Such information will be invaluable in the        diagnosis and treatment of disorders involving aberrancies        in these pathways                    Conclusions        The rapidity with which lymphocyte activation genes may        now be identified using the methods described in this        report opens the way to a molecular genetic definition of        the immune response based upon the categorization of the        genes regulated by distinct ligand receptor pairs        Consequently more precise genetic and molecular diagnoses        of immune disorders will soon become available and        hopefully new treatment regimes may be developed to target        the specific molecular nature of each disease                    Materials and Methods                  Cell culture          Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC were
