                                  Account Overwrought            Banking regulatory issues do not normally sparkinterest let alone outrage But more than a quarter of a million furiouscomments flooded the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp to protest the Know YourCustomer regulations proposed by banking agencies last December The regswould have required that banks determine customers sources of funds createclient profiles based on transaction patterns monitor accounts for deviationsinvestigate irregularities and report unexplained activities to federalauthorities            Tyrannical and Gestapolike declared thenations editorial writers Also fanning the public outrage were the EagleForum the American Civil Liberties Union and the Libertarian Party whichdecried the invasion of privacy posed by the KYC regs as they came to beknown Of all the correspondence only about  positive comments wererecorded with Go for it and Ill see you in the place where there is nodarkness counted as a laudatory sentiment by the FDIC            Heeding the outcryCongress introduced five measures by late March to kill the initiative Alsorunning for cover were the plans four sponsoring agenciesthe FDIC theFederal Reserve the Office of Comptroller of the Currency and the Office ofThrift Supervisionwhich withdrew the proposal Today as the bank regulatorsmop up the damage two questions need to be asked  What made the governmentthink the public would stand for such gross intrusions into their privacy andmore important  doesnt the public know that banks already have KYCpowers            By law all US banks snitch on their customers reportingto federal regulators every currency transaction greater than  Between million and  million such reports are filled each year Against a backdropof fines and sanctions banks must also report all transactions greater than whenever a financial institution believes that the information isrelevant to a possible violation of law or regulation This includesunexplained transactions that are not the sort in which the particularcustomer would normally be expected to engage or that have no apparent lawfulpurpose About  of these reports are filed annually The federalFinancial Crimes Enforcement Network aggregates the reports and makes themavailable to  government agencies and to all US attorneys This databank ofunsubstantiated allegations can be maintained indefinitely and is routinelyaccessed by law enforcement authorities who often go fishing for financialdata The information however only flows one way Banks are prohibited fromdisclosing to customers that they tattled to the government and an act ofCongress shields financial institutions from liability suits There is nopenalty for overreporting            Law enforcementauthorities describe these detailed reports as essential in their battleagainst drug traffickers terrorists Medicare crooks and embezzlers as wellas international money launderers The FBI reports that  percent of the convictions for financial institution fraud won in  were initiated orenhanced by suspicious activity reports            Although Congress howled about KYC and damned theregulators for snooping surely the fury was mock Federal and statelegislators have passed new bank surveillance laws with an almost biennialfrequency since the Bank Secrecy Act of  Legislators even boast about thenew laws at election time to prove that theyre tough on crime In late the House of Representatives prodded federal banking agencies to requiremore bank surveillance by overwhelmingly passing a bill that would haveforced regulators to issue KYC rules for comment within  days            Taking the hint the Fed composed the model KYCregulations on its own initiative last fall after two years of research One ofthe Feds KYC innovations would have required banks to develop programs toverify the identities of new customers It suggested that banks make visualchecks of businesses and corroborate phone numbers by calling new clients underthe guise of thanking them for their business            After completing a preliminary draft of KYC theFed rallied the three other sponsoring agencies to follow its lead The FDICnow says that it had serious reservations about the proposal the very proposalthat it nearly shepherded into law The agency insists that it published theKYC in the Federal Register for commentwhich is the way of all newfederal regulationsto accommodate the Fed and to standardize the bankingregulations            Ordinarily new financial regulations generate afew comments from members of the financial community the odd professor orattorney and the occasional think tank But KYC touched off protests acrossthe board The American Bankers Association complained about a new vastlymore expansive burden of investigating all customers to determine if anythingillegal has taken place The California Banking Association argued KYC woulddeter millions of Americans from opening bank accounts Privacy groupsprotested that they had not been invited to help design the new regs            But it was thegrassroots opposition to KYC sparked in part by the Libertarian Party whoseprotest Web site steered  email complaints from netizens to the FDICthat elevated the subject to the national agenda Acknowledging that they hadlost the KYC battle but won the regulatory war the sponsoring agencies madethis joint statement when they withdrew the KYC regulations at the HousesMarch hearings Over the past  years banking organizations and lawenforcement authorities have forged a vital partnership to fight financialcrime            To be sure KYC would have encroached on financial privacyjust as sensitivities about the Internet and other new technologies haveincreased demands for privacy Now that financial data are compiled and storeddigitally it is cheap easy and tempting for the government to cast a widerand wider financial dragnet to build increasingly intrusive computer profilesof citizens Attention must be paid lest the government further encroach on theprivacy of our data streams            But the KYC flap is less about the loss of financialprivacy than it is about the publics loss of naivet regarding the mythof financial privacy People want to believe that checking accounts aresacrosanct even though they havent been for a long time This spring thegovernment bolstered the myth of financial privacy by cynically folding its KYChand when its regulatory methods and practices were noisily scrutinized            In fact while KYC was dying a very public death itwas thriving in the shadows Thanks to current banking regulations more than percent of US banks currently maintain KYC programs The Feds BankSecrecy Act Examination Manual all but requires the adoption of Know YourCustomer programs Banks not heeding this imperative are subject to ceaseand desist orders and to financial penalties of thousands or millions ofdollars
