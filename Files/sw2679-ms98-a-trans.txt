                okay where were where were you from   um just here in Dallas   oh okay because i uh i talked to a professor in uh   uhhuh   what was it North Carolina who got the the TI system and he gave to all his students so my daughters even talked to and ive talked to several people from North Carolina i was just curious   thats yes yes thats true ive talked uhhuh people from Virginia and and all over yeah   have you too yeah i talked to the professor and i asked him about it and he said oh he says i think im the guy that actually uh gave it to all my students so thats why so many people are from this college uh go ahead you you first     uhhuh oh okay um well the subject were supposed to be talking about lets see is uh food   food   what type of foods do do you cook and what would you uh cook in uh uh lets see if you were giving a dinner party and the only reason why i may know a little bit about this is that im planning on having a barbecue pretty soon and to me thats the type of thing that i like to   oh great   give in um uh cooking for people and uh if hes cooking outside where its cooler and uh you dont have to do all that much work you know you just uh slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce  and away you go   yeah we have them too and i im trying to think which is the best uh that i prefer uh my wife uh       doesnt like to have all that work on the very day that youre doing it uh and we havent catered out very much uh we would i always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be the man always gets that chore and you have to make it perfect uh       ive made shish kabob which i like its fairly easy and fast   uhhuh   uh where i guess im thinking of the easy thing to do   umhum   for for having uh uh a dinner   uhhuh   i do cook but not im mostly the easy cooker you know the breakfasts and and the steaks uh although i would like to experiment with uh   yes     the meals my mother made you know so to speak and i havent gotten around to that yet uh   uhhuh what kind of meals did she make that you liked   well she was Polish and uh she would make very economical  meals we were very poor different rice and ham and things that uh she would throw things together   umhum uhhuh   and galunkies and all that and uh i would like to try that one day and she would make spaghetti with pork chops and and special meat balls and everything and my wife of course thinks im crazy which i may be too but uh   huh no sounds interesting uhhuh yeah thats great   yeah but dinner parties are a lot of work uh   yeah yeah but uh thats thats why i like the the outdoor stuff a a lot better people can entertain themselves i think a great deal     yeah   more uh when you have a barbecue especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and uh you know nothing really fancy like your your shish kebabs where you have to do a whole bunch of work   yeah yeah well that that shish kabob is uh just because it only takes a few minutes to cook you know you get it ready you have to do a lot of work beforehand i agree and buy special stuff but uh   uhhuh   so far as getting out there and and putting it on it only takes a little a few minutes uh but anyway im im thinking of the easy way rather than my guests i guess but uh   right   yeah yeah well i i think you do do a lot of work even if people do bring over things you still do uh all the uh housework and get everything everything prepared and utensils and just just everything   right right   uh but you know my mother used to make an Armenian rice dish im thinking about uh special dishes and uh yeah it was made out of rice and consume soup uh and bacon and onions   uhhuh yeah oh yeah   and then youd simmer it like all day long   right youd get the odor of it yeah   oh it would because yeah and it was just it was just wonderful thats thats something that i would really like to uh to try and find the recipe for but we used to have that at Thanksgiving time   uhhuh yes   because you can you can put it on top of the stove and do this and and theres so much broth and juice in there that it has to uh soak up into the rice all day long in order for it to uh uh to come out fluffy and and nice   oh great   and that was you know when you were talking about the the Polish dishes uh some goulashes and things like that thats uh thats what i thought about was that Armenian rice dish   oh yes we probably ought to try this but it probably will never taste as good as we remembered i guess it gets better and better as we remember it back as we get older you know but we probably should try it uh to do that   thats true thats true   the recipes are really interesting you know were probably going to lose them well probably forget all about them you know since were trying to make everything so simple here i am talk about trying to make everything easy you know   umhum right right   i uh you talked about Thanksgiving there are interesting meals at different times uh something see my wifes from Texas so uh remember we were first married and we were living in New Jersey and uh we were going over to my mothers house for Christmas you know to have a meal and we were on the way over we were just married that very year and she said oh im looking forward to a nice turkey i said turkey i said we dont have turkey at Christmas  i said we only have turkey on Thanksgiving i said were going to have a ham she said what   umhum   oh uhhuh yeah   i said yeah i said no turkey is only for Thanksgiving and because she had turkey a lot you know and uh that was surprising in the in the east uh we always had ham you know   uhhuh right right   and and and thats one thing also thats another recipe i guess we could talk about now the hams just kind of you know go take it out of a can or or uh a package sliced uh the cans were cooked for hours and hours and and were just wonderful you know i id like to try that too   uhhuh uhhuh yeah you know what i found was at Sams uh wholesale uh stores and uh what they have is this honey baked ham that have you seen have you had any of those   yeah oh yeah i saw them thats good no i i uh i ive i know about  but i think goes   if if you ever get a chance to buy one of those i think it was uh twenty dollars for uh i dont remember how many pounds it was but you cook it in the bag that they send it in and all the juices and everything are all sealed in and i tell you what if   umhum oh really   its never failed to come out tender and juicy and just and just delicious because i normally dont like ham because its so salty   oh i havent heard of that yeah yeah   but with this honey bake that they have that thats the only one i have been able to find there at Sams warehouse it is absolutely delicious and it slices great umhum umhum   oh yeah ill have to ask her about that uh because we have a delivery guy that comes around that sells i cant think of his name of it uh i dont know i see a can here or a box here Gourmet Choice uh he delivers uh what is the name of this thing i got a box where is it distributed marsh  it doesnt say Gourmet Choices  but he but its a company that has uh you know a truck that comes around and and they recently had hams they have steaks and   umhum   and uh actually pierogies and all that stuff that uh i i never i wish i could tell you the name of the company but i dont know what it is but uh they recently had a ham that was supposed to be it was boneless and we tried it it was real nice and it was fully cooked and everything we had it for breakfast a long time it was really great   uhhuh umhum wow you know that sounds like it   yeah   but thats thats the only ham i have found that i thoroughly thoroughly enjoy   i would like to try the old recipe though of cooking it and and i keep saying this uh to to do the different things that we did but i would like to put one in the oven you know the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours and see if because i dont think in in my married life which is uh twenty six years now weve never done that you know and i remember that when i was a kid uh to have the ham cooking uh rather than that we just ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally you know and thats it you know   wow umhum right     in the old days we had hams were the meal and i dont i dont think we really have it as a main meal   right thats true i i dont think so anymore not with more becoming more conscious of uh fat and cholesterol and and all those good things   right yeah thats an interesting point how how have you changed your your meals now have you into that uh looking at those things   uhhuh oh yeah well my parents actually started it and uh getting   uhhuh parents thats unusual   well it its true i think my parents are very unusual because uh we grew up in the south where uh you have all the um you know biscuits and gravy and oh fried foods galore and then gradually they started switching over to um plain rice um   oh yeah   no gravy its just it really is they uh theyre actually they actually uh uh led us through it versus um   thats amazing   us teaching them you know the uh the finer points but my mother has really high cholesterol so it was one of the reasons which started them off and they started doing this like in the early or in about the middle seventies uh yeah   yeah well thats amazing theyd go that they have started usually its the younger people doing it yeah   its true its true i agree with you so its really neat   i uh my my wifes mother is the only grandparent left and uh she has high cholesterol of course i have i have too but not like hers   umhum umhum   and i always get after her about salt and everything else and she just will i mean shes going to eat the same way she ate you know her whole life and she just tells more or less tells me to shut up you know   thats right right   and uh i like to im trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way uh     umhum umhum   uh its its not the  i listen to uh Larry Newarth on the weekend hes a fitness expert and uh he talks about you know the chicken and the rice and everything else and   umhum   and uh throwing away peanut butter and all the things things not to eat you know ever i think the peanut butter and mayonnaise he would throw away forever and then hes got me into making eggs without the yolk     wow umhum   you know try that sometime my wife says she cant stand it but uh when i make scrambled eggs now talking about a recipe   uhhuh   i say if i have four eggs not not for me but if im making four eggs uh even for my daughter and i ill take out all the yolks but one   wow   and its fine you you dont miss it uh in fact when i when i make eggs for myself   huh   if i if i fry them throw them in there i will almost hard fry them so i can take not eat the yolk at all   uhhuh uhhuh   and you dont really miss it you get the flavor of the yolk but uh you dont eat it at all you know you dont or hardly you get like uh a bite at at the the most   umhum   and so uh for cholesterol i mean im trying that and it has worked my cholesterol gone down twenty points uh although   wow thats good   i havent gotten on the which whether was it butter or cholesterol not cholesterol margarine and all that i dont know know whether any of that is true you know whether the margarines are butter   uhhuh
