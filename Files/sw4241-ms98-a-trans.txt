        okay um           i guess im not real familiar with recycling because ive been in the army for twenty years so uh   oh youre an environmental engineers dream   uh right so uh actually the first my first encounter with it was at the the place we were originally renting uh which was a small community near here and they        they gave each household one of these plastic uh bins or whatever to put our our stuff in   uhhuh   and uh then when we moved into the townhouse where we are now        there there again there was no recycling program and now there is   uh   and uh so we        were recycling uh all the cans the glass bottles all the plastic and the newspapers which   thats great i really feel like uh community sponsorship is going to be one of the keys to uh recycling success         umhum      um i know here we have in my community now were im in unincorporated im in the county by im unincorporated   umhum   uh within a certain city limits theres theres more uh        uh more i i i just want to say better programs here we have uh trash pickup twice a week and on the first day theyll pickup aluminum cans and on the second theyll pick up newspapers   umhum    umhum    hm   and um i think those are you know the kind of the core      umhum   crops if you will just to because theyre the most uh lucrative i think and the most uh technologically feasible to recycle      uh    right ours our regular trash pickups are also twice a week but then the recycling pick up is totally separate and thats on Thursday      oh are is is your community recycling sponsored by your local government   so uh    umhum yeah its just a small town and its uh its locally sponsored        i dont know what they do with it uh that always uh uh interested me as to where it goes and what they do with it to to process it but uh   yeah therere a lot of different ways to recycle you can um especially with the plastics you can melt them down and reform them or you can actually recycle them and it depends on whether they segregate the different types of plastics therere seven main types      umhum    umhum hm now i i kind of came up with an idea as well on my own in that        i think part of the recycling responsibility falls uh not only with the local or county governments but with the individuals as well   right   because uh the individual family is capable of recycling things that never have to be delivered to somebody else to to be recycled      thats right   and so ive kind of looked for because im interested in gardening which is an ideal uh vehicle for recycling ive looked for those things that i can recycle      oh      that i can use with my uh organic gardening that uh i like to do yeah and so what for example  what i do is uh   oh you do organic gardening      recycle the grass clippings and all the leaves that uh not only that i rake but uh that all my neighbors rake up for me  its uh   oh how wonderful youre doing so well   its neat that they uh they will rake it up for me off of their own yards bag it for me and put it on the curb for my easy collection  and uh      uhhuh    right      so then i just uh get as much as i need which sometimes embarrasses my wife  she says please dont pickup their grass clippings and i uh take it into the backyard or in this case wherever i can and compost it         uhhuh   see and then i can recycle that right into the garden and uh i      yeah thats wonderful id love im i have        tried not too diligently to get involved with that organic gardening composting i have two dogs and they would eat every bit of compost id put out there and i fenced it off with chicken wire about two or three feet high   umhum    hm    uhhuh   and theyd jump over the wire just to eat the little egg shells and potato peels and just whatever they could put their little jaws on it was awful      really so you you have dogs that are vegetarians huh gee thats odd      yeah people people say its just part of my Karma im not a complete vegetarian as a matter of fact ive got some corn beef on the stove right now but i uh      hm    oh      dont eat much meat or as much as i used to but my dogs since ive been eating more produce   umhum    umhum   eat more produce anyway      they they do to huh   yeah   well thats odd id never heard of dogs eating        uh vegetable leftovers or anything like that huh because one of the things that they say about compost uh if you make it from grass and leaves and   yeah theyll yeah      fruits and vegetable leftovers or scra pses that uh it does not attract animals   huh   um because theres no meat in it or anything or fish or anything like that      well yeah   thats interesting that you have dogs that are attracted to compost well they guess theyll be healthy dogs      yeah yeah  well with my luck theyll live forever huh   right so i uh i do that and then the other thing that i try and do along the same lines is uh because i like to start my own seedlings        i look at what i can do with the some of the plastic containers that we have   umhum   that i can use in the gardening
