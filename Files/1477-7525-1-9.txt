                    The Problem of Dyspnea and Related Symptoms in        Hospice Patients                  Research Questions          Severe dyspnea whether acute or chronic affects          patients functional status and quality of life as well          as other psychosocial aspects of the patients life             Patients with severe dyspnea who are in hospice care          most often manifest the associated symptoms and problems          of anxiety fatigue and sleeplessness which in turn          affect functional status and cognitive status and          subsequently decrease quality of life    Based on          previous studies      a specific study aim was to          explore the congruence of dyspnea ratings by caregivers          with patients ratings of dyspnea Another aim was to          explore the relation of the patients dyspnea and related          variables to the patients quality of life as well as the          effect on the caregivers quality of life The study          addressed three specific research questions in hospice          patients with endstage lung cancer and their          caregivers           Are there significant differences in the intensity          ratings of the patients dyspnea between patients and          caregivers           To what extent do these patientvariables age          educational level dyspnea intensity symptom distress          and functional status explain variance in the patients          perceived quality of life           To what extent do these caregivervariables age          educational level dyspnea intensity symptom distress          and mastery explain variance in the caregivers          perceived quality of life                          Conceptual Framework          The conceptual framework for this study was adapted          from the previous work of Moody McCormick and Williams          who that found mastery was associated with improved          symptom management which leads to improved functional          status and perceived quality of life    Another          underlying assumption is that accurate assessment of          symptoms leads to improved management an assumption that          has yet to be tested but will be the focus of a future          study In the present study the perceived mastery level          of the patient was not measured but it was assessed for          the caregiver          Nurses and physicians often fail to assess dyspnea          accurately as they tend to assess only observable signs          of dyspnea Breathlessness the subjective component of          dyspnea is often different from what is directly          observable    Since the early s there have been          a number of tools available to measure dyspnea in acute          and chronic illness Studies which have measured dyspnea          appropriately generally use a quantitative method of          selfassessment such as the visual analog scale or a          graphic rating scale The graphic rating scale is a          bipolar scale with  for No dyspnea and  for          Worst Dyspnea Ever In general a graphic rating scale          is preferred for older people hospice patients and          those who are apt to be easily fatigued The researchers          previous experience with the instrument has shown the          graphic rating scale to be the best choice for caregivers          in terms of ease of use and accuracy                              Dyspnea and Hospice Care          In hospice patients it is not uncommon to find acute          and chronic dyspnea because most patients have one of          these primary diagnoses endstage lung disease COPD or          interstitial fibrosis lung cancer or endstage heart          disease    Aggressive treatment of distressing          symptomatology contributes to overall quality of life and          restores to the patient some of the freedom and autonomy          usurped by the disease process          Dyspnea is often associated with other common          symptoms fatigue cough anxiety and pain    This          cluster of symptoms is usually studied together and          caregivers are often asked to assess all of them using          various types of analog or graphic rating scales In          planning interventions for dyspnea it is important to          assess the degree of distress the dyspnea causes for the          patient and in turn the caregiver Moody and other          researchers have found that the onset of acute dyspnea          in patients who have not experienced dyspnea before may          cause severe anxiety in both the patient and the          caregiver    In order to improve symptom management          in hospice care it is important to study whether          caregivers are able to use the assessment tools and          achieve ratings congruent with the patients ratings                          Caregivers in Hospice Care          Until recently most research in psychosocial oncology          and palliative care focused exclusively on the patient          However terminal diseases are a major stressor for both          the patient and the family caregiver causing a new set          of challenges for both    At the very least the          routine of daily life is altered and both patients and          family members must struggle to adjust and respond to new          demands    Recent research suggests that family          caregivers experience depression and anxiety          psychosomatic symptoms restrictions of roles and          activities strain in marital relationships and          diminished physical health    Indeed research          suggests that spouses experience as much if not more          distress than patients    This emotional distress          may affect role functioning both within the family as          well as in society including the ability to care for the          patient    Caregiver distress is an important          concern because family caregivers are assuming more          responsibility for care as treatment moves increasingly          to the outpatient arena It is increasingly important to          evaluate quality of life QOL of family caregivers          because of their increased responsibility and          contribution to the care of the cancer patient However          most studies to date have focused on specific outcomes          such as needs burden and emotional distress rather than          on a more comprehensive evaluation of QOL outcomes                            Methods                  Setting and Sample          A large hospice provider in SW Florida was the site          for the overall study of  patientcaregiver dyads that          had been accrued at the time of this secondary analysis          This substudy was focused on the  dyads  percent          from the sample which were identified through the          patients selfreport of dyspnea at the time of          admission To be eligible patients had to be adults           years with a diagnosis of cancer and an identified          family caregiver who was a spouse or adult child and          both had to consent to participate Both had to have at          least a sixth grade education be able to read and          understand English and pass cognitive screening with the          Short Portable Minimental Status Exam    Pfeiffer                                    Study Instruments                      Dyspnea Intensity            For hospice patients with severe dyspnea and            fatigue a bipolar point Dyspnea Graphic Rating            Intensity Scale DGRIS was used    This global            scale which assesses only the perceived severity of            the dyspnea was used due to ease of administration and            accuracy Reliability and validity of the oneitem            graphic rating scales have been supported by a number            of studies Scores range from  to  Testretest            reliability has ranged from  to  and concurrent            validity with other measures  to     Although            this scale was designed for patient selfreport the            caregiver also was asked to estimate the severity of            the patients dyspnea using this oneitem scale                                Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale MSAS            The Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale    was            administered to both patients and caregivers to measure            both the frequency and distress of common symptoms            experienced by patients For patients it was used to            measure distress caused by  symptoms commonly seen in            persons with advanced cancer including shortness of            breath The MSAS is a selfreport scale that provides            data about the occurrence of each symptom and the            distress associated with these symptoms Distress is            measured on a  point summated rating scale with scores            that may range from  no distress to  very much            distress Validity was supported by high correlations            with clinical status and quality of life Internal            consistency was assessed using Cronbachs alpha and            found to be high ranging from r   to                            The MSAS scale was administered to all caregivers            It was altered slightly by rewording items to determine            the degree to which each symptom experienced by the            patient caused distress for the caregiver These scores            also ranged from  to  This approach has been used            previously in studies with caregivers who have            dementia                                   Hospice Quality of Life Index            The Hospice Quality of Life Index HQLI is a            item selfreport tool that includes three aspects of            overall quality of life Psychophysiologic Wellbeing            Functional Wellbeing and Social and Spiritual            Wellbeing    Total scores may range from a low of            zero to a high of  Evidence of validity and            reliability of the HQLI was generated by a recently            completed study    Evidence of validity was            provided by the ability of the HQLI to differentiate            between hospice patients and apparently healthy            controls using both discriminate analysis p   and            comparison of means p   Previously the HQLI has            been validated for use with hospice patients with            cancer The finding that HQLI scores correlated at the            expected level r   p   with functional            status scores provides further evidence of validity            Finally factor analysis confirmed the factor structure            of the HQLI Reliability of the HQLI was provided by            generation of coefficient alphas for both total scale            scores and subscale scores Subscale alphas all were             and the total scale alpha was high for both cancer            r   and AIDS r   patients For this paper            the item asking the patient how breathless he or she            feels  was analyzed separately                        Mastery SelfEfficacy was            assessed by a sixitem summated rating scale with a            fivepoint scale ranging from None  to A Great            Deal  Scores may range from  to  It was            modified for the study to include contentspecific            stems based on the context of caregiving and the            caregivers perceived ability to cope with caregiving            tasks and manage daytoday problems The mastery scale            has been used by Moody et al in a number of dyspnea            and quality of life studies     Reliability of the            scale has ranged from  to  Content validity and            concurrent validity have ranged from  to                                               Palliative Performance Status PPS Scale            The purpose of the Palliative Performance Scale            PPS is to assess the physical condition and            functional status of persons receiving palliative care               Scores may range from  dead to  normal            functioning It is a relatively new tool based on the            Karnofsky Performance Scale and is purported to provide            a framework for measuring the progressive decline in            palliative care patients The PPS measures three broad            areas of function intake level of consciousness and            mobility The PPS is scored from  at             increments The PPS level for a given patient is            determined by reading across the table at each             decrement to find the overall best fit Stronger            performance factors are noted to be located on the left            of the instrument softer ones on the right Judgment            is required if one of the five factors observed in a            particular patient does not fit with the others The            usual approach to decide PPS is to first determine            whether the disease has limited the ability to work or            ambulate left side and then work ones way across            the table Patients who have a lower PPS generally are            more functionally impaired than those with higher            scores Prognosis is generally related to functional            status in most palliative care patients Those patients            with higher PPS scores may have longer length of stays            although all patients may not be comparable            Progression of disease can generally be noted with            declining PPS levels in a given patient Interpretation            of the instrument may have implications about patient            acuity and need for amount of services            The initial validity study assessed  patients at            home and  patients admitted to a hospice unit            Validity of this instrument was assessed comparing the            PPS score with length of survival The average period            until death for  patients who died on the unit was             days at  PPS on admission  days at              days at   at   at  Only two            patients at  or higher died in the unit As part of            an earlier project we assessed validity and reliability            of the PPS The predicted strong positive correlations            between PPS and KFS r   p   support            construct convergent validity    Although no            reliability data were reported by the tool developers            the researchers in this substudy found that interrater            reliability was very strong r   p   df                                            Demographic Data            Standard demographic data were collected on dyads to            allow description of the sample Patient data included            age gender education level marital status religion            occupation cancer diagnosis and length of time since            diagnosis Data on caregivers were assessed by            selfreport in a semistructured interview age            ethnicity gender education marital status and            religion                                    Study Procedures          This study was approved by the bioethics committees of          the hospice Following approval by this committee the          proposal was approved by the University of South Florida          Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human          Subjects Eligible dyads that were potential study          subjects were initially identified by hospice admission          staff and referred to the Research Assistant RA a          trained nursing data collector at the beginning of each          day The RA contacted the caregiver to arrange a visit by          both the nurse and a Home Health Aide HHA During this          visit the study was explained consent of both patient          and caregiver obtained the mental status of the          caregiver assessed and the functional status of the          patient evaluated Patients and caregivers who met the          admission criteria were asked to complete their          respective questionnaires independently in separate          rooms when possible The HHA collected patient data and          stayed with the patient to assist as needed The HHA          reassured the caregiver that the patient would not be          alone while the RA was collecting data from the patient          Therefore the caregiver was better able to concentrate          on the questionnaires knowing that the HHA was with the          patient                          Data Analysis          Data for all demographic variables and study variables          were analyzed first using descriptive statistics with          SPSS version     Multiple correlation and paired          ttests were used to analyze significant differences in          ratings between caregivers and patients and associations          between related symptoms and conditions Stepwise          multiple regression models were used to address research          questions two and three                            Results                  Profile of Study Patients and Caregivers          Usable data were collected on  hospice          patientscaregiverdyads A profile of the study group is          included in Table  The mean age of the hospice patient          was  years and  for caregivers About   of          caregivers were adult children and the majority was          spouses The dyad majority was white            AfricanAmerican  Hispanic and  Asian The majority          of patients were male  while  of caregivers were          female There were no mean differences in cognitive          status SPMSQ scores between caregivers and patients          The education level of patients was  years compared          to  for

bivariate          correlation was used to determine the relationship          between patient and caregiver ratings of dyspnea The          correlation between patient and caregiver scores was weak

        To address the second research question a stepwise          multiple regression was used to determine if these          patientvariables age educational level symptom          distress MSAS

results indicated that          symptom distress and education were the only significant          predictors of the patients quality of life R   p                                     Factors Influencing Caregivers Quality of          Life          The third research question was examined using          stepwise multiple regression to determine if the          caregivers perceived levels of mastery symptom          distress age educational level and the patients          dyspnea intensity were significantly related to their          perceived quality of life All variables were entered          into the model with quality of life as the dependent          variable Results showed that three variables were          significant predictors of variance in the caregivers          quality of life R   p   mastery symptom          distress age and education Table                             Discussion        Dyad ratings of the patients dyspnea were almost        identical paired mean difference was  These        findings support other researchers such as those of Sneeuw        and colleagues    who found that with few exceptions        mean scores of the proxy raters were equivalent to those of        the patient varying between  and  indicating a        moderate level of agreement at the individual level        Disagreement was not dependent on the type of proxy rater        or on raters background characteristics but was        influenced by the QOL dimension under consideration and the        clinical status of the patient    Although our        findings also confirm that patientcaregiver dyspnea        ratings were not significantly different mean difference         the correlation between caregiverpatient ratings        were significant but relatively not that strong r  p          df   Data were checked twice for accuracy        reanalyzed and the results were identical Why the        correlation is not stronger in view of the negligible mean        difference in paireddyad ratings is puzzling The results        indicate that both significant others and health care        providers can be useful sources of information about cancer        patients QOL Measurement of dyspnea needs to be done        frequently using standardized instruments such as the        oneitem graphic rating scale to assess dyspnea and        effects of treatments        Results of the regression analysis revealed that the        patients perceived symptom distress and educational level        are the most important variables that explain variance in        their quality of life This finding is similar to a        previous study by Moody McCormick and Williams           These results confirm the importance of assessing and        managing the symptoms to improve or maintain quality of        life                    Conclusions        From the results it is clear that caregivers can obtain        ratings of dyspnea that are congruent with the patients        perceived symptoms This is especially important in hospice        care as patients may become so debilitated that they need        to rely on proxy ratings from their caregivers to assess        and attend to their symptom management Caregiver perceived        quality of life was related to four variables perceived        mastery symptom distress age and years of education        with mastery being the strongest predictor Overall symptom        distress and education were found to be the best predictors        of the patients quality of life In the current study        mastery was tested only in the caregivers However Moody        and colleagues found mastery to be an important predictor        of the patients quality of life and recommend it be        assessed in both patient and caregiver           Future research in the form of clinical trials is needed        to test interventions to manage the severe dyspnea and        related symptoms that occur in patients with cancer and        endstage lung disease Therapies for dyspnea in the        hospice setting have been subjected to only minimal        scientific study especially for endstage chronic        obstructive lung disease and lung cancer Evidencebased        clinical guidelines such as those developed for pain        management are needed for dyspnea assessment and improved        management of symptoms
