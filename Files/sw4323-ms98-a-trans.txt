        yeah   okay so what kind of car do you want to buy next   uh well i dont thats a tough decision um at the moment i probably should go for something thats thats more on the practical side of things   right   um so i dont know right now i drive a uh Volkswagen Golf GTI   uhhuh   um and thats a great little car for me because its its fun to drive plus you can fold the backseats down and and its got a lot of storage room   well do you have children are you married   no huhuh im single   no       well i am um divorced just just like in three days ill be divorced and i have two little girls and um i have a Pontiac six thousand   oh wow umhum   and um thats worn out and and if i would have had the money to go buy a car i would probably get a Toyota just because     yeah really   thats what everybody says i should get when i get a car is a Toyota they supposed to just last forever you know and um if i had my choice id want a minivan     yeah yeah umhum   uh probably a Chrysler   right   you know Plymouth Voyager one of them other ones you know one of them thats what i would want  lots of room so     right right   have room for them children to you know move around and not get cramped up and fuss you know so   umhum   plenty of room for all the toys and everything     but i would probably you know want something with really good gas mileage because im cheap  you know so   umhum     that would probably be my choices two choices   yeah yeah i always try and go for something a little more sporty just because i dont have the   well youre single and you know   yeah i dont have the family to worry about its just me selfish me   yeah have them women look at you in that sports car driving  oh goodness   well true true  im sure it doesnt hurt but uh yeah actually um i dont know you know that brings up the the question about uh American versus imports     umhum   you know theres a lot of people saying buy American again you know but obviously uh neither of us would if we uh  had the option um   umhum no i wouldnt no i wouldnt   i guess yours is based on previous experience then maybe   oh yeah         well we had a Honda Accord and um an older one it was a eighty one and um it just you know lasted forever it was a really good car   umhum umhum   and um so i like them but um i have a couple of friends that have Toyotas and and they have a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand miles and not a thing goes wrong with them   wow   get great gas mileage and they still just run run run and ive got this poor pitiful Pontiac and thing breaks down every other day so you know   umhum     so i dont know   yeah i dont know its its its interesting um you know i dont   so if you were married and had children what would you want to buy   oh jeez if i was married and had children uh do i have a budget or not   of course you have a budget youre married and have children it depends are you a doctor or a lawyer then you dont have a budget or you just have a bigger one   yeah no no not yet   yeah yeah i guess everyone has a budget more or less um yeah i dont i dont know thats a good question um   right   i actually really like uh Jeep Cherokees uhhuh   ooh i do too i like them   yeah theyre the problem is theyre pretty expensive um   they are well all  just about everything is expensive now i mean you know the minivans are way on up there you know theyre real expensive and   true umhum   so you know   yeah but i dont know a a a Cherokee would be nice uh or or a Wagoneer uh   umhum   or gosh i dont know uh station wagon of some sort you know that that be an an alternative im im not too sold on the minivan idea uh   you dont you dont like them   well you know ive never driven one so i cant really criticize them fairly but   i like riding in them   do you   i love them i think theyre just great two of my friends have them and theyre great theyre i really like them   they uh umhum hm   um i rode my one of my friends has a Dodge Caravan and one has a one had a Plymouth Voyager and i liked the Plymouth Voyager the best   umhum hm   you know it was a little bit fancier   umhum   you know  they havent had a bit of problem with them   hm   they ride ride real smooth and the kids have room and you know i like them   right     so anyway   yeah yeah um i dont know i always like to to look for something a little with a little more power thats thats thats my main complaint against um like Toyota is because i think they always under power their cars   uhhuh do they   yeah um you know i mean theyre theyre great if if youre really looking for maximum uh
