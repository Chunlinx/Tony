                                  Federalize the Schools            Lets give PresidentClinton credit for attempting in this darkest hour of his presidency torevive a worthwhile if unpopular idea stronger federal control over thenations public schools            Clintons State ofthe Union proposal to semiprivatize Social Security may be getting most ofthe press but his plan to penalize states with the loss of federal educationdollars if they fail to enforce strict academic standards was by far the mostinteresting policy initiative unveiled in his Tuesday speech If Clinton sticksto his rhetorical guns and hangs onto his job it could become one of themost important initiatives of his presidency If he doesnt or if the billfails to clear a Congress thats sure to be hostile to it it will rank withthe health care bill as one of the more significant policy disappointments ofhis presidency            The proposal reaches the table at a time when educationreform has all but disappeared from the national political agenda Remembereducation reform Back in  a blueribbon panel on elementary andhighschool education declared the nation at risk and in response stateslegislated reforms such as merit pay to boost teacher performance The cry forbetter public schools reached a crescendo in  when George Bush theeducation president convened an education summit in Charlottesville Vawhich defined national education goals to be reached by the Year  Clintonone of the more reformminded governors at the Charlottesville conferencetried to establish national standards to help achieve the Charlottesville goalswhen he became president A Clintonauthored grant program inspired by theconference did become law in  But the standardsetting portion was watereddown by congressional Republicans who perceived it as a liberal plot to createa national board of education and by some congressional Democrats who sawtougher school standards as a threat to the selfesteem of black and Hispanicstudents It was all but gutted after Republicans took over Congress in A special place in hell should be reserved for perpetual Republicanpresidential candidate Lamar Alexander who as education secretary during theBush administration promoted national standards only to oppose them when theywere put forth by a Democratic White House            Over the past few yearseducation has receded as a subject of national concern A large part of theimpetus behind the education reform movement had been panic over UScompetitiveness in the international economy Today of course the USposition in the world economy is very strong MIT economist Lester Thurowrecently observed in the New York Times that as recently as  theUnited States had only one of the worlds  most valuable companies Lastyear it had nine Unfortunately the resurgence of US economic dominancemuch of which has less to do with American might than with financial turmoilin Asia was not accompanied by much improvement in the performance of USschools Education Week recently pronounced the chances werepractically nil that the  Charlottesville goals would be met by thetarget year of  An accompanying chart

science achievement            The outlines of Clintons education proposal are still abit vague They will be sketched in later this year when the White Housedrafts reauthorization language for the Elementary and Secondary Education ActBut at least as conceived at the moment the plan is to empower the federalgovernment to withhold funds to state education administratorsroughly percent to  percent of the  billion that the federal government spendsannually on public elementary junior high and high schools through thislawif the states schools are not taking steps to end certain harmfulpractices If the feds got really mad they could also withhold the actualfunds that go to schools although that is an unlikely last resort accordingto Gerald Tirozzi assistant secretary for elementary and secondary educationAmong these practices are social promotion whereby unqualified students arekicked up to the next grade level persistent low academic performance poordiscipline and the assignment of teachers to subjects for which they areunqualified This last aimed mainly at eliminating the issuing of emergencyteaching certificates appears to be a concession to the teachers unions butit will be accompanied by stricter requirements for testing new teachers Theplan also requires schools to issue in addition to report cards on individualstudents performance report cards on the schools overall academicperformance            Howls of protest aboutthe plans usurpation of local prerogatives have already begun Chester Finn asenior fellow at the Manhattan Institute who formerly worked in RonaldReagans Department of Education and who is sympathetic to many of Clintonsgoals insists The states are the constitutional authorities in educationSuch complaints already seem to have cowed the Clinton administration At areporters briefing on the plan earlier this week White House Domestic PolicyCouncil Director Bruce Reed said I think the headline writer for the NewYork Times got it wrongwere not for US control were for state andlocal control Actually the Times headline one hopes got it rightClinton To Urge More US Control on Aid to Schools Given that the aid inquestion comes from the federal government to begin withand when combinedwith about  billion in additional federal spending accounts for about percent of all money spent on public education from kindergarten through th gradedoesnt the federal government have aresponsibility to make sure the money is well spent Any state bent onkeeping its constitutional authority unmolested is always free to buy backits sovereignty by refusing federal education aid            In fact the whole notion that education should be purely alocal concern has long reflected Jeffersonian nostalgia more than it hasreality As Nicholas Lemann observed in the November Atlantic Monthly American public schools are rhetorically committed to decentralization but infact are centralized in a patchwork undeliberate way We have nationalstandardized tests national teachers unions national textbook publishersand national laws regulations and funding programs for schools And also hemight well have pointed out a national economy Jobs are not parceled outequally according to school districts A child being educated in Mississippineeds to be educated sufficiently to allow him to prosper in Ohio New Jerseyor wherever his future employment may be Sandra Feldman president of theAmerican Federation of Teachers which has lent its support to Clintons plansays There has been too great a difference between school districts andstates            Will Clintons plan be radical enough to have mucheffect As Finn rightly points out a similar but narrower penalty provision inthe  reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act hasnever been used although some states have received warnings none has lostfunds as is permitted under the law Theres some real danger that cosmeticreforms at the state levelmore programs no resultswill be enough to staveoff penalties under the new law Like most major education reforms in recentyears this one eschews testing of teachers who are already on the job as theprice for union support of testing for new teachers Finn may be right when heargues that to say were only going to deal with the new ones is to say wellsolve the problem  years from now Feldman counters that twothirds of thenations  million teachers will be retiring during the next decade Anothercause for disappointment is that the Clinton plan will not impose a nationalcurriculum which regrettably remains beyond the pale in any practicaldiscussion about education reform because of the ongoing culture wars amongChristian fundamentalists mainstream educators and multiculturalleftists            Still bully for Clintons Hail Mary pass if thatswhat he intends it to be As a lameduck president wholl count himself luckyto inhabit the Oval Office for two more years this is no time to play itsafe
