                um in Texas they do have the um capital punishment and um i i just i im probably one that has to agree with it too um therere are some things that go on that i just feel that i i just feel that that that that is a need i dont i dont know a lot of people dont feel that way either but i just feel that that   well i dont know how much publicity its gotten outside of the state but California we just put somebody to death   umhum   um for i think it was a double murder uh to be honest i didnt pay that much attention uh to the details of it um   but it had a lot of controversy out here uh basically because in California people like to protest about everything um but i agree i believe that that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go um   umhum   the big disagreement i have is that in California the appeals process uh is so extensive and takes so long that you end up spending a huge amount of money in like ten to fifteen years before you can actually you know put somebody to death for for a crime   yeah yeah that is a consequence yeah   and i mean thats thats ridiculous i mean if you can you know you you the trial is supposed to prove you know within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty and then they have appeals well thats fine but it shouldnt take more than a few years i mean i should think two or three years maximum you should be able to know and you should be able to either put the guy to death   right   or hes innocent i mean its if hes guilty for for you know multiple murders or whatever the case may be you know   right umhum well maybe thats something that needs to be worked on but i i just feel that that   yeah   capital punishment needs to stay within the system not all states have them but i you know was that was that the im not sure if that was in was that the man that that claimed he was abused or   yeah he was like um the the the defense the defense theyre were giving given was that uh like his mother had had been an alcoholic when when she was pregnant with him and so he he wasnt you know mentally competent or anything else   and that he had some he oh yeah yeah   which is ridiculous and and the court found him competent um and he knew what he was doing and everything else i mean you know it was it was the best defense they could come up with   yeah and how long had he been appealing appealing how long was that   i forget i think it was something like twelve years or something   gosh boy   it was it was something really outrageous   yeah boy well i mean and it seems like it it rarely does happen you know its not its not used that often you know at least here in Texas but i think its something that needs to stay i really do   yeah i think in general uh punishment in the United States is a lot weaker than it should be i mean it needs to be you know its kind of like the the the justice system in the United States is kind of like the dog poops on the carpet and you wait three months and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it   yeah   you know i mean theres theres no connection between the two   right right yeah   i mean you take these you know most of the people who are committing violent crimes most of them not all by any means but you know a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place   umhum   um they dont really see past next week much less next year and to say you know well if i kill somebody then a decade from now i might face the punishment   umhum yeah   thats not real it doesnt have any real impact on them   my sister and i were wondering about this recently because a an old friend of ours in California this just happened about a week ago um her husband just killed her and were wondering if that has an effect   umhum   if that if something does capital punishment you know does it happen with that within that uh i dont know   um you you mean would he be put to death for that   right   um largely depends on the circumstances and generally you know from what i understand its its only the most brutal types of things usually where its multiple you know   i think youre right   if if they can say things like you know well he was just you know temporarily insane because of some domestic squabble then   umhum   you know theyll theyll give him you know twenty years with with parole in in twelve or something like that   yeah yeah and uh i have an uncle that is an attorney that defends uh people on
