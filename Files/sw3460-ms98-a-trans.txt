                okay um what do you consider an invasion of privacy   um i was just now told thats what the topic was and um i guess invasion of privacy uh to me for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards   umhum   for example and uh i guess recently one of the TV stations here uh ran a series of uh news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a persons credit card numbers   thats very easy   and use it and i was quite surprised at that       i guess i can consider myself fortunate that uh it never happened to me i dont know what id really do if it did   no ive never ive never had that happen to me either what do you think about for instance like i was in Michaels the other night and charged something and they asked for my home phone even though you know the charge had been approved what do you think of that   um   does it bother you to give it   no not really because im listed in the phone book if i was the type of individual that uh had an unlisted number i i think i would be hesitant to give it   you know that they they now have a uh i believe its a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on a charge ticket   one of the things that upset me when i lived in California was uh they did a lot of things with your Social Security number   security number umhum   as a matter of fact they even went to the point of printing your Social Security number on your drivers license   oh   and they would not cash checks unless they had your Social Security number so we had our Social Security numbers imprinted on our checks   um umhum   and i was really you know unhappy about that situation i think that was an invasion of privacy   privacy yes yes i can see you know where that was i i dont mind my phone number and address or work phone being given you know when i have to cash a check i dont see any need for it when im charging something but i neither am i a person that  has the guts to say no im not going to give it to you either  you know and uh   right one of the biggest things i think thats going on in this country right now is the selling of uh mail lists and things like that   yes yes   you know uh recently we uh i purchased some magazines US News   umhum   and Forbes magazine   umhum   and every since that day i have been inundated with you know uh subscriptions to this subscriptions to that uh this news letter this investment letter uh even to the point of people calling me at home and prior to me ordering these magazines i never got those kind of calls   right right i discovered with uh charge cards um   and   i feel like that i dont know whether its the stores themselves that sell the list or whether the uh uh credit report bureau sells it but i get catalogs from people ive never even heard of and i know they have to be coming from my charge cards you know   umhum from some some list yeah   from from some list you know that knows that i have a say a charge account at at Neimans or something because then ill get catalogs that you know are within that range that i would never order from ordinarily and um   umhum right   you know and i get i get tired of that i because i look at all that junk mail and i think of how inept our post office is and how thats taking up  you know all their time to sort and theyre not even paying full postage   all their time sure   you know and if you did away with some of that our postal service might give better service   i think the general public would be you know uh tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for uh lets say the criminal individuals to to get access to peoples records um their credit cards drivers licenses checks things like that   right umhum   um i dont think anybody really knows what to do about it   no no um   computers ha caused a lot of this im sure   well you know lets face it computers can be gotten into very easily if you if you really have the the know with all if youre you know so inclined to uh oh what do i want to say have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that you know and have a basic knowledge theyre very easy to get into   sure seems as though they are yeah   to tap into a system uhhuh you know and uh which is scary i mean you know our lives are on computers   unfortunately   yeah and uh and i dont know i kind of i resent the the calls of an evening trying to sell me something uh   fortunately i havent uh havent uh been inundated with that situation yet   we are constantly it seems like i dont know why you know either wanting to clean our carpet sell us storm windows
