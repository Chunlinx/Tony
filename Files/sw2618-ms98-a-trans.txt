             well this is going to be very boring boring because i dont   hi you dont at all   no and uh unfortunately it shows i uh im supposed to im way overweight but uh ive had a problem with uh high blood pressure which of course is directly connected to it and my doctors trying to get my blood pressure under control   umhum   before i start in any exercising   or too much of it yeah yeah you need   so anyway i did join the uh uh the Texans up at uh   oh uhhuh   uh Springcreek   umhum   and ive been up there a few times but didnt accomplish too much because i just run down too quick   yeah i havent been up there um but i understand theyve got a nice pool and thats my favorite form of exercise is swimming   uh that would have to be mine i hate exercising its so boring   really     uh i would much prefer to like walk through the woods   oh yeah most of my my forms of exercise come in the form of a five year old and a two year old   uhhuh   and uh running after them or going biking with them or just exploring you know on a little exploration exploration hike you know through the neighborhood its amazing you know how many earthworms you can find and       and to a five year old theyre they never get old you know an earthworm every single time she finds one its uh its a brand new exciting activity for her   isnt it amazing   umhum it really is   well we um back when my my i have four sons theyre all grown now and and two of them are married with children of their own but when they were just uh pre teenagers we um   umhum   we decided the only way we could afford vacations is to go camping   oh yeah isnt it great   and we thoroughly enjoyed it i mean we went whole hog we had the tents and everything else and and pretty much roughed it sleeping on the ground and all   umhum   and uh i like to think that my children my sons learned a lot about uh the outdoors uh uh uh being selfsustaining   umhum   uh uh i would have no doubt what so ever that any one of them could be dropped in the middle of no where and theyd theyd exist exist somehow   well thats neat my uh my husband was uh was a boy scout and he uh actually went very far in the boy scouts and he was in The Order of the Arrow and he absolutely um you know the earth is is part of him and he is part of it and i think thats a real important thing and we we enjoy going camping we havent yet had them sleeping on the ground primarily because to them uh or to the five year old the two year old would freak out about it but she wouldnt quite get totally unnerved but the five year old still has a fear of spiders   uhhuh   and im afraid that if she woke up one with her we would have to pack up and come home  so weve primarily done our camping by cabin up at Turner Falls up in Oklahoma   oh wow well okay that is understandable oh yes im very familiar with it very beautiful place   isnt that a beautiful place   ive been up there several times   well it was up there actually that she got her fear of spiders because we sat and watched a tarantula for a long time we we you know wed never seen one   oh what a shame   or she had never seen one we my husband and i had but she wed never seen one as a family and so we just sat and watched it for the longest time it was you know removed from us by probably five or six feet so we werent concerned about it and we just sat and watched it and we explained you know how it did well that night she had a nightmare and she has been terrified of spiders since but we still go up there and we still have a great time   well good im glad to hear that about the only thing uh i might suggest is uh do the same thing again introduce her to a to a spider at a reasonable distance where she isnt frightened   umhum   and uh and that that that the the nightmare im sure was just a a freak ill bet it wouldnt happen again   i think not yeah i think it was you know being in a new place being kind of out of out of sorts and everything all combined but   sure   we uh thats you you know thats our favorite form of exercise is is life and we do our own yard you know we uh we we enjoy the activities that provide exercise both of us would love to exercise on a routine basis but our life doesnt um really have that much time in it so we just enjoy what we can along with our family you know   well that you couldnt pick a better way of doing it with your family   well yeah we have a   and and youre youre certainly all getting an education while youre doing this exercise   thats kind of how we feel about it we cant you know theres theres theres things that uh the only thing that is forever is the earth well  we hope its forever yeah and uh and you know therefore   as far as were concerned   it you know the girls can learn things in school about everything that is temporary but as far as really knowing the earth theres no other way to really learn it but to experience it   umhum   and we really have a great time with it im sure thats the way that you felt with your boys   oh definitely definitely it was a learning experience uh now we i guess we camped just about every public campground in the state of Florida   oh and Floridas absolutely wonderful for that i understand ive ive never lived there   oh yes yes yell they used to be but now theyre trying to really put it to the the the uh visitors i think theyre doing a very stupid thing   oh with Walt Disney World and   well they charge extra now they there was a time here a few years ago when they put an extra tax on all the campgrounds and the uh motels and hotels   um   so they are are uh you know really putting it to the visitors and people got a little fed up with it and they suddenly and suddenly the the foundling fathers of uh of Florida found out that they were losing beaucoup bucks people were going elsewhere for uh their vacations   by night they were trying to turn it too much into a business   exactly so they got rid of that tax in a hurry   oh thats good weve uh not been brave enough yet to brave that trip with these with the two small children  i mean you know in the car   uh yeah i can appreciate that   its its uh its you know getting up to Turner Falls or uh up to Lake Murray is about as far as weve really tried to go in a car we have gone down and uh uh gone down to the New Braunfels uh San well we were headed down to Sea World in San Antonio   umhum   and uh we stopped along the way and enjoyed ourselves along the way but um you know thats thats pretty much as far as weve tried with little ones   well the the trick is to stop frequently and let the kids get out and run   umhum   now uh im alone now myself and and i i have graduated from sleeping on the ground to uh going in a motor home   oh umhum   well the fact i live in it and theres just my dog and i now my dog is a wonderful traveler but i do have to stop for her quite frequently   umhum   and it works out fine i mean i stop im never in a hurry to get anywhere   and no reason to be   like it takes me two days to get to Memphis   and thats thats not terribly far   no its uh its about an eight or nine hour drive really     yeah yeah   but uh i make it in two days because i i dont push it   well theres so many neat places along the way i mean youve got Arkansas you know and   oh definitely oh absolutely incidentally oh i cant remember the name of that place theres a beautiful park up there and they do have a uh uh oh sort of a hotel a lodge a lodge thats what it is   umhum umhum   and its just off the interstate and the kids would love it because they have playgrounds for the children and all and they have uh several nature trails   its just off the interstate that goes through Hot Springs   uh its just below Hot Springs   um okay   oh   well that wouldnt even be a very far drive   its lake something   im not i i ought to look into it uh because we were kind of entertaining entertaining the thought of taking a uh you know like just a five or six day trip in the not too distant future to kind of kick off the summer   umhum   and i   well the next time you go across the state line or when you come back in be sure and stop at one of the Texas   uhhuh   welcome bureaus   umhum   and ask them for their literature on the the uh state national parks in the state of Texas   umhum   and youll youll get a collection from them the you wouldnt believe there were so many parks in the state   i probably wouldnt and ive lived here all of my life   well it it there there are so many for instance have you ever been out to Tyler State Park   oh yes i have i have been to Tyler that was one place we went when i was a child   all all right you   weve not taken our children though   theres a place to take them and uh oh good heavens up there just this side of Texoma Texoma not Texoma uh Texarkana   uhhuh Texarkana uhhuh   there are three or four state parks up there   we ought to head out       we uh   and theyre all great and and again theres the nature trails   umhum ah   for your exercising   right     we almost forgot our subject of the day there but be sure and stop at one of those Texas bureaus tourist bureaus and get their literature   yeah yeah well i certainly will Jack its been real its been real uh informative for me to talk with you and i i certainly enjoyed it   well its been my pleasure uh Gina Gina is that with a G   okay uhhuh it sure is   thats thats uh uh Italian heritage isnt it   i dont have any Italian heritage my my mother actually chose it because of Gina
