                                 Good Jobs at No Wages            Even many supporters of therecent welfare reform acknowledge a small flaw The new arrangement requireswelfare recipients to take jobs but does nothing to assure that jobs will beavailable President Clintons original notion of ending welfare as we knowit was to require work and also if necessary to supply it plus trainingday care health care etc But that kind of welfare reform costs more notless than just writing a check So the Republican version which Clintonsigned leaves out the second part of the equation It supplies less money notmore to the states frees them to cut off benefits and largely leaves thedetails to them to figure out            The states face quite achallenge in finding employment for all these people And the federalgovernment as is so often the case makes the task even harder withunnecessary jobdestroying regulations Many of these regulations have comeunder withering scrutiny in recent years by rightwing think tanksconservative editorial pages and Republican members of Congress Yet one suchpiece of federal red tape has escaped the criticism it deserves the thAmendment to the Constitution Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States Possibly due to misinterpretation byactivist judges this job killer forbids American citizensacting voluntarilyof their own free willto sell themselves into slavery Or to put it in termseven a liberal might understand It denies women the freedom to control theirown bodies albeit by selling them to someone else            Criticsof government welfare programs often ridicule the notion that people wouldstarve in the streets or die of untreated diseases without AFDC food stampsMedicaid etc Private charity they say will provide for truly needy casesWe may soon find out if this is correct However the logical defect is nothard to spot People are unlikely to invest in the feeding and care of othersif they are not in a position to reap the benefits But this defect can beeasily remedied            An analogy might be made to the situation ofelephants in Africa In  under pressure from groups alarmed by thedestruction of African elephant herds President Bush banned the import ofivory Most of the rest of the world soon followed and the ivory trade wasdevastated The best thinking now is that this was a bad idea because itdestroyed any incentive Africans might have to nurture and protect the elephantherds A better approach is to make sure that the elephants human neighborshave a commercial stakethrough reasonably regulated hunting and ivorysalesin seeing the herds thrive That way you can turn what heretofore havebeen liabilities into assets as an article in the American Spectatoronce explained            SimilarlyAmericas welfare recipients can be turned from social liabilities into socialassets The best way to assure that private individuals will come forward tosupply food and health careand even job trainingto those who are about tobe freed from their debilitating dependency on government is to allow thesegiving individuals to acquire an economic interest in the nutrition healthand skills of the former welfare recipients The employment arrangements thathave been traditional in this country since  are obviously not adequate tothe task because there is nothing to stop a healthy wellfed welltrainedpersononce raised up to this desirable state through privatesectorinitiativefrom taking her services elsewhere Repealing the  thAmendment would solve this problem by allowing people to contractually committheir future good health and skills to an employer            Rich people it should be noted already havethis ability Various devices such as bonuses and stock options enablecompanies to reasonably assure themselves of the continuing employment of keyexecutives without violating the  th Amendments onerous ban onwhat should more accurately be called contracts of permanent employment Butpoor people are usually not in a position to demand stock options Thereforethey are unable to make a convincingly binding commitment to an employer The th Amendment prevents it As is so often the case a seeminglycompassionate government regulationenacted with the best of intentionshasthe effect of hurting the very people it was intended to help            Beyond its practicaleffects repeal of the  th Amendment would restore to everyAmerican what we now know is the most important freedom of all freedom ofcontract The issue of a persons Godgiven right to contract for his or herpermanent future employment is really an extension of the recently concludeddebate over the minimum wage Although the reactionary forces of Big Labor andBig Government won that battle House Majority Leader Dick Armey was ofcourse absolutely right to note again and again and again that the effect ofa minimum wage is to deny workers the opportunity to contract for theirservices at a price employers are willing to pay            Clearly abolition of theminimum wage as Armey and others advocate would be an important step infulfilling Americas promise of a job for everyone who wants to work and forthat matter everyone who doesnt want to work But it is only a first stepOne might argue that abolishing the minimum wage is close enough torelegalizing slavery since it would free people to work at whatever wage theychoseincluding no wage at all But this alone would not liberate people tocommit their future labor in a way that potential employers can reasonably beexpected to rely on Only a contract can do that a contract of permanentfuture employment which the employer can call upon the government to use itspowers to enforce if necessary Now that Washington has stopped guaranteeingwelfare benefits a compassionate government surely owes its poorest citizensno less than this
