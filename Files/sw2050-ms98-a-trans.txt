        well i havent uh ive been working in my own home for just um about the last three years but so i can just wear whatever i want around the house but before then i taught taught at the University of Houston and um   oh now thats nice yeah   so i tried to wear things that were comfortable but still tried to look you know   somewhat business attire yeah   yes but it wasnt quite business but to give the the students um an made you feel like you were the authority i felt like if i came in just in jeans or tattered clothes that i didnt have as good control over the class   right   right   and if i tried to wear things that were a little bit more businesslike   exactly well i i work uh im a financial analyst and uh uh   umhum   in my group uh nearly everyone wears a a sports coat and tie uh but that does change in the summer uh they they get a little more lenient and we can wear like uh an open collar or uh   uhhuh   a lot of times in the summer ill try to uh like on a Friday ill try to take off half a day and maybe go play some golf   oh thats nice   so uh ill try to wear a short sleeve shirt and uh um and that thats okay thats appropriate   well do you um meet with clients and so you have to dress a certain way for the clients or   not really its uh its just uh in our small group we uh we have a controller and uh we support a senior vice president and uh the senior vice president is uh   umhum   is big on business attire and so um um he sort of funnels that down to uh to the people that work in his group so um i i i enjoy it i think it uh it makes a nice environment and uh i dont know gives it a little more business type uh atmosphere   well i uh i have noticed with my own children for example that they will depending on what theyre wearing it it makes a big difference on how they act and so that could be the same can be said for the business office too   right see i think thats exactly right you know if if youre uh if youre dressed in a uh a suit and uh to me it make it helps me feel uh sort of like you were saying a lot more confident in myself   umhum umhum   and uh if i do have to approach the uh the controller or the vice president i feel i just have that little little extra confidence in myself being dressed that way   well and i noticed in my uh teaching experience that since a lot of the people were my own age or older even um that because i taught English as a second language so i didnt have your average freshman student and um so i   oh i see   i had to do something to just elevate myself a little bit off their level i mean you want to be friends with the students but you dont quite want to be their equal   exactly   and so for me to dress in uh in businesslike um clothes my you know i i preferred slacks because we had to walk park pretty far away from   oh Lord and down in Houston itd be so hot yeah   yes and you wouldnt want to have to walk uh you know in high heels its hard to walk a long way and the campus is pretty large   right i see   so i preferred slacks and um you know kind of dressy shirts and things but   right   so that i would look a little bit different and i would come in and i would have just the appearance of a little bit more authority than they did and that helped with their discipline and   right i see   didnt make me have um to much trouble and   right right   with the students   and i think clothing you know it it just uh it it does like you were saying the the way you dress makes you feel different ways um if you like when you go out at night uh you may just want to have a casual evening or something so you you sort of dress down but if youre going to a uh   umhum   a social type party then you dress up and that i think it just has a a change on your attitude   well and i i noticed since we moved down here to Texas my husband is originally from Texas but uh im not and that you dont have to have uh such a wide variety of seasonal clothes that you do up north where you have to   i see im im sure thats true yeah   totally different wardrobe with different fabrics you know heavier wools and   right yeah see the winter seasons just not that long to to invest a whole lot of money in in uh   and   in the the heavier heavier materials   no and you dont um you know if you usually can wear pretty close to the same types of things just with a jacket or sweater   right   or something rather than having the whole entire different wardrobe with   exactly exactly   different shoes you know we always had like um higher higher shoes higher tops on them rather than just um the lower   right   skimmers skimmers i think they call them that you would wear daytoday but   and see i think ladies clothing um uh is a lot more varied than than than mens clothing because uh men or at least in my situation you can uh i can wear the same slacks and uh sports coats nearly nearly all year round   umhum   and uh ladies you know uh uh i dont know if thats marketing or what but they they definitely have a uh i think a a winter type wardrobe and then a spring and then a summer   thats really true a lot of it is um the color certain colors seem to be more acceptable   true   you know if you wear um pastels its needs to be warm weather   right   and otherwise you have to wear darker colors in the winter for some reason and i guess part of that is um just the physics of it that in what isnt it dark colors attract the sun and light colors repel repel them so   right exactly plus the social attitude you know if if you walk into a place and and uh i know in our office uh our secretary gives everyone a hard all the ladies a hard time if they wear white shoes i think its uh is it after uh Labor Day or something i dont know and and uh so you know the the social attitude has a little bit to do with uh i think the way we dress     umhum thats true theres some rule thats like between Labor Day uh no is it Labor Day or Memorial Day   im not for sure its that one in September is when you need to quit   uhhuh right and the one thats like in May you can only wear and and supposedly we dont have an opportunity my husband and i we dont go to a lot of like where you have to wear   yeah right   a white dinner jacket or something and so you can only wear a white dinner jacket between those two   i see right exactly exactly   holidays too thats pretty funny its funny that we have as a society       go to so much trouble when we have so many other things we could be spending our time thinking about   exactly a lot more uh th ats right a lot more helpful ideas that we could be uh spending time and effort on rather than our appearance   umhum yes i noticed uh when we moved to Plano that um the mall here Collin Creek Mall i dont know where you are but um   right i live here in Plano yeah   oh you do that there there is a pretty um i wouldnt say snobbish  but it its kind of borders on that that if i depending on what im wearing i get better service at the mall i felt since     oh really huh   uh where you know from where ive lived in Houston that you have to in order to get   yeah   the attention you might need help   right   you need to be you cant just come in off the street is what im trying to say   exactly and i think thats you know a North Dallas type attitude   oh is it   and uh because i noticed that uh like even going to church uh seems like people really dress up a lot more uh here in North Dallas going to church   umhum   and uh i dont know thats thats uh because i i went to school with at uh Texas Tech in Lubbock   umhum   and uh church was a a lot more casual uh rather than uh you know here its like going to a fashion show almost   yes i think i think your right ive noticed that too its just its very different but ive i think um its kind of sad when you have to go in and make dress up to go somewhere i mean just to the shop   right to try to keep up with the Jones almost yeah     yeah and you have to be sure that your everything coordinates and everything everything is um freshly pressed and everything   right you cant just wear your sweats and an old Tshirt and   no you cant just drop in well i appreciate um the conversation weve had about clothing i know ive its interesting to hear a mans point of view its usually my husband     right     hes got a pretty good deal i go out and buy all his clothes  and they magically     well now that is that is so uh well that is great i appreciate the call   well thank you and you have a good day okay byebye   you too byebye
