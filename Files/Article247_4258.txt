                                 Clichs of  in Review                           Introduction                        Chatterboxs request that readers submit nominations for the First AnnualJoseph Heller Memorial Clich Contest  yielded a huge response Whatexplains Web readers great interest in clichs Perhaps its a rebellionagainst the printing press a technology whose usefulness is now beingchallenged by the Internet Clichwhich according to the Oxford English Dictionary is French for to clickrefers to the striking of melted lead in order to obtain a proof or castThat is it describes a process of  printmaking in which a metal plate is castfrom something else a woodcut a plaster mold and then used to make copiesThe English term for this process is stereotype  which has acquired a similarpejorative meaning Of course Web aficionados should take care not to betoo scornful of the oldstyleprinting presss capacity to reproduce images ad absurdum  since the Web has vastlyexpanded it Indeed its quite possible that in the next century the termsclich and stereotype will be supplanted by new terms derived from theInternet We may find ourselves saying Im sick to death of  html like be there in a San Jose minute orAndroids resent being homepaged asunfeeling simply because theyre manufactured rather than born In themeantime clichobsessed readers may wish to consult the many clichorientedsites available on the Web These include the Clich Finder The Book ofClichs Cirque de Clich Steves Clichs SportsClichs MovieClichs  Dutch Clichs and the Web page of DavidClich an official

Also readers methods for countingcitations varied greatlysome used Nexis some used Dow Jones News Retrievalsome used Yahoo and so on In the end Chatterbox took the advice of readerJosh Green a graduate of Northwesterns Medill School of Journalism which every summercalculates the years biggest political clich by using the search engine forthe CongressionalRecord  Chatterbox took the better entries from readers and pluggedthem into the Record s search engineto see how often they were uttered in Congress between Jan  and Dec                             And the Winner Is                         Inappropriate  submitted byThomas E Ricks defense reporter for the Washington Post and authorof Making the Corps  This term made more appearances inthe Congressional Record  thanany other word or phrase nominated at least among the ones Chatterbox botheredto check Inappropriate easily outstripped evil a word that appeared inthe Congressional Record a mere times thoughWilliam Bennett Gertrude Himmelfarb and other denouncers ofmoral relativism take note it still lagged behind wrong which appeared inexcess of  times the CR searchengine doesnt count beyond three digits            What was inappropriate in The designation of several nonemergency categories of spending as emergencyspending according to a resolution submitted by Sens Phil Gramm OlympiaSnowe and Russell Feingold proposed oil drilling along the California coastaccording to Rep Randy Duke Cunningham Bill Clintons relationship withMonica Lewinsky according to a resolution submitted by several Democraticsenators lots of arts funded by the National Endowment for the Artsaccording to Rep Ron Packard sex between children and adults according toa House resolution endorsed by just about everybody that apparently came out ofa broadcast by radio therapist Dr Laura Schlessinger and many many other things            It must be said however that the rate at which Congress is deeming thingsinappropriate  is down slightlyfrom the  session when during a twoyear period the word inappropriate  appeared in the CR  times To hold steady inappropriate  would have had to appear times                           Runnersup                        At the end of the day  is aphrase that drove several                   Slate                readers bonkers this yearChatterbox had thought it old hat it dates back at least to the Bushadministration but the phrase appeared  times in the CR database for  ranking it second amongall submissions Thats an increasein its frequency of appearance over the previous congressional session whenthe word was uttered only  times during a twoyear period At this ratelawmakers will end up talking about theend of the day  times before the current session ends in Dec  Manythanks to readers Bill Moran Darren Thorneycroft and Nicholas Lemann authorof The Big Test  for flagging this one            Robust  came in third amongwords and phrases submitted  citations in the CR  and unlike the previous two it seems tobe a genuinely new clich at anyrate Chatterbox hadnt previously been aware of its overuse  Like at the endof the day its use is on the upswing one might even call it robust  with only  citations during theprevious congressional session According to John Burke who submittedrobust  it is                                             The most overused

       Agreed                           Clichs to watch in                         Many excellent nominations failed to garner as many CR citations as Chatterbox expected Theseinclude wakeup call  above my pay grade  paralysis byanalysis  new facts on the ground  and mano a mano   which as reader Jay Bridapointed out is always misused its Spanish not for man to man but hand tohand These are all comers in Chatterboxs view             Personal friend of Chatterbox
