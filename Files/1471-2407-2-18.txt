                    Background        With one million new cases each year breast cancer is        the most common cancer among women and is the leading cause        of death in women  to  years of age in the world        Breast cancer results from genetic and environmental        factors including diet radiation and hormones                The molecular events involved in breast carcinogenesis        however remain to be elucidated        Numerous studies have shown that polypeptide growth        factors such as insulinlike growth factors IGFs are        mitogens for breast cancer cells        The IGFI        and IGFII signal through a common tyrosine kinase        receptor the insulinlike growth factor  receptor        IGFR and have mitogenic and cell survival actions that        may promote tumor development Modulation of this mitogenic        pathway occurs in part via the MPIGFR which functions        in the internalization and degradation of IGFII            MPIGFR is also important in activation of TGF a        potent growth inhibitor for most cell types and in        binding transport and activation of lysosomal enzymes        such as cathepsins      It has been shown that        MPIGFR expression is significantly reduced in both rat        and human hepatocellular carcinomas     Loss of        hetorozygosity LOH at the MPIGF receptor gene locus on        q coupled with somatic point mutations in the        remaining allele has recently been demonstrated in liver        and breast cancers             In        addition somatic mutations of the MPIGFR gene were also        found in prostate cancer lung carcinoma and genetically        unstable cancers of the endometrium brain stomach and        colorectum          The findings of LOH and        mutations of MPIGFR in a wide variety of tumor types        have led to the proposition that the MPIGFR is a tumor        suppressor gene In addition to genetic data a tumor        suppressor gene candidate has to meet functional criteria        The functional characteristics of a tumor suppressor gene        have not been well established for MPIGFR Thus further        studies that address the relationship between the        functional MPIGFR level and cell growth activity are        needed        To verify whether decreased levels of functional        MPIGFR can provide a growth advantage for cancer cells        we used viral and ribozyme strategies to reduce the        expression of MPIGFR in human breast cancer cells and        then examined the effect on growth and apoptosis of these        cells                    Methods                  Construction of a recombinant adenoviral vector          containing the MPIGFRribozyme          A  bp MPIGFR ribozyme oligonucleotide          GAATTCTCCACACTGATGAGCCGCTTCGGCGGCGAAACATTCAACGCGT          and the corresponding reverse complementary strand were          synthesized The fragments were subcloned into pRz to          produce a plasmid designated as pRzIGFR containing a          ribozyme targeted against the MPIGFR For construction          of the recombinant adenovirus containing the          MPIGFRribozyme pAdGFPRzIGFR the segments          containing the ribozymes were amplified by PCR and cloned          into a pAdTrackCMV vector and then recombined          homologously with an adenoviral backbone pAdEasy  vector          to generate pAdGFPRzIGFR following the protocol          described by He et al     The pAdGFPRzIGFR          carries both the RzIGFR and GFP as reporter genes          each under the control of separate cytomegalovirus CMV          promoters Another viral vector pAdGFP which carries          the GFP gene only under the control of the CMV promoter          was generated and used as a control vector The          adenoviral vector DNA were linerized with Pac I and          transfected into the replicationpermissive  cells          EA transcomplementing cell line using Lipofectamine          Life Technologies to produce Edeleted          replicationdefective recombinant adenovirus as described          previously     Largescale amplification of the          recombinant adenovirus in  cells was followed by          purification using a discontinuous CsCl gradient The          constructs were confirmed by enzymatic digestion and DNA          sequencing

       EDTA pH  and  mgml each          bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol Cleavage products          were analyzed on  polyacrylamide and  M urea          denaturing gels NIH Imager was used to quantitate          product and substrate fragments                          Cell cultures and infection with AdGFPIGFRRz          and AdGFP          MCF cells were cultured in DMEM medium containing           FBS at C in a tissue culture incubator with  CO            and  relative humidity Cells          were used for experiments after  days in culture          Viral infections were carried out by adding viral          particles at various concentrations usually             virus particlesml to culture medium containing  FBS          Initially optimal viral concentration was determined by          using AdGFP to achieve an optimal balance of high gene          expression and low viral titer to minimize cytotoxicity          After  hrs of incubation the infection medium was          replaced with normal  FBS culture medium For          treatment with IGFII cells were incubated with  ngml          IGFII after infection with AdGFPIGFRRz or AdGFP          Seventy two hrs post infection cells were used for          analysis of MPIGFR gene expression and its effect on          cell growth                          Analysis of MPIGFR gene expression in MCF          cells          The MPIGFR transcripts were determined by RTPCR          using the GeneAmp EZ rTt RNA PCR kit Roche Total RNA          was extracted from cultured cells using an RNA isolation          kit Qiagen according to the manufacturers protocol          MPIGFR transcripts were amplified using primers          GACAGGCTTGTCCTGAGTTA and TTCTGCTCTGGTTCTGCATG           specific to the MPIGFR receptor Each RTPCR assay          was performed in triplicate Primers specific for human          actin cDNA were added to a parallel reaction to          standardize for variations in PCR between samples PCR          products were resolved on a   agarose gel visualized          under UV light and quantitated using NIH Imager                          Measurement of I IGFII internalization          Cells were incubated at C

described above                          Cell proliferation assay MTT assay and cell          counting          MCF cells were grown in culture plates tissue          culture grade  wells flat bottom in a final volume          of  ml serumcontaining culture medium per well in a          humidified atmosphere at C and  CO            for  days After infection with          AdGFPIGFRRz or AdGFP cells were incubated with or          without  ngml IGFII for  days  l MTT labelling          reagent were added to each well and incubated for  hrs          followed by addition of  ml solubilization

      with wavelength of  nm In addition the total          number of viable cells in each treatment group was          counted by a trypan blue exclusion method using a          hemocytometer                          Analysis of cell apoptosis          MCF cells were infected with AdGFP or          AdGFPRzIGFR Seventy two hrs post infection cells          were treated with TNF  ngml for  hrs Apoptotic          cells were identified by Hoechst staining using the          Vybrant Apoptosis Kit  Molecular Probes according to          the manufacturers protocol In addition after infection          with AdGFP or AdGFPRzIGFR and treatment with TNF          cell viability was assessed using the MTT assay Kit          Roche Molecular Biochemicals and cell apoptosis was          determined using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Kit assay          Roche Molecular Biochemicals according to the          manufacturers protocol                          Statistical analysis          Studentss ttest was used to evaluate the difference          between two values Each experiment was repeated at least          three times Statistical significance was accepted at the          level of p                              Results                  Cleavage reaction of the ribozyme in vitro          The MPIGFR ribozyme we constructed has bp          binding arms complementary to the target site of          MPIGFR mRNA and a catalytic core Fig A To          evaluate the bioactivityspecificity of the ribozyme and          the accessibility of the target site a cleavage reaction                    in vitro was performed The          substrates  P labeled RNA transcripts containing           bp of MPIGFR mRNA or an unmatched sequence were          incubated with the ribozyme as described see Materials          and Methods The ribozyme cleaved only the MPIGFR          mRNA into the expected products In this assay the          hammerhead ribozyme was able to cleave about  of the          MPIGFR target within  hr of incubation and by           hrs more than  of the MPIGFR target was converted          to the expected products Fig B These results          indicate a high efficiency and specificity of the          ribozyme           in vitro                           Expression of the MPIGFRribozyme in cultured          MCF cells          To test whether infection of cultured cells with the          AdGFPRzIGFR can induce the expression of the ribozyme          RzIGFR total RNA was extracted from cells infected          with AdGFPIGFRRz or AdGFP and subjected to RTPCR          using ribozymespecific primers As shown in Fig           infection of MCF cells with AdGFPRzIGFR resulted in          positive expression of the ribozyme as determined by          RTPCR As expected the ribozyme sequencespecific          primers produced a bp PCR fragment only in cells          infected with AdGFPRzIGFR but not in cell infected          with the control viral vector AdGFP                          Ribozyme treatment reduces MPIGFR expression in          MCF cells          To examine the ability of the ribozyme to reduce          levels of MPIGFR mRNA in MCF cells total RNA was          extracted from cells infected with AdGFPIGFRRz or          AdGFP and subjected to RTPCR using MPIGFRspecific          primers A primer specific for human actin was added to          a parallel reaction to serve as an internal standard          Cells were used  hrs post infection with average          infection efficiency of  for which a viral dose          used had minimal cytotoxicity The RTPCR product of          MPIGFR was  bp and the actin product was  bp          As shown in Fig  the AdGFPRzIGFRinfected cells          exhibit a significantly lower level of MPIGFR mRNA          than AdGFPinfected cells with a reduction of about           There was no significant difference in the level of          MPIGFR mRNA between AdGFPinfected cells and          uninfected cells data not shown indicating that          infection with the adenovirus itself did not alter the          endogenous MPIGFR mRNA level These results          demonstrate that the ribozyme was highly effective in          suppressing MPIGFR expression in cultured MCF          cells                          Effect of ribozyme expression on the functional          activity of MPIGFR          To determine the effect of the ribozyme on the          functional activity of MPIGFR the binding and          internalization of exogenous IIGFII was measured in          cells infected with AdGFPRzIGFR or AdGFP As shown          in Fig A cells infected with AdGFPRzIGFR had a          corresponding reduction of  in IIGFII          internalization when compared with control cells          infected with AdGFP We also examined the effect of          the ribozyme on the MPbinding activity of the MPIGFR          using the MPbearing lysosomal enzyme glucuronidase          as a probe The results showed that the maximal          MPbinding capacity of MCF cells treated with the          ribozyme was about  less than that of controls Fig          B Furthermore we assessed the ability of MCF cells          to internalize exogenous glucuronidase after treatment          with ribozyme Similarly the MPinhibitable endocytosis          of glucuronidase by ribozymetreated MCF cells was          about  less than that of control cells Fig C          These results confirm that the number of functional          MPIGFR in ribozymetreated cells was reduced                          Effects of MPIGFRribozyme expression on          proliferation of MCF cells          We examined the effects of ribozymeinduced MPIGFR          downregulation on the growth of cultured MCF cells We          did not observe any difference in cell growth between          GFPonly infected and noninfected cells data not          shown Thus all subsequent experiments were performed          using GFPonly infected cells as control Assessment of          cell proliferative activity by MTT assay and counting of          viable cells data not shown indicated that the number          of MCF cells in ribozymeexpressing cultures was          significantly higher than that in control cultures Fig           These differences in growth pattern and cell number          were even more significant when the cultures were treated          with exogenous IGFII  ngml supplemented to culture          medium Fig  These results suggest that decreasing          MPIGFR expression by the ribozyme can enhance          proliferation of human breast cancer MCF cells via an          IGFIIrelated mechanism                          Effect of MPIGFRribozyme expression on          apoptosis of MCF cells          We examined the effects of ribozyme expression on          apoptosis of cultured MCF cells After treatment with          TNF as shown in Fig  a large number of control cells          underwent apoptosis as indicated by morphological          changes small round shape and bright blue nuclear          staining There were significantly more apoptotic cells          in control cultures than in cultures expressing the          AdGFPIGFRRz Accordingly the number of viable cells          as measured by MTT analysis in cultures infected with          AdGFPIGFRRz was significantly about  higher than          in cultures infected with AdGFP Fig A The number of          apoptotic cells as measured by the cell death ELISA          assay in cultures infected with AdGFPIGFRRz was          significantly about  lower than in cultures infected          with AdGFP Fig B These results are consistent with          the hypothesis that decreasing MPIGFR expression by          ribozyme treatment can reduce cell apoptosis                            Discussion        A growing body of genetic evidence suggests that the        MPIGF receptor is involved in carcinogenesis                          However direct        evidence of a growthregulatory activity for MPIGFR is        lacking In this study using ribozyme technology we        demonstrate an association of decreased expression and        function of the MPIGFR with increased cell proliferation        and decreased susceptibility to TNFinduced apoptosis in        human breast cancer MCF cells Expression of the ribozyme        targeted against the MPIGF receptor in MCF cells        resulted in downregulation of MPIGFR expression as        measured by RTPCR and MPIGFR function indicated by a        decrease in internalization of IIGFII and        glucuronidase binding and endocytosis Although we have        not ruled out a RNAi effect in cells the observed effects        are likely the consequence of the specific cleavage of        IGFR mRNA by the ribozyme we used        MTT analysis and viable cell counts showed that        ribozymemediated downregulation of MPIGFR also        resulted in increased cell proliferation Noticeably the        effect of ribozyme expression on cell growth was more        apparent in the presence of IGFII This result suggests        that the proliferative effect of MPIGFR downregulation        is likely the result of unchecked IGFII stimulation        Because the MPIGFR is believed to sequester and degrade        IGFII     a decrease in MPIGFR could result in        decreased degradation and hence increased bioavailability        of IGFII to the IGFI receptor which mediates the        growthpromoting effect of IGFII Supporting evidence for        the involvement of IGFII in the proliferative effect        resulting from loss of MPIGFR function comes from        studies of MPIGFR knockout mice MPIGFRnull mice        display global hyperplasia that coincides with elevated        levels of IGFII Most importantly however the lethal        nature of an MPIGFRnull phenotype is reversed in an        IGFIInull background     Although we did not measure        extracellular levels of IGFII our results show that        ribozymemediated downregulation of MPIGFR leads to a        decrease in IGFII internalization supporting the above        possibility        Our results also showed that MPIGFR downregulation        resulted in decreased sensitivity of MCF cells to        TNFinduced apoptosis Although we do not rule out the        potential contribution of the IGFII pathway to this        effect we would like to consider other potential        MPIGFRdependent mechanisms such as lysosomal proteases        and TGF signaling that may directly affect cell        sensitivity to apoptosis Recent evidence suggests that        lysosomal enzymes such as cathepsins B and D contribute to        TNFinduced apoptosis         in vitro       and         in vivo     The MPIGF        receptor has been shown to be involved in binding        transport and activation of lysosomal enzymes including        cathepsins      Therefore it is possible that        downregulation of the MPIGFR results in improper        trafficking and activation of cathepsins This in turn        would eliminate the apoptotic cascades triggered by these        enzymes under TNF stimulation and result in decreased        sensitivity of MCF cells to apoptosis        It has also been shown that TNF stimulation involves the        activation of TGF       a potent growth        inhibitor for many cell types and a ligand of MPIGFR In        fact activation of TGF requires the binding of latent        TGF to the MPIGF receptor     Therefore        downregulation of MPIGFR expression could also lead to        a decreased bioavailability of activated TGF thereby        decreasing the sensitivity of MCF cells to the TGF        apoptotic pathway A detailed mechanism of the observed        effect is currently under investigation                    Conclusions        Our findings that ribozymemediated decrease in        expression and functional activity of the MPIGFR result        in a growth advantage for MCF cells indicate that this        receptor acts as a negative regulator of cell growth This        is consistent with previous observations that MPIGFR        knockout mice displayed generalized increased growth and        cardiomygaly resulting from cardiac myocyte hyperplasia            and that antisensemediated reduction of MPIGFR        expression enhances tumorigenicity in JEG cells            Thus loss or mutation of MPIGFR may contribute to        development and progression of tumors via different        pathways by increasing the mitogenic activity of IGFII        and decreasing the apoptotic signaling of TGF and        lysosomal proteases Further studies using various cell        types or using animals are needed to address this issue        Ribozyme technology as we show here is a useful tool for        these studies                    Abbreviations        AdGFP adenovirus carrying GFP gene AdGFPRzIGFR        adenovirus carrying
