                    Background        Dystrophinopathies are Xlinked recessive diseases        caused by primary dystrophin deficiency and include        Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy DMD Becker Muscular        Dystrophy BMD manifesting DMDBMD carrier females        Xlinked dilated cardiomyopathy isolated quadriceps        myopathy muscle cramps with myoglobinuria and asymptomatic        elevation of muscle enzymes            The DMD gene spans  million base pairs of genomic DNA        on the X chromosome and its  kb transcript encodes a        fulllength protein dystrophin of  kiloDaltons        Dystrophin is a sarcolemmal protein that through its        interaction with many other proteins participates in the        linkage of the extracellular matrix to the cytoplasmic        cytoskeleton       Mutations in this gene result in        DMD BMD or other dystrophinopathy A major consequence of        the dystrophin genes large genomic size is a high rate of        mutation close to  of cases prove to be spontaneous        mutations     Approximately  of mutations causing        DMD are deletions of large segments of the gene usually        including one or more exons       Approximately  of        mutations are duplications of large segments of the gene            Large deletions and duplications are detected using        multiplexed PCR primers to amplify a subset of        approximately  of the  exons that are empirically        estimated to constitute  of large deletions and        duplications Thus most but not all large deletions and        duplications are detected by this test      The other         of mutations are presumed to be point mutations such        as substitutions deletions or insertions of one or        several nucleotides leading to premature termination codons        nonsense or frameshift mutations amino acid        substitutions missense and neutral mutations and        alterations in splice sites These mutations have remained        undetected in most patients both male and female because        available techniques are relatively expensive and laborious        given the size of the dystrophin gene Existing procedures        for detection of point mutations include SSCP single        strand conformational polymorphism      a variation        of SSCP called DOVAM Detection of Virtually All Mutations            Enhanced SSCP     HA Heteroduplex Analysis             PTT Protein Truncation Test     DGGE        Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis              chemical cleavage of mismatch     and RNase cleavage            Each of these procedures has its advantages and        limitations but the size of the gene and the cost of the        procedures have not made them routine in most        laboratories        The purpose of this project was to develop an effective        and convenient process to detect both large and small        alterations in the DMD gene with only a moderate increase        in cost In an effort to address these issues we developed        a new primer set to be used in conjunction with denaturing        highperformance liquid chromatography DHPLC and        dyeterminator sequencing DHPLC has been developed to        screen for DNA variations by separating heteroduplex and        homoduplex DNA fragments by ionpair reversephase liquid        chromatography     We used this technique to study        eight male patients and one female carrier relative of one        of the eight males Since this technique separates        heteroduplexes and homoduplexes it can also be used to        analyze manifesting and carrier females with point        mutations                    Results        We started the project with the intention of designing        primers to amplify and sequence all of the exons of the        dystrophin gene as well as the UTR and UTR In order        to ensure detection of splice site as well as exon sequence        alterations genomic sequence surrounding each of the        sequenceknown fragments of dystrophin was mined from the        NIH GenBank database Primers were designed see methods        that allowed for amplification of a product with           bases on either side of each exon To look for point        mutations eight patients were chosen as test cases based        on the absence of dystrophin clinical symptoms consistent        with DMD and no large deletion or duplication detected by        the multiplexed PCR test In addition one sister thought        to be a carrier female was also tested as described in the        methods and summarized in Table         Initially the primers were used to prepare amplicons of        dystrophin exons for direct sequencing Likely        diseasecausative mutations were found in four of the        patients and confirmed in the female relative of patient         by direct sequencing of exons  through  and the three        UTR fragments the last of which includes the dpm        promoter and exon  These were sequenced prior to our        obtaining the DHPLC system for screening When a likely        diseasecausative mutation was found in each of these        patients no further fragments were sequenced for that        patient Patient  and his carrier sister were shown to        have a CT substitution in exon  bp predicting a        nonsense mutation GlnStop leading to a likely        diseasecausative truncation of the protein Table and        Figure         Patient  has an  bp deletion in exon  and patient         is missing exon  which was not recognized until the        end of the project and had not been detected by the        multiplexed PCR test because exon  is not one of the        included exons in that test These two mutations both        create out of frame transcripts leading to eventual stop        codons and premature truncation of the protein Patient         has a CT substitution in exon  at bp  predicting        a nonsense mutation ArgStop leading to a likely        diseasecausative truncation of the protein Patient  has        a GT substitution at base  of the intron  splice        site This donor splice site is normally a G but in         sites examined in the human genome only  times is it a T            The predicted aberrant splicing of exon  makes        this a likely causative mutation in this patient        The DHPLC system was obtained halfway into the study and        four patients exons  through  and the UTR including        exon  were analyzed on the DHPLC system prior to sequence        analysis In the DHPLC system fragments are screened for        variation in retention time or chromatogram shape from that        of an unaffected control amplicon Fragments exhibiting        variation are then sequenced for confirmation and analysis        Two variations were detected by DHPLC both in exon  for        patients  and  Figure a only patient  shown        These two fragments were sequenced and a        nondiseasecausative GlnArg missense mutation at bp         was found in both patients As we found no likely        diseasecausative mutations in our first pass DHPLC        conditions we sequenced all four patients exons  and        the  fragments of the UTR the first of which contains        exon  Only two of the  fragments  patients x         fragments each sequenced showed alterations which were not        detected by the first pass temperatures chosen for DHPLC        analysis The first is a polymorphism  CT in        intron  in patient  The second is a probable novel        diseasecausative

position in the splice sequence making it likely that        exon  will be aberrantly spliced     When these two        fragments were run on the DHPLC system at the lower second        pass temperatures indicated in Additional file A Primer        sequences and DHPLC temperatures Excel spreadsheet the        alterations were detected Figure cand b In addition        the four previously identified mutations were confirmed on        the DHPLC system as was the carrier status of patient S        Figure         In total likely diseasecausative mutations were found        in six of the eight male patients and confirmed in the        carrier sister patient s of one of the six patients        patient  In addition one silent and five neutral        polymorphisms and six intronic alterations that have        previously been shown to be present in unaffected        individuals were found One silent polymorphism and eight        previously unreported intronic alterations were also found        In two patients  and  we did not find likely        diseasecausative mutations despite sequencing all         fragments                    Discussion        We used a combination of direct sequencing and DHPLC to        search for mutations in  patients with DMD and a carrier        sister Likely causative mutations were found in  of         males and confirmed in the carrier sister of one In our        study one likely causative mutation patient  del exn        was found just by PCR analysis and  likely causative        mutations were first detected by direct sequencing but each        was subsequently detected by DHPLC Our experience        indicates that the multiple different conditions of DHPLC        would have detected all of these likely causative mutations        and all polymorphisms Direct sequencing of all the        fragments is still more costly than DHPLC and our results        indicate that initial analysis using the far cheaper DHPLC        should precede sequencing thus reducing cost of the        analysis Causative mutations were not found in two of the        eight patients Due to the enormous size of the dystrophin        gene  million base pairs finding  of mutations is        improbable using these fragments because we cannot examine        all the sequences and situations that might affect        expression It is possible but unlikely that one of the        currently unknown alterations that we found in patients         and  will eventually be proven a causative mutation        rather than a polymorphism        Two of the patients in which we found diseasecausative        mutations have affected brothers three in addition to        patient  have potential carrier sisters and all six        have mothers who could also be carriers We have shown        that  using the DHPLC system it is now not only        feasible but actually a simple process to determine if any        of these relatives have the same point mutation as their        brotherson and  that carrier testing and prenatal        diagnostic testing is now available to any of these        patients who wish to use it        As larger cohorts of patients are tested a more        accurate estimate of the percentage of undetectable        causative mutations will emerge and present a clear new        challenge We estimate based on our small sample and other        unpublished data that such cases will comprise a small        percentage less than  percent of total DMD cases        Possible explanations for such cases include duplications        which we may have missed mutations in unknown enhancers or        translation modifiers hidden in exons or introns mutations        that create novel splice sites and changes in the coding        region which might be pathogenic but which due to our lack        of knowledge are thought to be polymorphic For example        changes to an amino acid that is essential for some        proteinprotein interaction potentially transportation        or is modifiedprocessed on the protein level but which we        currently assume is just a polymorphic change Other        possible mechanisms include mosaicism in which DNA        extracted from blood lymphocytes has different sequence        than DNA extracted from muscle cells and cryptic        chromosomal rearrangements These will require dedicated        efforts to resolve either individually case by case or to        develop new more comprehensive routine tests including        RNA and protein analysis Fortunately there are other        methods for detection of point mutations that can be        compared to or used in addition to the method presented        here including PTT     DGGE     and DOVAMS            More information on DGGE analysis of the DMD can be        found in the Leiden Muscular Dystrophy web site        httpwwwdmdnl        Clinical laboratories planning to begin testing for        point as well as large mutations must clearly evaluate        possible technologies in at least three areas        effectiveness convenience and cost        DHPLC followed by sequencing improves the effectiveness        of mutation detection from  using the existing        multiplexed PCR technology that detects large mutations        only to approximately  by including detection of        approximately  of point mutations as well Clinical        laboratories that are planning to screen cohorts of        patients using the technique presented here will produce        three important outcomes The first will be a more accurate        measure of the effectiveness of DHPLC screening for        sequence variation followed by direct sequencing The        second will be improvements in the conditions for mutation        detection using DHPLC As new mutations are discovered        they could be entered into the database along with any        suggested improvements to the DHPLC conditions for a given        fragmentalteration The third will be a collection of DNA        RNA and tissue from patients for whom all  fragments were        sequenced with no likely disease causing mutations        detected This will prove extremely useful for further        investigations into the more subtle causes of        dystrophindeficient muscular dystrophy Ultimately this        will provide procedures for the detection of mutations in        dystrophinabsent patients that will be more        comprehensive        The convenience of DHPLC followed by sequencing is        readily apparent It requires neither radioisotopes nor        ethidium bromide gels when combined with a core sequencing        facility or capillary sequencer See Additional file Bfor        details        We found that the cost of reagents for DHPLC screening        followed by direct sequencing was only moderately higher        than the cost for the existing multiplexed PCR test The        reagent cost of the existing multiplexed PCR diagnostic is        estimated at  per patient Increasing the percentage        of mutations detected in patients from the current  to        approximately  by including point mutations would come        at the moderate increase in reagent costs of approximately         per patient plus a moderate increase in other costs        such as consumables and technician time Although the        initial investment in a DHPLC system is not minimal at        approximately  the cost can be amortized over many        patients and the DHPLC system can be used in the molecular        diagnosis of many other diseases in addition to DMD The        same of course is true for the purchase of an automated        sequencer Details of the reagent costs per patient        calculations are attached as Additional file A Briefly we        assumed that likely diseasecausative mutations would be        found on average within approximately  fragments We        calculated the cost of reagents per l PCR and the cost        of reagents to run a sample on the DHPLC system and        multiplied by the number of samples required to screen a        patient We estimated that there will be four fragments per        patient that require sequencing We calculated the reagent        costs to amplify purify and sequence these four strands        per patient in both directions We then combined the cost        of the existing multiplex test for  of patients with        the cost of DHPLC screening followed by direct sequencing        for  of patients to arrive at an average cost per        patient and the increase over the average cost per patient        for the existing multiplexed PCR test alone                    Conclusion        Point mutations can be found in both DMDBMD male        patients and asymptomatic or manifesting DMDBMD carrier        females via an effective and convenient process using        automated DHPLC screening for variation and direct        sequencing for confirmation and analysis at a moderate        increase in cost per patient We have shown that it is now        feasible for clinical laboratories to begin testing for        both point mutations and large mutations in the dystrophin        gene using this or one of the other available methods for        mutation detection The detection rate for all mutations in        the DMD gene can be increased from the present  to above                            Materials and Methods                  Patient materials          After reviewing medical records we studied eight male          patients who had been diagnosed as having DMD based on          pathology lab report disease progression and          abnormalities in the level of dystrophin expression          either by immunofluorescence or western blot analysis In          each patient no large deletion or duplication was          detected using the currently used primers This current          set consists of primers to amplify the dpm promoter          including exon  and exons                            Although none of          the patients had a family history of DMD all were          determined to be highly likely to have dystrophin gene          mutations as opposed to other genetic causes of muscular          dystrophy see Table           Genomic DNA was prepared from whole blood using the
