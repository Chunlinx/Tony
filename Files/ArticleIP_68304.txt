                                 The Russian Military            In  the Soviet armysaved the world from Nazism by holding Stalingrad while the Germans pounded itto rubble Today that armys delinquent stepchild the Russian army isfighting a city battle of its own The Russians are pounding their own cityGrozny to rubble and are murdering Russian civilians in the process Theirconquest of Grozny which should conclude by the end of January will completea methodical campaign of brutality Since October more than  Russiantroops have inched through Chechnya leveling villages with lowprecisionartillery and dumb bombs This pacification has killed many Chechenguerrillas and civilians and has turned most of the survivors into refugeesIn its indiscriminate use of firepower against civilian targets it is as badas anything since World War II says Lani Kass a professor of militarystrategy at the National War College            No matter The war against the Chechens who aredespised as Muslim terrorists in slavic Russia is wildly popular proof thatRussian military power is returning Chechnya is payback for Afghanistan forthe first humiliating Chechen war of  and for NATOs bombing of SerbiaThe armys triumph will ensure Vladimir Putins election as president in MarchIt has already restored the militarys prestige and budget            But the notion thatChechnyas rape represents a return of Russian military glory is preposterousRussia is turtling through Chechnya partly because it doesnt have enoughcompetent troops to fight more quickly Russia can rely on only about skilled soldiers in an army of  Analysts believe that Russia couldmuster one or two decent army divisions out of a paper strength of divisions            Russias military is a lumpen army the dregs ofdregs Conscription remains mandatory but more than  percent of youngRussians avoid it The enlisted ranks fill with the stupid the sick and thecriminal These soldiers are little better than cannon fodder Russia makes noserious effort to train them because it doesnt have qualified noncommissionedofficers and its officers cant control the conscripts Hazing is unbelievablybrutal More than  soldiers are murdered every year by theirbrothersinarms and more than  kill themselves because of the horrificconditions            Pay is laughably smalland usually in arrears Russia has shelved its longstanding plan to switch to avolunteer army because it cant pay enough to recruit soldiers According tothe CIA Russia spends only onesixth as much on the military as the SovietUnion did during the s Clothing and rations are scarce Navy servicemenhave starved to death Alcoholism is rampant as soldiers drink everything theycan get their hands on In the s the Mig was nicknamed the FlyingRestaurant because crews would drain and drink its alcoholbased hydraulicfluid Hepatitis flourishes because troops dont know how to dig latrines Thearmy is a kingdom of darkness says US Army War College professor StephenBlank            Russia cant afford to equip its socalled soldiers Only atiny fraction of Russian materiel is equal to modern Western equipment Russialacks uptodate communications computers and precision munitions Muchhardware remains from the Soviet buildup but most of it doesnt work Soldierscannibalize spare parts to keep a few vehicles working Pilots lack the fueland equipment to fly training missions Russian arms plants still produceexcellent weapons for export antiship missiles for example but the Russianmilitary cant afford to buy any of them            Russian conventionalforces have grown so flaccid that Russia has altered its nuclear policy Itused to abjure firstuse of nukes Now firstuse is an essential part ofmilitary doctrine because Russia knows it cant defend itself conventionallyThe only good news about the military is that it has regained secure controlover its active nuclear weaponsthough not over discarded nuclear materialEven the Pentagon which has long featherbedded its budget by inflating theMoscow threat has largely stopped pretending that Russia can endanger USmilitary interests The Russian army is no longer the great Russian bear but arather vicious ferret says Mark Galeotti a Russian military analyst atBritains Keele University            This military has decayed immeasurably since the glory daysof the Mighty Red Army The Russian army broke Napoleon Soviet troops inWinston Churchills words tore the guts out of the Nazis US officialscertainly exaggerated the competence of the Soviet military during the ColdWar but it was still a great force  million men under arms a to tankadvantage a to aircraft advantage The Red Army was the only institutionthat matched the Communist Party in prestige The best and brightest joined theofficer corps There were  applicants for every slot at some militaryschools The state pampered officers with special stores chauffeured cars anddachas             The Czarist and Sovietarmies were not artful but they were often effective weak on offense strongon defense They performed poorly in farflung adventures the RussoJapaneseWar for example but savaged invaders when the Motherland was under attackThey mastered bruteforce warfare throwing huge numbers of troops tanks andshells at the enemy The USSR won World War II by losing  millionsoldiers            The Afghanistan invasion vanquished the myth of Sovietmilitary invincibility and aroused the popular mistrust of the army thatpersists today The breakup of the USSR shattered the army into  piecesas Russia lost nukes ships bases and many of its best officers to newlyindependent republics In the postSoviet chaos youngsters found more ways toduck conscription and the quality of the average soldier plummeted BorisYeltsin who didnt trust the army further damaged it by elevating theinterior ministrywith its hundreds of thousands of soldiersas a separateindependent foundation of military power The first Chechen war dealt the finaldisgrace The hardened rebels slaughtered Russias illprepared men ambushingthem by the hundreds in Grozny Russian mothers traveled to Chechnya pulledtheir sons off the front lines and brought them home            Russias generals andpoliticians essentially ginned up the new Chechen war as a confidence builderRussia has reason to invade Chechnya The rebellious province has beenagitating to form a separate antagonistic Muslim state But Russia was itchingfor an excuse to attack When Chechens raided the Russian territory ofDagestan and bombs wrecked Moscow apartment buildings the army seized theopportunity Many suspect that the bombings were staged to marshal support forwar Because it is a winatallcosts war to restore military prestigeRussian generals have shown utter indifference to civilian casualties and awillingness to lie to retain popular support Russia for exampleconsistently undercounts its war dead The West tolerates Russias atrocitiesbecause it has no choice and because it is better for Russia to take out itsaggression on its own citizens than to go adventuring abroad            The Shermans march through Chechnya is not just boostingRussian military pride It is also increasing the militarys political cloutThe Russian military has long been politically quiescent because a tradition ofprofessionalism pervades the officer corps But the general staff insisted thatPutin grant them total freedom to prosecute the war Putin who wants a victoryto boost his own prospects granted it essentially castrating the civiliandefense ministry and subordinating the interior ministry Western analysts nowfear that the generals are using Chechnya to reassert control over nationalsecurity and foreign policy Their militarism and nationalism bode ill forfuture relations between Russia and the West The general staff for instancehas essentially forbidden Russia from talking to NATO            As for the victory in Chechnya its a mirage ForRussias generals and politicians victory simply means flying the Russian flagin downtown Grozny But Chechens are fighting a guerrilla war Russian soldierswill shell Grozny to its foundations and fly their flags but they wont engagein streettostreet fighting Its too bloody So the rebels can melt away andjoin their comrades in Chechnyas southern mountains Chechnya has beenfighting Moscow for  years and hasnt surrendered yet It wont stop nowWhen the Russian army continues south it will find itself in another mountainwara miniAfghanistan this time against a tougher and betterorganizedenemy The Chechens will gradually bleed the Russian garrisonone car bombone mine one mortar at a timeuntil the Russians withdraw in frustration Butfor now Putin and his generals will get their victory a Potemkin triumph fora
