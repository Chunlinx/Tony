                    Background        Regular use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal        antiinflammatory dugs NSAIDs has been consistently        associated with reduced risk of colorectal cancer and        adenoma        possibly due to NSAIDrelated        inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis enhancement of        cellular immune response or induction of apoptosis               A number of epidemiological studies have investigated        the potential protective effect of NSAIDs with respect to        other cancer sites There is some evidence that regular and        prolonged NSAID use is associated with reduced risk of        cancers of the esophagus      stomach              ovary      and female breast              Although there is a growing body of epidemiological        evidence on the role of aspirin and other NSAIDs in the        chemoprevention of lung cancer Table                    about half of these studies published to date        were not specifically designed to investigate this        association        In a randomized trial aimed        at examining the effect of aspirin in the prevention of        cardiovascular disease in male physicians Peto et al           first noted lower lung cancer mortality rates in the        aspirin intervention group compared to the placebo group        Two subsequent cohort studies demonstrated associations        with regular    or frequent aspirin use    among        women but not men In contrast in a prospective analysis        of the NHANES I followup study Schreinemachers         Everson    reported lower incidence of lung cancer only        among men classified as recent aspirin users Rosenberg           observed no strong evidence for a chemopreventive role        of aspirin in a hospitalbased casecontrol study whereas        Langman et al     in a recordbased casecontrol        study reported a borderline significant risk reduction        associated with frequent prescriptions of NSAIDs Most        recently results from a casecontrol study nested within        the NYU Womens Health Study     indicated that women        classified as regular aspirin users were at a marked and        statistically significant reduced risk of nonsmall cell        lung cancer NSCLC compared to women classified as        nonusers however no significant associations were        observed for all histological types combined Another        recent casecontrol study investigated the effect of        aspirin on lung cancer risk in a sample of heavy smokers            Results indicated that daily aspirin use was        strongly associated with reduced risk this effect was        apparent for both men and women We conducted a        hospitalbased casecontrol study to further investigate        the overall association between aspirin use and lung cancer        risk and to add to the limited body of evidence on the        potential effect modifying roles of tumor histology and        cigarette smoking on the chemopreventive role of aspirin in        lung tumorigenesis                    Methods                  Study population          The study population included individuals who received          medical services at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute          RPCI between  and  and who agreed to complete          a comprehensive epidemiological questionnaire Informed          consent was obtained from all participants The case          group consisted of  individuals with primary incident          lung cancer identified from the RPCI tumor registry and          Diagnostic Index Controls included  individuals          randomly selected from a pool of  eligible          individuals who received medical services at RPCI for          nonneoplastic conditions These participants came to          RPCI with a suspicion of neoplastic disease but were not          diagnosed with either benign or malignant conditions The          most frequently utilized services among the controls were          carried out in the breast clinic  dermatology          clinic  gastrointestinal clinic  and          sarcomamelanoma clinic  The remaining controls          were seen in a variety of clinics at our institute          including gynecological oncology hematology head and          neck radiotherapy and urology however the proportion          of controls seen at these clinics was less than five          percent of all control participants Controls were          frequency matched to cases on sex and fiveyear age          intervals                          Questionnaire          All participants completed the Patient Epidemiology          Data System PEDS questionnaire which is offered to all          new patients as part of the admission process and is          returned by approximately  percent of new patients The          page instrument covers information on tobacco and          alcohol consumption family history of cancer          occupational and environmental exposures reproductive          and medical histories and diet The instrument also          assesses aspirin use relevant to the period prior to the          onset of disease Specifically the instrument queried          If you are currently ill indicate how often you took          these medications before the illness Participants          provided information on how many times a week and for how          many years they took aspirin Participants who reported          aspirin use at least once a week for one year were          classified as regular aspirin users Dosage of use was          assessed by comparing participants who were classified as          nonusers to participants who reported that they had          taken aspirin either one to six times per week or seven          or more times per week Duration of use was evaluated by          comparing nonusers to participants who took aspirin for          six months to ten years or more than ten years We also          evaluated a combined measure of dosage and duration by          computing tablet years tablets per day  years of use          Reason for analgesic use was unavailable for these          analyses                          Statistical analyses          Descriptive analyses included Student ttests of means          for cases and controls for continuous variables and chi          square tests for categorical variables Unconditional          logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios          ORs and  confidence intervals CIs ORs were          adjusted for potential confounders including age          education and packyears of cigarettes smoked Covariates          were only included in the final regression model if they          were established risk factors in these data or changed          the observed risk estimates by at least  percent          Variables that were evaluated but not included in the          multivariate model were occupational asbestos exposure          dietary fruit and vegetable intake and family history of          lung cancer Participants classified as nonusers ie          those who did not report to have used aspirin at least          once a week for at least one year served as the referent          category throughout the logistic regression analyses                            Results        Descriptive characteristics of the study population are        shown in Table  Due to the matching procedures there        were no differences between cases and controls with respect        to age and sex Cases were significantly less likely than        controls to have obtained a college education p          As expected cases were more likely than controls        to be former and current smokers p   and to        have had more packyears of cigarettes p          Table displays the association between aspirin use and        lung cancer risk in the total sample as well as among        females and males separately Compared to nonusers regular        aspirin use was associated with a significant reduction in        risk of lung cancer in the total study sample adjusted OR           CI  as well as among female        adjusted OR    CI  and male adjusted        OR    CI  participants Higher dosage of        aspirin seven or more tablets per week was significantly        associated with risk in the total sample adjusted OR           CI  and among male participants        adjusted OR    CI  Prolonged duration        of use  or more years was not associated with a        significant reduction in risk in either the total sample        nor among the subgroups defined by sex However        selfreported aspirin use of one to  years was associated        with a significantly lower risk of lung cancer in all        groups Among male participants there was evidence of a        dose response relationship with lower risk as a function of        longer duration of use p   Risk of lung cancer        was significantly reduced in relation to increasing tablet        years in the total sample p   and in males p          We further explored these associations by        restricting the sample to current and former smokers who        were divided into tertiles of packyears of cigarettes        smoked As can be seen in Table  risk estimates for the        exposure categories described above were generally below        the null among all smoking groups However statistically        significant risk reductions and doseresponse relationships        were only observed for participants in the lower tertile of        packyear distribution  packyears Table displays the        association between regular aspirin use and risk of        histologyspecific lung cancer Significant risk reductions        were observed for both NSCLC adjusted OR   CI         and small cell lung cancer SCLC adjusted OR           CI                     Conclusions        Results from this hospitalbased case control study are        largely consistent with the existing body of evidence on        the association between regular aspirin use and lung cancer        risk All previous studies reported some evidence of        reduced risk of lung cancer in relation to use aspirin or        other NSAIDs            We observed a        significant risk reduction among participants defined as        regular users in the total sample as well as among men and        women separately Our data also demonstrated significant        risk reductions associated with higher aspirin doses        prolonged duration and greater tablet years of aspirin        use although significant trends were largely restricted to        male participants We further observed that after        restricting the analyses to current and former smokers the        chemoprotective effect of aspirin was most apparent among        individuals in the lower tertile of the packyear        distribution Finally when we explored this risk        association among histological subtypes significant risk        reductions were apparent in when controls were compared to        patients with both NSCLC and SCLC        Although our findings follow the general trend that has        been demonstrated in previous investigations some        differences exist Two cohort studies reported reduced risk        among aspirin users among females but not males             while we observed strongest associations for male        participants Another study did not demonstrate a risk        reduction among females     whereas we consistently        found nonsignificant risk estimates below unity for female        participants In a recent report based on the NYU Womens        Health Study Akhmedkhanov et al    reported a        significant risk reduction for NSCLC and a more modest        nonsignificant decease in risk for all histological types        of lung cancer Our data are partly in contrast to these        results in that we observed the most marked reduction for        SCLC but also a significant decrease in risk for all NSCLC        subtypes combined        These discrepancies in results may be partly explained        by differences in study designs across studies ie        randomized trial     cohort study              casecontrol study      or by the vast differences        in exposure assessment ranging from assignment of        participants to aspirin intervention group vs placebo        group    over ever use of aspirin in the last  days           to having had an NSAID prescription in the past three        years            One of the proposed mechanisms for the chemopreventive        properties of aspirin and other NSAIDs points to the        observation that NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin        PGendoperoxide synthase cyclooxygenase enzymes            of which two forms of similar enzymatic activity exist        COX and COX COX is constitutively expressed and        involved in homeostasis     COX is induced and        involved in inflammation      There is evidence from        laboratory studies to suggest that the COX pathway may be        involved in lung tumorigenesis Bauer et al           reported significantly higher levels of COX enzymes in        mouse lung tumor tissue compared to normal tissue It has        also been shown that aspirin inhibited nitrosamine induced        lung carcinogenesis     and it reduced COX enzyme        levels in lung cancer cell lines     Further support        for a potential role of the COX pathway in lung cancer        development comes from several investigations that        demonstrated COX overexpression in human lung tumors        specifically NSCLC       and precursor lesions            While COX expression was generally shown to be        increased in NSCLC and to a much lesser extent in SCLC the        role of COX expression in latter tumor type is difficult        to determine due to the fact that the numbers of SCLC        tumors examined in these studies was very small        Several methodological issues should be considered in        interpreting these results As in all casecontrol studies        bias could have affected the validity of the current        findings Selection bias is likely to have occurred in this        investigation The lung cancer patient group was restricted        to individuals who were treated at RPCI a large regional        cancer treatment center and are not likely to represent        the general population of lung cancer patients in the        western New York region However it is unlikely that        selfreported aspirin use would be different for RPCI        patients than from patients treated in different        facilities The use of hospital controls might introduce        bias due to the possibility that some controls were        suffering from conditions that would make them more likely        to use aspirin  However greater likelihood of aspirin use        in the control group would only have attenuated the true        risk estimate rather than produced spurious associations        In addition hospital controls were selected from a large        pool of eligible participants with a wide variety of        noncancer diagnostic groups minimizing bias arising from        potential overrepresentation of patients with        characteristics that may be associated with the exposures        In fact no significant differences with respect to aspirin        use were observed for the most common diagnostic categories        among controls Selection bias may have also been        introduced due to the low participation rate in this study        Only about  percent of eligible cases and controls agreed        to complete the PEDS questionnaire We have no way of        ascertaining whether or not those individuals who refused        to complete the instrument differed from participants with        respect to aspirin use Nevertheless previous studies that        utilized the PEDS data base and faced the same        methodological issue consistently replicated established        epidemiological associations for a variety of cancer sites        including ovary      colon     breast            prostate     and lung     Recall bias is always a        problem in casecontrol studies of cancer However in this        investigation it may have been less of an issue due to our        use of hospital controls Further the questionnaire used        in this investigation places no particular emphasis on any        specific item Thus there is little reason to believe that        cases were more motivated than controls to recall aspirin        use Exposure misclassification may also have affected our        results as we based our analyses on selfreported        analgesic use and were not able to independently verify        this information Also the questionnaire did not assess        the specific doses of analgesic preparations such as        regular or extrastrength tablets Further we did not have        detailed information on other NSAIDs that participants may        have taken and cannot rule out the possibility that cases        may have been more likely to have taken preparations such        as ibuprofen or prescription NSAIDs which would have        resulted in an overestimated or entirely spurious results        However we have no reason to believe that any of these        potential sources of misclassification were differential in        nature        In summary in this hospitalbased casecontrol study of        lung cancer we observed consistent associations between        aspirin use and risk particularly among men Although a        number of epidemiological studies have produced fairly        consistent results none of these investigations has been        specifically designed to address this research question        These suggestive findings need to be replicated by a        welldesigned pharmacoepidemiological study that        incorporates the newly introduced NSAID preparations                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions
