                                 The Nixon Analogy            Should President Clinton betreated just like President Nixon This week Republicans argued that he shouldUnfortunately they failed to get their message straight Two differentRepublican camps advanced the Watergate analogy in two different ways for twodifferent purposes One camps case is more persuasive but the others is moreexciting And Democrats are exploiting the difference            TheProcess Camp led by House Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde RIll is using theWatergate analogy to justify procedural rules for the Clinton impeachmentinquiry Wednesday Hyde released an inquiry resolution which he notedfollows the Watergate resolution word for word In a letter to the HouseJudiciary Committees ranking Democrat Rep John Conyers DMich Hydeproposed that the model for impeachment should be the one that you helped towrite in  Hyde thinks that by following the rules of the Watergateprocess which were approved and administered by Democrats he can forceDemocrats to admit hes conducting the Clinton inquiry fairly            The more zealous Substance Camp led by House Majority WhipTom DeLay RTexas is using the Watergate analogy to suggest not just that theClinton impeachment process should mirror the Nixon impeachment process butalso that Clintons offenses are as serious as Nixons This camp hopesconstant comparisons between Watergate and the Lewinsky coverup will cause theformers gravity to rub off on the latter If Clinton has done what Nixondid DeLay argued on ABC last weekend that is impeachable            Democrats cant persuasivelyrebut the process analogy In  for example Conyers opposed a preordainedtime limit on the Watergate probe How can Conyers now demand such a limit onthe Lewinsky probe So instead theyre conflating it with the substanceanalogy Wednesday when asked about the Watergate inquiry rules Conyersreplied The notion that this investigation should be openended likeWatergate  is preposterous because Watergate involved a wholesalecorruption of government which extended through the FBI the CIA and otherfederal agencies This matter involves the concealing of a private affair            LikewiseWhite House Press Secretary Mike McCurry argued The facts of Watergate andthe Monica Lewinsky matter are entirely different and I think most Americanswould readily and quickly agree to that which is why I went through a littlereminder about the enormity of the crimes committed during the period ofWatergate According to the New York Times  McCurry arrived armed fora question about comparisons to Watergate He got it and almost ran out ofbreath as he rattled off a lengthy list of the accusations against Nixonincluding that he misused the FBI and the Secret Service to conductunlawful wiretapping of American citizens and maintained a secret unit in theWhite House to violate the constitutional rights of citizens After pausingslightly for air McCurry added indignantly So theres no parallelwhatsoever             Once the process analogy is transformed intothe substance analogy it loses its force Yes substantive analogies can bedrawn between Nixons offenses and Clintons eg between the Enemies Listand the FBI files or between the Plumbers and the Bimbo Eruption Team But thedifferences are more striking In the Lewinsky casethe only case presentlybefore Congressthe presidents objective was sex not power The underlyingsins were more personal than political And the secret tapes and wires werearranged not by the president but by his enemies and investigators            The ironyis that it would have been so much easier to deem Clintons offensesimpeachable on their own terms He has plainly lied under oath for example IfCongress determines that this constituted perjury which is somewhat moretechnical then Clinton has committed a felony Republicans could simply arguethat no felon should be allowed to remain president Instead theyre holdingClinton to the impossibly high standard of corruption set by Nixon If asHenry Hyde recently pledged to do the House applies the standard thatemerged in  it will decide that the charges against Clinton do not fallunder the articles of impeachment argued two Watergateera Democraticcongressmen in a Times oped Thursday Theyre right Clintons offensesarent what the Watergate committee meant by an impeachable offense But thatcomparison isnt what Hyde meant by the Watergate rules either                           RecentFrame Games                        Just Say No Whythe Democrats best strategy is to play defense posted Wednesday Sept                         The GOPs GambleWhy the Republicans will save Clinton by destroying themselves postedFriday Sept
