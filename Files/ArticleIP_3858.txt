Praise of CheapLabor Paul Krugman suggests that because Third World workers are betteroff working in multinational factories than living off garbage dumps we shouldrespect the multinationals for their contribution and avoid policiesestablishing basic labor standards But the comparison should be between whatwas done and what should have been done not what would have occurredotherwise Consider the following A boat captain comes upon a drowning womanin a lake saves her but then rapes her            Now according to Krugmansince the woman is better off than she would have been otherwise the boatcaptain is to be admired and rewarded for what he has done My complaints aboutthe lack of social justice in this case are simply dismissed by Krugman aslofty selfrighteousness            There arevalid concerns as to the potential effectiveness of international laborstandards but Krugman provides no theoretical or empirical proof that theywould not improve the lives of Third World workers The capital owners andFirst World consumers are collecting significant rents from theseactivities It may be possible to force them to share these more equitably withthe workers Back to the example If the boat captain is restricted to onlycharging the woman  he may still choose to save her             ShelburneRobert                                       JustOverprice It                        I enjoyed Paul KrugmansIn Praise of CheapLabor but he seems to miss the point            American consumers enjoy lowprices That is why there is this boom in foreign manufacturing and that iswhy Dollar Stores are so popular When a consumer can walk into a store andfor only one dollar purchase something that was manufactured in the ThirdWorld most consumers can understand why the person who made that item earnsonly  cents an hour            The moralquestions and outrage arise however when a consumer forks over  for apair of sneakers that were assembled cheaply in some Third World countryAmerican sneaker manufacturers at this point seem a tad gluttonous                           Jim Rhodes                                       Nikenation                        I agree with ninetenths ofPaul Krugmans InPraise of Cheap Labor We cannot meaningfully compare wages in Indonesiaand the United States Nor can we often comprehend the far bleaker alternativesto these jobs that exist in the industrializing Third World            ButKrugman takes no account of how political violence can factor into thisequation If arrests imprisonments and worse prevent workers in Third Worldcountries from making claims for better wages and working conditions thenKrugmans system of global supply and demand starts to come unhinged The moralcomponent to Krugmans argument is that we should not allow our squeamishnessto prevent Third World laborers from deciding that  cents a day makingReeboks is better than a deadening declining rural poverty No argument hereBut if those workers are compelled to work for low wages by extraeconomicthreats then that choice is an illusory one             Joshua MicahMarshall                                       Beat onthe Brat                        I was enjoying JacobWeisbergs BatteredRepublican Syndrome until he equated support forparental rights with support for child abuse I abhor child abuse and feel thatthe abusers should be punished but corporal discipline is different            When a child continues tobehave in a way that can cause harm to himself or to other children a spankingcan be extremely effective I do support parents who dont believe in corporalpunishmentif they can raise their children well without an occasionalspanking more power to them But I think the most damage is done to childrenwho receive no discipline at all            Weisbergwould have everyone believe that my wife and I are evil or maladjusted becausewe have spanked our children But we are highly responsible parents who havevery happy confident wellbehaved children They know that we love them andthey also know that we mean what we say Im disappointed in Weisbergs lapseof logic and lack of understanding of what it means to be a good parent

for aban on cloning amount to discrimination against people based on another genetictrait            Racism is the very thingthat makes human cloning insidious Once human cloning is perfected asMyhrvold presumes it will be who will utilize this method of procreationThose who have access to it Who will have access to it Those who live intechnologically advanced countries and have the financial resources to affordsuch a luxury Caucasian men            Cloningwill merely present nervous Caucasian men with the means to attempt to ensurethat they arent outnumbered by those threatening masses of other races on whatthey consider their own territory He defines genocide as seeking to eliminatethat which is different and argues that bans on cloning fall into thatcategory But cloning does not produce that which is different It producesthe same product repeatedly Bans against human cloning are the only protectionthe average citizen has against Big Brother social and genetic

withoutboth biological parents are between two and three times as likely as otherchildren to commit crimes to drop out of school to get pregnant in theirteens to be unemployed as young adults During the welfarereform debate heblamed the welfare system for the ills of singleparent families Now he blamesliberalized marriage and divorce laws            Notice that he doesnt saythat these problems are associated with children of divorced parents only thattheyre problems of children raised without both biological parents Thatincludes many illegitimate children orphans and abandoned children Someonetruly interested in understanding the causes might want to know how many ofthese children are raised in poverty are born to drug addicts or had fatherswho never married or even lived with their mothers Someone without such a bigax to grind might also look into a comparison of statistics for children raisedby one or two nonbiological parents such as adoptees and stepparents andcompare them with children raised by two biological parents in deeply unhappyandor abusive relationships            But notFrum Hes happy to toss out this statistic that folds in all possiblechildhood abandonment and pin the blame entirely on the reforms in the divorcelaws Only now are we beginning to appreciate the extent of the damage donehe writes Fine Lets just see if he remembers this next time the subject ofwelfare comes up                           Dan Schwarcz                                       Addressyour email to the editors to lettersslatecom
