                                               I want totell you how really disappointed I was when reading the first entry of theDiary fromLorenzo Semple Jr to encounter a really vulgar word To be sure Ive beenknown to use that particular AngloSaxon expletive myself and with greatverve too but to encounter it in the pages of                   Slate                was justtoo much Dont you edit the diary submissions of your contributors Was itabsolutely necessary to use that particular word Just because its a diarydoesnt mean it should be published unexpurgated             BobSolon Indianapolis                           WithSeven You Get Egg Roll                        I very much enjoy TodaysPapers and Im sorry that this first message to you comes on the occasionof a complaint            In his Nov  entry ScottShuger suggested a contradiction between septuplet father Kenny McCaugheysstatement that God gave us those kids and the fact that  specialists wereinvolved and that Bobbi McCaughey had been hospitalized for more than a monthIf thats a contradiction then no one could ever properly say God gave usthose kids or even God gave us that kid because as you know there issome human effort involved in all human birthswhether from doctors nursesmidwives even mothers and to a much lesser extent fathers            If you dont believe in Godthats one thing The alleged contradiction would therefore have nothing to dowith the number of specialists involved or the length of stay in the hospitalIt would have only to do with your theological presupposition But if you allowfor the possibility of a sovereign you should not be surprised that He usesHis creatures to achieve His endswhether in the birth of a child orchildren or in the rearing of them            God isgood Mr Shuger Im looking forward to Todays Papers tomorrow             Nickolas SEicher                                       Down theHatch                        GOP efforts to derailPresident Clintons appointment of Bill Lann Lee as the nations chiefcivilrights enforcer PaybackTime by Jacob Weisberg only demonstrate what bad sports Republicans havebecome in the last few years If they cant have their own man in the OvalOffice it seems they will do anythingno matter how petty or selfserving orjust plain stupidto cripple the Democratic agenda that won Clinton his officenot once but two times in a row            Even Sen Orrin Hatch has toacknowledge that Lee is well qualified for the post he seeks Yet the senatoris trying to kill Lees nomination complaining that he might be an activist atthe Justice Department Hatch worries that Lee would use his new position tohalt any spread of antiaffirmativeaction legislation or seek to subvertCalifornias abolition of such practices            Hatchscampaign may play well to GOP extremists those folks who have always fearedthat civilrights legislation and affirmative action would somehow bring downWestern civilization But its obvious to the rest of us that contesting thisnomination on the basis that Lee might be an activist in government is rankhypocrisy If the rule from now on is that nobody can hold office in Washingtonunless they swear not to try to sway public opinion or undo existing laws thenevery congressional Republican with a hankering to overturn Roe vs Wademight as well start looking for new employmentHatch

suggests that the opponents of imports from countries withpoor working conditions are in fact being disingenuous They dont reallyoppose the bad conditions What they oppose is the competition            This may be true for someBut for me and for many others there is a legitimate concern about whetherwe through our purchases are encouraging the abuse of others And despiteKrugmans argument it would matter to me if I knew that the shirt I justpurchased was produced by laborers who were beaten and tortured in order toincrease their productivity            It isunfortunately difficult to determine reliably if the labor that went into aparticular item was handled humanely But that doesnt mean that the issue ofhumane treatment of workers is unimportant Krugman argues persuasively thatthe berrybased argument is irrelevantbut the moral argument remainsnonetheless quite cogent             YaronMinsky                                       FreeTrades Been Berry Berry Good to Me                        As a staunch supporter offree trade I couldnt agree more with A Raspberry for FreeTrade Paul Krugmans critique of the arguments put forward by theopponents of fast track They are not only specious but also deeplydisingenuous            But supporters of free tradeshould look beyond the intellectual caliber of these arguments and consider thepolitical realities that sustain them And here free traders may only havethemselves to blame            Sensible free traders arguethat jobs lost to free trade are more than made up for by jobs gained and makefurther quite correct arguments that American trade barriers are alreadyquite low and that we have the most to gain by global trade liberalization            Still none of the manybenefits of free trade overcome the fact that some will lose in the moredynamic economy that aggressive free trade creates and that the very dynamismof free trade can cast a penumbra of insecurity that goes well beyond those whowill actually lose employment            The political answer tothis which many progressive supporters of free trade have endorsed is acombination of aggressive free trade coupled with programs aimed to cushion andcompensate for the social dislocations which free trade causes This is insome sense the New Democrat line the Clinton line the DLC line etc            Theproblem is that progressive supporters of free trade have been able to gettheir freetrade agreements but very little in the way of cushioning programsfor the kind of dynamic economic order were clearly moving into Asustainable progressive freetrade coalition requires both I dont pretendthat the politics of the situation are simple by any means But getting one andnot the other has played a major role in creating the increasingly successfulpopular backlash against free trade             Joshua MicahMarshall                                       Address your email tothe editors to lettersslatecom Please include your address and
