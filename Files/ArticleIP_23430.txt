                                  Matt Groening            I have before me thecurrent issue of The Comics Journal  which features a list of the greatest comics of the century from Prince Valiant at the bottom toPogo Peanuts  and Krazy Kat at the top with room for everyonefrom R Crumb to Captain Marvel in between There is no place in it howeverfor Matt Groenings Life in Hell  Groenings friend Lynda Barry whosework often shows up next to his in the pages of alternative weeklies across theland gets the nod for her brilliant Ernie Pooks Comeek No Upandcoming comics superstar Ben Katchors Julius Knipl Real EstatePhotographer checks in at No  But those anxious bunnies Binky and Bongoand their sidekicks the deadpan fez wearers Akbar and Jeff are conspicuousto me anyway in their absence            This is a shame sinceGroening better known as the creator of The Simpsons  and now of themuchhyped Futurama  is also an important figure in the world ofpenandink serial cartooning He is the link between Jules Feiffer who earnstwo spots on The Comics Journal s list and Dilbert who earnsnone He is also part of the explosion of brilliant graphic work that began inthe early s and has so far produced an array of permanent contributions toAmerican culturethe Hernandez brothers Love and Rockets  Joe SaccosPalestine  and Art Spiegelmans Maus  to name only a few Unlikethese artists Groening is not interested in rigorous draftsmanship or extendednarration but he is like them and like Barry and Katchor committed tousing cartoons as a way of addressing reality Life in Hell hits uswhere we live under the thumb of wellmeaning rational but ultimatelypsychotic and abusive authority Hell is other bunniesbosses parentsteachers coworkers boyfriends girlfriends We I mean all us bunnies fezwearers and miscellaneous snaggletoothed popeyed fourfingered creaturesseem hardwired for sadomasochism Even the exuberant indistinguishable loversAkbar and Jeff spend panel after panel devising new ways to baffle dominateand mindfuck each other            To paraphrase Henry David Thoreau When reality becomescartoonlike the only place for a realist is in cartooning Its no accidentthat the rise of serious comics or graphic novels as some publishers choseto call them came at a moment when American fiction was relatively moribundFor its part The Simpsons arrived at what was a relatively bad periodfor Hollywood movies and was part of what will be remembered as an explosion ofinventive network television programming thirtysomething Roseanne  My SoCalled Life  Twin Peaks and of courseSeinfeld                            The Simpsons now midway through its  th season has outlasted them all It beganas a series of fillin segments for The Tracey Ullman Show  Oh for theFox network of yesteryear Of  Jump Street and Shannen Dohertyera  of Alien Nation and Roc  Where have you goneKeenen Ivory Wayans These crudely drawn miniepisodes were like RaymondCarver stories optioned by HannaBarbera They featured the grind andhumiliation of lowermiddleclass family life and they centered not on thechildren Bart Lisa and Maggie but on the beleaguered patriarch Homer Theearly Homer was hardly the sweetnatured oaf who quickly replaced Bill Cosbyand Ronald Reagan as Americas favorite dad His voice was growlier his temperquicker and his shaky masculine pride always on the line The first bit Irecall seeing involved Homer falling for the aggressive sales pitch of an RVsalesman and his willingness to bury his family under crushing debt in orderto look like a big shot in the salesmans eyes and theirs The current Homerin contrast is a creature so utterly without pride as to qualify for a kind ofsainthood            In early  Fox a fledgling outfit with nothing tolose put the halfhour Simpsons in its Thursday  pm slot upagainst The Cosby Show  then the No  program in America The upstartdid not just so much challenge Cosby as envelop it In perhaps the mostsustained of the winking popculture references for which it has become famousand on which it came to depend rather too heavily as time went on TheSimpsons soon featured an avuncular AfricanAmerican physician with apenchant for multicolored sweaters                           The Simpsons isjustly celebrated for the density of its cultural allusions and the rich detailof its visuals The best episodes project two dimensions into three better thanany animation since Disneys features of the s or the great Chuck JonesMerrie Melodie shorts for Warner Bros But the shows real achievement is inits characters a range of comic types as vivid as any in Dickens orShakespeare While Bart is the franchise and Lisa the feministintellectualicon the heart of The Simpsons is the extraordinary marriage of Homerand Marge a marriage that has had its tests Remember that slinky Frenchbowling instructor That countryandwestern diva The sixfoot hero sandwichThe nervous breakdown on the freeway but has endured since the end of thedisco era When George Bush sneered during the  campaign that Americaneeded more families like the Waltons and fewer like the Simpsons you knew itwas over for himand not only because he seemed to be wishing for an end toelectricity and indoor plumbing The Simpsons are our truest best selvesstupidmaybe lazyyou bet suspicious of authorityalways willing to doanything about itnot really but above all loyal to our spouses ourchildren our little sisters our friends our hometowns our bad haircuts andour favorite brand of beer The Simpsons may be hip and ironic butunlike say South Park or Ren  Stimpy  it has never beencynical            Its success resulted from the unlikely collusion betweenGroening a leftwing populist and selfdescribed hippie from the PacificNorthwest and Rupert Murdoch a rightwing populist from Australia WhileGroening has always insisted on and been granted freedom from networkinterference his show is still a creature of contradictions It pokes endlessfun at the corporatization of all aspects of life think of Duff Gardens amindnumbing totalitarian theme park or the robotic Schwarzenegger cloneknown as McBain or Malibu Stacy the Barbielike doll Lisa Simpson lives foreven as its characters have become among the most recognizable icons ofcorporate culture This January the spiky hair and bulging eyes of BartSimpson mysteriously found their way into a photograph of soldiers patrolling astreet in Hebron that accompanied a New York Times Magazine essay byPalestinian intellectual Edward Said An Editors Note the following weekexplained that the photographer in question signs all his pictures by holding aBart Simpson mask up to his lensand that the editors erroneously assumed thatthe mask had been held by a passing Palestinian child            As much as I love theSimpsons show Groening recently told Wired magazine I alsolove the Simpsons figurines To me the figurines are part of thecreative product Groenings willing if somewhat ironic embrace of themarketing bonanza his creation has unleashed may have cost him his rightfulspot in the The Comics Journal s highbrowsubculture pantheon Im surehes not as upset about it as I am            In the decade since its debut The Simpsons hasspawned a raft of imitators and has launched a boom in primetime animationSome of the products of this boom have been unsurprisingly dreadful RememberThe Critic  Duckman  But others have been pretty goodthetragically misunderstood Beavis and Butthead  for instance and itscreators subsequent King of the Hill  And now Fox ever eager to flogits winning formulas to the point of exhaustion has come up with The FamilyGuy  The PJs  and Groenings own Futurama  The critics havebeen generous to Futurama  confident that it will pick up steam as itgoes along Im not so sure Visually its stunning The screen is packed withpuns for the eye and teasers for the brain But the writing is slow andstilted and the situations already seem tired and didactic This weeksepisode was as cuddly as an episode of Full House  and the previous onein which its discovered that the moon has become a vulgar tourist trap seemedrecycled from Simpsons outtakes right down to the Whalers on the Moonsinging panorama Perhaps Futurama will pick up I make nopredictions            Except one A thousand years from now if robothistorians want to know what life was really like inlate th century America they will look to Life in Hell andThe Simpsons  No there were no talking rabbits and human hair was notsculpted into yellow spikes or blue pylons well not that often anyway Buteverything else is pretty much accurate
