coverage of thetragic loss of John F Kennedy Jr in a plane crash Fridaythe curse on thefamily its love of adventure the end of a dynasty etc But the Jerusalem Post peddled a newtheory The Kennedys are

Kennedyobsessed European newspapers to write offthe future of the family dynasty Corriere dellaSera of Milan pegged John Jrs cousin Kathleen Kennedy Townsend on itsfront page as the heir to his sceptre It would be good if Camelot themythical realm of King Arthur were to end in the hands of a woman abovesuspicion it said It would be poetic if the first American woman presidentwere to be called not Hillary but Kathleen Corriere also carried aninterview with Gay Talese the troubadour of todays America and yesterdaysItaly dismissing the idea of a Kennedy curse I think on the contrary thatthere burns inside them a feeling of invincibility an obsession withchallenge an arrogance of power that drive them to take risks all the timehe was quoted as saying Asked if he thought John Jr had been different fromthe others Talese replied Different in the sense that he wasnt a sexualpredator like his father uncle and grandfather nor addicted to drugs oralcohol like other members of his family  But otherwise he was aKennedysure of himself and convinced of his immortality                           La Repubblicaof Rome on the other hand said John Jrs problem was that he knew he wasnta Kennedy at heart and that he had crashed his plane because he wanted to beone He didnt manage to live like a Kennedy but fate allowed him at least toleave this world as one it concluded But what does La Repubblicaknow about it Another characteristic of the Kennedys is that they invitereckless psychological examination La Repubblica led its front pagewith a headline saying that John Jr shouldnt have flown at night because hewasnt certified to do so In Britain the tabloid Express announced inhuge letters that he had had a death wish In Paris Le Figaro s headline wasThe Accursed Kings Les Rois Maudits  and its frontpageeditorial compared John Jr to the late Princess of Wales Like Lady Di itsaid fate struck because according to one of those Elizabethan poets of whomPresident Kennedy always kept a quotation in reserve not Elizabethan actuallyJames Shirley  There is no armor against fate Death lays his icyhand on kings             In aneditorial the Times of London said John Jrs fate recalled anothermyththat of Oedipus who fulfilled a prophecy by killing his father andmarrying his mother without knowing who they were The Oedipus story survivesthe paper said because it embodies the deep human sense that free will is afragile thing and no inheritance however noble frees one from the mark ofsin  The fate of John Kennedy Jr reinforces in every mind that melancholytruth The Independent of London also made the Princess Dianacomparison saying that her myth like that of the Kennedys was not solely theproperty of one country It would be a fitting legacy if John Juniors deathreminded America and the world of the high ideal of public service and liberalvalues than run through the Kennedy rhetoric it said in an editorial It isthe Kennedy greatness to call us to a higher moral purpose and the Kennedytragedy that none of the family could fulfil that promise            The Guardian of Londoncommented in its editorial Monday that if John Jrs death helps slow down theUS trend toward a new kind of dynastic democracy then some good will have comefrom this grim news The paper also quoted Col Muammar Qaddafi of Libya asreported by the BBC on its front page While expressing his deepest regretabout the tragedy Qaddafi said he was even more sad that the United Stateshas been unable to locate his plane America claims to know how to find amustard seed either on earth or in space thanks to its extraordinarycapabilities he said Or perhaps the US is negligent and not serious insearching for its citizens from the Kennedy dynasty
