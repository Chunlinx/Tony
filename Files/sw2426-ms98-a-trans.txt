        okay   well i havent uh you know when the war was on i watched um CNN and um Nightline   uhhuh   pretty regularly and read the paper and all but when uh lately like the last week or two i guess with Easter  and spring break with the kids i um i hadnt been thinking much about the Middle East and whats going on over there have you been keeping up   uh well  uh just really the last couple of days since this uh the UN debate or whatever you want to call it that uh voted on whether there was going to be a cease fire i guess you know the thing really isnt over they uh   uhhuh   they had uh kind of uh i dont know if you call it stand down or whatever but anyway they stopped and wait to see if Iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though as i understand it from the Iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the UN uh had set up you know the Iraqis are probably not going to go for at all unless theyre just absolutely forced to   uh hum   so i guess from what i understand the thing could just they could take off at any moment without uh   start it   you know any uhhuh you know any local um you know congressional effort or anything else because you know its not really settled yet   theres no official document signed or anything   not yet not yet at all   well i um when the when the crisis began last August i began to think well i i um couldnt remember things that i had studied in the past in school and all so i got out like my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history and it was really what i felt was kind of cynical because it there just hasnt been any peace over there   uhhuh   ever in thousands of years of history   no yeah i dont know why they expect its going to start this week you know   yeah       thats right and it just its just not people they and its not uh you know there isnt any real Arab coalition because they do fight among themselves   uhhuh   and they fight with each other and they have such hatred for Israel and   yeah the uh the thing thats kind of interesting uh about this my sons in the Air Force   oh yes   and uh he came within about a quarter of an inch of going uh to Saudi he ended up in Korea instead and because of the way they split a transportation group out in Lubbock   hum   so he ended up going to Korea but his buddies ended up going to Saudi well hes still in Korea and his buddies are home now  he he almost wishes that that he could have gone home   oh no he and got it over with  well i just  theres just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace   yeah uhhuh   and um with and that im afraid that we would have to stay   yeah the thing uh the other thing too when this all started if you you know if you did much reading on the thing you know Kuwait the country of Kuwait was just you know somebodys uh you go back to World War i when the uh Ottoman empire broke up and the British and the French and the English yeah the British and the French mostly   uhhuh   decided to carve up that part of the world and call part of it Persia and part of it uh Iraq and part of it something else you know and they they split things along um   uhhuh   geographical lines but they didnt take any kind of consideration into uh social or cultural things at all so the country of uh of Kuwait really doesnt make just a whole lot of sense   right   except that it is an accepted place you know its like any other country you know for whatever reason its   yeah   its actually there well Iraq has had uh designs on that place since nineteen twenty two so you know it wasnt like something that just suddenly popped up   yes   and its just that this was an excuse you know to make some noise now something that i read in the paper the other day that i thought was kind of interesting was that the Arab uh uh their version or vision or whatever the United States now is somewhat changed in that we won you know now now we are a uh a legitimate player in the game over there you know the   yes   we i dont think we can really understand their attitude because their cultures just so much different   right   uh we are now a legitimate player in the in the in the game because we came in with a certain amount of force and we you know we defeated you know Iran couldnt do it in seven years and we went in and did in in seven days what Iran couldnt do in seven years you know so   right right   that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit it makes us more legitimate so now what theyre saying is that well since we won whatever we say goes because its a kind of a might makes right attitude about it and you know weve got the power   yeah   yeah which is why for centuries you know hundreds of years the British and the French had so much influence in there because theyd go in and theyd win something   right   and then and then they could call the shots for the next you know period of time until the next strong man came up and you know and   right   and caused problems so   well i just uh im not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go in and call the shots like you say and and i just would prefer that i mean sometimes weve said lets keep we   yeah yeah   were not interested in what other countries do and then other times we jump in and do things and while im really glad that they   uhhuh   uh i it was important demilitarize demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments   yeah   i dont hope id i hope we dont try to keep uh in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to   yeah   stay over there because we just dont want to send our people there and make them stay   yeah thats thats the uh thats thats the big thing you know we still got a little bit of the old you know Vietnam um problem in you know in the back of our minds we we got this were were used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out   yeah   Vietnam we never did get out you know never did get the job done because they were too ham strung   yeah   uh this thing they they gave the guys uh the power and the material and the told them to go do it and they did it you know got in and got out im not sure the the big fuss that were going to see now for the next few weeks i would think   yeah and   is uh you know the uh the business with the uh the Shiites of all people you know in the southern part of the country and also the Kurds because these people evidently are you know being killed off by the thousands   yeah   and whether the the United Nations i dont think the US will do it on their own but whether the United Nations comes around and says hey wait a minute we know this thing isnt uh all that much over weve got to go back in there and and be sure tha t this large population isnt just wiped out which is seems to be exactly whats happening right at the moment   uhhuh i noticed that   but uh you know   well i dont think theres much hope for a lasting peace over there like they   oh well no no there there never will be i mean uh uh the only way that youre going to have peace over there if if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them     yeah history   you know until we make a decision to do that there wont be peace but i dont think we want to make that decision either   uhhuh no   so thats thats a little rough you know were not were not quite up to that sort of thing   no   so   well i guess i better go i have a repairman just came for my refrigerator   oh oh well thats fun   but yes well i enjoyed the topic i hope you have have a good day okay byebye   you too bye bye
