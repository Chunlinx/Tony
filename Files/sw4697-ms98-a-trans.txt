                well the the question was talking about the juries and um one of the things i thought about was on a lot of the drunk cases that they were having that especially for repeat offenders that um maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again um so that um a judge i think would be the most appropriate person to uh to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day   right i i kind of agree with that because i think in some cases uh the jury may not even have the information about other crimes the person has committed   right   uh i i think that in some cases thats considered to prejudice the current case   right   so a a judge youre right should have the whole dossier of the criminal there and if theyre judged guilty would probably be in a better prison position to give an appropriate uh sentencing     umhum yeah see i agree with you um one thing i heard was this where they have instead of going to the regular court they have a a mock court i mean its supposed to be all legal and everything uh you go and you present your case the other side presents their case and youre done with it its almost like the Night Court we see on TV um and um but its not that we have uh such it didnt backlog or all of the uh the cases that are uh all ready pending   umhum   um so i that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way   in other words not not there would be some types of crimes for which youre not guaranteed a jury trial   yes yes Now   i i i dont theres theres a point on which we dont agree i would tend myself to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a anytime a   umhum   one of the parties wants one and i usually its the defendant i guess that wants to have the jury hear the case   umhum sure   so im im not out for  streamlining things to the point where we uh take that you know that would require a change in the Bill of Rights i believe and so   oh yes and and i wasnt i didnt mean that  i i didnt mean that no because i mean gee whiz if i was uh uh didnt have that right you know not to have a jury that oh yes i would feel um   oh oh okay   youre right that my civil rights had been violated but i meant for some when both parties agreed that yes were going to have a judge here were not going to have a jury you know lets get it over with sort of like car accidents you know   right well i think thats all ready possible i think that you can waive the right to a jury trial uh   yeah right right   yeah so i agree that that should be encouraged you know people should know that thats an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to   umhum   to clients unless they feel they can you know tweak a jury into  perhaps   right giving a different sentence   giving a different sentence or possibly if its a civil case giving higher uh you know awards of money or something since usually the lawyers get a percentage of the the award   umhum the take right right   yeah and i suspect it in cases like i guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though rather than civil is that right   well i i it were at liberty to to talk and and meander as long as its all on the same theme umhum   yeah well uh um in the case of civil civil uh things i think maybe the the use of the jury is very often to the lawyers advantage and i think that may be where jury use is overdone you know i mean there are cases where they could be settled maybe out of court a little more efficiently but the lawyers are really   right right   uh its to their advantage to play to as big an audience as possible so uh i was wondering too if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases   umhum uhhuh   not just sentencing in in a criminal cases uh   uhhuh   im not so sure im in favor of that but i am in favor of it for criminal cases so theres a difference of my view there for those two   right right yeah but well you can tell i havent been in too many juries judges chambers or anything like that  and well i was called once when i was nineteen and um   have you ever had to serve jury duty uhhuh   but i was doing so many other things that they took took pity on me and i was doing school and things like that they they let me out and ive never had to it since and that was almost twenty years ago   uhhuh uhhuh it it isnt sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time in uh that would have been about uh twenty years too um uh just last year and     uhhuh   uh the case i heard was a criminal case and it seemed it really trivial it involved two bicycles we didnt do the sentencing the judge did   umhum huh   so   how interesting   wed we uh rendered a verdict and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing   uhhuh uhhuh   and that was here in Wisconsin so i i dont know if that varies from state to state or if it varies
