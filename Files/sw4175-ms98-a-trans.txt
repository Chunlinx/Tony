               so what do you think about uh the recycling programs in Atlanta Julie   i dont believe that were the recycling program here is just terrible i mean its hard to find places to go i mean Kroger does a couple things they i dont think they do they do newspapers   i dont know theres theres big bins out there i dont know if they ever get i i really dont know what the details are there should be someplace where you could call and find out as a matter of fact im pretty sure theres a place you can call and find out the closest you know thing to you but i think there should be some kind of curbside service thats the only way i could really   yeah the one in Florida is so cool because they pick up everything they pick up newspapers and uh you know milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans you know like soup comes in and stuff   uhhuh   they pick up everything   during the summers like the around where i live the uh homeless people seem i mean they all have like shopping carts and stuff and theyll go around and collect cans and aluminum stuff and so we used to just save them up and then theyd come around and wed give them to them   umhum umhum umhum   but when during the winter time i think they they move south or something so   yeah   i dont do that anymore and the the recycling at Georgia Tech like that um outside the uh student center   umhum   they never empty those things   i know it i know it it piles up   they just overflow so whats a guy to do you know           i just dont know   i asked myself   i just dont know and now they have like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because mean until seven oclock you got to pay to park at the student center you cant really unload all your stuff     really huh well i you know its true hadnt thought about that that is very unconvenient inconvenient even     i know it i know   but uh so you do recycle dont you   oh yeah   yeah im kind of im kind of bad about it   the   but if i if see a  if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something   umhum   ill throw it in there  but i dont really i dont ever take anything   well i mean its really  you ought to because the the the farmers market recycles absolutely everything   uhhuh   and since we go there all the time i mean       probably be at all   but wait ive never seen you before  who are you     oh by the way my name is Julie   yeah my names Bill well   hi   hi   im from Atlanta   me too   neat   crazy       um well is there anything else youd like to share me about your recycling philosophy Julie   i just think that everybody ought to do it   do they do like what what about like um what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know   the only thing i know that you can recycle is milk jugs   really   yeah   what about like those grocery bags   oh yeah they have uh uh what i what i used to uh now that i dont go to the grocery store much its kind of moot but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time     uhhuh   and then go and hand them to them the next time and use them over and over   uhhuh   and but also most places i think like Big Star does and im not sure if Kroger does or not but   theyll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic   yeah and they they have like little little boxes that you can put your old bags in   aha   can bring them in   those petroleum products are gonna kill us   i know it i know it   its hostile planet i think Julie   it  it really is a small hostile planet           the petroleum pretty much i mean those petroleum products i think are the big uh you know   did you know that   the great Satan of the recycling   no really not  did you know that like something like fifty percent of the worlds landfills is like paper filled with paper   hm paper just seems so innocuous   huh   paper doesnt seem threatening at all you know   well it is it is though   it comes from trees how can it be bad   it is because they   they treat it with chemicals or something why cant trees break down i dont get it   well they do treat paper with chemicals like yellow paper you know   yep   takes something like  twenty times as long to decompose you know you can bury a piece of yellow paper an it will still be there in a couple of weeks   oh really   yeah itll be whole   huh   youll be able to read off of it   im gonna switch from those yellow legal pads then   um hum   im glad you told me that because i use those at work where i work and uh       but i can just forget that from now on im going to use im going to switch to the white ones     well white papers bad too they they treat it too   well what about uh papyrus you know made out of bamboo you know bamboo stuff from the   im sure thats fine im sure   from the banks of the Nile   maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again   you think so   maybe   tablets   yeah   i think we should just abandon the you know the written word altogether   you think i dont know well i mean   no what do you think   i think weve kind of you know i mean everybody everybody   kind of radical i know but   if everybody had a computer       we would no longer need paper at all   thats true if everyone had a twoway wrist watch TVs on their wrist like uh Dick Tracy     i would love that
