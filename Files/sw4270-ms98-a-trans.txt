                okay i guess probably the first thing uh we could start off with is uh if youve ever been on a jury before or not   oh thats a very interesting question the answer that i have is no in fact um i was selected for jury at one time but uh fortunately for me or unfortunately just depending on your perspective   uhhuh   umhum   i had already changed jurisdiction jurisdictions uh and so i had to reply that i couldnt do it   uh right i uh just recently retired from the army and and so when we uh moved to this area here i got selected for jury duty as did my wife and uh it was an interesting experience id never done it before and   well was it civil or or criminal     this was uh all civil although i uh i did have a chance at a criminal one they uh actually had to interview like about a hundred and fifty people before they could actually uh get together a jury because there had been so much publicity about it but uh i was not selected for that one i would have been interesting i think but the i guess the question that is uh what we think of uh trial by jury thats a hard question     yeah well on on the one hand theres a lot of uh of of of positive things youre not at the whim of one person who might have a grudge or a prejudice   right umhum   on the other hand um well juries are not legally expertise experts and and they often just feel bad for somebody   right umhum   but which is right they should often uh especially for example in a a civil case   yeah   theyll feel bad for the person who got injured and not take into account uh any of the legal aspects of the incident and award large damages that were really undeserving from a legal point of view   right and it meant umhum right course youre uh as a juror to youre youre really at the mercy of the uh the lawyers because you dont know what really went on and you can never depend on anybody telling the truth and uh youre kind of at the mercy of the various lawyers who are uh examining and cross examining the witnesses and theyre so its its really tough and one of the things when i was on the jury that that bothered me was the fact that i was holding in my hands possibly the life of that individual and when you got right down to it uh you i really never knew who was really telling the truth and who wasnt you cant you cant go by what the the lawyer is uh is saying pretty much and you dont know if the witnesses are being truthful even though they are sworn to tell the truth   right   its a very difficult decision i found uh  one of the things that bothered me was the in one case the the trial was stupid these people were supposedly adults youd think they could have worked their problems out but instead we had to sit there and listen to all the dumb things that they did and i felt sometimes like saying why dont you people just youre supposed to be adults why dont you get with the program and work out your problems instead of having to to go through all this in front of a jury it just seemed it just seemed dumb at the time   yeah well its hard you get when you get involved emotionally in somethings     right   so it it uh it gets   its an awful responsibility but its like voting and all the other things that were responsible for its   uh all the civic duty yeah   one of those things you have to do i guess   well i think one of the problems that we have here in the United States and the the question didnt seem to focus on civil things they want more focus on criminals   right   but um from my my perspective one of the problems is that in our Bill of Rights   uhhuh   we have it written that uh even for civil cases everyones guaranteed a right to a jury as long as the uh dispute is for more than twenty five dollars   right   umhum   now twenty five dollars at the time that they wrote the Bill of Rights was a lot different than what it is now     yeah that was a lot of money   and uh basically what it means is uh they try to say you know like uh petty things you dont get a jury and nowadays that same twenty five dollars might be i dont know   umhum   right   ten thousand dollars i im not exactly sure the uh the economics involved and   well yeah what the value would be equal to today   thats right and uh it makes it very uh   yeah     oh most cases in small most small cases for uh civil suits really shouldnt have even have the option of a jury   umhum yeah   uh i know we i was involved uh in a suit uh where the uh you know long time ago there was an accident whatever and an ambulance chaser came by and and wanted know you know i dont know five or ten thousand dollars   right uh   and they requested a trial by jury   uhhuh   and it seemed like really stupid that that they should even have that option for for such a small amount that our founding fathers didnt understand the economic principles involved   hm umhum the uh right first one that i had was a drug case and then the second one was a
