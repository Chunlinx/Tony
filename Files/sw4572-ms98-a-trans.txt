                so uh what things do you consider an invasion of privacy     well i dont know what do you think     oh i dont i dont know i had a little bit more time to think about it i was thinking of like uh   i dont know i started i started to think about all the big you know data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the  credit reports and   umhum   and all those you know demographics studies that they do that um you know have who knows how much you know stuff about all the purchases that youve made and everything kept tract somewhere and   i dont know i dont know how much the stuff actually what they actually have in there but   umhum   i know they use that i mean they they sell those to   well what about the required drug testing uh as a uh condition of employment   yeah that was that was that was the other one i was thinking of   i think thats uh i mean i know drugs are illegal   it  a subtle thing actually um   i uh have worked at Texas Instruments   uh uhhuh   and uh they instituted a drug policy there drug testing policy where they randomly would test uh employees   umhum   and actually to tell you the truth i really didnt think much about it i i hadnt you know it really didnt relate to me but there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they they get a false positive you know what recourse do you have   uhhuh   and   also um uh this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing this kind of big brother activity and yet uh a lot of these large corporations such as Texas Instruments although they dont admit to it its actually oh a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure   umhum   so   what that means is to me that really its the government thats requiring this although they dont actually execute execute it themselves its really the governments that so in that sense at at least uh philosophically its really borderline legal   umhum  well i i think that um i think that you know a persons competence should be more determined by you know their actions and their behavior and if theyre you know if theyre on some kind of you know controlled controlled substance then you know it kinds of takes away from the job of you know the supervisor or manager type person know who is able to evaluate them i think they should be evaluated that way rather than  with a you know a chemical you know   well what about this uh AIDS epidemic now where you find that uh   uh you know certain people are actually are are criminal in their disregard for   the people that are carriers and dont uh dont reveal it     others yeah and and uh of course the ultimate solution is to operate on their brain so that it doesnt get uh it destroys their libido   yeah thats that would be kind of an extreme   now uh you know if they ever   i mean ive heard of things like you know making them you know uh marking them somehow or you know or something like that or you know putting them all some some place like in a kind of a   so what about that as an invasion of privacy   yeah well i guess it kind of borders on where   yeah   i mean what do you value more the invasion of uh the persons privacy or the possible danger to you know other people   so really it it gets to balancing uh personal freedom against uh the general welfare   yeah   of society   i guess thats always thats been the big role of government i guess   well are its supposed to have been   i mean  generally yeah yeah well yeah thats kind of a difficult one to go into i mean that that particular case   now it   because i mean theres a lot of people that uh i mean they could require one you know obligatory obligatory AIDS testing for everyone because im sure you know theres a huge part of the population not a huge part but a you know the the AIDS population i guess that have it that dont know they do   a growing part umhum   and are spreading it but again to require you know such a test and just and then to make make it known they have it is to subject them to to discriminatory discriminatory practices and other things i dont know uh i dont know how exactly i feel about that   maybe chop their weenies off
