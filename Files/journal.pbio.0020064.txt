                            The ability to taste food is a lifeanddeath matter Failure to recognise food with a        high enough caloric content could mean a slow death from malnutrition Failure to detect a        poison could result in nearinstant expiration And now as researchers begin to understand        some of the nuts and bolts of taste perception it seems that the sense of taste may also        have more subtle effects on health                    The Basics of Taste        At the front line of the taste sensory system are the taste budsonionshaped structures        on the tongue and elsewhere in the mouth Figure  Up to  taste receptor        cellsepithelial cells with some neuronal propertiesare arranged in each taste bud In the        tongue the taste buds are innervated by the chorda tympani a branch of the facial nerve        and the glossopharyngeal nerve These nerves carry the taste messages to the brain        Taste is the sense by which the chemical qualities of food in the mouth are        distinguished by the brain based on information provided by the taste buds Quality or        basic taste explains Bernd Lindemann now retired but an active taste researcher in        Germany for many years is a psychophysical term Large numbers of people describe        different tastants and then statistical analyses are used to define the important tastes        The number of taste qualities has varied over the years says Lindemann We are now        settling at around five though I would not be surprised if some additional qualities pop        up        The five qualities that Lindemann refers to are salty sour bitter sweet and umami        the last being the Japanese term for a savoury sensation Salty and sour detection is        needed to control salt and acid balance Bitter detection warns of foods containing        poisonsmany of the poisonous compounds produced by plants for defence are bitter The        quality sweet provides a guide to calorierich foods And umami the taste of the amino        acid glutamate may flag up proteinrich foods Our sense of taste has a simple goal        explains Lindemann Food is already in the mouth We just have to decide whether to        swallow or spit it out Its an extremely important decision but it can be made based on a        few taste qualities                    From Physiology to Molecular Biology        Taste has been actively researched for many decades During the th century        electrophysiologists and other researchers worked hard to understand this seemingly simple        sense system Then in  the first olfactory receptors were described These proteins        which are exposed on the surface of cells in the nose bind to volatile chemicals and allow        us to detect smells This landmark discovery in part encouraged many established taste        researchers to investigate the molecular aspects of taste        The olfaction results also enticed researchers from other disciplines into the taste        field including collaborators Charles Zuker University of California San Diego UCSD        La Jolla California United States and Nick Ryba National Institute of Dental and        Craniofacial Research NIDCR Bethesda Maryland United States About six years ago        explains Zuker who previously worked on other sensory systems in flies there was a        disconnect between our understanding of sensations in the case of photoreception        mechanoreception touch and so on and what we knew about taste There was evidence says        Ryba that a class of protein receptors called Gproteincoupled receptors GPCRs were        involved in sweet and bitter taste but the receptors werent known so we started to look        for them  These molecules are intrinsically interesting but more importantly they        provide tools with which we can dissect out how taste works                    Bitter Sweet and Umami Receptors        The bitter receptors fell first to the onslaught of the UCSDNIDCR team and other        molecular biologists In  the ability to taste propylthiouracil a bitter tasting        compound had been linked to a locus on human Chromosome p Reasoning that this        variation might be due to alterations in the coding sequence for a bitter receptor the        UCSDNIDCR researchers used the draft of the human genome to search for sequences that        resembled GPCRs on Chromosome p That was how we found TR the first bitter receptor        and subsequently a whole family of TRs says Zuker                              Researchers want to know how is taste coded                          All these receptors says Zuker are coexpressed in bitter taste receptor cells a        result that contradicts other research showing that different bitterresponsive cells react        to different bitter molecules To me says Zuker it makes sense that all the bitter        receptors would be expressed in each bitter taste cell We just need to know if something        is bitter to avoid death not the exact identity of the bitter tastant        The sweet receptor story started in  with the identification of two putative        mammalian taste receptors GPCRs now known as TR and TR In early  four groups        reported an association between the mouse         Sac locus which determines the ability of mice to detect saccharin and        TR a third member of the TR family The UCSDNIDCR team subsequently showed that the        TR and TR heterodimer a complex of one TR and one TR molecule forms a broadly        tuned sweet receptor responsive to natural sugars and artificial sweeteners and that a        homodimer of two TR molecules forms a lowaffinity sugar receptor that responds to high        concentrations of natural sugars only All sweet detection concludes Zuker is via the        TR and TR receptors        And umami A truncated glutamate receptor was identified as an umami receptor by        researchers at the University of Miami Florida United States School of Medicine in         Zuker however believes that the one and only umami receptor is a heterodimer of TR and        TR In October  Zuker and his coworkers reported that mice in which either TR or        TR has been knocked out show no preference for monosodium glutamate MSG an umami        tastant However other researchers reported in August  that TR knockouts retain some        preference for MSG We believe this is due either to the truncated glutamate receptor or        another unknown receptor says lead author Sami Damak Mount Sinai School of Medicine New        York New York United States Damak says he does not know why the two sets of TR        knockout mice behaved differently but the UCSDNIDCR researchers suggest that the residual        response to MSG seen by Damak et al is a response to the sodium content of MSG Damak is        not alone however in thinking there may be more than one umami receptor and additional        sweet receptors        Commenting on these recent discoveries taste expert Linda Bartoshuk Yale University        School of Medicine New Haven Connecticut United States says that it is lovely to see        all these details especially as they confirm what we already believed conceptually For        example she says it is no surprise that there are many bitter receptors but probably only        one sweet receptor There are so many poisons and it makes perfect sense to have lots of        receptors feeding into a common transduction pathway Sweet is a different problem In        nature there are many molecules with structures similar to sugar that we must not eat        because we cannot metabolise them So I would have predicted one or at most a few highly        specific sweet receptors                    What about Salty and Sour Receptors        The salty and sour receptors may be very different from the GPCRs involved in bitter        sweet and umami perception which bind complex molecules on the outside of the cell and        transmit a signal into the cell For salty and sour perception the taste cell only needs        to detect simple ions One way to do this may be to use ion channelsproteins that form a        channel through which specific inorganic ions can diffuse Changes in cellular ion        concentrations could then be detected and transmitted to the nervous system        Physiologist John DeSimone Virginia Commonwealth University Richmond Virginia United        States says there are at least two ion channel receptors for salt in rodent taste receptor        cells The first of these is the epithelial sodium channel a widely expressed channel that        can be blocked specifically with the drug amiloride In rats says DeSimone only  of        the nerve response to salt can be blocked by amiloride so there is probably a second        receptor This he says seems to be a generalist salt receptorthe amiloridesensitive        channel only responds to sodium chlorideand may be the more important receptor in        people        Sour tastants are acids often found in spoiled or unripe food DeSimones current idea        is that strong acids enter taste cells through a proton channel probably a known channel        present on other cell types while weak acids like acetic acid vinegar enter as neutral        molecules and then dissociate to lower intracellular pH DeSimone believes that he has        identified the proton channel involved in sour taste as well as an ion channel that could        be the second salt receptor and he plans to do knockout experiments on both If these        channels are essential elsewhere in the body as DeSimone suspects to avoid lethality he        will need to construct conditional knockouts in which the channel is lost only in the taste        receptor cells        Zuker meanwhile is not convinced that the current ion channel candidates for salt and        sour perception are correct And he says GPCRs could also be involved in these        modalities There is a precedent for that he claims noting that extracellular calcium        is sensed by a GPCR                    TasteCoding        With many taste receptors now identified researchers are turning to a longstanding        question in taste perception how is taste coded When we eat our tongue is bombarded with        tastants How is their detection and transduction of information organised so that the        appropriate response is elicited Taste physiologist Sue Kinnamon Colorado State        University Fort Collins Colorado United States explains the two theories of        tastecoding In the labelledline model sweetsensitive cells for example are hooked        up to sweetsensitive nerve fibres that go to the brain and code sweet If you stimulate        that pathway says Kinnamon you should elicit the appropriate behavioural response        without any input from other cell types In the crossfibre model the pattern of        activity over many receptors codes taste This model predicts that taste receptor cells are        broadly tuned responding to many tastants Support for this theory says Kinnamon comes        from electrical recordings from receptor cells and from nerves innervating the taste buds        that show that one cell can respond to more than one taste quality        Zuker and Rybas recent work strongly suggests that tastecoding for bitter sweet and        umami fits the labelledline model in the periphery of the taste system Their expression        data show that receptors for these qualities are expressed in distinct populations of taste        cells In addition in early  they reported that as in other sensory systems a        single signalling pathway involving the ion channel TRPM and PLC a phospholipase that        produces a TRPM activator lies downstream of the bitter sweet and umami receptors When        the UCSDNIDCR researchers took PLC knockout mice which did not respond to bitter        sweet or umami and engineered them so that PLC was only expressed in bitter        receptorexpressing cells only the ability to respond to bitter tastants was regained        These data says Zuker support the labelledline model        The latest data supporting the labelledline model came last October when Zuker and        colleagues described mice in which a nontaste receptora modified opioid receptor that        can only be activated by a synthetic ligandwas expressed only in cells expressing TR        sweetresponsive cells The mice were attracted to the synthetic ligand which they        normally ignore indicating that dedicated pathways mediate attractive behaviours The        researchers plan similar experiments to see whether the same is true for aversive        behaviours        Even with all these molecular data the crossfibre model of tastecoding still has its        supportersjust how many depends on whom one talks to Both Damak and Kinnamon for        example believe that there is at least some involvement of crossfibre patterning even in        the taste receptor cells But says neurobiologist and olfaction expert Lawrence C Katz        Duke University Durham North Carolina United States the onus is now on people who        believe otherwise than the labelledline model to provide compelling proof for the        crossfibre theory because now at least at the periphery the evidence is compelling for a        labelled line for bitter sweet and umami Bartoshuk also says the debate is decided in        favour of the labelledline model in the periphery The crossfibre model is an interesting        historical footnote she comments        Whether this putative link between taste perception and health can be confirmed and        whether it will be possible to manipulate food preferences to improve health remain to be        seen However it seems certain that as in the past five years the next five years will        see large advances in our knowledge of many aspects of taste a fascinating and important        sensory system                    What Nextand Why Study Taste Anyway        The periphery of the taste sensory system has yielded many of its secrets but        relatively little is known about the transduction pathways in taste how taste cells talk        to the nervous system or about events further downstream in the brain How are signals        from taste receptors integrated with those from olfactory receptors to form a        representation of complex food flavours for example With their expanding molecular        toolbox researchers can now delve deeper into these aspects of taste perception This may        tell us not only about taste but about how the nervous system in general is put together        says Ryba        But understanding taste is not just an academic exercise It has practical uses too        DeSimone suggests that by understanding salt receptors it may be possible to design        artificial ligands to help people lower their salt intake As Kinnamon succinctly puts it        Can you imagine eating potato chips and not having the salty component An artificial        salt receptor ligand could make saltfree foods a palatable option for people with high        blood pressure Lindemann also sees a great future in artificial ligands for taste        receptors The sense of taste is partly lost in elderly people he says so better        tastantseffectively chemical spectaclesmight give them back their pleasure of eating        and thereby improve their quality of life        Finally some aspects of taste may be inextricably tied up with general health says        Bartoshuk Many people who can taste propylthiouracil are also supertastersthey have        more fungiform papillae structures containing taste buds on their tongues than        nontasters Figure  Supertasters find vegetables bitterparticularly brassicas like        Brussel sproutsso they tend to eat fewer vegetables as part of their regular diet than        nontasters Being a supertaster affects your taste preferences your diet and ultimately        your health claims
