                                            Over the past several years it has evidentlybecome fashionable for restaurants to have all their servers march out singingbirthday greetings to customers Am I the only person who finds thisintolerable Ive stopped going to restaurants that follow this custom if I canavoid them My wife likes the food at some of these places so compromisesmust be made The noise makes conversation impossible and I cant help butwonder if thats my meal being ignored in the kitchen during the song                                       Am I being pettyShouldnt servers be respectful of all customers What can be done                                       BH                        Honey get a gripPrudie just sang Happy Birthday to herself It takes  seconds If itis your meal being ignored for roughly one fifth of a minute Prudiedoes not think the delay will harm the flavor Let Prudie hasten to add thatshe too finds the wait staff singing the birthday song rather hokey andbelieves that the only people who dislike it more than you and I are thehonorees It is always embarrassing but certainly not worth the boycott of agood restaurant Prudie thinks you need to hook up your sense of humor to yourtolerance mechanism and find something really objectionable to dislike  suchas the suggested tip printed on the bill            Prudie proportionately                                             A Note From Prudie  What kids call grownups is still rilingsome readers so here is a knock for Prudie that was at leastcivil                                                         DearPrudie                                                      You stated Itsounds to Prudie as though you and your spouse are a little more formal thanthe times when that he felt children should address adults in a more formalmanner than using their first names You may be correct that they may be out oftouch with current rude customs of our society In my day children weretaught respect for their elders and one of the methods used was form ofaddress Today the television and the mall do the job that once was thepurview of parents Back then we had no guns in high schools no drivebyshootings no graffiti on the walls etc I for one am glad that I was raisedby parents who had a value system I still get up when a woman enters the roomopen a door for her and offer my seat on a bus Somehow I am happy to be tooformal for your society                                       Norm                        Dear Norm            Prudie applauds yourstanding for women and holding doors but must point out that calling adults bya first name if they wish it is a different issue Please be assured thatknives in the schools are not caused by calling Mrs Allen Jodie            Prudie realistically                                             DearPrudence                                                      While watching the impeachment trial myhusband of  years revealed to me that he had an affair with a friend of ourssome  years ago It went on for the eight months that we were in a commutingmarriage living in different states Ten years ago she came out on a vacationto visit us for two weeks and has continued to correspond during the holidaysMy husband says he was ashamed of his lie and that they had promised never totell me Over the past years I have asked him if there was anyone else and healways lied He said the reason for the continued correspondence was that if hestopped writing I might get suspicious So I wrote her and her husband andtold her to stop writingplus what I thought of her morals                                       After four months Icannot get this out of my mind I think I love him and want the marriage to goon but other days I feel so used that I cant believe I am still with himIve spoken to a counselor twice and that helped for a day or so My husband is and I am  What should I do Am I dumb to try to make this work I alsosuspect him of other lies but my views of reality are definitelyskewed                                       ep                        Dear e            Where to begin Prudie wants to tell you so manythings First is that you must find the way that is right for you to feel goodagain That old canard that confession is good for the soul usually onlyseems to work for the person confessing Lover Boys disclosure has clearly putyour life at sixes and sevens            Of course your husbands behavior was lower than asnakes tail in a wagon rut He has not only lied to you but also to the womanhe cheated with You however evened the score somewhat by writing to thewoman and her husband God only knows whats going on in theirhousehold            Therapy that improvesthings for only a day or so is not Prudies idea of effective help You mightwant to try someone else Since you suspect other lies you might want to havea trial separation On the plus side you say you love this man and the affairyou know about ended more than a decade ago On the minus side feeling yourenever getting a straight story is a major impediment to the comfort one feelswhen there is trust Prudie hopes you find your way to peace and resolutionand your guide will most likely be a competent therapist perhaps of themarriage counselor variety            Prudie empathetically                                             DearPrudence                                                      You recently ran a letter from about unwantedsympathy for what was a great example of how to live a life I also have someareas where I get very uncomfortable with sympathy I am the father of threesons Two of them died while they were teenagers one from an auto accidentand the other from cancer Yes I loved them deeply and still have a hole in myheart for them The problem is when in conversation someone asks generalquestions such as How many children do you have People are devastated if Itell them three but I lost two If I say one I am bypassing an important partof my life If I just say three I am not giving a very truthfulanswer                                       I have adjusted wellto these tragedies It has been hard I dont want to put people in anuncomfortable position There is also a part of me that hurts but I dontreally want to expose that to a stranger                                       Albany Father                        Dear Alb            Prudie bows low to a mansuch as yourself who having lived through what is said to be lifes cruelestevent is trying to do the honest philosophically correct and thoughtfulthing Prudie suggests that you tailor your answer to the situation If it is apassing social encounter with what you would call a stranger say one childIf you encounter someone with whom you feel rapport you might say three witha brief explanation and allow that person to express sympathy Let yourinstinct guide you Prudie wishes to suggest that you are not playing yourhistory false by not informing people of the two children you lost Let thedecision about what to say and to whom come from your heart the place wheretwo of your sons now live            Prudie respectfully
