                                  Wiener Whining at Super             It is a wellknown fact that the Shopping Avengerkeeps a special place in his heart for the downtrodden and the outcastincluding but not limited to the poor the indigent the day traders and theblind When the Shopping Avenger sees the forces of rampant capitalismmanhandling an unfortunate soul he will fly to the rescue straightaway unlesshes busy leading anarchists into battle on the streets of Seattle ornapping            But there is one group whose persecution willinstantaneously get the Shopping Avenger into superhero mode and that iswiener dogs            The Shopping Avenger loves wiener dogs TheShopping Avenger loves all animals but he especially loves animals that haveno discernible legs            So when Ms Gale Hogsten of South Carolina wrote tocomplain that the Super  motel chain abused her wiener dog along with therest of her family the Shopping Avenger donned his codpiece and cape andsuperhero tightsthough not necessarily in that orderand launched himselfinto battle Super  is a major motel chainit is two better than Motel butthe Shopping Avenger showed no fear            But first the Shopping Avenger will let GaleHogsten tell the story            As Hurricane Floyd was coming our way I booked aroom near Atlanta so we could get the heck out of here the aggrieved MsHogsten writes What Super  did was to call Hurricane Floyd a specialevent hence they were able to charge any damn price they wanted to Ourfamily got the regular rate of  the first night however others in the hotelstarted getting ripped off being charged  the second night and up to the third night Nothing like the feeling of being homeless and being screwedin the process The Shopping Avenger endorses the previous statementwholeheartedly            Like most people I was traveling with a pet andwhen I read about this particular Super  it did say still does that smallanimals are allowed We have a wiener dog a corgi and a cat Somehow theidiot at the desk heard we had animals and decided to charge us an extra bucks What are you going to do not pay            Not pay indeed            Plus Hogsten writesthey never gave us any maid service for three days            The Shopping Avenger made contact with Hogsten via emailand learned that her wiener dog whose name is Rusty was traumatized by theseevents though not as much as Hogsten was traumatized by these events Whatpissed me off personally was charging  bucks for the wiener dog she statedemphatically            The Shopping Avenger right away made contact withthe Super  executive offices Super  it turns out is owned by the CendantCorp which owns every hotel and motel room in America and is therefore thesort of unfeeling monopoly that would rob people fleeing a hurricane Exceptthat the executive who was assigned the difficult task of dealing with theShopping Avenger one Jennifer Nemeth did a provisionally satisfactory job ofmaking the Shopping Avenger happy            I hear you she said by way of introduction Weheard that some of our franchises were doing this sort of thing and we getangry when we hear about them doing it Nemeth maintained that Super  doesnot discriminate against shortlegged dogs We get a lot of letters sayingThanks for letting us bring Fluffy that sort of thing            Fluffy Who ever heard of a wiener dog named FluffyBut thats not the point            Nemeth promised toinvestigate the motel in question She promised to apologize on behalf ofSuper  to Rusty the wiener dog and she promised free nights at a Super  ofHogstens choice Wait till next episode to learn if Super  keeps itspromises            Now let us contrast the open attitude of Super  with thatof oh UHaul the Shopping Avengers bte noire  The Shopping Avengeris quite positive that as long as he is reachable via email atShoppingavengerslatecom each month will bring him  or  or  complaintsabout UHaul Littleknown fact UHaul spelled backward in Aramaic isPonzi            The Shopping Avengers new favorite UHaul storycomes from one William Brangham who states Ive resisted writing because youno doubt have received thousands of complaints about this company and Ithought Why pile on But after reading the other complaints youve receivedabout UHaul I think its fair to say that Ive got the topperUHaul almostkilled me            Do tell Mr Brangham            My girlfriend was moving from New York to VermontWhen we picked the truck up they did honor the reservation a man brought thevehicle out parked it out front and then reached behind the front seat andbrought out a bottle of fluid He opened the hood poured some of it somewherein the engine closed the hood put the bottle back and handed me the keys Iasked him what hed done and he said Oh just topping up some stuff            If youre thinking Yikes youre right            Brangham continues My girlfriend was in thedrivers seat and she literally couldnt move the wheel six inches in eitherdirection I got in there and could do little more  Then we realized thefluid that had been topped off was power steering fluid There was a pool of itgathering on the street I went behind the seat to find five empty bottles offluid plus one with about half a cup left It sure seemed like UHaulknowingly rented me a faulty truck            But it gets worse Brangham called UHaul customerservice which in the Shopping Avengers estimation is probably a guy namedJoe in a phone booth After waiting a considerable period of time a UHaulmechanic showed up taped up a leaky hose and left Its dark but we stillhave one stop across the river in Hoboken  Im driving the truck In themiddle of the Holland Tunnel doing about  mph the steering wheeldrastically stiffens Its now so hard to steer this huge truck that I have toput my foot up on the dash or on the door to tug the wheel in the direction Ineed it to go Im  and  lbs and it took every ounce of strength I hadto stop from smashing into oncoming traffic in the tunnel If myfivefootsomething lbs girlfriend had been driving theres absolutelyno way she could have controlled the truck            Horrible yes It gets still worse I bought powersteering fluid like it was cheap beer topped off and away we went He toppedoff every few miles The next day they drove the truck to a UHaul centerUpon arrival they keep us waiting for an hour and a half because themechanics not in yet like we told him When he finally arrives he proceedsto tell us incessant stories about how drunk he got the night before and howhis hangover is killing him            The mechanic eventually inspected the truckYouve got a busted hose he told them Mr Brangham writes The firstUHaul mechanic had patched the hole on the hose with electrical tapeApparently this is a very foolish thing to do  Even in his groggy statethe second mechanic couldnt believe a fellow mechanic would pull such astunt            Suffice it to say that Mr Brangham and hisgirlfriend made it to Vermont and asked for a refund because UHaul nearlykilled them But he reports UHaul didnt even offer an apology            Any of you loyal deputyAvengers out there have a UHaul story that can top this one You know where to write            In the previous episode the Shopping Avenger promised toexplain to the reader why Southwest Airlines is the Shopping Avengers favoritecompany and now the Shopping Avenger will keep his promise             Very tasty peanuts             Southwest tries at least most of the time tokeep its customers happy This is in marked contrast to every other airlineever flown by Shopping Avenger but particularly Northwest Airlines for whichShopping Avenger has very hard feelings at the moment for reasons that will beexplained in the next episode            Southwest does have its drawbacks The ShoppingAvenger when he was just a boy Avenger worked one summer at a Bobs Big BoyThe Shopping Avenger learned very quickly that Bobs Big Boy is a restaurantfor people who dont know how to eat in restaurants The same holds true forSouthwest It is an airline for people who dont know proper airline etiquetteOn his last Southwest flight from Baltimore to Phoenix the seat next to theShopping Avenger was filled by a gentleman whose first words were Bring onthe  Heinekens            The Shopping Avenger had a very long flight            But this of course isnot Southwests fault except insofar as Southwest makes its seats so cheapthat even drunken assholes can fly across this great country of ours            Recently the Shopping Avenger went to bat for one of hisloyal readers a certain Miss M who had an actual valid complaint aboutSouthwest Ms luggage  was left sitting for an hour in the rainon thetarmac When she got to her destination she discovered that her clothing wasruined She got very little satisfaction when she approached Southwest throughthe normal channels so she turned to the Shopping Avenger for justice            After some initial backingandforthing in whichSouthwest made noises that sounded very much like the noises made by suchairlines as Northwest when they do something wrong Southwest came around andoffered M two  travel vouchers M considered this a satisfactoryresolution and thus so did the Shopping Avenger who is nothing if not loyalto the wishes of his readers Southwest knows how to make people happy whichis very unusual in American business today            Next month Why UHaulis a key part of Satans plan for world domination                           Got a consumerscore you want settled Send email to shoppingavengerslatecom
