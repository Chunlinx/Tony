whole thing Should I in polite company be referring tomyself the same way                                       Please signme                                       All Doled Out in Ohio                        Dear All            There is no protocolmandating the third person for advice columnists Prudie does so because itfeels comfortable and she has tired of the I word Prudie agrees with youthough about the Bob Dole thing  so if you run for office by all means usethe firstperson pronoun so that people wont make fun of you As for politecompany the only kind to be in follow the above suggestion and speak asthough you were running for office            Prudie thirdpersonally                                             DearPrudence                                                      My wife and I recently renovated a fabulouscondo loft in a historic downtown area The unit immediately below us has beenrented out as a livework space to a couple with a video business Heres thething They are both heavy smokers and have managed in three months to smell upthe rest of the building Recently the ashtray smell has begun to permeate ourapartmentI presume through the wooden floors                                       I am a nonsmoker andallergic to cigarette smoke Entreaties to the apartments owner have gonenowhere I am not an intolerant person having grown up in New York City whereone mans ceiling is another mans floor I am not an antismoking nut eitherjust as long as I can stay away from it What can I do I dont feel itsappropriate to try and dictate someones behavior in their own apartment butthe smell drives me nuts                                       Smokeless in Savannah                        Dear Smoke            You do indeed have a problem It sounds as thoughyou have purchased your loft but the nicotineaddicted couple is renting Andyou are correct that you cannot dictate private activities in someone elseshome unless body parts are sailing by your window            Because you report thatthe owner is unwilling to support you you have limited options Short ofselling your fabulous renovated condo you can stock up on neutralsmelling airfreshener or make a plea to the smokers themselves Prudie by the way issympathetic because she has marveled that cigar smokers can stink up theoutdoors  And just a little PS because Prudie senses you are in a NewYork state of mind In apartments everywhere in the world one mans ceiling isanother mans floor            Prudie odorously                                             Prudence                                                      In reference to the etc I am LEFThanded and therefore leftfooted but I dont think thataffects my ability to be honest Really tired of the LEFT jokes insultsetc                                       Sue                        Oh my Prudie has foundyet another way to be politically incorrect Hows this for making amendsPrudie was not in her RIGHT mind when she wrote that answer Feel better            Prudie adroitly                                             DearPrudie                                                      In your response to  several weeks ago yousaid that Sometimes an inexperienced womana young onewill be turned offwhen a guy is too nice A friend of mine who is about my age  said thesame thing recently She just isnt attracted to nice guys but cant reallyexplain why                                       Being a much moreeloquent and mature woman yourself do you think you could explain ImmatureWoman Syndrome to me so that I can understand the many wonderful but immatureyoung women I know Or if you think it would be easier you could just elopewith me so that I wouldnt have to face the thankless but highly entertainingtask of dealing with them                                       Happily Confused                        Dear Hap            Prudie thinks you have a darling sense of humor andthanks you for the offer of marriage As for your question Prudie did not sayall young women are unresponsive to nice guys  just some Proof ofthis is the numerous older women who picked guys who were nice and whoare still married All you need to know about the IYW syndrome is that agrounded womansomeone you would wantwill not be looking for a guy who istrouble or Mr Bad Behavior The babes with radar for difficult men have theidea that they can fix a guy or tame him It gives them a feeling of powerand danger Prudie has long felt however that women are not reformschools            You will be fine mydear Prudie just knows it            Prudie maturely                                             Pru                                                      My sister has threeadorable daughters one aged  and twins aged  I do not yet have children ofmy own so I visit my nieces as often as possible On occassion my oldestniece will  spend a weekend with me My problem is with how my sister treatsher girlsshe screams Shut up at them constantly and also hassles theyearold about her weight Shes a bit chunky but not obese for petessake Our mother certainly never treated us this way and it makes cringe tothink of what these comments might be doing to the girls Can I say somethingto her How                                       mm                        Dear m            It sounds as though your sister is overwhelmed bythe responsibilities and obligations of raising young children  and twinscan be a special strain trust me You dont say what your relationship is withher but Prudie suggests you arrange to have coffee and a chat during whichyou can tell her that you are aware of her short fuse with her adorable girlsyou understand the many demands on her and that there is help for thesituation Pass on the name of a group for parents like her It is ParentsAnonymous and it helps stressed out parents who fear they might escalate fromyelling to actual physical abuse There are  chapters so chances are goodshes near one Even the knowledge of such a group will reassure her that herproblem is by no means unique to her family and that shes definitely notalone            You might also point outthat harping at the older child about her weight is psychologicallycounterproductive Suggest that she choose the household food with nutrition inmind so that the yearold cannot dive into a bag of Cheetos Overeatingchildren however can find ways of filching chocolate etc when theyre outof the house You could also say more importantly that some unhappiness maybe making the child cling to food Good luck in your mission to help yourniecesand your sister            Prudie supportively
