            okay so what were you saying   do you work with do you work around children when you work with computers   no no not at all i work with computers yep they what one thing i   okay do you have but you have friends that have children   i have some friends that have children uh not that many actually   that have been uhhuh what is child care like in New York what is   uh i do not really know excuse me too much about child care in New York   does the company you work for have child care on premises for the employees   excuse me one second huhuh no not at all in fact my situation is a little bit strange i was uh a student for many years and then graduated and went and worked in France for awhile have just come back and was doing consulting work so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now uh and and i might   oh oh my a sabbatical well i hope you can stay as long as possible with   yeah well hopefully i can do some consulting work at home and if i can do that it will yeah ill be able to spend the time with my daughter and not have to worry too much about child care      oh that would be wonderful right right   but uh i might start to go crazy with it too it is a little i i miss the intellectual stimulation   right   but at the same time i really it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now and   i think it does when when theyre real little and theyre changing every day theres and you just miss the little things and and uh   oh yes yeah well i think for me the important concerns i do not think i would put her in day care for joint situation right now unless it was like one other child with a with a person   uhhuh uhhuh   i wouldnt want her to be into a in a large day care situation so young because i think a little infant just doesnt get the stimulation they need   uhhuh thats right   maybe if if i needed to work part time like four hours a day i might do that because like you should get enough stimulation from me the rest of the time but uh i just think that you know when theres two year olds running around the whoever is taking care of them the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds and only when the infant screams are they going to go there and if not the infant is going to lay in the crib all day and maybe have a mobile above it to play with   thats right thats right right   and you know i play with her most of the time shes awake and i think that is so important   right well that it is important for the bonding that they do it with the mother this is     yeah well such as things for learning gives the child stimulation i think is important   right   and uh   our oldest grandson when he was eighteen months old went into a a Montessori day care system and they took infants starting at six weeks and they have a program uh   uhhuh   in that was devised by this Montessori person and uh a certain type of stimulations and theres times of day that even when the child is awake that they they lay quietly and look at certain things they keep deliberately keep the room not real bright and and uh they have different things theyll theyll put them down on the floor and of course they never have more than like five   uhhuh   and and theyll put them down on the floor and they will have oh i think one of them was a little mirror and some were just different objects that have had a definite purpose for kids you know and theres something about their eyes   uhhuh yeah well shes shes just been doing all kinds of stuff where shes you know   uh how old is she now oh yeah   shes two months now nine weeks and shes just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that and shes just started that like yesterday or the day before   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and so every days are different and i think that you know i think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older and   uhhuh   ill probably be going back to work around January whereas shell be about eight or nine months old and so i think you know shell be at a i have heard its a roughage to put them into a   um   it is because thats when theyre clinging to mama so you might have a real problem with that   yeah   i think it it hurts the parents to leave when the child is crying so it you know it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place but thats unusual   but but i think it yeah were just going to have to see how things work out uh but im trying to you know leave her a fair amount even at this young age with her grandparents just to go to a movie and things like that so that shes used to other people taking care of her   uhhuh is it your parents or your husbands parents   my parents my husbands parents are in France so its a little bit harder but during you know she she shes met them already   oh   not that she will remember them but shes met them   right right thats nice when uh i my i have three grandchildren another one coming in September and i it would if they were where i couldnt get my hands on them im afraid i would probably go crazy i you know i i like that but if it you do not have to put them in child care thats   uhhuh are they all nearby   thats an ideal situation for you is to stay with them as or you can set up your work program and your husbands so that one of you is there all the time thats thats wonderful for the child   yeah   but right and you need to look at when you if you do decide to go with child care you really need to to   well if i work part time that might be doable   look at what your options are and and look at the what they offer drop in at times that are unexpected the   yeah well right now the situation is so tight at many places that its even hard to have a choice   uh uh   incredible but you know since this is people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids  and you know i just find that incredible and my sisterinlaw is going to have a baby very very soon and shes intending to stay home with the baby   uhhuh uhhuh oh   and you know maybe do some freelance type work from home and so if i go back to work on a part time basis im hoping i can leave my daughter with her because her daughter you know again will be a couple   oh that would be wonderful   my daughter will be about six months older than hers and you know itll be a little rough when she is a very very little infant but like when she is a month or so my sisterinlaw has had lots and lots of experience dealing with babysitting for large families and so uh   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh oh   she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day and we could might even be able to do it on a trade off basis that i watch their baby when they want to go out to dinner or to movies or whatever or if she wants an afternoon off even if she wants an afternoon just to work   right right right uhhuh uhhuh   uh and not be bothered we might be able to exchange that way   uh huh   and so well just have to see how things work out but i think the whole you know ideally i think the businesses should have the day care centers there whether its the parents who take turns watching the kids or whether they hire a couple of people and uh you know parents come down to supervise or whatever   i do too really well trained people right and have have some kind of real good program set up so that you when you go you can be assured that if theres an emergency that person in charge knows CPR or first aid or   um yeah oh yeah   and and have some kind of program set up like you say to stimulate the kids or educate them in some manner and have the you know the right toys and the right setting and uh have a an organized type of program set up so that the kids have a schedule you know thats real important to little kids   yeah well shes my daughter doesnt seem to be on a real schedule yet and its  probably my fault because i do not have a real schedule now but   uhhuh they they adjust to what the parents   yeah well shes been staying up late at night and  you know sleeping late in the mornings and things is just fine by me     uhhuh we you know that works until they start school and thats a problem society is geared to a a day person and its   right   i have uh another friend whos brother and his wife have done this they stay up until all hours of the night
