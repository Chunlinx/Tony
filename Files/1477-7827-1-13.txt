                    Background        Estrogenic steroids regulate cellular function in a wide        variety of tissues     During human pregnancy the        production of betaestradiol E rises eighty fold        from  nM preovulatory peak to  nM at term               and estrogens influence various aspects of placental        function and fetal development in humans and primates                  Several previous studies have shown that        human placenta binds estradiol       However more        recent immunohistochemical studies on paraffinembedded or        snap frozen sections as well as other techniques RTPCR        for ERalpha mRNA failed to demonstrate estrogen receptor        alpha ER in human placentae during pregnancy or in        cultures of dispersed placental cells      However        it has been indicated that the failure to detect the ER        does not entirely preclude the presence of this receptor in        human trophoblast cells but might be attributed to a        relatively low number and density of ER molecules on these        cells     On the other hand Billiar et al reported        identification of the ER in the nuclei of cultured human        placental syncytiotrophoblast     To our knowledge no        western blot analysis of placental ER expression has been        previously described        During the third trimester and after  weeks of        pregnancy in particular the placenta may develop an        abnormality often classified as placental aging                 These abnormal placentae are characterized by        generalized interstitial fibrosis and fibrinoid        degeneration of villous stroma and are associated with        cellular apoptosis and congestion of villous sinusoids               Immunohistochemically villous abnormality is        associated with progressive diminution of Thy        differentiation protein in the villous core     Marked        changes in villous structure are particularly associated        with advanced maternal age      We have recently        reported that with respect to the Thy expression        compensatory dilatation of villous sinusoids and placental        expression of low molecular weight cyclin E variants the        term placentae can be classified into four placental types        PTPT     where PT corresponds to the most severe        placental abnormality These observations indicate that the        term placenta is not a constant structure either        morphologically or biologically Therefore expression of        certain placental proteins including ER may vary        Upon immunohistochemical staining ER is predominantly        localized to cell nuclei However positive staining of ER        in the cytoplasm can also be seen       It has        been reported that cytoplasmic ER expression accompanied        by a lack of nuclear staining is characteristic for        immature cells nuclear ER indicates differentiating        cells and complete lack of ER expression accompanies        terminal differentiation of estrogensensitive cells            In addition evidence for cell surface ER expression has        been recently presented            Trophoblast cells are usually separated and grown in        media containing phenol red PhR     Phenol red is a        weak estrogen with apparent biological effects and the ER        binding affinity in Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium        DMEM is equivalent to levels of E as high as  nM            Although relatively low when compared to the E        levels in pregnancy this estrogenic binding affinity of        PhR is close to that of E during the preovulatory peak             Therefore we included studies with PhR PhRE        and PhRE media in order to determine the effect of        estrogens on differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells        syncytium formation derived from normal and abnormal        placental types        Here we show for the first time that the ER protein is        expressed in normal and marginally abnormal placentae        normal placental types but barely detectable in placentae        exhibiting moderate and severe abnormality abnormal        placental types However all placental types showed        distinct ER expression in trophoblast cultures Nuclear        ER expression was confined to the villous and tissue        culture mononucleated trophoblast cells but not        syncytiotrophoblast layers DMEM with PhR stimulated        differentiation of trophoblast cells from normal placental        types but midpregnancy levels of E significantly        enhanced differentiation of cultured trophoblast cells        derived from both normal and abnormal placentae                    Materials and Methods                  Tissues          Ten placentae from deliveries between  and  weeks          of pregnancy were investigated The source of placental          tissue were women with normal and abnormal pregnancies          admitted to the University of Tennessee Medical Center          Six additional cases were studied for the effect of E on          trophoblast differentiation Excluded were

temperature fixed  min in acetone dried           min and stored at C until immunoperoxidase staining          was performed  within two to four weeks Prior to          staining the slides were transferred in a cold room          C into air protected boxes containing Drierite          granules WA Hammond Drierite Co Ltd Xenia OH to          prevent water condensation and the boxes with

expression of cyclin E cE low molecular weight protein          variants four basic placental types can be recognized          PTPT Table           Normal mature placentae placental type  PT show          strong Thy expression in the villous core and          relatively small lumen of sinusoids expression of cE          variants is low The PT can be viewed as placenta          capable of fulfilling the demands of the growing fetus          occasional villous regeneration and expansion of          existing mature villi without requirement of adaptive          dilatation of villous sinusoids          Marginal irregularity the PT is characterized by          significant diminution of Thy staining and moderate          but significant dilatation of villous sinusoids Cyclin E          expression is highest in this placental type The PT can          be viewed as placentae with villous and vascular          adaptation to imminent placental aging enhanced villous          regeneration and expansion accompanied by moderate          dilatation of villous sinusoids          Placentae showing further diminution of Thy          expression and excessive dilatation of villous sinusoids          are classified as PT Cyclin E expression is higher          compared to PT but lower compared to PT The PT can be          viewed as placentae exhibiting advanced aging capable of          compensating demands of the growing fetus only by extreme          dilatation of villous blood sinusoids          Finally in PT Thy expression in terminal villi is          very low but this is not accompanied by dilatation of          villous sinusoids Cyclin E expression varies The PT          can be viewed as placentae exhibiting villous immaturity          either compensated by placental hypertrophy villous          regeneration and expansion without maturation  maternal          diabetes mellitus PTA or uncompensated placental          atrophy associated with villous immaturity  intrauterine          growth retardation PTB with apparent consequences for          the newborn Further details are given in Ref                       Altogether placental abnormality is not as simple as          one might imagine eg just placental aging Table          shows that abnormal placentae include either advanced          placental aging with an excess of villous blood sinusoid          dilatation PT or severe villous immaturity without          significant dilatation of villous sinusoids PT Again          the latter can be either compensated by placental          hypertrophy normal Apgars associated with fetal          macrosomia in maternal diabetes PTA or uncompensated          placental hypotrophy and associated with intrauterine          growth retardation and apparent deterioration of the          Apgar scores    PTB          Note that the Table also summarizes the data with          respect to ER expression showing either strong          expression of ER protein PT and PT or only traces          PT and PT This supports a view that regardless of          pathophysiology the intensity of in vivo ER expression          can be utilized for discrimination between the two basic          categories only the normal NP PT and PT and the          abnormal placentae AP PT and PT Observations          supporting this view follow Possible exceptions for PT

mixture of well developed syncytia and persisting          mononucleated trophoblast cells with ER          immunoreactivity However in late cultures from abnormal          placentae the formation of

Variability of outcome in trophoblast cultures          Figure           Figures shows that trophoblast cultures from normal          placentae characterized by strong Thy expression in          the

Nonparametric ANOVA was extremely significant            P   Dunns Multiple          Comparisons Test indicated a significant difference in          ER expression between normal placenta PT in vivo vs

cultures          from PT showed a high increase when compared to the PT          in vivo P   but there was no significant          difference when the PT early and late cultures were          compared However late PT culture PT LC showed          significantly lower ER vs both PT cultures P            This correlated with differences in syncytium          formation Fig Cvs F                          Variability of placental ER expression Figure                    In western blot analysis of the ten placental samples          investigated five showed a distinct ER band at  kDa          and five exhibited barely detectable ER expression Fig          A Note that in Fig A the placentae with strong ER          expression belong to the PT normal or PT slightly          abnormal types while placentae with low ER expression          belong to the PT and PT types moderate and severe          abnormality For statistical purposes in this study the          PT normal and PT placentae slightly abnormal with          compensatory villous differentiation were coupled as          normal placentae NP The PT moderate abnormality          compensated by maximum dilatation of sinusoids

        and late trophoblast cultures Interestingly the PT in          lane  shows a diminution of ER expression already at          early culture possibly due to the accelerated syncytium          formation already activated           in vivo              Fig Dsummarizes the data on ER expression in all          ten placentae and cultures presented in panels AC It          is apparent that high ER expression in normal placentae          in vivo was relatively constant yet there were marked          differences among trophoblast cultures ranging from ER          diminution to persisting ER expression Indeed only a          small proportion of trophoblast cultures from PT          placentae showed complete transformation of          cytotrophoblast cells into the syncytia while in others          mature syncytia were accompanied by cytotrophoblast          cells          Nonparametric ANOVA for Fig Dwas extremely          significant            P   Dunns Multiple          Comparisons Test indicated significant difference in ER          expression between NP in vivo when compared to AP in vivo                     P   Estrogen receptor          alpha expression in AP in vivo was also significantly          lower compared to all other columns at           P   Interestingly the          ER expression in AP early and late cultures          significantly exceeded that of NP in vivo            P            Altogether very low in vivo ER expression in all          moderately and severely abnormal placentae rose          significantly several fold in early cultures and high          expression remained unchanged in late cultures This          correlated with poor development of syncytial          aggregates                          The role of E in terminal differentiation of          trophoblast cells Figures and           Trophoblast cultures from six additional term          placentae were studied for trophoblast differentiation in          normal DMEMHG medium with phenol red PhR in phenol          redfree medium without E PhRE and in phenol          redfree medium with  nM E PhRE Three placentae          were classified as normal two PT and one PT and          three as abnormal two PT and one PT All time           freshly isolated trophoblast cells and early cultures          showed distinct ER bands regardless of the absence          E or presence of E or PhR in the media during          trophoblast separation and regardless of their origin          from normal or abnormal placentae Late cultures showed          lower ER expression in cell lysates from normal          placentae when compared to that from abnormal placentae          data not shown          Trophoblast cells from normal placentae cultured in          PhR medium formed midsized syncytial clusters in early          cultures and large syncytial clusters in late cultures          l Fig A see also Fig Band C The same cells          cultured in PhRE medium showed a retardation of

cultured in PhRE medium showed severe          retardation of syncytium formation in early and late          cultures Fig E However PhRE medium stimulated          trophoblast differentiation in early

from three NP and          three AP studied It is apparent that PhR media          stimulated syncytium formation in NP but not AP Lack of          estrogens PhRE caused retardation and E          supplementation stimulated syncytium formation in          trophoblast cultures derived from both normal and          abnormal placentae          Nonparametric ANOVA for Fig was extremely significant

Fig  Note that the          measurement of extra large syncytium aggregates in NP          PhRE see xl Fig C was limited by a maximum view          area representing  sq m see Materials and          Methods          Altogether E appears to stimulate terminal          differentiation of trophoblast cells derived from normal          and abnormal placentae both expressing ER in vitro and          to enhance a fusion of syncytial clusters into extremely          large aggregates The presence of phenol red a weak          estrogen in the culture is sufficient to stimulate          differentiation of trophoblast cells into large syncytia          in cultures from normal placentae but not from abnormal          ones                            Discussion        This is the first demonstration of ER protein        expression in human placentae by western blot analysis        Nuclear ER expression was confined to the villous        mononucleated trophoblast cells associated with        trophoblastic syncytium and differentiating cultured        cytotrophoblast cells No nuclear ER staining was detected        in trophoblastic syncytia in vivo or in vitro        Unexpectedly extravillous trophoblast cells also lacked        ER These observations indicate that trophoblastic nuclear        ER expression is characteristic of cytotrophoblast cells        differentiating into syncytial structures but not for        resting cytotrophoblast cells Additional placental cell        types expressing the ER were fibroblastderived vascular        pericytes and extravillous amniotic fibroblasts        Estrogens may via the ER contribute to the stimulation        of terminal differentiation of mononucleated trophoblast        cells into syncytial aggregates Terminal trophoblast        differentiation is associated with diminution of ER        expression        Nuclear ER expression is characteristic of        estrogensensitive cells which might be stimulated by        estrogens to proliferate as well as modulate differentiated        functions In placental material ER expression determined        by western blot analysis showed either strong ER or barely        detectable ER bands and where investigated there were no        transitions between these two types of ER expression In        addition strong ER expression was associated with normal        placentae PT and PT suggesting that in these term        pregnancies ER cytotrophoblast cells contribute to        syncytium differentiation On the other hand placentae        exhibiting moderate and severe abnormality showed virtually        no ER expression by western blot analysis or        immunohistochemical staining of tissue sections except the        vessels This indicates there is no syncytium        differentiation although the senescent placentae of        females of advanced maternal age were reported to exhibit a        higher number of Ki dividing mononuclear trophoblast        cells     These observations suggest that dividing        cytotrophoblast cells do not necessarily contribute to        syncytium differentiation and may not express ER        An unexpected feature was the strong ER expression of        cultured trophoblast cells derived from placentae deficient        in ER expression in vivo This observation indicates that        the lack of ER expression in vivo is not due to the        inability of trophoblast cells to express ER in general        It might be speculated that under conditions of tissue        culture factors modulating ER expression are different        from that in vivo Given that ER expression is already        enhanced at the end of the cell separation time  ER        expression appears to be inhibited in vivo        Virtual lack of in vivo ER expression seems to be an        additional indicator of moderate and severe placental        abnormality Based on in vivo ER expression the placentae        may be divided into the two basic categories normal        placentae NP ER and abnormal placentae AP ER        However it should be considered that some PT placentae        the functions of which are in harmony with actual fetal        demands may not exhibit compensatory differentiation of        trophoblast cells and therefore may not express ER in        vivo Table  The existence of placental aging is still        debated yet various clinical morphological cellular and        molecular aspects of placental senescence have been        indicated               However        it is still unclear if there are any consequences of        placental aging for normal pregnancy delivery and        neonatal birth weight and Apgar scores       It        has to be noted that even the abnormal placenta may have        the capacity to improve its function and compensate for        demands of the growing fetus eg by elongation and        excessive dilatation of villous sinusoids             As recently indicated     certain types of        placental abnormality have also been ascribed to the        villous immaturity low or no Thy differentiation protein        expression in placental villi and a lack of blood sinusoid        dilatation  PT see above accompanied by an existing        diabetes mellitus or absent placental hypertrophy        intrauterine growth retardation  Table  However it        has been suggested that although chronic placental        adaptations may be successful for the fetal survival eg        in placental senescence or maternal diabetes they may lead        to adverse outcomes later in the life of an individual            Therefore although it might not be apparent in the        newborn the abnormal placenta may indicate a burden for        the future of an individual and for the quality of the        human population Yet placental abnormality is not a rare        event since it has been found in  of the cases in our        material        The second cell type expressing the ER were amniotic        fibroblasts and fibroblastderived vascular pericytes        Estrogen receptors have been identified in cultured        fibroblasts of various origins and vascular smooth muscle        cells       Estrogens enhance proliferation of        fibroblasts and inhibit vascular smooth muscle migration             Binding of estrogens to fibroblasts also        stimulates fibroblast interaction with epithelial cells        with subsequent acceleration of maturation of epithelial        cells            The last observation is of particular importance to        several aspects of this study Activated Thy villous        fibroblasts characterized by secretion of Thy        differentiation protein among epithelial cells in vivo and        among cultured trophoblast cells in vitro      are        present in PT and PT but absent from PT and PT        placentae    see also Fig Avs D Various types of        placental mesenchymal cells inevitably accompany purified        trophoblast cells     and highly activated Thy        fibroblasts are present in early trophoblast cultures            Extravillous trophoblast cells do not express ER yet        indeed there are no Thy fibroblasts among the basal        plate and chorion laeve extravillous trophoblast cells see        Fig O Hence Thy fibroblasts may stimulate        differentiation and ER expression in mononucleated        trophoblast cells        Although estrogens were suspected to stimulate        trophoblast differentiation      no direct proof has        been provided up to date Trophoblast cells derived from        normal placentae differentiated into large syncytial        clusters in the presence of PhR without E supplementation        Phenol red in tissue culture media is a weak estrogen        sufficient to stimulate the proliferation of ER MCF        human breast carcinoma cells     We report a similar        estrogenic effect of PhR media on trophoblast        differentiation and syncytium formation in cultures from        normal placentae but not from abnormal ones        Because trophoblast cultures derived from both the        normal and abnormal placentae were ER in time  cell        lysates the above difference can not be ascribed to the        lack of ER expression Yet ER at midpregnancy levels        further stimulated syncytium development as evidenced by        the development of extremely large syncytial aggregates in        late cultures from normal placentae and development of        large syncytial aggregates in cultures from abnormal        placentae Hence trophoblast cells from abnormal placentae        are also capable of differentiating in response to        estrogenic stimuli but the level of estrogens must be        higher However it is important to note that        pharmacological levels of E  nM have been found to        suppress development of syncytial aggregates even in        cultures derived from normal placentae unpublished data        Hence either low or extremely high levels of estrogens in        vivo may cause a suppression of placental syncytium        formation        Our observations indicate that the cultures from normal        and abnormal placentae contain similar trophoblast cells        capable of differentiating in response to exogenous        estrogens but they may differ in the ability of        accompanying mesenchymal cells to promote this process One        might speculate that in cultures derived from normal        placentae the weak estrogenic effect of PhR is sufficient        to stimulate trophoblastmesenchymal cell interactions in        vitro resulting in a local production of estrogens It is        possible that the estrogens can be secreted by the        syncytiotrophoblast clusters and fibroblasts because these        cell types express the enzyme aromatase     Indeed        trophoblast cultures are capable of producing estrogens                   The data are summarized in Table  Our observations        rise a fundamental question if E is not in fact an        essential input for trophoblast differentiation Yet        previous experience has shown that lower estrogen levels        during pregnancy are indicative of poor fetal condition                               Conclusion        Placental ER expression in vivo is high in normal        placentae and barely detectable in abnormal placentae The        significant increase of estrogen production occurring with        pregnancy advancement may play a role via the ER in the        stimulation of terminal differentiation of mononucleated        trophoblast cells into syncytial aggregates and promote        placental function This mechanism however may not        operate in abnormal placentae which show a lack of ER        expression
