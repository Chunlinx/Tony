        okay so   okay were going to talk about lawn and garden today okay um where do you work at or do you you wish to discuss that   right what uh no i im in uh well i live in uh Richardson Texas and uh   oh okay yeah were neighbors okay   yeah and uh but grew up in uh Iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of  lawn and garden work uh and uh   hi can you hang on just a minute thank you   yeah   i have no idea he didnt broadcast thank you uhhuh  im sorry go ahead   no so uh uh not not growing up familiar with here uh uh when i get a chance i listen to Neil Sperry and do that  and uh   oh i do all the time i do all the time i get a lot of good tips from him   yeah uh   i have his book too umhum   yeah dont do any uh any gardening in the sense of uh vegetable gardening but uh   not in Texas   tried tried tried some tried some different flowers and and uh bushes and stuff and uh       uh have a have a lawn service there was one when we when we bought the house and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one but in terms of the fertilizing and uh weed control mainly leave that up to them what about you   umhum well no i had a lawn service one year and i thought phooey im going to do it myself because i figured up the cost and i said huhuh i can do it much   yeah yeah   cheaper and better and so what i did i switched to a liquid and i do it with an applicator with my hose and its so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over the territory i was surprised how easy it was   yeah yeah well   and it i thought well im going to do this all the time   well good   so i found you know and ive got some problems with uh two trees in my front yard and i took them to a certified uh nurseryman the other day and do you know what he told me i he needed to do   yeah no   which is at  its just unreal he said i needed to pull every leave off the tree and the tree is fifteen feet high and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it and he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said i should purchase and i thought uhoh  this is this is unreal this is unreal     yeah   so uh i think ill get my soninlaw to do it for me if he will but   yeah what what what kind of a is this some sort of a disease or is it a pest   yes its a disease that its got and i dont know what happened to it uh and then it   what well what kind   it um well   what kind of trees are they   well one is a maple one is um   huh   a maple but i would much prefer i think its not a native Texan tree   yeah   and uh the one that the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property and they dont get any care and theyre Cedar Elm and theyre just beautiful     uhhuh uhhuh   so i mean it its you know these things that you pamper some people have really a green thumb and you know and um although i dont have   yeah   too serious a problem but i dont know if it was from the the the late freezes that were or the early freezes we had that caused this tree damage and you know Sperry said you know thats what happened to the Crepe Myrtles   yeah   the last two years that you we are looking at all of the freeze damage from the prior two years   yeah   so i kind of think that maybe that uh happened to these large trees that i have   yeah   and i really hate to lose them but um thats one of the hazards i guess of uh having a a yard because i   yeah yeah well thats thats one thing that we had weve had very poor luck with with is in in our yard is is trees but the uh what what trees were were there when we moved in uh uh   umhum   were had been put in by the developer when he built the house and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree i think yeah and uh   right the quick growing yeah and they and he   figured up last night at there were seven different trees of of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in and we got one left at this point but uh a couple of them weve lost to the wind werent too good trees weve lost to wind uh uh   um umhum   three we three weve lost to to uh freezes between uh eighty three and uh and then uh a year ago we lost uh   can i pick your brain about how you got rid of those trees did are they still there did you cut them down at the at the ground level or did you pull them up by the roots or how did you get rid of them because if i   another one well   i i dont know how to get rid of these big trees because one has a circumference of about ten inches and   yeah well we didnt have we didnt have any that were that   oh   that big when they uh went two of two of them uh  the wind the wind blew over uh   umhum oh   in in terms of getting them down uh   umhum because i dont want stubs in my lawn because you still have to   but yeah yeah now the the one that the one that we lost the last one that we lost a a year ago uh up up until then they dont hadnt been big enough but what i just   umhum   used a hand saw and sawed them off at at as close close to ground level as i could and then   the base to the ground umhum   uh got some got some chemical that you drill holes and pour in that helps   bore i see try uh a stump killer yeah uhhuh   helps rot the stump killer yeah stump killer and stump stump rotter but uh this last one had a fair sized root and some guy   uhhuh   was doing a job in the neighborhood uh and and saw it and stopped in and asked if i didnt want the stump dug out on the spot for thirty five bucks and i said fine and he had he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that and it   yeah and they get that saw and i think its a kind some kind of a screwing a screwing thing that just rips it right out   yeah yeah and it it just it just ripped it right   right out yeah   right out and uh i took the it it left the it left he left the chips and i   used those for uh mulch sure   put them up mulch around around around the other shrubs and uh   sure   uh had had a pile of dirt from various things uh back by the garage that i filled in with and and its filling in with with grass uh nicely this year so that that was that was worth it but uh   umhum a blessing in disguise i mean you two fold purpose yeah   yeah yeah but uh yeah well you do you do your own uh lawn in terms of uh mowing   lawn yes umhum yes i have a i have a selfpropelled uh Snapper   yeah   because im sitting on a hill and it uh and its very difficult to address   oh yeah yeah i uh yeah i i i uh we just got a a old push uh uh Sears mower i its been fifteen years now since we we first moved to Texas weve had it and i keep waiting for it to die but every year it just seems to hang on and uh and uh i do it my do it myself but uh yeah well  a year a year ago i took into took it into Sears to have it tuned up for the season and they said   well thats good  theyre very expensive  uh   no its its too old we wont even work on it and and i took it back home and its cant kept plugs along but uh but my sons uh one one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have   oh booey yeah yeah they always try to give you a song and dance
