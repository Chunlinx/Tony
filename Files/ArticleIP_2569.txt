                                 The Nixon I Knew            Determined scholars andjournalists have fished through the Nixon tapes and recovered enough materialto fill books and articles showing that Nixon was obscene and unscrupulous Ido not deny that there was a Nixon like that But that was not the only Nixonor the most usual and important one Richard Nixon performed the dailydifficult duties of being president responsibly and respectably I was not aconfidant or crony of President Nixon but I saw him frequently during hiswhole tenure of office when I was a member and then chairman of his Council ofEconomic Advisers On all these occasions he impressed me as a civil seriousdedicated judicious and highly intelligent man I believe that others whoworked with him in a professional way had the same impression            I firstmet Nixon on Dec   after his first election when he was about to nameme a member of the CEA If I was a Republican at all I was not a NixonRepublican He was about to assume the most powerful office in the world I wasa littleknown economics essayist But I felt comfortable with him He did nottry either to gladhand me or to impress me with his importance He showedgenuine interest in what I had to say about the matters on which I was assumedto be well informed and he was unreserved about expressing his ownopinion            Iwas also struck by my observation of him at the firstmeeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Policy shortly after theinauguration As members of the CEA my colleague Hendrik Houthakker and I werethe lowestranking people in the room But the president wanted to hear what wehad to say He also made it clear that he did not expect his economic advisersto engage in political activity although we might make speeches on economicpolicy to groups of economists and others interested in a professional way Ithought he showed courtesy consideration and a desire to learn Later afterthe  campaign some of my Democratic friends thought that my speeches hadbeen too political If so it was because I enjoyed being in the politicalgame not because Nixon urged me on            In thenext six years I went through many meetings in which three or four peoplefromTreasury Budget Federal Reserve or the CEAwould discuss economic policywith the president He usually listened to the interchange quietly When thediscussion was over he would summarize it in a systematic waydistilling whatorder could be extracted from it and indicating what he thought were the mainconsiderations and options These scenes were lightyears remote from thelockerroom conversations with Haldeman Erlichman and others that have becomethe subject of much recent interest            The president appreciated both the value andthe limitations of economics He understood that it had something to contributeand should be heard but he also understood that economics is an uncertainscience There were no complaints or recriminations when the economic forecaststurned out to be wrong At the beginning of  the CEA had forecast thatunemployment would be down from about  percent to  percent by the end of theyear In December I had to report to him that unemployment was still about percent I said that was in the neighborhood of  percent All he replied wasthat it was a streetcar ride across the neighborhood That realistic attitudewas a great comfort to an economic adviser            I dontrecall him ever using an obscenity unless you want to count the time he saidthat he would rather have X inside the tent ping out than outside the tentping in I believe this was borrowed from LBJ and probably fromgenerations of earlier politicians I remember Nixon once saying Honesty maynot be the best policy but it is worth trying once in a while But that wasan occasion when he was arguing for honesty            In view of the grossness of some of the languageselectively extracted from the tapes I think it important to note that Nixonshowed an appreciation of and capacity for good writing and wit He hadprobably the best staff of writers of any president since the time whenAlexander Hamilton wrote speeches for George Washington The exchange with himthat I best remember came in early  when he was considering thereimposition of a wageandprice freeze that had been so popular when firstdone in August  In a smartalecky kind of way I said quoting HeraclitusYou cant step in the same river twice He immediately responded Yes youcan if its frozen            In myopinion the imposition of priceandwage controls was President Nixons oneserious economicpolicy mistake But that decision was within the range ofoptions urged upon him by respected economists mainly Democrats The controlsystem gave the administration extraordinary power over individual businessesI do not believe there was any case in which this power was improperlyused            Nixon recognized and utilized talent whateverits political connection The leading example was George Shultz He saw in thisprofessor whom he had never met before he invited him to be secretary oflabor a man of extraordinary intelligence management ability and integrityHe quickly elevated him to director of the Office of Management and Budget andthen secretary of the Treasury There must have been few administrations thathad as much talent in the two senior Cabinet positionsState and TreasuryasNixons had in Kissinger and Shultz            I do not put down these fewrecollections in order to excuse Richard Nixon I knew him and liked andrespected him I am not inclined to judge him I do not feel I have the wisdomand moral elevation to do that Anyway what would be the point He is nowbeyond ouror at least mypower to add or detract I only want to suggestthat those who feel the need and ability to judge him should try to look beyondthe Revelation of the Day
