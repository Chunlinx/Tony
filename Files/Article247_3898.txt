                                 The Spread of Goo                        Dear Eliza            The last time I had  drinks in different colors was this one evening inVegas  but thats neither here nor there Last night I reprised our run overthe bridge trying several new bars a different brand of goo and a couple ofdrinks            My clearcut taste winner among the new bars was the Grabber Energy Bar inWild Mountain Berry Grabber must have some sort of French affiliation as itslabeled Barre DEnergie and its ingredients list is bilingual Leave it tothe frogs to produce a tasty sports snackGrabber had the taste andconsistency of a thicker Fruit RollUp And its allnatural real fruitDrawback I dont quite understand why its an energy bar since it has barelyany protein or fat It does have  calories and  g of carbohydrates            I also tried the Clif Bar in Apricot flavor which basically tasted likedried apricots but mushier Not bad  calories and g of fat I liked itbetter than the crunchy Clif Bar we tried yesterday After this I went to theHardBody Energy Bar The HoneyAlmond flavor of this was yummyId actuallyeat it as a snack even if I werent exercising Not surprisingly it was a calories and a whopping g of fat The Chocolate Truffle flavor HardBody hadthe same stats but was less enjoyable Chocolate Truffle is way too rich to beeating before or during exercise            During my run I felt good and energetic and midway through I paused to trya different goo packet from the PowerGel I tried last night This one is calledGu and it was much more satisfying Texture was like a nice custard andflavor banana blitz was mild and delicious I actually felt better afterthe Gu than before This may have something to do with its potassium whichhelps maintain fluid balance and stop cramps The goo packet market isexploding right now The latest entry is Clif SHOT from the Clif Bar peopleClif SHOT has potassium as well and cuts out the maltodextrin sugar that Guloads up on but it also boasts caffeine which Im not sure I want duringexercise The great thing about the goo packets is portability Theyre a realboost out on a run and theyre easier to carry and keep better than abananayou can stick a goo packet in your sock if you need to            After the run I tried a couple of Gatorade drinks Riptide Rush wasdelicious A light grape flavornot too light to seem watered down just lightenough to be truly refreshing Gatorade has potassium too The Lemon Iceflavor I tried next was a disappointment It had that very weak lemonadetastehighly disagreeable after a workout            Well Eliza its been great fun eating goo with you Im not sure wedetermined anything conclusive but I guess we can heartily recommend thePowerbar Harvest flavor at least on grounds of taste And the goo packetconcept is a winner in my book But if this is the general future of food Illhave the lobster For quick reference heres a chart of our reactions to thebars we were both able to sample
