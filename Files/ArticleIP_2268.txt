                                 This Is Your Network on Drugs            ABC is devoting the fullrange of its resources to a monthlong March Against Drugs The network saysit will forgo  million in advertising revenue to air antidrugpublicservice announcements World News Tonight  as well as GoodMorning America  Turning Point  and   is featuringstories about the dangers of drug use On March  DDay Peter Jenningswill host a town meeting Nonnews shows including General               Hospital and Home                Improvement  have been drafted intoservice too On the March  episode of the sitcom Grace                UnderFire  Grace finds drugs in her sons room As a child of the s shefinds it hard to raise the issue with him But in the end according to an ABCpublicist Grace decides to take a hard line            ABCslittle adventure in what is known in the trade as causerelated marketing isthe most serious episode of Disneyfication since the Mouseketeers took over thenetwork in  The March Against Drugs replaces journalism andentertainment with agitprop Beyond that the willingness of a top newsorganization to suspend all skepticism is one more sign that the drug war hasreached another baroque period            The story of ABCs descent into this morass begins withfamily James Burke the head of the Partnership for a DrugFree America isthe brother of Daniel Burke who until shortly before the Disney takeover wasthe head of Capital CitiesABC Under Daniel Burkes leadership ABC tried todistinguish itself as the antidrug leader among the major networks running aplethora of partnershipproduced publicservice announcements including thefamous friedegg commercial This is your brain on drugs Capital Citiesinstituted a preemployment urinetesting program that covered the ABCnewsroom David Westin who recently replaced Roone Arledge as president of ABCNews has redoubled these efforts Last year when the partnership presentedresearch indicating a national rise in teen drug use Westin hatched the MarchAgainst Drugs idea            The firstquestion Westin should have asked himself is whether it ever makes sense for anews organization like ABC to climb into bed with an advocacy organization likethe partnership Fighting racism and protecting the environment are good causestoo But had ABC allied itself with even mainstream organizations like theNAACP or the Sierra Club alarm bells would have gone offand rightly soDespite the worthiness of these causes questions arise about the methodstactics reliability of information and sources of funding of any advocacyorganization Nonprofits often provide essential help for reporters but itsJournalism  that you treat them skepticallyas sources not as allies in acrusade            The Partnership for a DrugFree America is anonprofit group that produces superslick TV and print advertising to try tounsell drugs Until very recently the partnership was heavily supported bythe cigarette and liquor industries which want to distinguish their productsfrom illegal drugs The partnership no longer accepts smoking anddrinking money but about half its support comes from the Robert Wood JohnsonFoundation whose wealth is based on pharmaceuticals            These biases are reflectedin the March Against Drugs Drinking by teens is arguably a bigger problem thanthe use of illegal pills plants and powders According to surveys  percentof highschool seniors say they have been drunk in the last month Only percent say they use drugs But ABC isnt talking about that Most expertsagree that it is OK if your kids see you having an occasional drink says aneducational pamphlet distributed by the network in connection with the marchABC has aired no stories about the abuse of prescription drugs so far thismonth It did however run an alarmist story on Good                Morning               America about kids sniffing toxic household chemicals which it claimedkills  kids a yeara statistic that drug experts say has no basis            Whats alittle exaggeration in a good cause The air of hyperbole that surrounds theABC march is in keeping with the partnerships Madison Avenue attitude that amessage doesnt have to be accurate if it sells One famous partnership adsuggested that smoking pot produces the flatline brainwave of a comatoseperson ABC News would never knowingly be a party to the dissemination of suchcrude and dishonest propaganda during a real war as opposed to a metaphoricalone like the war on drugs But this month it seems to be dropping all itsusual standards            Richard Evans a Massachusetts lawyer who wrote a piece inTime about the difficulty of talking honestly to ones kids about drugswas flown to New York to participate in a taped roundtable dialogue forGood                Morning                America  He says his comments criticizing thepartnership were edited out of the discussion before it aired Perhaps this wasbecause of time constraints or because Evans was inarticulatethough he waspretty cogent on the phone And ABC has made some efforts in the direction ofbalance Last week World News Tonight ran a fairminded story aboutBaltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke who advocates treating drugs as a publichealthproblem rather than a lawenforcement one But if another dissenter ispresented this month it will probably be some stoned freak with a ponytailIts your choice communism or Joe McCarthy Thats not atypical of TVjournalism which thrives on the conflict of extremes But ABC used to dobetter A couple of years ago it broadcast Americas War on Drugs TheSearch for Solutions  a much praised hourlong special that questioned thetactics and methods of the drug war            There is a crudeness to theMarch Against Drugs campaign that must make Ted Koppel wince A pamphlet calledHow to Raise DrugFree Kids produced by the partnership ReadersDigest  the Department of Education and ABC for the project makes theproject of childrearing sound like growing seedless watermelons Neverexperimenting with drugs is seen as the chief goal of growing up DrugFreeKids might sound like just another dumb slogan  la Just Say No But theseslogans have consequences Zero Tolerance led to the nearexpulsion of ayearold girl who gave Midol to a friend at school DrugFree Kids isalready encouraging parents to drugtest their own childrensomething GoodMorning America thinks might not be such a bad idea            Historians are likely to lookback on ABCs March Against Drugs as a highwater mark in the antidrugirrationalism of the mids Theres a returning kidsonmilkcartons senseof hysteria to the whole crusade This would have been a good story for ABCNews if ABC hadnt been so busy being part of the problem
