even a flat announcementlike OPEN acquires a cold yet undeniable fire            Butneons cool heat alone did not make the OPEN sign the visual loudspeaker ofAmerican small business First neon had to evolve from handicraft tocommodity from carefully considered decision to impulse purchase from custommanufacture to mass production Only then could OPEN join the pay phone andpublic toilet as invisible icons that dont appear until you look for them            The signs ubiquity was a long time coming Until a decadeago a simple neon OPEN sign retailed for as much as  Thats not cheapbut its far less expensive than the first neon sign sold in the United Stateswhich blinked on in  when a Los Angeles car dealer had a Packard signmade for  by comparison the cheapest new Packard on the lot

thereare a mere several hundred            What changed the neonsign business was thebeer business In the course of a few postwar decades outfits like FallonLuminous Products and Everbrite learned how to manufacture durabletransportable neon signs for Coors Miller and the various AnheuserBuschbrands Protective plastic housings sturdier mounts lighter transformers andshockresistant shipping boxes gave the signs greater mobility Mass productioncut costs            But asidefrom beer logos and a few other popular corporate insignias neon was a toughmassmarket sell despite competitors efforts to break new markets It wasntuntil the mids that Fallon and Everbrite devised blue and red OPEN signsits a matter of dispute who made the first one but the way they soldthemdoortodoor mostlykept prices high A generic OPEN cost about what alocal shop would charge for one made to order and the market respondedaccordingly In a good year Everbrite sold only about  signs            Today Everbrite moves  OPENs a year and Fallon isjust as busy The market blossomed in the late s with the rise ofwholesale buyers clubs like Costco and SAMS Club Their customers weremainly small businesses says Tim Fallon We showed a classic size sign toSAMS They tested it and it hit Everbrite President Jeff Jacobs pitchedCostco which also saw OPEN signs fly out of the aisles Now SAMS Club sellsFallons signs for about

                  The classic OPEN sign is a inch by inchrectangle with a dozen feet of millimeter tube in the word OPEN and another feet in the border One reason the sign has achieved world domination isbecause the letters heighttowidth ratio approximates the GoldenSectiontoso beloved of artists architects and the ordinary humaneye Another is that the size fits most transoms windows and walls Stillanother The shipping box stacks easily on a standard pallet            Mavenscan discern between makers at a glance Fallon sets its OPEN in a moldedplastic case while Everbrites mounts on a
