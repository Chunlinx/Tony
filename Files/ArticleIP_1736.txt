                                 Oslo Moves to London                           GETINTERNATIONAL PAPERS BY EMAIL                                       For Tuesday and Fridaymorning delivery of this column plus Todays Papers daily PunditCentral Monday morning and Summary Judgment Wednesday morning clickhere                        Under the headline UK to host Maypeace parley the conservative Jerusalem Post splashed the news Monday that there woulddefinitely be a new round of Middle East peace talks in London next monthhosted by British prime minister Tony Blair and attended by Benjamin NetanyahuYasser Arafat and Madeleine Albright The Post attributed thisinformation to a senior diplomatic source But the prestigious Israeli dailyHaaretz wasmuch morecautious with a frontpage headline saying only that Blair makes someheadway in brokering peace gettogether While several of the main Britishnewspapers led Monday with the possibility of a London meeting none of themtook it as a done deal The conservative Daily Telegraph said in aneditorial that while Blair might have a useful role in preparing the ground fora new US diplomatic effort anything more ambitious is purepresumption            Although Blair was describedin the headline of a Jerusalem                Post editorial asa most welcome visitor to Israel the paper said the idea that the Stormontwizard can perform another miracle in the Holy Land is nice but somewhatunreal He might however be the right person to talk bluntly to Arafatabout terrorism the Post said If he were to do so and communicatethis message to the Israeli public he would justify his newlyacquiredprominence in world politics and facilitate a useful European participation inthe peace process In another editorial marking the arrival in Israel of USDefense Secretary William Cohen the Jerusalem                Post urgedPresident Clinton to follow the example of gutsy King Hussein of Jordan andmeet with Ahmed Chalabi the leader of Iraqs democratic opposition ThePost said it was difficult to fathom why the US seems slavishlyattached to a policy toward Iraq built upon containment and UNinspections that is doomed to failure when it should be supporting thisviable democratic alternative to Saddam as a strategic and moralimperative            Anopedpiece in Haaretz by Sharon Sadeh said Blair might well serve as anefficient channel for the conduct of secret talks particularly with thePalestinians and the Syrians who view Britain as a fairer and more balancedintermediary than the United States But it is unlikely Blair can restoreIsraels confidence in a British role in the peace process Shadeh saidbecause he is a prisoner of the antiIsraeli British Foreign Office Themaineditorial in Haaretz concerned an international campaign to obtainthe early release of Israels Mordechai Vanunu who was kidnapped by Mossad inItaly  years ago taken back to Israel and given an year prison sentencefor having revealed his countrys nuclear secrets The paper said Israel couldnot act permissively toward those who are entrusted with its deepest secretsand then decide to breach their commitment but it deplored the fact thatVanunu has been held in strict solitary confinement for the past  years onthe insistence of Israeli security services The impression is that thesecurity masters were not content with Vanunus punishment and sought inaddition to drive him insane the paper said            In Hong Kong the South China Morning Post ran an editorial congratulating Clintonfor his role in Chinas decision to send Tiananmen Square hero Wang Dan intoexile in the United States It described this as a victory for Clintons changeof policy a few years ago when he decided to engage in dialogue with theChinese government over human rights rather than link the issue to Most FavoredNation trading status The paper said it was now clear Beijing is moving inthe right direction It added that the human rights situation is likely to goon improving under new Prime Minister Zhu Rongji who sees it as anembarrassing legacy from a less open past which sits ill with his determinedpolicy of engaging China with the world            But in anews report the SCMP quoted several Hong Kong opposition leaders asattacking China for using Wang Dan as a pawn in SinoAmerican relations HongKong dissident Han Dongfang said exile was used by China as an effective way toeliminate internal dissent In continuing heavy coverage of the death of PolPot and its aftermath the SCMP revealed that the widow of this man whohad crushed all religions and murdered thousands of Buddhist monks and nuns hadheld a private Buddhist ceremony in front of his corpse one hour before hiscremation It also claimed that Thai soldiers who removed locks of hair fromhis head had been acting at the request of the US government            In Rome La Repubblica disclosed on its front page that Pope JohnPaul II is secretly completing a new encyclical for the third millennium Itsaid the encyclical the  th of his pontificate will set out thechurchs thinking on the future of mankind expressing fears about modernmaterialism and urging people to look into the real meaning of life The samenewspaper reported that among  people who visited the Turin Shroud in thecathedral in that north Italian city Sunday was the American tennis star AndrAgassi who arrived there from Monte Carlo in a pale blue Rolls Roycedeclaring himself to be a deep believer            Le Monde of Paris ran afrontpage feature titled Bill Clinton the Teflon President  attemptingto explain why the president remains so popular despite all the bimboeruptions It said he was benefiting not only from a national state ofeuphoria about peace and the economy but also from the fact that Americansare more European than is generally believed in their reactions to sexualmatters In another frontpage piece Le Monde reported that BrigitteBardot has joined the ranks of Serb nationalist supporters in France who denythe crimes committed by the Bosnian Serbs and portray them as victims of avast AmericanGermanVaticanIslamic coalition In an interview published in anew proSerb tract
