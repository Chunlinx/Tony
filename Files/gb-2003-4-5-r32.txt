                    Background        Recent reports describe the use of geneexpression        profiling for the identification of molecular markers of        toxicity       This technique alone does not account        for morphological changes in tissues that have        traditionally been used by pathologists to discriminate        between types and severity of toxicological responses              For a comprehensive approach to toxicological        evaluation we developed a unique methodology that uses        histomorphometric profiles derived from machine vision in        conjunction with geneexpression profiles termed        extensible morphometric relational geneexpression analysis        EMeRGE This novel method was evaluated on an        established extreme model of liver toxicity using carbon        tetrachloride CCl           in rats that were dosed for  days        and allowed to recover Liver is relevant in toxicology as        the primary organ of metabolism and detoxification it is a        recurrent target of chronic drug toxicity        A fully automated analytical microscope equipped with        machinevision hardware and software was used to generate        quantitative information about the structure and        heterogeneity of liver The histomorphometric profiles        could be used to evaluate tissue heterogeneity across the        tissue including regions of hepatocellular necrosis        Representative images of tissue sections from control and        treated tissues are shown in Figure  Examples of        processed sample image tiles are shown in Figure  where a        control liver Figure a can be compared to a treated        liver Figure b illustrating the significant structural        damage induced by treatment with CCl           Geneexpression profiles were        generated from the same livers using DNA microarrays The        microarrays measured mRNA transcription levels of genes        important in adsorption distribution metabolism and        excretion ADME Previous studies of these genes        including markers of toxic stress apoptosis growth        regulation and repair were consistent with documented        toxicologic responses to CCl           where expression of components of        cytochrome P and other metabolic enzymes CypC        CypA CypA SCS and Fmo were found to decrease        whereas certain genes involved in the inflammatory response        and signal transduction were increased CD and Lgals                   Previous studies relating gene expression to pathologic        or tissue data have evaluated qualitative tissue        information only      or focused on visually        identified tissue subareas or specific cells isolated by by        laser microdissection LMD       In LMD specific        cells from a sample are collected by interactively defining        areas of interest in a microscope image which are excised        by a laser for subsequent geneexpression analysis LMD is        subjective and destructive to the specimen and has limited        ability to account for tissue heterogeneity Progress in        digital microscopy has allowed quantitative image analysis        to generate data that objectively and completely describe        tissue phenotype free of observer disagreement            and with the potential to detect subtle changes that are        undetectable to the human eye     Tissue        histomorphometric profiles in EMeRGE are correlated        statistically with geneexpression profiles characterizing        each sample through both topdown phenotypic information        and complementary bottomup genomic data Spearmans rank        order correlation determined significant monotonic        relationships that illuminate important connections between        structural features in tissue elements and genes that have        been reported as significantly up or downregulated by CCl          treatment in previous studies            Principal component analysis PCA as described in        Materials and methods was carried out to reduce the        complexity of the data    and then to relate individual        animals to specific phenotypic groups A quadratic        regression classifier was used to develop a scheme that        defined treated and control groups in three datasets gene        expression tissue feature and the combination of both        This method required no preselection or filtering of        invariantly expressing genes to classify groups as        previously published Although the classification ability        was not improved when tissue features were added to gene        expression analysis of the combined data revealed        different outlier animals for each dataset presenting a        more complete picture of the damage and regeneration                    Results and discussion                  Correlation between tissue features and gene          expression          Relationships between gene expression and tissue          features can be a deep source of information about toxin          mechanism Using Spearmans rank order correlation see          Materials and methods we tested for monotonic          functional relationships between geneexpression values          and tissue features The numbers of significant          correlations were determined at the following levels            and  Table  These levels represent          the cutoff probability of making a type I error for          example the probability of determining that there exists          a true correlation when in reality there is none          Genes that correlated with tissue features with a           p value of  or lower were          chosen for additional inspection see Additional data          files This analysis highlighted known markers of          toxicity as well as many genes identified in previous CCl                     studies most notably that for LRF          M a known regulator of proliferation during liver          regeneration following injury as well as the genes for          vitronectin U and  glutathione           S transferase Mu isoform U                         A number of genes correlating with tissue features          were distinct from those found by a twofold ratio          analysis     Assessment of these genes revealed an          association with the known or suspected genes involved in          the biology of CCl            toxicity Correlations with three          structural metrics were chosen for examination providing          a substantial number of genes  clear space area           vacuoles and vacuolesmm  The tissue metrics  clear          space and area  vacuoles were negatively correlated with          at least one isoform of cytochrome P AU          BX and BM this may be a hallmark of          recovery One gene common to clearspacerelated metrics          nonstained tissue including vacuoles and hydrophic          degeneration was tubulin V Tubulin levels do          not change during the acute phase of CCl            poisoning but have been shown to          decrease in association with the development of fatty          liver tissue as a result of chronic CCl            exposure      In the present          study tubulin was positively correlated with the three          components of clear space perhaps indicating cellular          reorganization Also strongly correlated with all three          clearspace metrics was           S adenosylmethionine synthetase          X AdoMet synthetase A suppression of AdoMet          synthetase activity has been observed in a model of          acetaminophen toxicity     The negative correlation          of AdoMet synthetase mRNA observed in the present study          suggests that CCl            toxicity suppresses message as well          as AdoMet synthetase was most significantly correlated          with  clear space          Expression of distintegrin metalloprotease Z          was positively correlated with the two vacuolerelated          metrics This is an ADAMhomolog known to be a tumor          necrosis factor TNF convertase     TNF          produced by Kupffer cells in the liver stimulates          production of TNF a mitogen for hepatocytes helping to          generate new cells needed to rebuild damaged areas of the          liver     Kupffer cells have a significant role as          mediators of acute inflammation after CCl            treatment however they also          produce factors that can cause secondary injury in the          liver through fibrogenic responses An increase in a TNF          convertase would ensure that any residual cytokine          present would be in the active stimulatory form TNF and          its receptor along with interleukin IL and its          receptor were both upregulated in the present study but          neither was correlated with a tissue metric below the                     p value threshold          Different spectra of cytokines are associated with          toxicity or inflammation compared to tissue repair In          the present study genes encoding many different          cytokines were affected however not all were          significantly correlated with the tissue metrics examined          in this analysis A striking exception was the family of          vascular endothelial growth factors VEGF The role of          VEGF in the recovery of necrotic liver following CCl            treatment has been well established               Here several VEGF isoforms were found to          correlate with clearspacerelated metrics Isoforms B          and D AF and AF were positively correlated          with  clear space itself whereas isoform C AF          was negatively correlated with both area  vacuoles and          vacuolesmm  VEGF Ch was reported to be involved in          cancer metastasis and tumorcell invasion               whereas isoforms B and D are believed to have roles in          proliferation and tissue remodeling                 highlighting the diverse roles of these cytokines VEGF          mRNA peaks at  hours after CCl            treatment in Kupffer cells whereas          it peaks at  days in hepatocytes well after necrosis          has resolved and when vascular and sinusoidal endothelial          cells are reappearing in the tissue               Correlation of VEGF isoforms with specific tissue metrics          suggests they have different roles in the regeneration          and revascularization of severely damaged areas of the          treated livers          Both the heatstable enterotoxin receptor M and          contrapsinlike protease inhibitor CPi D          correlated with  clear space and area  vacuoles The          enterotoxin receptor which is a marker for regeneration          in both partial hepatectomy and CCl            toxicity     was positively          correlated with these tissue metrics whereas CP was          negatively correlated SPI has been shown to be a          downstream target of both the inflammatory acutephase          regulators TNF and IL     Positive correlation          with an intermediate conductance calciumactivated          potassium channel SMIK AF was common to the          metrics related to vacuole density area  vacuoles and          vacuolesmm  CCl            treatment perturbs the balance of          many serum electrolytes     and an increase in the          SMIK channel might help reestablish normal potassium          homeostasis as the liver recovers from the toxic          stress          Correlations between genes and tissue metrics may          reveal interesting differences similar to          histomorphometric findings For example the vacuolar          metrics area  vacuoles and vacuolesmm  have genes          uniquely correlated with each demonstrating a potential          genetic basis for the difference between the number and          size of vacuoles and their density or packing Vacuole          density was linked to the expression of wee tyrosine          kinase D and a nuclear corepressor AF as          well as IL and  AJ and AF all          involved in cellcycle regulation and signaling In          contrast area  vacuoles was linked to expression of          interferon regulatory factor  IRF M IRF has          been reported to be upregulated by TNF during sepsis              The correlation between this cytokine and area           vacuoles but not with vacuolesmm shows the dynamic          balance between the primary response to injury and tissue          proliferation and repair This illustrates how genes          associated with each metric could help define molecular          factors behind complex cellular mechanisms          In this study the toxic injury visible on day  was          subsequently reversed by days  and  with decreasing          impairment indicated by the levels of expression of          metabolic genes By day  there was a decrease in           clear space in livers from treated animals whereas the          other metrics  area  vacuoles and vacuolesmm           remained consistent over time data not shown These          findings hint at the important role of genes correlated          with  clear space in the balance between toxicity          repair and proliferation occurring in treated livers                          PCA and classification          PCA was used to reduce the complexity in the gene          tissue and combined profiles of each rat liver From          these analyses we determined the principal component          that identified the daytreated animals The second          principal component of the geneexpression data separated          the daytreated animals from all others including the          remaining CCl            treated days  and  Figure a          The first principal component separates the two groups          for the tissueonly data Figure b and both the first          and second principal components track the differences          between the two groups in the combined datasets Figure          c          Using the first two principal components we          classified the animals in treated day versus control          and other groups using a quadratic regression classifier          for all three datasets A crossvalidation estimate of          the probability of successful classification of the          animals was used to determine the diagnostic strength of          each type of dataset Each step of the crossvalidation          calculated the appropriate principal components for all          but one animal to determine the parameters of the          quadratic regression classifier and then the remaining          animal was classified This was repeated so that every          observed animal was left out and classified The          resulting schema can identify which animals were          correctly classified or misclassified With this method          we were able to estimate the accuracy of developing a          welldefined classification method In practice the          discrimination rule would be created on a training set of          data and applied to an unknown set therefore a high          crossvalidation probability of successful classification          for developing a welldefined discrimination rule is          important          This analysis was carried out on gene expression and          tissue features separately and on the combined dataset          Using geneexpression data only the correct          classification probability was  Using the          tissuefeature data correct classification was           Finally using the combined data accuracy for correct          classification was  The strong correlations          between tissue features and genes allowed for the          prediction of the tissue metrics from the gene dataset          but not the genes from the tissuefeature data note that          this is due to the fact that it is easier to predict           tissue metrics from  genes than vice versa          Therefore inclusion of tissue data in the combined set          did not necessarily improve the classification using just          the geneexpression data Comparing the misclassified          animals from both sets however revealed differences for          genes compared to tissue features These differences can          be used for diagnostic purposes by comparing the          classification of outlier animals and to examine more          closely the underlying components in both the molecular          and phenotypic response to a toxin          The introduction of robust machinevision techniques          that can consistently discern the histomorphology of          tissues in a comprehensive fashion will support          pathologic assessments allowing a more quantitative          evaluation of phenotypic responses to compounds          Investigations can be carried out in an automated          unsupervised fashion necessary for highthroughput          analyses The EMeRGE method demonstrated correlations          between specific genes and tissue structures that can          augment interpretation of biological observations and          diagnosis These correlations illustrate a new paradigm          that phenotypically anchors changes in gene expression to          structural features in tissue Improved outlier detection          may be attained with a combination of geneexpression and          tissue phenotypic data The improved objectivity and          reproducibility of phenotypic assessments correlated with          geneexpression data is a step forward in tissue analysis          that will impact on the definition of therapeutic margins          and help refine dose levels as well as improve          identification of atypical responses Other covariants          such as clinical chemistry parameters can be added to          this analysis for an even deeper view     Combined          analyses such as EMeRGE can be applied to any          experimental or pathologic conditions where gene          expression and tissue histology are integral to the          interpretation of toxic or pharmacologic events as well          as to the pathophysiology of disease                            Materials and methods                  Experimental protocol          Six groups of five male age and weightmatched          SpragueDawley rats were separated into three groups of          vehicle controls and three groups of CCl            treated animals Each rat was dosed          once daily on days   and  by intraperitoneal          injections of either pure cornoil vehicle or CCl            dissolved in corn oil approximately           vv at a dose of  mgkgday     Animals          were euthanized by CO            asphyxiation and exsanguination          following a  h fast on either day   or  and          tissues were harvested for analysis The central lobe of          each liver was harvested at necropsy and approximately           g was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen RNA was extracted          using TRIzol reagent according to the protocol from          GibcoBRL The remaining liver fraction was fixed in           formalin                          Sample preparation hybridization and          scanning          Total RNA was quantified and assessed for quality on a          Bioanalyzer RNA chip Agilent Palo Alto CA Each chip          contains a set of interconnected gelfilled channels that          enables molecular sieving of nucleic acids          Pinelectrodes in the chip create electrokinetic forces          that drive molecules through these microchannels and          carry out electrophoretic separations Ribosomal RNA          peaks are measured by fluorescence signal and displayed          in an electropherogram A successful total RNA sample          featured two distinct ribosomal peaks S and S rRNA          Firststrand cDNA was prepared labeled and processed as          described in the Motorola CodeLink system protocols          Processed arrays were scanned using an GenePix Scanner          Axon Instruments Foster City CA array images were          acquired using the Motorola CodeLink Analysis Software          Amersham Biosciences Piscataway NJ                          ADME rat bioarray system and data          preparation          The Motorola CodeLink ADME Rat Bioarray consists of           oligonucleotide probes corresponding to           unique clusters and  control probes selected from          GenBank Rodent and RefSeq build number  Each           basepair bp probe is was spotted in triplicate All          samples were hybridized to two microarrays resulting in          six data points per probe          The Motorola CodeLink Analysis Software gives an          integrated optical density IOD value for every spot a          unique background value for that spot is subtracted          resulting in raw data points                          Histomorphometric profiling          The remaining portion of the central lobe was fixed in          formalin embedded in paraffin sectioned  m and          stained with hematoxylin and eosin HE An          automated analytical microscope system ARTIS          TissueInformatics was used to scan the entire slide at a          low resolution to identify tissue locations The smallest          possible rectangular region fully encompassing each          tissue section was captured at a high resolution at           mpixel on a tilebytile basis generating           individual digital image tiles per slide Each individual          image tile was automatically focused captured          digitized corrected for shading and analyzed          The methodology was developed for image segmentation          and trained for object classification using a          representative set of images from controls and treated          rat liver specimen from various studies before the          system was applied the specimen of this study As a          precursor to any segmentation operation the input bit          RGB images of HEprepared tissue were converted          using a stain space conversion based on PCA This          technique effectively allowed each pixel in the image to          be mapped to its respective stainabsorption value to          give an invariant representation of the histologic          properties of the image Once the stain value at each          pixel was determined a generalized grouping was used to          account for regional features such as nuclei which bind          the stain Similar highlevel segmentation accounted for          other object types within the tissue  namely clear          space vacuoles sinusoids and cytoplasmic material           that generally tend to absorb or not absorb one type of          stain          Hepatic cells comprise approximately  of the volume          of the liver and  of the cell count They vary in          shape and texture both in nuclei and cytoplasm from one          liver zone to another Conditions such as hyperplasia and          hypertrophy and other metabolic conditions may affect the          appearance of nuclei and the surrounding cytoplasm as a          result of tissue injury          Definition of the invariant characteristics of hepatic          nuclei made a robust segmentation possible and included          the following features Hepatic nuclei have a darkblue          appearance as a result of the absorption of hematoxylin          They may contain nucleoli or chromatin figures internal          to the nuclei This will be exhibited as a conic boundary          with a clear internal structure highlighted by dark          annotations They are generally round or polyhedral in          shape They will have a general size boundary correlated          to the image capture magnification variance will exist          between each layer of the liver They are highlighted          from the background tissue by the differential stain          properties of hematoxylin offsetting nuclear material          from the surrounding cytoplasm          For classification a probability model was used where          each pixel expressing hematoxylin stain contains a vector          of attributes that denotes the probability of the pixel          belonging to a nucleus object Candidate objects can be          readily found by locating local maxima in the          hematoxylinstained image expressed as a ratio of          hematoxylin and eosin with a spatial filter applied to          reduce noise The vector is composed of elements such as          stainvalue deviation size shape and texture          measurements of internally visible chromatin andor          nucleoli Proper values for these vectors were learned by          a simple neural network model and used to classify          objects into appropriate categories for example hepatic          nucleus or nonhepatic nucleus At times representative          elements of this vector were misleading because of          artifacts in histology preparation and sectioning These          errors were resolved by applying prefiltering to each          vector element before comparison with the neural network          For example nuclei with a halfmoon silhouette caused          by the sectioning process will be misleading In this          case fitting a polygon to the boundary and extracting          hullproperties for the classification can make a solid          differentiation          Once the nonhepatic nuclei objects were separated          from the surrounding tissue they were differentiated          further by applying spatial characteristics derived from          the architecture of the liver Both size and eccentricity          acted as a differentiator as well as encapsulation by or          nearness to sinusoids clear space These rules were          fairly invariant and had proved robust in validation          protocols graded by pathologists on how well a feature          was discriminated The cellular architecture of the liver          allowed for robust training data to be automatically          characterized by the system Objects were assigned          rankings of their probability of belonging to a given          class plotted against spatial relationships allowing for          quick identification and correction of errors for          example an object classified as a Kupffer nucleus other          nucleus should not exist outside of a certain proximity          to a sinusoid          Other elements in the liver could be derived with          similar morphometric comparisons utilizing simple          patternrecognition classifiers for optimal performance          Micro and macrovesicular change were detected by          thresholding the resultant clearspace image derived by          calculating tissue pixels that do not contain stain in          the saturation plane and locating round objects          Similarly performance was improved by localizing red          blood cells identified by strong eosin stain band          expression to oblong white objects as they are          typically found in intrasinusoidal space          All nuclei were then masked out of the original tissue          mask and clearspace areas were identified by performing          an automatic threshold in the intensity band of the          masked image Binary clear space areas were classified as          vacuoles or as general white space objects based on          circularity and size A texture measure was developed          based on a gradientfiltered image as an indicator of          fine spatial changes in the cytoplasm     The          cytoplasm of control livers had a smooth and uniform          appearance compared to that of treated animals which          exhibits more roughness mainly caused by vacuoles          After training the system was applied to the specimen          of this study and all analytical steps were executed          fully automatically and without further user interaction          The derived tissue metrics included hepatocyte and other          nuclei sinusoids vacuoles including conglomerates of          microvesicular change counts of each feature per mm            area of each feature respective to the total tissue area          of each section total  clear space nonstained          cellular and tissue elements and  hematoxylin stained          objects nuclei and a texture feature A reference set          of  images was selected for validation Two images from          two animals from all groups control and treated were          randomly selected The system used in this study was          validated for the detection of basic tissue elements          including hepatocyte nuclei other nuclei vacuoles and          sinusoids Two pathologists independently inspected the          classified objects indicated by colored overlays on the          digital images Typically there are about           hepatocyte nuclei  nonhepatocyte nuclei           vacuoles and  sinusoids in any one image          Falsepositive hits and missed falsenegative          identifications of nuclei were counted Results for          hepatocytes nuclei were less than  false negative and          less than  false positive for other nuclei less than           false negative and less than  false positive The          percentage of correctly detected vacuoles including          conglomerates of microvesicular change and sinusoids were          determined by an estimation of correct identification          The result for vacuoles and conglomerates of          microvesicular change were in the range of less than           false negative and less than  false positive Smaller          vacuoles could not be correctly identified because of          resolution limits but the heterogeneity in the cytoplasm          could be detected by the texture analysis Estimate for          sinusoids was in the range of less than  false negative          and less than  false positive          The fieldspecific features clear space          hematoxylinstained areas and texture have no direct          quantifiable visual correlation this also applies to          geometric and density features that are derived from the          basic tissue elements and therefore cannot be validated          by human observation                          Statistical data analysis          The raw microarray data consisting of six readouts          per gene were prepared for analysis by removing outliers          and undergoing normalization Generally outliers result          in expression values that are much larger than expected          To minimize the effects of the outliers an outlier          detection filter was applied to the data First the          median of each set of six data points was calculated          then the absolute value of the difference between each          data point and the median of the set to which it belonged          was calculated The median absolute deviation was then          determined A modified zscore for each original          geneexpression value was derived as the absolute          difference between the original data point and the median          of the set to which it belonged multiplied by  and          divided by the median absolute difference for the set              Then if the largest geneexpression value in a          given set of six values had a modified zscore larger          than  it was labeled an outlier and removed from the          raw dataset Only  of all raw data points were          determined to be outliers using this method After          outlier removal the resulting datasets were normalized          with respect to the median value of all raw data points          on a given microarray to adjust for arraytoarray          variability The medians of the remaining geneexpression          values for each probe on the microarray were then          calculated and used for further analysis This data          preparation resulted in one geneexpression value per          gene per animal and is referred to as the normalized          dataset          Spearmans rank order correlation is a rankbased          adjustment to Pearsons correlation which checks for          strength of a linear relationship between two variables              Spearmans rank order correlation ranks the data          in each variable and then calculates Pearsons          correlation with the paired ranked data hence checking          for the strength of a monotone relationship           p values are based on permutation          methods          PCA is a statistical technique to reduce the          dimensionality of a dataset while retaining as much of          the variability as possible     Each principal          component captures as much variability as possible with a          linear combination of the data and is uncorrelated with          all other principal components The resulting data points          represent a projection of the dataset PCA was conducted          on all three datasets and hence there were three          different input variables With the geneexpressiononly          dataset we used the normalized gene expression data           genes for all rats With the tissueonly dataset          we used the data from all  tissue metrics for all rats          Finally for the combined dataset for each rat we          combined the tissue metrics  metrics and normalized          geneexpression data  expression values to give a          total of  measurements and conducted PCA on the          resulting dataset          The quadratic regression classifier    is given          by                    y                                                          e                                                           e                                                           e                                                           e                                                           e                                    e                                               where           e            and           e            are the first and second principal          components respectively and            is assumed to be independently          and identically normally distributed with mean  and          variance             Also note that            and            are the arithmetic means of all of          the first and second principal components The model was          estimated using the usual leastsquares assumptions          where the dependent variable           y  was an indicator variable for          CCl            toxicity          The crossvalidation probability is estimated by first          calculating the first two principal components of the          normalized data except for one rat Using the two          principal components and the CCl            toxicity classification the          quadratic regression classifier was fit to estimate the          coefficients                       through                        Then the same eigenvectors or          projection estimated in the PCA were applied to the          leftout observation to estimate the first two principal          components note that this sidesteps any potential          prediction bias The principal components are then          plugged into the estimated quadratic regression          classifier If the resulting prediction           y  was above  then the sample          was classified as suffering from CCl            toxicity if the value was below           then it was classified as not suffering from CCl            toxicity To estimate the accuracy          of the classification this was repeated so that every          rat was left out and then predicted          PCA
