                you ready okay what have you seen lately   yeah well uh its funny when i tried to make the call the other days i thought i hadnt seen anything since Dances With Wolves but today i went to see Regarding With Henry   oh im dying to see that   it was really good we uh Jeff Warner just got out of the hospital and uh Jeff and Deanna went and   oh uhhuh   another friend in the neighborhood and uh we all liked it we had uh both moms and uh fifteen year olds and a twelve year old and everyone enjoyed it and uh   oh my goodness oh well i am just dying to see it i went to dinner with some friends last weekend and they said get a babysitter and well all go see Regarding Henry and i said ooh i want to see it so bad   yeah well my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer on choir tour and visiting friends and one thing and another a lot of the ones i had wanted to see and so since he had this friend up from Houston uh   oh   and his friend had already seen so many and i thought they decided on this and i thought well i want to see this one too so  we uh i finally its my first summer movie   yeah oh my well let me see was it well we went to see One Hundred And One Dalmatians last weekend and that may be no right before i went in the hospital my girlfriend said come on were going to the movies and we wont well she goes all the time but i go maybe once every couple of months   yeah   and when i go i go see two at a time so we went to see Soapdish   oh was that good   and oh hysterical we laughed so hard it was just you couldnt hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing so hard   uh well i want to see that and City Slickers both i love comedies but thats what i was   thats the other one that we went to that night   oh was it   and my face hurt so bad from laughing because i love Billy Crystal and course growing up on on the back of a horse you know and being on ranches and stuff     oh   so much of that was so true and i was absolutely rolling in the aisles it was so funny both of them were great   oh well good im im glad to hear that because they   oh they are are we just laughed so hard and like i said with City Slick i mean with Soapdish it is so cornball and it is so overacted that youre just hysterical you know just they just carried it off to the tee it was   uhhuh well i dont i dont know if you got to see Weekend um At Bernies that was out a couple of years ago they had a free showing at the Berkeley um United Artist   no how neat   and i dont know who was here or whether Jay just called a friend and we didnt think wed have much chance of getting in but we thought wed try it you know free movie   shoot yeah   it was so funny and it sounds like uh what you were just describing Soapdish too i mean we just we hurt by the time we came out and the whole theater was hysterical and its just its just goofy i mean its   oh yeah   uh if you have a chance to rent it at least or it should be out on TV i would think   yeah i think it is i think it is   um because its its just a fun summer light comedy make your cheeks hurt laughing especially in the theater it was contagious you know i i imagine the way Soapdish was but with everyone laughing   yeah oh gosh i never laughed and people were just screaming and applauding and you know it was just hysterical   well im glad you did that before your surgery   oh me too because i dont even know if i could live through it now i mean im getting around real good and im just still real sore and today i was i course i went back to work two weeks after   yeah yeah oh gosh   uh but see i dont have permanent work i right now im working with a temporary agency and so the second week i was out of the hospital i went up and worked half day on the computers because you can learn all the software for free   oh   and so i went up to do WordPerfect because that seems like thats what everybody wants and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed and then they called me to see if i wanted to work a day and i said yeah and i went and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that   yeah   and uh i worked about three days a week ever since two to three days a week and so i went to my doctors last Thursday and this was my fourth week checkup and he said well gosh youre just healing really well i just cant get over this he says in two weeks you can go back to doing your crazy normal things if you want to play ball you can go play ball he says now im not going to say youre going to feel like playing ball but you can if you want to and uh you know he was teasing me and   yeah   he says yeah youll be out there waterskiing i can just see it now       and uh he says so you just take it easy for two more weeks youve only got two more weeks i said okay fine i i will i will whatever you call easy ill do it you know but and ive been out trying to find a job because this is just not cutting it   yeah yeah   and so i dont im real glad that we didnt go see those funny ones when i was when im still sort of on the sore side   yeah   but well what whats your next have you seen Robin Hood yet   no that was one uh Jay got to see  with a friend and so i i and to try and uh   uh   try and find time its hard uh with Jims schedule too just to get a time that we can both go and   oh yeah   um im holding out for City Slickers for the two of us because uh we had friends that went to see that and said you know its just perfect for our age group  and because i think he he needs a comedy too um   uhhuh   uh and thats what he would have liked to have seen Regarding Henry too but knew that uh weve weve got a lot of company this summer which is wonderful were really enjoying it but some of the different things were doing uh   uhhuh   theres just not a time enough time to do it all and he said well realistically  you know he knew he couldnt get them all in but uh Jay really liked Robin Hood um   yeah   when the choir group went to see Backdraft and they thought that was uh it was funny cause he sounded like the critics he said you know the plot line and the characters uh you know arent real big but the the fire scenes and the drafts you know that action part is fantastic   uhhuh   but he thought Robin Hood was great it was real different then youd expect but he but he enjoyed it and so   oh really well i went course i am a Kevin Costner fan supreme   yeah me too and yeah i really uh like him a lot which is why Dances With Wolves was the last movie we had seen for several months but it was i uh   uhhuh gosh was that wonderful   in fact uh a friend from Germany was visiting in March and we wanted we didnt ran out of time we wanted to take him to see it we were going to sit through it again because we really wanted him to see it too   oh yeah   uh i just thought that was terrific and i really enjoy Harrison Ford which is one of the reasons i wanted to see   i do too i think hes really good   and hes very good in Regarding Henry thats not an easy part to play i i dont think   i wouldnt think well my kids are going to their dads tomorrow night so i sort of think i may go do that   yeah thats at that one wont your sides  um it was this the first time you got to see One Hundred and One Dalmatians   good i have my parents took me when i was probably somewhere between Ashley and Jamies age and we went to the   uhhuh
