                                  How Big a Safety Net            Why do we have a social safety net It depends onwhom you ask Some say its a matter of political prudence eg Thealternative to a safety net is a revolution Others say its a moralimperative       Among the latter the most influential is Harvard University professorof philosophy John Rawls Rawls likens the safety net to an insurance payoutHeres his argument Back before you were bornin fact before you were evenconceivednobody knew you were going to develop into the sort of sophisticatedindividual who reads                   Slate                For all anyone knew you might havebeen born without enough skills to boot up a computeror to earn a decentliving            If your unborn soulcould have bought an insurance contract then youd probably have snapped upsome kind of skill insurance in which everybody pays premiums and those wholand in the shallow end of the gene pool split the pot       Of course you didnt buy insurance But thats only becausethere are no telephones in the worldbeforebirth so the insurance salesmencouldnt contact you According to Rawls and his followers you would havebought the insurance if you could have and that creates a moral obligationupon all to pay the premiums       Thats a very powerful argument but its incomplete Heres why Itoffers no estimate of how much insurance your unborn self would havewanted Rawls says we should enforce a bunch of hypothetical insurancecontracts but you cant enforce a contract if you dont know what it says Soto convert the Rawlsian argument into a concrete policy you first have todetermine what terms wed have written into those prebirth agreements            Heres how the philosophers solve that problemThey guess Most of them guess that our unborn selves would all have cheerfullysigned on for a pretty substantial welfare state Being an economist and not aphilosopher I am inclined to think about such questions a little moredeeply       How much insurance would an unborn soul want to buy We already know alot about the demand for insurance from available data on how much of it firelife disability auto etc people in the real world buy       Some people demand more insurance than others do because they face morerisk So before we can estimate how much skill insurance your prebirth selfmight have purchased we must first estimate how much risk you were facing whenGod was handing out the brains            The right way to measure risk is to measure thestatistical variance of the possible outcomes In this case that meansmeasuring the statistical variance of human talents You cant measure talentdirectly but you can measure it indirectlysay by observing people withsimilar education and training and measuring the variance in their earningsAfter youve controlled for education and training earnings are at least arough measure of talent       Once youve measured that variance youve measured the risk so you cango back to the insurance markets and observe how much insurance people chooseto buy when theyre facing similar risk levels That gives at least a roughestimate of how much we should all be paying into the general welfare pool            Economists James Kahn of the New York FederalReserve Bank and Hugo Hopenhayn of the University of Rochester recentlysacrificed a lunch hour and the back of an envelope to computing that roughestimate The bottom line turns out to be astounding If you take the insurancemetaphor seriously then  percent of the populationthe  percent with thefewest skillsshould be permanently unemployed and on welfare In other wordsthe presentday welfare state is not nearly as large as it ought to be So ifthe Rawlsian philosophers had bothered to do a little arithmetic they mighthave discovered that their arguments are a lot stronger than they dared toexpect       But Kahn and Hopenhayns arithmetic leaves something out Theyimplicitly assumed that it would be costless to identify the people with thefewest skills so that we can put only those people on the dole That assumptionbecomes invalid if highly skilled people can hide their abilities in an attemptto defraud the system Policing such fraud can make social insurance policiesconsiderably more expensive and when insurance is more expensive people wantless of it Factor that into the equation redo the calculations andyou end up concluding that the fraction of the population on welfare should bejust  percentin other words practically zero            The truth probably lies somewhere in between percent and  percent We cant costlessly observe each others skills butwe cant costlessly hide our own skills either In other words maybe thesocial net should be drastically expanded and maybe it should be drasticallyslashed Not too definitive a conclusion But its the result of just oneafternoons work and its more precise than anything the philosophers havecome up with in the quarter century since Rawls first made his argument       Personally Im not sold on the insurance metaphor to begin with forreasons that could fill a separate column But the broader point is that ifyour argument is based on metaphors you should be prepared to treat thosemetaphors with respect If the safety net is really just like insurance thenwe should be buying it in quantities commensurate with our other insurancepurchases And we should be making an honest effort to calculate what thosequantities are The philosophers dont seem willing to meet thatresponsibility Thats why we need economists
