                            The World Health Organization estimates that about  of all deaths in children younger        than five years old are due to acute lower respiratory tract infections LRTIs with         of these deaths due to pneumonia But despite LRTIs being among the most frequent diseases        in the first years of life the viral causes of these illnesses are not always clear        Several viruses are known to be involved eg respiratory syncytial virus RSV        influenza viruses parainfluenza viruses and human metapneumovirus but none of these        pathogens is detected in a substantial number of cases        In a new article published in         PLoS Medicine  Lia van der Hoek and colleagues investigate the        association of acute LRTIs with human coronavirus HCoVNL a virus they recently        described They suggest that HCoVNL a new member of the Coronaviridae family is one of        the most frequently detected viruses in children less than three years old with LRTIs and        that this virus is strongly associated with croup        The team analyzed samples from the PRIDE study a prospective populationbased study of        LRTIs in children younger than three years old in Germany They assessed by PCR  samples        of nasopharyngeal secretions from children with LRTIs        In all  samples  were positive for HCoVNL RNA Viral RNA was more prevalent        in samples from outpatients  than hospitalized patients  and coinfection with        either RSV or parainfluenza virus  was observed frequently With an overall occurrence of         HCoVNL was the third most frequently detected pathogen in this patient group RSV        was the highest found in  of samples The researchers focused on HCoVNL in cases        of respiratory disease where no other viral pathogen could be detected in order to identify        clinical symptoms associated with HCoVNL infection Samples in which only HCoVNL RNA        could be detected had a significantly higher viral load than samples containing additional        respiratory viruses A strong association with croup was apparent  of the        HCoVNLpositive patients with high HCoVNL load and absence of coinfection had croup        compared with  in the HCoVNLnegative group Indeed a significantly higher fraction         of samples from croup patients than noncroup patients  contained HCoVNL        RNA        This study strengthens the evidence for the role of HCoVNL in croup Previous studies        have shown croup to occur mostly in boys with peak occurrence in the second year of life        and predominantly in the late autumn or early winter season And HCoVNL infection seems        to follow these trends said the authors        However the authors warned that the high percentage of HCoVNLpositive samples could        be due to a strong viral activity in the study year and longterm studies are needed to        determine whether HCoVNL infections occur in cycles peaking every two to three years as        observed for other respiratory viruses But they noted that HCoVNL has spread worldwide        with the virus found in Australia Canada Japan Belgium and the US Thus health        authorities should add HCoVNL to the list of pathogens that can cause numerous LRTIs in        young children
