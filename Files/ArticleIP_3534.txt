gentlemanshould never wipe up anything he accidentally spills in a ladys lap Thissuggests to me that our president IS a perfect gentleman but should this pointof etiquette always be followed in cases of possibly impeachableoffenses                                       Thoughtfully                                       Susan Easton                        DearThought            Prudie believes theTiffany Manners people would be pleased to update their book to keep upwith developments  however  Prudie suspects that impeachable offenseswould be applicable to so few teens that the lap etiquette will remainunchanged            You werenice to call the president a perfect gentleman Prudie is betting thats theonly compliment hes received on his manners since oh January

inBoston                        Dear M            You are too kind aboutPrudies persuasive abilities Perhaps you will be cheered to know that mostpeople dont seek advice before they enter an affair only after In Monicascase though it is tempting to think What if Prudie thinks What if thepresident werent so keen on pizza            In anycase something Prudie doesnt want to think about is the powder roomscene you fantasize It would no doubt make the roller derby look demure            Prudie modestly                                             Dear

insisting this whole Clinton mess is a sex thing It isnta sex thing Its a lying thing and we need to take it seriously A leaderneeds credibility and people need to be able to trust his judgment
