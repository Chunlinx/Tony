                                 Empty Jocks            Sundayafternoon  of historys greatest basketball players headlined a MadisonSquare Garden fundraiser for Bill Bradley Bradleys former New York Knicksteammates Dick Barnett Dave DeBusschere Walt Frazier Jerry Lucas EarlMonroe and Willis Reed sang Bradleys praises as did Kareem AbdulJabbar BobCousy Julius Erving John Havlicek Moses Malone Oscar Robertson BillRussell and Bill Walton The event complete with cheerleaders movie starsand lights and music reminiscent of an NBA game enthralled the press BradleyThrows Garden Party Scores whooped the Washington Post             Bradley has pitched himself as a man of substance in a world corrupted byglitz As Russell put it at the gala In these days of spin control BillBradley is one of the most honest people Ive ever met So its worth askingwhether the jocks media blitz for Bradley punctuated by their fullcourtpress on Sundays political talk shows conveyed anything of substance Thequestion posed by NBCs Tim RussertWhy do former opponents and teammatessupport Bill Bradley for presidentraises a prior question Why should wecare            On thetalk shows the players testified that Bradley is intelligentknowledgeable wellrounded compassionate concerned wonderful agreat leader a great listener and a good person They applauded hishonesty integrity respect and quiet strength They recalled that heplayed very hard played by the rules and was always interested in theneeds of people They asserted that he loves his country and seeks the goodof as many people as possible            Theseplatitudes are probably true But why did they dominate the three majornetworks Sunday morning What light do they shed on Bradleys presidentialcompetence or agenda On Meet the Press  DeBusschere argued that theexathletes know Bradley as a man and that voters should listen to whatcelebrities have to say about a man that they all respect and have known verywell That explanation however turns out not to be true of many of Bradleysjocks On Face the Nation  Erving conceded that he had never playedagainst Bradley and knew little about him until this year Cousy told the samestory My wife and I jumped on board the minute the senator called  I didnthave a personal relationship            Thejocks who knew Bradley as an athlete failed to name anything he hadaccomplished in politics Nevertheless they praised his political careerHes had good leadership qualities as a senator said Lucas DeBusschereagreed Hes a leader He was when he first came into the political scene He was going to study and learn  and I think hes done that Russell addedHes had some experience in national politics And then he got away for awhile  which is sometimes very helpful Again how do the assertions offormer basketball players clarify this question Unable to produce evidencethey extrapolated from sports to politics Bradley believed in passing andgetting other people involved in the game Reed argued on This Week Thats what Bills about and what hed do in his politics getting everybodyinvolved in the game            Thejocks were plainly ignorant of the issues Old jocks dont know a lot aboutthe Balkans and the Middle East solutions or campaignfinance reform and allconfessed Cousy On Face the Nation  Bob Schieffer told Erving WellDr J since youre the doctor here I guess I ought to ask you about healthcare The question sounded like a joke but it wasnt and Erving answered itIm a proponent of Bills position he replied citing Bills health careplan which I got a chance to read last night            Bradleys campaign has been long on sentiment and short on solutions Theathletes testimonials did nothing to remedy that deficit DeBusschere praisedhim for caring and going out and saying things and doing things about racerelations Reed called for racial enlightenment and predicted Bill will tryto make that happen Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson observed Skincolor is an immediate reaction to people and this is something that we have toovercome This is something Bill sees Cousy boasted that Bradley makes humanrights a cornerstone really in terms of his priorities  All those problemsstem obviously from mans inhumanity to man  So Im happy to see Billfocusing on you know just getting people to get along together on a domesticand a worldwide level            Cousyargued that Bradleys jock advocates should be taken seriously because theyreconcerned about issues and unencumbered by the baggage of immorality thatdisqualifies many celebrity athletes Bradley has been very selective in termsof the celebrities that he has asked to jump on board said Cousy If wereall pretty good guys and weve lived our lives properly then hey why dontyou listen to us in this case and vote for Bill Bradley No doubt Cousy haslived his life properly So have my neighbors And they dont get on Meetthe Press             Stripped of their rationalizations Bradleys jocks fall back on the argumentthat their opinions are important simply because theyre celebrities Look atAmerica and what America is all about Robertson argued Basketball isAmericas game  People come to games to see these stars play Stars have suchinfluence on Americans today And its just apropos for me to be here to saythat Bill Bradleys a person who can generalize all these people together OnLate Edition  Bradley said of his basketball pals Why wouldnt youreach out to your friends  Id be stupid if I didnt do that            If thejocks dont know why Bradley should be president why are they endorsing himBecause they think their association with him helps their image as well as hisNot too many jocks are Rhodes Scholars observed Cousy arguing that Bradleypersonifies the virtues of team sports Thirty years ago everybody was adumb jock who played sports sniffed DeBusschere Bill I think has proven that a basketball player baseball player football player are very intelligentpeople and that type of stigma attached to you is not worthy            Butare the jocks serving Bradley well At best theyre helping him exploit thesuperficial elitist politics he claims to be campaigning against Thats whathappened on Meet the Press  where Russert after hosting Bradleys jocksfor much of the show explained the absence of a Gore representative byreporting We asked the Al Gore campaign to provide celebrities who wouldsupport him They declined            At worst the jocks arehurting Bradley by failing to comprehend and refute misrepresentations of hisagenda Thats what happened on Face the Nation  where Gore campaignmanager Donna Brazile accused Bradley of endangering AfricanAmericans and allother minorities and Hispanics by trying to eliminate Medicaid What Bradleyneeded was a policy expert who could block Braziles cheap shot Instead thetask of defending Bradley fell to Erving who shrugged that its probably adebatable issue but knowing Sen Bradley he is you know the type ofindividual who has always been fair With that response Erving negated hislayup for Bradley by yielding a threepointer to Brazile Thats the problemwith basketball stars They can score but they cant play D
