                                 Giving Your All            CARE is a noble organizationthat fights starvation It would like your support The American Cancer Societyis a noble organization that fights disease It would like your support tooHeres my advice If youre feeling very charitable give generouslybut dontgive to both of them            Giving to either agency is achoice attached to a clear moral judgment When you give  to CARE youassert that CARE is worthier than the cancer society Having made thatjudgment you are morally bound to apply it to your next  donationGiving  to the cancer society tomorrow means admitting that you were wrongto give  to CARE today            You might protest that youdiversify because you dont know enough to make a firm judgment about whereyour money will do the most good But that argument wont fly Yourcontribution to CARE says that in your best though possibly flawed judgmentand in view of the admittedly incomplete information at your disposal CAREis worthier than the cancer society If thats your best judgment when youshell out your first  it should be your best judgment when you shell outyour second             When itcomes to managing your personal portfolio economists will tell you todiversify When it comes to handling the rest of your life we give you exactlythe same advice Its a bad idea to spend all your leisure time playinggolf youll probably be happier if you occasionally watch movies or go sailingor talk to your children            So why is charity different Heres the reason Aninvestment in Microsoft can make a serious dent in the problem of adding somehightech stocks to your portfolio now its time to move on to otherinvestment goals Two hours on the golf course makes a serious dent in theproblem of getting some exercise maybe its time to see what else in life isworthy of attention But no matter how much you give to CARE you willnever make a serious dent in the problem of starving children Theproblem is just too big behind every starving child is another equallydeserving child            That isnot to say that charity is futile If you save one starving child you havedone a wonderful thing regardless of how many starving children remain It isprecisely because charity is so effective that we should think seriouslyabout where to target it and then stay focused once the target is chosen            People constantly ignore my good advice bycontributing to the American Heart Association the American Cancer SocietyCARE and public radio all in the same yearas if they were thinking OK Ithink Ive pretty much wrapped up the problem of heart disease now lets seewhat I can do about cancer But such delusions of grandeur cant be verycommon So there has to be some other reason why people diversify theirgiving            I think Iknow what that reason is You give to charity because you care about therecipients or you give to charity because it makes you feel good to give Ifyou care about the recipients youll pick the worthiest and bulletconcentrate your efforts But if you care about your own sense ofsatisfaction youll enjoy pointing to  different charities and saying Igave to all those            Heres a thought experiment for charitable diversifiersSuppose you plan to give  to CARE today and  to the American CancerSociety tomorrow Suppose I mention that I plan to give  to CARE todaymyself Do you say Oh then I can skip my CARE contribution and go directlyon to the American Cancer Society I bet not            But if my contribution to CARE does not stop you from making CARE your first prioritythen why should your  contribution to CARE today stop you frommaking CARE your first priority tomorrow Apparently you believe that your is somehow more effective or more important than my  Thats either adelusion of grandeur or an elevation of your own desire for satisfaction abovethe recipients need for food            We have been told onreasonably high authority that true charity vaunteth not itself it is notpuffed up You can puff yourself up with thankyou notes from a dozenorganizations or you can be truly charitable by concentrating your effortswhere you believe they will do the most good            Early in this century the eminent economist AlfredMarshall offered this advice to his colleagues When confronted with aneconomic problem first translate into mathematics then solve the problemthen translate back into English and burn the mathematics I am a devotee ofMarshalls and frequently follow his advice But in this instance I want toexperiment with a slight deviation Rather than burn the mathematics I willmake it available as a link            I propose to establish thefollowing proposition If your charitable contributions are small relative tothe size of the charities and if you care only about the recipients asopposed to caring say about how many accolades you receive then you willbullet all your contributions on a single charity Thats basically amathematical proposition which I have translated into English in this columnIf you want to see exactly what was gained or lost in translation and if youremember enough of your freshman calculus to read the original then
