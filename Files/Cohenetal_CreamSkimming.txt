Postal Rate CommissionOctober Published in Emerging Competition in Postal and DeliverySystems edited by MA Crew andPR Kleindorfer Boston Kluwer Academic Publishers An Analysis of the Potential for Cream Skimming in the USResidential Delivery MarketA IntroductionPostal administrations often claim that without a legalmonopoly to protect them from cream skimming they would not beable to continue providing universal service at uniform andaffordable prices Because they serve delivery points with a rangeof profitability postal administrations fear that without monopolyprotection cream skimmers would capture their high profit routesleaving them with their less profitable routes The question iswould cream skimming divert so much volume that universal serviceat affordable prices becomes infeasibleSweden is the only industrial nation which actually has hadcompetition in its letter mail market after abolishing itsmonopoly A competitor City Mail has served selected portions ofthe country but was twice forced into bankruptcy City Mail hasagain emerged from bankruptcy and is competing with Sweden PostPerhaps on City Mails third attempt we will finally have a validtest of whether Sweden Post actually needs monopoly protection inorder to provide universal service at reasonable prices As far asthe authors know the economics of the competition between SwedenPost and its competitor has not been studied If City Mail finallysucceeds in avoiding bankruptcy such a study might determine thereasons why Sweden Post was vulnerable to cream skimming Inaddition it might describe the impact that a viable competitor hashad onIn the US as in most industrial nations the postal monopolyextends only to letter mail including addressed advertisingFinland has abolished its monopoly and in so doing created alicensing system for competitors to Finland Post No other operatorhas yet begun to offer service in competition with Finland PostNew Zealand has also just recently abolished its monopoly but itis too early to know if competitors will emerge and besuccessfulA recent study found that the Swedish Postal Service had engagedin a variety of anticompetitive practices with respect to itscompetitor See Deregulation of the Postal Services Marketreport on the abuse by the Postal Office of Its dominant marketposition and on the Competition Authoritys handling of thequestion of competition in relation to the Post Office ProfessorErik Nerep Stockholm School of Economics February the dominant provider It should be noted that the presence ofCity Mail has already prompted Sweden Post to lower prices forlarge volume mailers in areas served by its competitorCream skimmers take advantage of an incumbents price when it isbased on an average of heterogeneous costs They serve the low costportion of the market and price below the incumbent Conceptuallycream skimming has two basic dimensions  product and geographyProduct cream skimming is where a competitor tries to capture themost profitable portion of the market for a product withheterogeneous costs Geographic cream skimming is where acompetitor tries to provide a service only to selected low costareas City Mail is an example of geographic cream skimming Itscarriers provide twice weekly delivery to various areas in Swedenfor large volume customers This paper addresses only geographiccream skimming Postal monopolies like most other legal monopolies are thoughtby many observers  to be technically inefficient and  tohave delivery functions which exhibit economies of scale Thispaper addresses several questions which arise from these two pointsunder the assumption that the monopoly and any other barriers toentry were to be removed It asks how much more efficient would apotential competitor have to be to overcome the scale economies ofthe US Postal Service Assuming potential competitors are able toachieve the necessary level of efficiency it then asks how muchvolume might they be able to capture and in which markets Finallyit asks what effectIt would be interesting to learn How much it cost Sweden Postto serve the areas where it lowered prices relative to its averagecost how important the abandonment of universal pricing is toSweden Posts competitive position and are the circumstances inSweden applicable to the US Section J of this paper examinesthis issue furtherCream skimming may have a third dimension having to do withtransactions costs In practice cream skimmers may restrictthemselves to large volume customers since the transaction costs ofdealing with smaller volume customers and individuals may beprohibitiveSweden Post delivers five days per weekA report by the General Accounting Office GAO at leastpartially analyzed the effect product cream skimming would have onthe US Postal Service Its assessment was as follows PriorityMail First Class over  ounces  high risk of loss ofsignificant volumes but a low financial impact if it did occurFirst Class  low risk of loss of significant volumes but a highfinancial impact if it did occur Advertising Mail low risk ofloss and a medium financial impact if it did occur See PostalService Reform Issues Relevant to Changing Restrictions on PrivateLetter Delivery General Accounting Office September In the US legal monopolies include the local delivery ofelectricity gas water and until recently telephonewould the loss of volume to cream skimmers have on the resultingprices the Postal Service would have to charge in order to maintainuniversal serviceMany observers believe that cream skimmers in the United Stateswould serve cities and leave rural areas to the universal serviceprovider because they assume that the cost of delivery to ruralareas is much higher than the cost of delivery to cities Anearlier study challenged that assumption It estimated that in city delivery cost per piece was only  percent lower thanrural delivery but that city delivery cost per delivery point wasactually  percent higher than rural delivery cost It concludedthat there was no cross subsidy of rural delivery by city deliveryIn theory cream skimming of residential service could occur ineither city or rural areas This paper focuses on city deliverybecause of the more detailed data available on this type ofdeliveryWe first provide a brief description of the current competitionin delivery We then describe the data used in our analysis and thecosts and profitability of the Postal Services city residentialdelivery routes We next examine the volume vulnerable to captureby potential cream skimmers We describe characteristics of routesmost likely to be profitable to competitors and provide a range ofestimates for the cost of cream skimmers After examining theconsequences of successful cream skimming on Postal Service rateswe explain why cream skimming is not likely to be successful onbusiness routes in the US Finally we provide some observationson the relevance this analysis may have for other countriesB Current Competition In DeliveryCompetitors of the US Postal Service may legally deliver onlyperiodicals catalogues over  pages parcels and unaddressedletters Alternative delivery is particularly difficult becauseof the so called mail box law which prohibits any one but the See Cohen Ferguson  Xenakis Rural Delivery and theUniversal Service Obligation A Quantitative InvestigationRegulation and the Nature of Postal Delivery Services Ed Crew Kleindorfer Kluwer Academic Publishers Technically the US monopoly is primarily a revenue monopolyA third party may deliver a letter if proper postage is affixed andcanceled The monopoly also has an urgent mail exception forletters which are charged twice normal FirstClass postage with aminimum of  Unlike most industrial nations there is noexemption from the monopoly based on weight or pricePostal Service from accessing a private mail box The USPostal Service broadly interprets letter to include any addressedinformation recorded on a physical object Thus for example itconsiders an addressed grocery store advertisement to be aletterIn  Publishers Express was founded by Time Inc MeredithCorp American Express Publishing New York Times Co TimesMirror Co and R R Donnelley among others to providealternative delivery In spite of its prestigious sponsorshipthe company ceased operations in  Many other smallentrepreneurs provide alternative delivery but they have a verysmall share of the market They are scattered around the countryand mostly deliver unaddressed saturation advertisements andsmall quantities of periodicals and small parcelsThe real alternative delivery system in the United States is thenewspaper industry which delivers advertising preprints orinserts The Postal Service has the advantage of being able todeliver these advertisements to all addresses while newspapersusually but not always deliver inserts just to their subscribersA typical newspaper in the US has less than  percent coveragein its service area This puts it at a disadvantage vis a vis thePostal Service which delivers to all households Newspapers onthe other hand have the advantage of charging lower pricesBecause marginal costs are very low a newspaper price forpreprints might be as low as  or  cents per piece The lowestrate currently charged by the Postal Service is  to  centsfor saturation mail weighing up to  ounces and drop shipped atthe delivery office Newspapers deliver about  billion insertsannually while the US Postal Service delivers at least billion competing itemsAs far as we know the US is the only country that has a mailbox ruleFor a more comprehensive discussion of alternative delivery inthe United States see the General Accounting Office Study n supraNewspapers also deliver product samplesThe Postal Service has an additional disadvantage because citycarriers deliver only addressed advertising mail This requires themailer to have an address list kept in delivery sequence and tohave address labels for each pieceNewspaper Association of Americas WEB SitewwwnaaorgmarketscopedatabankpreppriyrhtmThis was the saturation and piece walk sequence EnhancedCarrier Route mail volume in  Many of these items are socalled marriage mail pieces which contain several individualadvertisements combined into a single piece These individualadvertisements could each be a standalone insert Thus  billionpieces is an extreme lower bound on the number of preprints carriedby the Postal ServiceC City Carrier DataEach year the Postal Service conducts a City Carrier SurveyCCS of delivered mail volume by route Between  and  thePostal Service conducted the survey using a relatively small panelof about  routes Prior to that the Postal Service randomlysampled a much larger cross section of its routes over the courseof a year The last set of cross sectional data filed with thePostal Rate Commission in  consisted of a sample of different routes Because of the large sample size these dataare far more useful for our analysis than the subsequent paneldataEach record in the  CCS contains the date of theobservation the Digit ZIP Code in which the route is locatedthe route type the number of pieces by subclass and by shapeper stop the number of possible deliveries and actual deliveriesper stop and the stop type single delivery residentialmultidelivery residential and businessandmixed Generallydata are recorded for every tenth stop on a route The authors wereable to make use of the records for  routes This analysisis based on the data set of  usable residential routes and stops  About  percent of all city routes areresidential routes The rest are business or mixed residential andbusinessD Postal Service Delivery Cost And ProfitabilityThis analysis uses delivery data from  but uses  costlevels for wages fringe benefits and other associated deliverycosts Total volume grew  percentA panel survey collects data repeatedly from the samesampleThere were  thousand city delivery routes in FY  Therewere also  thousand rural routes most of which had costscomparable to city delivery routes See Cohen Ferguson Xenakis n  supraThe  CCS data were not available when the analysis for thispaper was conductedBusiness foot business motorized residential foot residentialpark and loop residential curb mixed foot mixed park and loopand mixed curbThe data are organized by the  pay periods in a year Portionsof the data from a few pay periods were not usable Comparisonswith previously published summaries indicate that the missing datadid not bias our resultsTo a much lesser extent this analysis makes use of data from business routesNinetyfour percent  of these stops are residential whilesix percent  are either business or mixedbusinessandresidential stops Not all stops on a residentialroute are residences Some are business stops and some are mixedbusiness and residentialbetween  and  and the number of routes increased percent We make no attempt to adjust for these increasesWhen calculating city delivery cost we include the entirefixed and volume variable inoffice and outofoffice cost forall city routes plus the cost of overtime supervision space andvehicles Starting with a productive hourly rate of  for citycarriers we calculate a cost per residential delivery route of per delivery day The cost we calculate can be considered tobe the avoided cost or the incremental cost of the city deliveryfunction Alternatively it can be considered a lower bound on thestandalone cost of city deliveryWe calculate the daily profit of residential delivery routes forthe Postal Service by totaling the revenue minus collectionprocessing and transportation costs of the mail delivered on eachroute and subtracting the delivery cost of Table  displays a variety of mean route statistics forresidential routes separated into quartiles based on their profitless As can be seen the mean daily profit of each quartile rangesfrom positive  to negative  The average profit for allresidential routes is  with  percent of the routes operatingat a loss The route cost per piece ranges from  cents to cents and averages  cents Route volume ranges from pieces to  pieces and averages  pieces The number ofpossible deliveries which ranges from  to  is dependent onroute terrain  All the statistics presented are monotonicacross quartiles except for route type This is because of theclose relationship between cost per piece delivery and stopvolumeInoffice refers to the in the office activity of a lettercarrier primarily sequencing mail to be deliveredoutofoffice refers to the activity of the carrier while on thestreetThis is based on the city delivery carrier total cost of per hour This in turn is based on a productive hourly rate payovertime pay and benefits for hours worked increased to accountfor other costs that can be associated with carriers These othercosts include systemwide labor related costs eg workerscompensation civil service retirement unfunded liabilityindirect labor such as carrier supervision vehicle costs andspace related costs rents fuel utilities custodialmaintenance The standard work day for a city carrier is eighthoursIt is a lower bound because the cost includes no marketing oradministrative costs which a standalone firm would normallyincurBy physical terrain we mean the physical proximity of thedelivery points and whether they are most advantageously served bya curb park  loop or foot routeA monotonic series is one whose every term is greater than lessthan or equal to the previous term per piece delivery and stop and the number of deliveriesstops on a route With respect to route type we see that thepercentage of curb routes is greatest in the most profitablequartile These routes are largely a suburban phenomenon theyreach more stops in a day and hence have more volume The appendixTable A presents demographic characteristics related to thequartiles in Table Table SELECTED AVERAGES FOR RESIDENTIAL ROUTES WHEN ROUTES ARE SORTEDBY PROFIT PER ROUTEProfit Cost cents Per possible Volume Pieces Per possibleQuartile dollars Piece Delivery Stop pieces Deliverya StopaIn the paper referenced in n  supra pieces per possibledelivery were weighed by stop and produced a slightly higher piecesper delivery Here they are unweightedThe revenue for  percent of the routes all of quartile and most of quartile  is not enough to cover the costs of themail delivered on those routes Thus it might be argued that amonopoly is necessary to ensure service to those households Forseveral reasons it would seem the burden of proof for thisposition should fall on its proponents The routes which areunprofitable are dispersed across the country in a great number ofcities A competitive postal service that refused to servehouseholds on unprofitableCurb routes deliver directly from the vehicle to a curbside mailreceptacle Park and loop routes involve parking covering an areaby foot then parking the vehicle in a new arearoutes would impose large transaction costs on its customers toseparate mail and to secure suppliers to deliver its remainingmail Such firms would be at a considerable disadvantage to thoseproviding universal service Larger transaction networks be theymail packages overnight or telephone are more valuable tocustomers and providers than smaller networks It is for soundbusiness reasons that Federal Express and United Parcel Serviceprovide universal delivery service A major business asset of theUS Postal Service and all other national posts is that theyprovide service to every address in the countries they serve Thusthere is a business incentive for any postal provider who is notsimply a cream skimmer to offer universal service within theterritories it servesRoutes which are unprofitable when serviced six days per weekwould become profitable when serviced less frequently In acompetitive environment the Postal Service could easily retainuniversal service but perhaps not a universal service standardDelivery less than six days per week would certainly be preferableto abandoning delivery altogether Of course if the Postal Servicewere to simply abandon delivery to unprofitable routes it wouldnot have to refuse return or destroy mail destined to theseroutes Delivery firms with lower costs than the Postal Servicewould emerge to serve them and the Postal Service could hand offits unprofitable mail to them  Under any foreseeablecircumstances universal delivery would not ceaseE Volume Available For Cream SkimmersIt is unlikely that cream skimmers would base their selection ofareas to serve on the Postal Services delivery profits PostalService delivery profitability depends on the revenue for all maildelivered and it is not likely that cream skimmers could captureall categories of mailIt is interesting to note that United Parcel Service recentlybegan delivery less frequently than daily to certain residentialareasCosts would be lower by dint of lower wages andor less frequentdeliveryThe concept of a universal service obligation may really meanmore frequent delivery than economically warranted for householdsliving on unprofitable routes This of course is in addition toproviding retail services to rural communitiesResidential cream skimmers would serve bulk mailers withsufficient volumes of mail for the areas they serve We assume thatonly mail that is presorted to the carrier route level would bevulnerable to cream skimming If a bulk mailer did not havesufficient volume to sort to the carrier route level thetransaction costs for both mailer and cream skimmer would beprohibitive Of course third parties might become intermediariesbetween these bulk mailers and cream skimmers Such parties wouldhave to engage in processing and transportation They would ineffect be a parallel postal system for bulk mailers An analysis ofseparate postal systems for bulk mailers is beyond the scope ofthis paperThe US Postal Service requires FirstClass and advertisingmail to have at least ten pieces for a carrier to qualify for acarrier route discount Publications may qualify with as few as sixpieces for a carrier route The amounts being presorted to thecarrier route level in  are shown in the right hand columnFirstClass Mail is unzoned and receives no discount for beingdeposited near its destination Most FirstClass carrier routevolume is prepared by utilities and may be local depending on thebilling operations of the utility For purposes of this analysis weassume that all FirstClass carrier route mail is available tolocal cream skimmersPublications Mail While only  billion pieces of the carrierroute volume is entered locally or entered close enough to itsdestination to be available to cream skimmers we assume that all billion pieces are available to cream skimmersAdvertising Mail Eightfive  percent or  billion piecesof carrier route advertising mail are drop shipped or enteredlocally Notwithstanding we assume here that all carrier routeadvertising mail would be available to cream skimmersTo summarize  billion pieces of carrier route volume arepotentially available to cream skimmers This represents percent of the total volume of  billion pieces in Geographic cream skimmers would concentrate on areas with the mostcarrier route volume because their cost per piece would be lowestand their potential profit would be the greatestTable  displays mean daily route statistics for routes whendivided into quartiles reflecting their volumes of carrier routemail We see a wide divergence in carrier route volume among thequartiles The range is from  pieces to  pieces with anaverage of  The first quartile routes have more than twice thevolume of carrier route mail as the second quartile In fact thefirst quartile has more than half of all carrier route volumedelivered on residential routes Thus the first quartile of routesare much more attractive targets for cream skimmers than the otherroutes We again see a monotonic behavior of the other variablesacross quartiles Route profitability by quartile in Table changes by a sizable amount as compared to route profitability inTable  Less than half the routes in quartile  Table  are alsoin quartile  Table  The appendix Table A presentsdemographic characteristics related to the quartiles in TableSome of this mail is delivered by rural carriers For purpose ofthis analysis we assume that rural delivery is subject to the samedegree of cream skimming as city delivery However some carrierroute mail is delivered on business routes and some is deliveredvia post office boxes and thus would not be available to creamskimmers Consequently  billion represents an upper bound ofthe volume available to cream skimmersThe only deviation from the monotonic behavior in Table  occursfor deliveries per route between quartiles  and Table SELECTED AVERAGES FOR RESIDENTIAL ROUTES WHEN ROUTES ARE SORTEDBY VOLUME OF CARRIER ROUTE MAIL PER ROUTEProfit Cost cents Per possible Quartile dollars PieceDelivery StopVolume pieces All Carrier Pieces Per possible Mail RouteDelivery StopF Estimating The Delivery Cost For Cream SkimmersCream skimmers undercut prices charged by an incumbent that hasheterogeneous costs but averaged prices Cream skimmers profit byselling low cost items at below the incumbents average priceDelivery cream skimmers would attempt to serve those areas wherethe cost to deliver carrier route pieces is the lowest ie wherethe volume of carrier route pieces is the highest The firstquartile of routes in Table  would make the best targets It isthis case we examineIn an important sense this is an unrealistic case sincequartile  represents  routes which are scattered over morethan half the  Digit ZIP Code areas in the US It isextremely unlikely that they constitute all the residential routesin any Digit ZIP Code nor is it likely that they make up theentire suburban ring around cities It is unrealistic for creamskimmers to serve such a fragmented market From both anoperational and marketing standpoint cream skimmers would have toserve markets with at best a large proportion of routes in quartile Their markets would undoubtedly contain a large number of routesin the other quartiles Notwithstanding for analytical purposeswe assume the best possible case for cream skimmers that theywould be able to serve only routes that fall within quartile A potential competitor must decide the level of service toprovide and this decision would affect the amount of volume that itcould actually capture Many magazines newspapers andadvertisements must be delivered within a one two or three daywindow A competitor delivering only one day a week would have toforego much potential volume On the other hand delivery six daysa week would certainly raise the cost per delivered piece and makeit less likely that a cream skimmer would be viable City Mail inSweden chose to deliver two days per week MondayThursday in someareas and TuesdayFriday in other areasIn all probability a cream skimmer could not prosper unless itcould deliver mail at a price less than the incumbent postaladministration Its cost per delivered piece would be a function ofits cost of labor and productivity It would be expected that acream skimmer would have a significant labor cost advantage Itsproductivity would be influenced by the inoffice and outofofficetechnology it employed In  Postal Service carriers spent morethan  percent of their time inoffice preparing for delivery onthe street Many mailstreams must be merged and sorted intodelivery sequence It is not clear what technology cream skimmerswould use Moreover we do not know whether the personnel of acream skimmer would be more productive on the street thanUS Postal Service carriers This analysis will combine thesevariables labor cost technology inoffice and outofofficeproductivity into a single efficiency parameterIn a sense each piece of advertising mail competes with otheradvertising mail for the recipients attention If a cream skimmercould capture a large portion of the available carrier routevolume its customers might prefer more frequent delivery tominimize this type of competitionThis function is rapidly being automated for letter size mail inthe US Delivery point barcoded mail is increasingly beingsequenced on sorting machines saving significant inofficedelivery time From  to  the percentage of inoffice timefor city carriers has declined from  percent to  percent It isexpected that this trend will continue Unless a potential creamskimmer had enough capital to employ sequencing automation thePostal Service might have a significant advantage in sequencing andmerging lettershaped mail First Class is almost all lettershaped publications are almost all flat shaped and carrier routeadvertising is  percent letter shapedG Cream Skimmers Cost Per PieceTable  has four matrices each reflecting a differentpercentage of available volume assumed to be captured by creamskimmers Each matrix presents cream skimmer unit or per piececosts based on frequency of delivery and relative efficiency of thecream skimmer We measure relative efficiency in terms of creamskimmers cost relative to the Postal Services costThe shaded cell in the top matrix  cents is the PostalService cost per piece for delivering only carrier route presortedmail in the least expensive quartile This number is derived fromthe  cent cost of the Postal Service delivering all mail in theleast expensive quartile shown in Table  If only the carrierroute mail is delivered the average delivered volume decreasesfrom  to  in this quartile The variable costs drop asthe volume drops but the fixed costs are spread over less volumewhich increases the fixed costs proportionately The result is anincrease in the unit costs to cents shown in Table  Going down that column the costsper piece are displayed assuming a cream skimmer had the same costas the US Postal Service but delivers fewer days per week Thecosts decrease by the amount of fixed costs in delivery Thevariable cost remains the same because the volume does not changeMost other national postal administrations would have a greaterpercentage of fixed costs because they have fewer pieces perpossible deliveryThe columns display cream skimmers costs as a function of USPostal Service efficiency expressed as a percentage of the PostalServices delivery cost per piece The  percent column displaysthe cream skimmers per piece cost if its cost were  percent ofthe US Postal Service The  percent column displays the creamskimmers per piece cost if its cost were  percent of the USPostal ServiceTable CREAM SKIMMERS COST PER PIECE IN CENTS AS A FUNCTION OFEFFICIENCY RELATIVE TO POSTAL SERVICE DAYS OF DELIVERY AND PERCENTOF CARRIER ROUTE MAIL OF CARRIER ROUTE VOLUME CAPTURED OF CARRIER ROUTE VOLUME CAPTURED OF CARRIER ROUTE VOLUME CAPTURED OF CARRIER ROUTE VOLUME CAPTUREDFor all mail the Postal Service city carrier cost fixed andvariable is  cents per piece See Tables  and  cost perpiece all routes This is the cost for the delivery function Eachpostal product has a variable cost for mail processingtransportation and delivery Each product also has an averageincremental avoidable cost In the case of advertising carrierroute mail the average incremental cost is about  cents Ifthreatened by cream skimmers the Postal Service could respond bylowering its price towards average incremental costs If the PostalService maintained uniform prices but had competition only inselected areas it would sacrifice revenue in those areas withoutcompetition These circumstances would probably call for selectivediscounts with average incremental costs as a floor to largevolume mailers who would otherwise become customers of creamskimmers Thus cream skimmers would most likely have to have costsno higher than approximately  cents per piece in order to competeon a cost basis aloneThe Postal Services productive hourly wage of more than  maymake it likely that cream skimmers could obtain some cost advantageon that basis alone We do not know how reducing the frequency ofdelivery would affect demand for alternative delivery A twodayfrequency could satisfy a threeday window but would miss manydelivery dates for time value publications It should also be notedthat some customers may not be willing to leave the Postal Servicefor a variety of reasons including the sense of security of dealingwith a government agencyIf a cream skimmer were to capture only  percent of theavailable market it would have difficulty succeeding At thatlevel of market penetration its costs would have to be  percentof the Postal Services at a twoday frequency in order to be belowPostal Service incremental costs With  percent of the averagevolume at a twoday frequency a cream skimmers costs would haveto be  percent or less of the Postal Services in order to remainbelow the Services average incremental costsThe variable cost of carrier route advertising mail comespredominantly from the delivery function inoffice andoutofoffice The delivery function is about  percent variableThus the variable cost of the advertising carrier route mailproduct can be much lower than the average fixed and variablecost of delivery The average incremental cost of advertisingcarrier route mail is only slightly higher than the variable costsince we estimate it here to consist of variable costs plus singlesubclass stop costs for Except for a customer with a very high elasticity of demandthere is no reason for a monopoly to grant volume based discountssince customers have no alternative supplier We understand thiswas the case with UPS which had a virtual monopoly in surfaceparcel delivery in the US and did not give discounts to surfaceparcel customers until Roadway Package Service began to target itsmost lucrative customers in the s UPS then began offeringdiscounts to certain large volume customersSome mailers currently use cream skimmers because of serviceconsiderationsH Consequences Of Successful Cream SkimmingTable  shows the required increase in the US Postal Servicerates based on the percentage of carrier route volume that would becaptured by cream skimmers targeting mail in quartile  Table The maximum effect is an increase of about  cents in theFirstClass rate with corresponding increases in the otherclasses This would be an increase of nearly  percent asignificant but limited effectLifting the letter mail monopoly and allowing cream skimmingwould likely have an important impact on rate setting for thePostal Services large volume carrier route customers if ourassumptions are correct concerning the amount of volume availablefor capture by cream skimmers The maximum impact on overall postalrates is however likely to be limited The negative impact onPostal Services finances would likely be offset to a great extentby the effect of limited competition on the Postal Servicesefficiency service performance and product innovationTable  IMPACT OF CREAM SKIMMING ONI Comparison Of Business And Residential RoutesWe do not analyze cream skimming on business routes because only percent of mail volume delivered on them is carrier route ascompared to  percent on residential routes This makes themunlikely candidates for cream skimming based on our analysis Wecompare several statistics for city residential and business routesin Table Table  COSTS BY TYPE OF CITY DELIVERY ROUTEIt can be seen that business routes have slightly more piecesper route with slightly higher cost per piece The cost perdelivery point and stop on business routes is much higher but theprofit per piece remains higherWe are not aware of any study that has identified the reasonswhy business routes have a higher cost per piece and much highercost per stop than residential routes Several factors maycontribute including the high cost of serving each individualbusiness in office buildings In contrast residential apartmenthouses generally have mail boxes in one central and convenientlocation for carriers Other factors include the larger proportionof business mail requiring signatures and the greater difficulty ofgetting around in congested business areas as opposed toresidential and suburban neighborhoods Because business routeshave much higher cost per delivery point theyBusiness routes get much more assistance from routers whosequence the mail in the office thus saving inoffice time for thecarrier The cost per piece and per delivery point reflects theseextra costsProfit is higher on business routes than on residential routesbecause of greater volumes of high profit mail such as on Priorityand Express Cream skimming delivery networks might be developedfor such mail in business areas but are beyond the scope of thispaperare unlikely candidates for geographic cream skimmers who couldbe expected to have far fewer pieces over which to spread the costper delivery pointJ Some Differences Between the US and Other CountriesThe classification structures in industrial countries havevarying degrees of efficiency defined as adherence to costEfficient classification discourages cream skimmers because itleaves less cream to skim The less efficient the classificationstructure the more the administration needs monopoly protectionThe US Postal Services classification structure contains severalscore of cost based discounts and rate differentials probably morethan any other administration This should tend to make the USless vulnerable to cream skimming Moreover the US has morepieces per capita than virtually any other country Because thedelivery function has important economies of scale ceterisparibus the US should have lower per piece costs than virtuallyevery other country This factor also makes the US lessvulnerable to cream skimming In addition the proportion of fixedcost in the delivery network is largely a function of volume percapita per delivery The larger the volume per capita the largerthe proportion of variable costs and the smaller the proportion offixed costs Since virtually every other postal administration hasless volume per capita than the US a larger proportion of theirdelivery costs are fixed relative to the US A cream skimmer canreduce its fixed cost relative to an incumbent simply by reducingthe number of days of delivery Thus a cream skimmer would obtainless cost advantage by cutting delivery frequency in the US thanin countries with less per capita volume This also tends to makethe US less vulnerable to cream skimming than othercountriesOf course messenger services are common in central businessdistricts but this is for reasons of service and not costThe most efficient classification structure would be based oncosts alone and would offer worksharing discounts whereverpractical These discounts would equal the cost savings No postaladministration meets this standard nor do the authors recommendthat they doAdvertising mail alone has over  different rate categorieswith rate differentials based on shape and discounts forpresorting barcoding and drop shippingA consequence of this is that an administration which deliversfive days per week ceteris paribus is a more difficult target forcream skimmers than one which delivers six days per weekOn the other hand some factors appear to make the US PostalService more vulnerable than other postal administrations to creamskimming Few if any countries have as large a proportion ofcarrier route volume as does the US This is the mail mostsusceptible to diversion In addition few postal administrationspay their employees as large a wage premium as does the US PostalService A wage premium allows cream skimmers to obtain anefficiencycost advantage simply by paying the prevailing wage See Cohen Chu Ferguson  Xenakis A Cross SectionalComparison and Analysis of
