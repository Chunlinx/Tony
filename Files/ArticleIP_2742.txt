                                 This Is Not Quite Your Life            Why would he do somethinglike that asked James Warethe real James Ware whose yearold brotherwas shot while riding on the handlebars of his siblings bicycle during theBirmingham civilrights strife of  A federal judge also named James Warehad to give up a promotion to the appellate bench the other day when it turnedout that the dramatic story hed been telling for years about his martyredbrother actually happened to someone else Why on earth would he tell such anobvious whopper            You maybe thinking that asking why public figures lie is like asking why fish swimBut this is not conventional rsum padding Nor is it a standardcoveryourass prevarication we are not involved in the Bay of Pigsinvasionbombing Cambodiatrading arms for Iranian hostages Nor is it thefoolish bravado of a philandering Gary Hart put a tail on me  youll bevery bored Or the of a Chuck Robb my wife is the only woman Ive lovedslept with or had coital relations with or a Bill Clinton Gennifer Flowersis a woman I never slept with            No were talking about the selfdefining kind of lie asJudge Ware himself described it the biographical embellishment for publicconsumption This kind of lie is remarkably common even though it is alsooften remarkably easy to expose Sen Joseph McCarthy for example fabricatedan entire heroic World War II history for himself as Tail Gunner Joe ButMcCarthy lied without compunction about nearly everything The more interestingcases are those involving people who generally tell the truth            Waresexplanation is that he was confused His actual sister he says was shotaround the same time as the bicycle incident His feeling of loss andpossible kinship to the murdered youth led him to merge the two happenings inhis mind he says Doesnt seem likely More plausible is that Ware wasentrapped by his own rhetorical success Hed been enthralling audiences withthis tale for years You tell a good story The crowd loves it Word of yourmarvelously moving speech gets around You are invited to give more speechesHow could you explain the sudden disappearance of your signature anecdote Idecided it wasnt so selfdefining after all            Many a politician has been enticed intoselfenrichment by an appreciative audience or the anticipation of one In hisstandard stump speech of the  presidential campaign Sen Joe Biden startedoff by quoting British Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock on the hard life of hisuneducated coaldigging forebears Pretty soon though Kinnock had droppedout of the speech and it was Biden himself whose ancestors worked in the coalmines  and would come up after  hours and play football for four hoursBiden grew up in a whitecollar suburb his father was a car salesman onegrandfather was a state senator and the only Biden on record as having workednear a mine was a mining engineer            Al Goregalvanized the  Democratic convention with his moving account of holdinghis sister in his arms while she died of lung canceran experience that hesaid caused him to pour my heart and soul into the cause of protecting ourchildren from the dangers of smoking But Gore continued to seek the supportof the tobacco industry Throughout most of my life I raised tobacco hetold an audience of tobacco farmers in his  bid for the Democraticnomination some years after his sisters death Ive hoed it Ive chopped it put it in the barn and sold it            As Jonathan Rauch reported in Slate a fewmonths ago the published memoirs of former Labor Secretary Robert Reich arefull of selfaggrandizing fictions Reich is constantly the lone honest tribuneof the people in rooms full of unattractive fat cats and grandees makingimprobable and unflattering remarks            Over theyears Jesse Jackson has got a lot of mileage out of remembering the blood ofMartin Luther King Jr that smeared his shirt when he cradled the dying leaderin his arms Testimony from other witnesses indicates that Jackson wasinitially reluctant to go to the balcony where King was shot though he mightlater have been close enough to Kings body to acquire some stains from thepool of blood on the floor            Some politicians discovered memories are lessmelodramatic At the recent campaignfinance hearings Sen Robert Torricelliwaxed eloquent about his memories of the first hearing of the Senate I everwitnessedthe  Kefauver hearings on organized crime which he recalled asa festival of antiItalian prejudice But Torricelli was five days old whenthose hearings ended            PresidentClinton who never did get his draft story straight said in a radio addresslast year that a wave of black church burnings brought back vivid and painfulmemories of black churches being burned in my own state when I was a childWhen Arkansas historians pointed out there were no black church burnings in thestate then or perhaps ever a Clinton spokesperson said he meant blackcommunity buildings though there is no record of that either But whereverthe fires were she insisted Clintons recollections were very vivid andpainful            No doubt As the literature on lying often observes thosewho become skilled in the art of deception can easily fool themselves WhenRonald Reagan regaled world leaders with his story of having witnessed theliberation of a Nazi concentration camp he probably saw the event as vividlyas he had once seen the film about it that he helped to make Of course Reaganwas a special case He made himself up as he went along borrowing bits andpieces from this movie or that I paid for that microphone probably camefrom a Spencer Tracy political comedy his faith in an invulnerable Star Warsnuclear shield perhaps came from the inertia projector portrayed in a movie in which he starred While some of his political lies were far fromharmless most of his autobiographical lies were relatively small stuff Inever wore makeup in films check the films I believe in tithing tocharity check the tax records I got my nickname Dutch because  chooseone of at least three versions            LikeMcCarthy other Republicans like to pilfer their glory from the field ofbattle Former Rep Bob Dornan RCalif who went down in grudging defeat lastfall described his military career thusly in a  House speech I went intothe Air Force and volunteered for whatever dangerous assignment there was Infact he avoided action in Korea by going to drama school and his subsequentmilitary career was mostly spent directing and performing in armedforcestheatrical productions though he did crash one helicopter and three jets whilein pilot training            Christian Coalition head Pat Robertsondescribed himself in rsums and a published autobiography as a Marine officerassigned to combat duty during the Korean War In factwith the help of hisfathers connectionshe was conveniently detached from a unit headed for thebattlefield and spent his tour doing administrative tasks Wes Cooley ROrelost his seat last fall after falsely claiming a Korean War combat touras amember of the Special Forces no less            Curiously Richard Nixonthat archetype of political deceit provides no ready example of rsumrewritingunless you want to count I am not a crook By contrast piousJimmy Carter once described himself as a nuclear physicist He lateracknowledged that nuclear engineer was a more just description of hisacademic qualifications A modest fabrication but not bad for a presidentwhose subsequent campaign slogan was Ill never lie to you            Why do they do it Theeasiest answer is that by and large or at least for long periods of timepublic figures get away with it And even when they are discovered the publicis often forgiving or at least forgetting One theory has it that publicfigures see their audience as a distant easily manipulated mass to which theycan lie with impunity But maybe thats not the whole story Perhaps we thepublic dont mind being lied to if the lies evoke a vision not only of betterleaderspersons of uncompromising principle noble deeds and generousspiritbut of a nation that responds to such leadership
