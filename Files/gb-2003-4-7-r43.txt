                    Background        All organisms have evolved intricate signaling networks        that sense and respond to their environment At a cellular        level the activation of one or more signaling networks        often leads to coordinated changes in gene expression via        the regulated activity and binding of transcription factors        to transcription control regions TCRs of genes for        example enhancers and upstream activating sequences In        yeast and most other eukaryotes the transcriptional        regulation of individual genes is often multifactorial as        multiple transcription factors may bind to a single TCR             Multifactorial regulation encompasses several        distinct biochemical mechanisms In some cases        transcription factors may bind cooperatively to adjacent        DNA sites via direct physical interaction      In        other cases multiple transcription factors that bind        independently may recruit a common coactivator     or        may act independently of one another to alter gene        expression in response to distinct cellular cues            Recent studies have also suggested that nearby        transcription factors may collaboratively compete with        nucleosomes thus enhancing the binding of individual        transcription factors      Many experiments in yeast        have shown that specific pairs of factors must be bound        near each other for multifactorial regulation to occur               and it is on these spatial constraints that we        focus here        The challenges in understanding how regulatory        information is encoded in genomes include both the        identification of regulatory sequences in TCRs and the        elucidation of sequence constraints on productive        multifactorial regulation Previous computational work has        been devoted to identifying putative binding sites for        transcription factors A plethora of computational methods        has been developed to find overrepresented sequences in a        subset of genes believed to contain a common transcription        factor binding site reviewed in     The rapid pace        of genome sequencing has enabled a complementary approach         phylogenetic footprinting reviewed in       which        recognizes that the conservation of sequences across        related organisms often reflects evolutionary selection for        their presence in TCRs Several algorithms have been        developed to perform systematic phylogenetic footprinting        analyses              After compiling a collection of putative binding sites        associations can be made between various binding site        assortments and gene expression Some recent approaches        include Boolean logic     regression methods               spatial clustering     and multiple binding        site matrix classifiers       Spatial information        on the relative locations of binding sites is ignored in        all but the last two classes of approaches        The primary aim of this work was to incorporate        positional information and phylogenetic footprinting in        methods of identifying sequence motifs that may regulate        gene expression Consequently we expanded the focus of        phylogenetic footprinting from the conservation of        contiguous sequences to higherorder features of TCRs        namely the spatial organization of individual binding        sites Because transcription factors participating in        multifactorial regulation may require binding sites in        physical proximity to each other we searched for groups of        conserved sequences that were more closely spaced in TCRs        than expected We refer to these spatially organized        sequences as conserved word templates As a proof of        principle we started with the simplest example of such        templates pairs of conserved words of  basepairs bp        Conservation was assessed using the genome sequences of         Saccharomyces cerevisiae and three        closely related         Saccharomyces species which had been        sequenced to identify conserved regulatory sequences            To exploit this comparative genomic data we have devised        a method that systematically tested sequence pairs for        joint conservation across genomes and close spacing within        individual TCRs As genes regulated by the same set of        transcription factors often display similar geneexpression        patterns in certain experimental conditions we identified        pairs of conserved word templates whose gene targets were        associated with common changes in gene expression We        adopted a groupbysequence approach to first identify        genes that contained the wordpair templates and then to        test for significant associations with expression levels of        the identified genes     Significant associations        between conserved wordpair templates and specific        geneexpression changes and the prevalence of known        transcription factor binding sites suggest that conserved        wordpair templates comprise sequences important for        multifactorial regulation in yeast In addition conserved        wordpair templates represent more specific predictors of        gene expression than individual words or word pairs in         S cerevisiae                     Results                  Identification of conserved wordpair          templates          Multiple genome sequences provide additional power to          studies of gene regulation Because of natural selection          mutations accumulate more rapidly in nonfunctional DNA          regions than in functionally constrained bases Given a          multiple sequence alignment of orthologous sequences from          closely related species the aligned and invariant          regions should be enriched for functionally important          residues      Additional           Saccharomyces genomes were          sequenced to ensure sufficient sequence similarity to           S cerevisiae such that orthologous          regions could be reliably aligned yet enough sequence          divergence that functional sequences would be much more          conserved than nonfunctional sequences      To          confirm that regulatory sequences were found in conserved          regions we tested a database of  known nonredundant          regulatory motifs and found that  show conservation          ratios that were more than three standard deviations          above that expected by chance               We present a method to find conserved higherorder          sequence templates from related           Saccharomyces genomes Figure           Our method incorporates sequential statistical tests          with each step focusing on a distinct property of          conserved sequence templates The simplest instances of          sequence templates involve word pairs and their relative          spacing As described in detail below pairs of words          that were conserved in the same intergenic regions of          four           Saccharomyces genomes were          identified using a chisquare test for independence          Next a permutation test was used to select word pairs          whose physical proximity was closer than that expected by          chance Finally to evaluate the transcriptional          information contained in conserved word pairs with close          spacing the expression of genes containing TCR templates          was compared to the rest of the genome We initialized          our word list using all  words of length  treating          a given word and its reverse complement as identical For          each TCR consisting of up to  bp upstream of an open          reading frame a word was labeled conserved if all six          bases were identical in at least three of the four           Saccharomyces genomes on the basis          of the CLUSTALW alignment of that TCR          To test systematically whether words were conserved          more often in the same intergenic regions of the           Saccharomyces genomes than expected          by independent conservation a chisquare test was          performed on all possible pairwise combinations of words          see Materials and methods Pairs of words that          overlapped each other by more than three nucleotides were          excluded A significant proportion of word pairs showed          dependent conservation among the  million word pairs          tested  of them approximately  had          conservation  scores greater than  This threshold          corresponds to a probability of  for obtaining one or          more false positives after a Bonferroni correction for          multiple testing          Next we selected word pairs that displayed closer          physical spacing in intergenic regions than expected by          chance The choice of a statistical test to evaluate          close distances must consider the local fluctuations of          AT nucleotide content in genome sequences Previous work          used a Poisson distribution to evaluate proximity between          binding sites     However variability in base          composition can skew occurrences of arbitrary sequences          away from their expected distributions Indeed this          statistical test was confounded by large fluctuations in          the Poisson parameter estimates which varied up to          twofold within a single chromosome              The effects of basecomposition fluctuations as well          as varying lengths of TCRs motivated our nonparametric          statistical test for close spacing We used the median          denoted by  to summarize a distribution of minimum          distances between two words in           S cerevisiae  This distribution          was calculated on the basis of the genes whose TCRs          conserved both words and is independent of the relative          word order If two nonoverlapping words were closely          spaced in all TCRs we should find to be smaller than          expected by chance The statistical significance of this          spacing was assessed using a permutation test by          selecting the set of genes that contained a conserved          word pair and then randomizing the assignment of one of          the words to the genes containing that word see          Materials and methods By permuting the TCR labels for          one of the words but not the word positions themselves          we retained the positional biases of individual words          within intergenic regions          After correcting for multiple testing by controlling          the false discovery rate FDR a total of  out of           word pairs around  had significantly small          values FDR           q   for Figure  For a          list of these closely spaced and jointly conserved word          pairs see Additional data files As a negative control          we also assayed a sample of word pairs that did not show          dependent conservation conservation    yet were          jointly conserved in at least  TCRs No word pairs in a          random sample of  pairs with nondependent          conservation    showed significantly small          values for  after correction for multiple testing          Figure illustrates the distributions of for conserved          wordpair templates jointly conserved word pairs and          randomly conserved word pairs The medians of these          distance distributions were  nucleotides           nucleotides and  nucleotides respectively Notably          the median for template pairs was significantly smaller                     p   than the median for          randomly conserved pairs These results indicate that          many of the word pairs that were conserved in the same          intergenic regions of multiple           Saccharomyces genomes also          exhibited closer spacing in TCRs                          Conserved wordpair templates were significantly          associated with gene expression          Our method identified conserved wordpair templates          that were statistically significant with respect to both          coconservation in multiple genomes and close spacing in           S cerevisiae TCRs To evaluate the          regulatory information in these templates we assessed          the statistical association between gene groups that          shared a template and changes in gene expression          Similarly to other groupbysequence approaches for          finding regulatory sequences we expect that gene subsets          defined by common TCR sequence features should have          geneexpression patterns that are similar under          conditions where the transcription factors are active          yet are different from the average expression of genes in          the genome              To assess the association between conserved wordpair          templates and differentially expressed genes we          identified gene subsets whose TCRs contained both          conserved words in the template and observed their          expression patterns in           S cerevisiae in publicly available          datasets           see Materials and          methods for details We then conducted          KolmogorovSmirnov KS tests to evaluate for          differential gene expression between each gene subset and          the whole genome KS tests provide a nonparametric          sensitive and robust way to compare two distributions          Similar results were obtained using other statistical          tests such as           t tests and likelihood ratio tests          AM Moses unpublished data A           P            C matrix was computed each          conserved word pair in           P was assigned a KS           p value for each experimental          condition observed in           C see Materials and methods          Entries in this matrix KS           p values were filtered out if the          KS           p value did not meet the          threshold for multiple testing or was less than  times          more significant than the KS           p value for a gene subset          associated with either word alone see Materials and          methods The latter criterion minimizes geneexpression          changes that can be explained by the presence of a single          conserved word          Figure ashows the number of conserved wordpair          templates that were significantly associated with          geneexpression changes for varying significance levels          of the KS test which have been corrected for multiple          testing see Materials and methods Each line indicates          the number of gene subsets that were significant in a          different minimum number of experimental conditions          Several hundred closely spaced word pairs were          significantly associated with differential gene          expression For example  word pairs met an          FDRcorrected significance threshold of           p   for five or more          experimental conditions which represented approximately           of all closely spaced word pairs          The proportion of conserved wordpair templates          showing significant associations with gene expression was          compared to two sets of negative controls comprising          word pairs that failed either the first coconservation          or second close spacing statistical test For the first          control we used a sample of  word pairs that failed          the joint conservation test conservation             found in at least  TCRs but also showed modest          constraints on word pair spacing            p   Only eight of these          word pairs approximately  were significantly          associated with geneexpression changes at an          FDRcorrected threshold of           p   for five or more          experimental conditions To assess the relative          enrichment for significant associations with          geneexpression changes at a variety of multiple testing          thresholds we computed an odds ratio the proportion of          significant associations among the template pairs          divided by the proportion of significant associations          among the random pairs For the above threshold the odds          ratio was about  In other words gene groups that          contain a common conserved wordpair template in their          TCRs were about  times more likely to be associated          with significant geneexpression changes compared with          gene groups selected using randomly conserved word pairs          As shown in Figure b the odds ratios for association          with gene expression changes in multiple conditions          varied between  and  This analysis was repeated for          a sample of  coconserved conservation             word pairs that failed the close spacing test          permutation           p   after multiple          testing yet occurred in at least  intergenic regions          The relative enrichment for gene expression associations          in closely spaced words is displayed in Figure c Among          coconserved word pairs those pairs that were closely          spaced than expected were still about  to  times more          likely to be significantly associated with gene          expression changes compared to word pairs that were not          found to have significantly close spacing We confirmed          that gene groups associated with significant gene          expression changes did not have statistically significant          differences in their TCR sizes as assessed by a          permutation test data not shown Thus gene groups that          contained coconserved and spatially close word pairs are          more significantly associated with geneexpression          changes than expected by chance                          Many identified sequences represented known          transcription factor binding sites          In addition to their statistical significance many          conserved wordpair templates that were most strongly          associated with geneexpression changes were consistent          with biological information on the transcription factors          known to bind those sites     In all analyses          described below we used a set of  word pairs that had          significant associations with geneexpression changes at          an FDRcorrected multiple testing threshold of           p   for five or more          experiments For visualization purposes we organized the                    P            C matrix by hierarchically          clustering the KS           p values for the  word pairs          see Materials and methods for details          Hierarchical clustering of this output matrix          identified groups of word pairs with similar KS           p values in specific subsets of          experimental conditions Figure  For these clustered          output matrices see Additional data files In many          cases the word pairs that clustered together also          comprised overlapping hexamer sequences suggesting that          some of the hexamers in different pairs may represent a          larger somewhat variable sequence Table  For          example group  in Figure included six word pairs In          each of these word pairs one of the component words           such as TCACGT CACGTG or ACGTGC  matched part of the          consensus binding site for Cbfp TCACGTG The other          component word in each pair  such as ACTGTG CTGTGG          TGTGGC or GTGGCT  represented part of the known          Metp binding site AAACTGTGG Therefore genes          whose TCRs contained any word pair within this group          probably contained a conserved Cbfpbinding site along          with a conserved Metpbinding site and the          distances between the conserved sites in these genes were          also smaller than expected by chance These results agree          with the known interaction of Cbfp and Metp for the          regulation of genes involved in sulfur utilization see          Discussion          Table shows a partial list of the  most significant          groups of consensus sequences which were assembled by          joining adjacent word pairs in the clustered output          matrix with overlapping sequences Many of these          consensus sequences matched transcription factor binding          sites that had been biochemically verified Several pairs          of transcription factors denoted by stars in Table           were not previously known to act on the same sets of          target genes                          Conditions with significant geneexpression changes          coincided with transcription factor activity          Further support that templates contain transcriptional          regulatory information was obtained from a key          observation the experimental conditions with significant          geneexpression changes often corresponded to conditions          in which the cognate transcription factors are known to          be active Table  In addition many gene subsets that          shared an individual wordpair template in their TCRs          were highly enriched for geneexpression changes We will          survey examples of wordpair templates associated with          geneexpression changes focusing our attention on          several environmental stress conditions The          environmental stress response represents a paradigm for          multifactorial control of transcription regulation          Genomewide expression studies found that around           genes were induced and around  genes were repressed in          response to a wide variety of stressful environmental          transitions      Many of these genes also showed          subtly different expression patterns in response to          specific stimuli suggesting that the common          environmental stress response may be modulated by the          activity of conditionspecific transcription factors                       Over a third of the conserved wordpair templates were          associated with geneexpression changes in multiple          environmental stress conditions Figure a Tables            The largest group of overlapping word pairs contained          matches to the PAC and RRPE motifs which were associated          with genes that were repressed in multiple stresses               These motifs were discovered by their enrichment          among the approximately  genes that were commonly          repressed in stress yet the putative transcription          factors that bind these sequences have yet to be          determined The second largest group of overlapping word          pairs corresponded to the RRPE core which is           nucleotides long along with some flanking conserved          bases These repressed genes were enriched for rRNA          processing genes the group of genes in which this motif          was originally identified     Nine conserved          wordpair templates contained sequences that matched most          of the stress response element STRE the consensus site          for the general stress transcription factors MsnpMsnp          Genes that conserved both these words in their TCRs were          significantly associated with geneexpression induction          in multiple environmental stresses including cadmium          heat shock aminoacid starvation nitrogen depletion and          stationary phase In most cases the sequences comprising          the word pairs were mutually overlapping We interpret          these sequences as representing different halves of the          same binding site Because our test for close spacing          required nonoverlapping sequences the two words must          have appeared over  bp away in TCRs Thus these genes          have probably conserved at least two Msnplike          consensus sequences in their TCRs          Several groups of conserved wordpair templates only          showed significant associations with gene expression          changes in different subsets of stress conditions Figure          b Tables   For example binding sites for Cbfp          and Metp were found to cooccur in several conserved          wordpair templates Genes that contained conserved          binding sites for these transcription factors in their          TCRs were strongly induced in cadmium aminoacid          starvation and early nitrogen depletion These conditions          are consistent with the biological activity of these          transcription factors which induce transcription of          sulfurassimilation genes in response to the demand of          sulfurcontaining metabolites       In another          example several word pairs comprising binding sites for          the transcriptional repressors Migp and Umep were          associated with induced gene expression in stationary          phase The observed derepression of Migp and Umep          targets in stationary phase is consistent with the          nuclear export of the Migp repressor under glucose          limitation as well as recent findings that carbon source          genes can be Umep targets     In addition genes          containing a conserved sequence similar to the consensus          for Msnp an inducer of the environmental stress          response and the heatshock transcription factor Hsfp          were significantly induced under heat shock Once again          the conditions with most significant geneexpression          changes corresponded to the known activities of the          transcription factors involved                          Enrichment for known transcription factor targets          among individual gene groups          Some groups of genes with shared wordpair templates          were enriched for known targets of transcription factors          The vast majority of genes with conserved sites for both          the Cbfp and Metp transcription factors were          induced more than fourfold in cadmium aminoacid          starvation and early nitrogen depletion Figure a Half          of these genes have confirmed roles in sulfurutilization          processes such as methionine metabolism sulfate          assimilation sulfate transport and sulfur amino acid          metabolism     Compared to the rest of the genome          the group of genes that conserved both of these words          within their TCRs was highly enriched for          sulfurutilization genes hypergeometric           p value      after          Bonferroni correction for multiple testing In addition          we found three genes in this group            GSH            RAD and           BNA  with highly correlated          expression under the above conditions and thus may be          commonly regulated by Cbfp and Metp despite their          lack of direct annotation as sulfurutilization genes          The shared conservation of both the Cbfp and Metp          sites provides further evidence that these genes comprise          part of the cellular response to the demand for products          of this pathway          Genes with a conserved halfsite for the Happ          transcription factor as well as a conserved EcmpUpcp          binding site in their TCRs were significantly associated          with induction in the presence of drugs that inhibited          ergosterol biosynthesis Figure b This group of           genes contained eight ergosterol biosynthesis genes this          proportion represented an enrichment compared to the rest          of the genome hypergeometric           p value     after          Bonferroni correction for multiple testing The          transcription factors Ecmp and Upcp have been shown to          induce the expression of ergosterol biosynthesis genes in          response to low intracellular concentrations of          ergosterol whereas Happ is known to regulate the          expression of these genes according to the availability          of heme and oxygen which are required for the pathway                                        Conserved word pairs were more informative than          sequence features derived from single words or single          species          The above results from the KS test strongly suggested          that sequence features based on the coconservation and          close spacing of word pairs identified examples of          multifactorial regulation Two other statistical tests          were also performed to examine how information contained          in conserved wordpair templates compared to other          sequence features derived from           S cerevisiae  or from single          conserved words Informative sequence features should be          both highly specific a high proportion of genes that          share the feature should show geneexpression changes          and highly sensitive most of the genes that show          geneexpression changes should also share the          feature          To assess the specificity of a sequence feature in          explaining gene expression we computed the average          expression profile for all genes that shared that          feature We expect that if a sequence feature represented          a transcription factor binding site genes containing          that feature in their TCRs would be induced or          repressed on average compared to all the genes in the          genome     By comparing the average expression          profile derived from conserved wordpair templates with          average expression profiles derived from simpler sequence          features we assessed how much information was obtained          by incorporating both the conservation and pairwise          combination of sequences For representative word pairs          associated with significant geneexpression changes in          environmental stress conditions we compared the average          expression profile for gene subsets that shared single          words in           S cerevisiae  gene subsets that          conserved single words among multiple genomes and gene          subsets that shared both words in           S cerevisiae Figure and see          Additional data files In general the average          geneexpression profiles for conserved word pairs were          more significantly different from the average expression          of genes in the genome when either conservation or word          pairs was used as an additional criterion for gene          selection In Figure  the last two rows for each word          pair indicate the average expression profiles for genes          that shared both words in           S cerevisiae  as well as the          average expression profile for genes that conserved both          words in multiple genomes respectively Strikingly the          consideration of wordpair conservation yielded further          increases in average geneexpression profiles compared to          word pairs in           S cerevisiae alone Similar          effects were observed for the PACRRPE and the          overlapping RRPE pairs associated with genes repressed in          the environmental stress response see Additional data          files Thus conserved wordpair templates contained          more specific predictors of gene expression than          comparable sequence templates derived from           S cerevisiae alone          To evaluate how well sequence features can explain          gene expression changes across the whole genome several          groups have constructed linear regression models using          various choices for features        The           R square statistic of a regression          model indicates the percent of global variance that can          be explained using the sequence features in the model          Models with better fits to the genomewide expression          data would thus have greater           R square values To assess the          sensitivity of individual word pairs in explaining global          gene expression we first constructed regression models          using individual word pairs see Materials and methods          We chose three representative environmental conditions          aminoacid starvation  min     stationary phase           h in YPD     and ergosterol inhibition          terbinafine     We constructed regression models          using counts of individual words in           S cerevisiae TCRs or using counts          of words that were conserved among           Saccharomyces TCRs Sequence          conservation improved the fit of regression models based          on individual word pairs            R   see Additional data          files These results clearly show that sequences          conserved in multiple           Saccharomyces species were more          likely to be associated with geneexpression changes          To assess the joint contribution of word pairs on gene          expression we also included interaction terms between          the individual words only if their coefficients were          statistically significant see Materials and methods          Pairwise interaction terms expressed as the product of          scores for two features represent a standard way to          assess whether two features contribute nonadditively to          gene expression     Indeed the inclusion of          significant pairwise interaction terms improved the fits          for both the           S cerevisiae sequence model and          the conserved sequence model increasing the           R square by a further  to           see Additional data files Whereas the interaction          terms only comprise a small proportion of the global          variance they can be interpreted as statistical evidence          of dependence between sequence features              Therefore the nonadditive contributions of conserved          wordpair templates further suggest their involvement in          multifactorial regulation          We expanded these models to include multiple conserved          wordpair templates using a stepwise linear regression          procedure The set of potential sequence features was          expanded to include all words found in templates          associated with significant gene expression changes in          that condition as assessed previously by the KS test          see Materials and methods The final           R square values for regression          models based on occurrences of multiple words in           S cerevisiae ranged from  to           Table and see Additional data files Once again          the use of conserved instances of individual words          yielded better model fits with improvements in           R square values from  to           Further improvements in the model fit            R   to  were obtained          using pairwise interaction terms between individual words          found in the same wordpair template The total           R square values for the regression          models based on conserved wordpair templates with          interaction terms thus ranged from  to  Table           Thus sequence features based on conserved wordpair          templates could explain more of the global gene          expression changes than features based on           S cerevisiae alone                            Discussion        This work describes two principles for analyzing        combinations of regulatory sequences First sequence        conservation among closely related yeast species was used        to find sequences that were more likely to be functionally        important Second a template approach that considered        joint positional distributions of word pairs increased the        specificity of geneexpression predictions using        sequencebased rules We have demonstrated that        higherorder sequence features within TCRs were conserved        across multiple         Saccharomyces genomes Closely spaced        and jointly conserved word pairs were also more likely to        be associated with specific geneexpression changes A        large proportion of words contained in templates matched        known transcription factor binding sites In many cases        associations between templates and geneexpression changes        were significant in conditions when the corresponding        transcription factors are known to be active In addition        groups of genes that coconserved both words in a template        often were enriched for common functional roles These        results suggest that conserved wordpair templates which        were discovered strictly on the basis of higherorder        properties of sequence conservation also carry biological        relevance        Conserved wordpair templates may be consistent with        several underlying biochemical mechanisms One possible        interpretation of templates is that closely spaced sequence        pairs may promote direct or indirect interactions between        transcription factors by increasing the local        concentrations of the individual factors For example the        proximity of Cbfp and Metp binding sites may promote        interaction between these factors in recruiting their        common transcriptional activators Metp and Metp        Experimental studies on the TCRs of         MET and         MET have demonstrated that the        binding of Cbfp enhances the DNAbinding affinity of        Metp     Indeed biochemical experiments suggest        that all these proteins may interact at the TCRs of some        sulfurutilization genes            Another possible regulatory scheme for conserved        closely spaced word pairs is that individual sequences        found in templates may correspond to binding sites for        transcription factors that bind independently under the        same or separate conditions The Msnp and Hsfp        transcription factors whose binding sites were similar to        words identified in a template represent an example of        multifactorial regulation in response to distinct        environmental stimuli     Spacing constraints between        their binding sites could nevertheless be important under        conditions when both factors are active Recent experiments        have suggested that transcription factors that do not        physically interact may still coactivate gene expression        as long as their binding sites are spaced within a        nucleosome length approximately  bp due to        collaborative competition of the bound transcription        factors with core histones            Close spacing between word pairs may be important for        reasons other than the promotion of transcription factor        interactions Different regions of TCRs at varying windows        away from translation start sites may be more competent at        recruiting or inhibiting RNA polymerase These differences        may be influenced by nucleosome accessibility chromatin        structure or DNA physical properties which can be        correlated with local AT content see    for        references Notably we have also found that the relative        proportions of A and T nucleotides vary considerably within        the  bp closest to translation start sites AM Moses        MBEisen and Audrey Gasch unpublished results        Lowcomplexity words that contained four or more As or Ts        could be found in many templates denoted by T                   n          C in Figure and Table  these words may serve as        surrogates for a distance window from the translation        start Binding sites that are close to these lowcomplexity        words may be found in more transcriptionally competent        regions of TCRs Alternatively the possibility that each        word in an identified pair may be found at similar        distances from a third conserved sequence element in all        TCRs cannot be discounted        Direct biological models of bindingsite organization in        TCRs as exemplified by conserved wordpair templates        provided several advantages over naive statistical models        based on sequence combinations in         S cerevisiae  Average        geneexpression profiles showed that conserved word pairs        were more specific predictors of gene expression giving        fewer false positives than single or pairwise sequences        derived from         S cerevisiae  indicating that        conserved regions among these closely related         Saccharomyces species were enriched        for functional sequences The consideration of distance        constraints between pairs of conserved sequences found many        more examples than a previous study of bindingsite        clustering for multiple transcription factors in         S cerevisiae     In addition        we discovered new sequences and pairwise interaction terms        using regression models similar to those reported in           and    Table  Conserved wordpair templates        accounted for similar changes in genomewide expression          R square from approximately  to        approximately  using only  to  features compared        with dozens of overlapping features used by other methods             Therefore individual features from our methods        were more predictive of genomewide expression changes        A key limitation of our approach is the use of hexamers        which may fail to capture known binding sites For example        the binding sites for Mcmp and Rapp are poorly modeled by        exact words in that these transcription factors bind        sequences with relaxed specificity at certain positions            Our method missed examples of multifactorial        regulation involving Mcmp or Rapp that were suggested by        previous work using positionweight matrices     In        addition our method required sequence identity for a word        to be labeled as conserved This strict requirement omitted        binding sites that may have retained their function        despite mutations in degenerate positions that may have        little impact on transcription factor binding This        tradeoff between enumerating all possible words and        capturing degenerate positions in binding sites was        compounded by the very large number of pairwise word        combinations that were enumerated Further work should        incorporate more complicated sequence models as well as        optimization methods that restrict the search space of        sequence combinations        The consideration of joint conservation and close        spacing has provided insights into how TCR organization may        influence the multifactorial regulation of gene expression        in         Saccharomyces cerevisiae  These        criteria were motivated by experimental studies on the        positional organization of individual binding sites within        TCRs with the hypothesis that this underlying architecture        would be functionally conserved Even more complicated        higherorder sequence rules are apparent in the        organization of         cis regulatory modules in         Drosophila melanogaster            Nevertheless a common organizational theme of the TCRs in        both of these organisms is the importance of relative        spacing between transcription factor binding sites The        discovery of additional principles for TCR organization        will further advance our understanding of how regulatory        information is encoded in genome sequences                    Materials and methods                  Datasets          Wholegenome shotgun sequencing of           Saccharomyces bayanus            S mikatae  and           S paradoxus

             Intergenic regions were aligned using CLUSTALW as          described    and are available from the Yeast          Comparative Genomics website     A total of           CLUSTALW alignments were analyzed These alignments were          filtered for orthologs in at least three genomes          Geneexpression measurements were obtained from the          Stanford Microarray Database    and Rosetta              The main experimental types among the  conditions          examined include cell cycle      environmental          stress response     DNA damage      cadmium          N Ogawa and PO Brown unpublished data and          inhibition of ergosterol biosynthesis     This data          has been logtransformed base  and each experimental          condition has been median normalized                          Dependent conservation of word pairs          To assess whether two words were coconserved in the          same intergenic regions a chisquare test of          independence was systematically conducted for all          possible words of length  We defined a word to include          a bp sequence and its reverse complement Each          transcriptional control region TCR for a gene was          defined as the  bp upstream of its translation start          site TCRs shared between divergently transcribed genes          less than  bp long were only counted once A word was          labeled conserved in a TCR if all six bases were          identical among at least three of the four genomes in the          CLUSTALW alignment For each word pair            W            V

of each          conserved word in a TCR summed over all TCRs TCRs          shared between divergently transcribed genes less than           bp long were only counted once The expected counts

multiplied by the total number of TCRs          The chisquare statistic with Yates continuity correction          was computed according to the definition                                    Spatial proximity of constrained word pairs          The second requirement for a conserved sequence          template involved constraints on spatial arrangements          between individual words Any method that evaluates          spacing distributions between word pairs must take into          account positional biases that may be present for          individual words AM Moses unpublished results We          used a permutation test to evaluate the significance of          the median of minimum distances excluding overlaps          between conserved word pairs By permuting the TCR labels          for one of the words but not the word positions          themselves we retained the positional biases of          individual words within intergenic regions Within any          given TCR
