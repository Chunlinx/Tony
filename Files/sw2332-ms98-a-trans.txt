        hi how you doing   good     do you  do you have uh drug testing where you are   yes yes we do right here at the at the very building they have uh a nurses office   uhhuh   and uh i havent my name hasnt come up yet how about you   uh yeah i have uh what ive found out out of curiosity was my name has uh has come up twice and weve only been involved with the program say about a year   right   and uh when i when i first heard about it i was very uh very defensive i didnt think it was something that that the companies ought to be doing   right   because i felt that i was losing something or taking something away from me   yes thats the the major issue i guess that uh   yeah but now um now that its happening i i feel comfortable with it i i dont feel as though ive lost anything and that i feel uh secure in that i know that everybody that works around me um is is drug free   i have a a similar opinion at first i wasnt sure but then i thought it was a good thing for the company as as well   how about how about where you   uh uh we had a couple of people in our group who wrote one who wrote a huge letter to the editors   umhum   saying that its a violation of my rights and this and that and the tests arent accurate and but i think theyve got that testing down to a real science where you know they dont really you know im im sure you saw the video on how they do the testing and it its almost impossible i think to uh to make a mistake   well i was involved in uh in the in the initial training program because i had to go out and teach or explain to other people what we were doing why we were doing it so i i guess i had a little uh uh first hand knowledge of   right   of uh seeing the films i had more of extensive training in in uh background information of the reasons why they were doing it the cost that uh   right   uh that we projected that it that it actually cost companies by having people uh uh be involved with drugs   who were uh right and that and thats a lot of money   oh yeah   and   how do you feel about other other uh things like public uh safety buses bus drivers and and uh airplane drivers or or pilots rather you   oh oh taking drug testing   yeah   oh sure i think thats thats i feel that you know for certain cases that i that i am willing to give up my rights to secure the rights of others i guess is what im saying   yeah   uh when the public whole is at stake   well i   then im willing to give you know personally i cant speak for others but for myself im willing to say okay you know if i see this is a right to if to privacy im willing to give up that right because i can see that its uh public good is at stake and the company good is at stake and you know if they can get this thing under control you know it its going to save us all money as far as benefits and everything else you know insurance and and and everything else in this country   um yeah the the uh ive always felt that public people who are involved with the safety of other people should be drug tested ive i have never said that i didnt want that the problem that i had was   right   whether my coworker is on drugs or not has does not have an influence on my safe wellbeing   right you dont work in an area where theres chemicals or machinery or or things like that but   no so i had uh right   and um they dont have any of that up here but you know um i guess its just the productivity and the the number of uh uh sick days i guess and that they uh that they accrue   well im sure thats still going to happen   right well well i i think they would you know someone on drugs probably misses more work i guess thats why this smoking thing came out too   um you know ive gone to those classes uh unfortunately for me im im a smoker and um i i saw the statistics that came out on       uh smokers typically have more time out of work theyre uh uh more prone to accidents and all of those other things and and uh   when theyre drive and thats why why i guess the car insurance has no nonsmoker rates or whatever as well   for for automobile insurance i had no idea   yeah   that they were doing that i know that they originally talking about uh health   oh yeah they nonsmoker at least down here in Texas they have nonsmoker nonsmoker they call them discounts   uhhuh   they give you if youre a nonsmoker i i guess there is some kind of studies that show but if youre smoking youre not youre not as you know when youre lighting up or something you know your hands both hands arent on the wheel or whatever   youre not as attentive um uh thats uh thats different ive never heard of that how about the um the the smoking premium out in Texas i understand they they started doing that   that yeah i guess that takes effect in uh   June July   when June July yeah   yeah that they from what i understand that uh notices went out to all of the sites   right there was a lot of uh controversy about that too im not a im not a smoker myself   yeah well thats thats the problem thats you dont uh how about do you eat do you like French fries   i do   what would you what would you ever say if they said anybody who eats French fries has to pay a ten percent premium on their life insurance   yeah id probably get upset   uh then you would get upset its its uh what theyre doing is theyre nibbling at the population piece by piece   yeah yeah right right   and uh and now they know that the number or percentage of smokers is is less than the the uh the people who do not smoke then they can go ahead and do that um   right right right if they i i i assume if they they i guess theyre saying with the cigarettes though that theyve been able to show that its the number one leading cause of preventable preventable   preventable death not yeah but   death in this country was a half a million people a year or so dying with smoke relating smoking related   yeah but isnt isnt the uh the insurance also for for uh Blue Cross so theyre not only saying preventable not preventable death theyre also saying um that youll have uh less likelihood of being sick if you dont smoke   right right right  right well thats all what i always felt if it if those studies were true about smokers having higher medical costs   uhhuh   and we do have one smoker in our area who and he he seems to miss a lot of work       but um   is he an older person   um forty   well that   eight maybe   thats not too old   yeah forty five forty eight     yeah and he and he does miss a lot of work   yeah but then theres people you talk to and say ive never been sick a day in my life you know so i guess i guess you know the the studies show as an average   yeah   not specific cases and uh   yeah   i thought well with you know if thats really true then then i guess i agreed with the extra premium       if it could i mean if they can come along and prove that French fries were the same deal then they have a right to charge for that too i guess   well what what do you mean if they can prove it there theres already   yeah that that its a major cause of uh early   hardening of the arteries its its uh sure it is  high cholesterol   right       well it depends if theyre cooked in      see see one of the things that will determine whether theyre able to do that or not is not their ability to prove that it is unhealthy because we all know that French fries are not healthy for you its the capability its the capability of detecting it   yeah right right   how do you prove someone has eaten French fries   right it its the its the honor system isnt it       its the honor system i know itll be an interesting experiment to see how   um but i think in time come youre going to see that happening youre going to see um where the high risk people pay a premium but they have to find a way to prove it   yeah right right well well i think the same way with alcohol too personally it you know that that would probably be the next   yeah yeah   the next thing   uh   i mean but you know theres theres the difference because uh they say you know i guess they say tobacco is addictive i guess they say alcohol is addictive as well   but yeah there are more drinkers than smokers if you think about it   oh yeah thats there is oh there is   and and drinking is still socially acceptable where smoking is socially unacceptable today and so that theres a big difference so that so that they really cant make a a change in in policy about drinking until   right right right well its part of the business world too when you make deals you know a lot times its uh   yeah yeah right right yeah   three martini lunch or whatever they say     so i guess you can you can classify alcohol as a drug so is a cigarette in my opinion um where its not something i dont think people that are that are smoking are doing it voluntarily i think theyre doing it involuntarily   right   i know i am um i dont know anybody in their right mind that says that that im doing it because i want to i   yeah yeah makes me feel better   well i i i do i do make that statement i say i do it because i like it but i cant say im im im doing it because i want to im doing it because i have to or because my desire is greater than uh   right nicotine addiction yeah       yeah i have uh my inlaws are both smokers and uh theyve tried to quit numerous times and   uhhuh   and i think the longest theyve made it is about three months and then they go to a a friends house or something and there theyre all smoking and and they break yeah they just cant stand it you know all of a sudden they get its overwhelming and then they break down and then they say im a failure and then they just give up you know   start up again i uh i started when i was younger and uh it was prior to the time that the the risks were uh were known   were known yeah so well i think weve probably talked long enough   okay nice talking to you   well i can tell youre from youve got that New England accent   and youve got that Southern accent   does that mean youre youre youre in uh uh New Hampshire what   im in the Attleboro Attleboro Massachusetts plant   Massachusetts   yeah   yeah i have uh my wifes uh grandparents are from Boston theyre   oh no kidding
