              okay i dont know about you but i hate to do yard work and i pay somebody to do all of my yard work   really  i like it   yeah do you   i i like um um um working with flowers and stuff like that   oh well i i i dont mind doing like gardening or just stuff like that but im just regular cutting the grass and   oh just mowing the mowing the yard   i always told my dad when i was a kid and he made me do it i said i cant wait until im old enough so i dont have to do this anymore     thats probably why you hate it so much   because i always had to do it and so i just pay someone else to do it and they do the they do the cutting they fertilize they um edge and um i think this year im going to have some landscaping put in   uhhuh   so i dont know i dont i im single and and and and so i dont know i dont if i had a a man around to do it it might be different i dont know   i kind of enjoy working out in the yard i i enjoy working out in the yard i mean in the summertime its hard here because it gets so hot   pardon me do you umhum   you have to like get up at six oclock in the morning if youre going to mow the yard and not faint while your doing it     do you cut the grass and stuff   yeah   you do you live by yourself   no no im married   but you still do it anyway   well we both do sometimes   you both do it thats nice do you have um a lot of flowers and stuff   well were were moving to a new house and so well well have to get started over there   oh   decide what were going to plant and everything at the at the old house we had a lot of roses   um those are pretty i i used to have a house that had a really it was really well landscaped and i i enjoyed the flowers and the and the trees the things this   umhum   house doesnt have very much it has some trees but um who lived here before didnt put in anything in the way of shrubs or flowers but i think i am going to have that done   yeah   have that done this year because i do enjoy looking at it i just im not i dont tolerate the heat well     it does get really hot here   i much prefer to stay in the house in my air conditioning and look at it without working in it       although i have i did try one year um out here in Dallas but i lived i used to live in San Antonio and i did try growing having a garden where i grew tomatoes and vegetables different vegetables and that was kind of fun   uhhuh yeah   to get out and work and that   we tried that last year and but we hadnt lived here in Dallas for you know long enough to to remember that you have to do like um i have this sister who lives in Florida and she plants her garden in January harvest in May   uhhuh uhhuh   plant again in um late September   ooh   and then harvest like in December yeah thats right because the summertime you just cant grow anything and we tried to plant in like end of March or April and everything just toasted i mean it just   isnt that when when are you  i thought that was when you were supposed to plant   oh here it gets so hot i mean this stuff just burns to a crisp what   when when are you supposed to plant it when when are you supposed to plant then   probably late January   really   right when it just as soon as it stops freezing   um       i didnt realize that   because you know i mean last summer the only way you could keep something keep a keep a garden growing last summer was to water it all day long every day and because it would just it would just burn to a crisp   yeah yeah it does eat up the water eats up your water bill i know that   oh yeah   but um i dont know ive i   i just prefer having someone else do it to me um you know id rather spend my time doing other things   umhum yeah   and i know my dad always enjoyed it he loved to work in the yard   why did he make you do it   uh he made us do the grunt work   well so okay you need to get married and have kids and then when theyre big enough you can have them go do the yard  and you can do what you want to do   thats what he i cant tell you how many times i heard that thats what he yeah i i cant tell you how many times i heard that and my son only my son only five so hes not old enough yet to send out to to the do the yard work     no but he will be   about five more years maybe but um i dont know i dont know really         its interesting i dont i dont know part of the reason i think is that i dont know anything about it when i had my other house and it was already landscaped and i you know i didnt know what to do and how to take care of the things and you know i learned a little bit but um   yeah   i heard roses i heard that roses are really difficult to grow and they really take a lot of   well i i didnt seem to have that experience i mean they were already there but we just fed them and watered them   you did you have any problem with bugs or anything like that   no   well thats good have you have you ever grown any vegetables   oh well like i said we tried last year but we didnt do it right   um tomatoes tomatoes       and its going to be too late this year by the time we get moved so well probably wait and maybe in the fall we might plant a fall garden this year   yeah  um hum   but were not going to try to do anything during the summertime because it is just too hot   its an interesting i think its an interesting you know its an interesting hobby if um you know to have i just have never taken the time to learn to learn very much about it and   umhum   you know but like i said i dont tolerate the heat and the   yeah   some of its fun but the cutting of grass and i just dont enjoy that   yeah thats what i said you know summer during the summertime youve got to get up at six oclock in the morning   oh i see   to do it before you know before it gets hot and one time last year i remember we were planning on doing that and it was eighty degrees even then   at six oclock yeah yeah i know   oh it was just awful and so humid   have you had to start your work on your yard this year yet cutting it and stuff   oh no because were fixing to move   i just had mine done for the first time last week yeah   really   so its getting to be i i usually have it done about every other week   yeah   and i dont know now its not growing real fast it will pick up   yeah oh yeah   its just getting green i prefer to see green than brown   umhum     but well it was nice talking to you   nice talking to you too   and good luck on your moving and your garden  thanks   thanks oh thanks   byebye     byebye
