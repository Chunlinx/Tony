                                 Bradley and Gore Slug It Out Over Poverty            BROOKLYN NYIn the Democratic primary revised version Al Gore playsAvis to Bill Bradleys Hertz Bradley was scheduled to give a major address onchild poverty at a Baptist church in the BedfordStuyvesant neighborhood ofBrooklyn today So Gore cobbled together his own proposal and launched apreemptive strike at a Methodist church in a black neighborhood in WashingtonDC yesterday This new Gore is a cheeky bastard A Gore aide even showed upat the Bradley campaigns preaddress press briefing to hand out fact sheetscriticizing Bradleys antipoverty record            Irksome as the feisty new Al is to Team Bradley his aggressiveness isalready making for a better and more interesting campaign When both candidateslay out their proposals on a given subject at the same time we journalists areimpelled to compare and contrast them And in this case the exercise isilluminating What the two antipoverty proposals make clear is that while Goremay be trying to steal Bradleys thunder he isnt imitating his proposals atall The two agree about some of the main pointsincreasing the minimum wageexpanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and fully funding Head Start But theyhave fundamentally different attitudes about how the federal government shouldgo about helping poor people            The most striking difference is in the way the two candidates frame theproblem Gore takes a thoroughly Clintonized New Democratic approach topoverty emphasizing the need for personal responsibility and NewCovenantstyle reciprocity between government and benefitrecipient He castthis weeks proposal as the Next Step in Welfare Reforman effort to StrengthenFamilies Reduce Child Poverty Promote Responsible Fatherhood The nuances oflanguage are significant Note that Gore avoids separating out his proposalsfor helping the poor Subscribing like Bill Clinton to the idea that suburbanvoters dont like Democrats enamored of liberal spending programs Goresandwiches his generosity toward the poor between more middleclass friendlyideas The objective of reducing not eliminating poverty comes attached totwo other ideashelping parents make time for their children and what hecharacterized in his speech as cracking down on deadbeats who abandon theirchildren Gores proposal is filled with coercive and punitive mechanisms Hewould require poor mothers to sign individual responsibility plans He wouldrequire fathers who owe child support to go either to work or to jail            Bradley by contrast talks like an only slightly chastened Mondale liberalHis Child Poverty in America speech available at wwwbillbradleycom offersthe soaring aspirations of LBJs war on povertythough without theprogrammatic reach or generous funding I am issuing a simple challengetoday he said Let us eliminate child poverty as we know it in America bythe end of the next decade In place of the Clintonian buzzwordresponsibility Bradley calls for justice Where Gore favors tough loveBradley offers unconditional sympathy And instead of proposing coercivesystems to make poor women work and poor men support their families Bradleysuggests various ways of raising their incomes to the poverty line In otherwords where Gore views poverty as partly a moral failing Bradley views it assimply a lack of money If in the end he doesnt offer very much money toaddress the problem its because he knows that any Democratic presidentelected in  would lack the political capital for more than a modestdownpayment which is how he described his plan            There are two specific areas that highlight these differences in approachPerhaps the clearest difference is on the issue of the  welfarereformbill which Gore supported and Bill Bradley voted against on his way out ofthe Senate As a result of welfare reform millions of families have movedfrom the dependency of welfare to the dignity of work Gore said in hisspeech Bradley on the other hand didnt refer at all to the welfarereformbill of  which required states to adopt time limits and work requirementsAsked what Bradley thinks now of welfare reform his press secretary EricHauser said that it had some fundamental flaws in terms of the federalgovernment simply handing money over to the states and that Bradley continuesto harbor some doubts about its longterm viability The problem for Bradleyis that welfare reform is working remarkably well Someday soon Gore will clubhim over the head with this issue and Bradley will deserve it            A similar distinction in tone and approach marks what the two have to sayabout deadbeat dads Bradley takes a kind of Ad Council approach In hisspeech he called on fathers to realize that having a child is a lifetimecommitment Gore would give them no other option He wants to take away theircredit cards on top of their drivers licenses and passports while attachingtheir bank accounts and garnishing their wages Gore then proposes throwingthem in jail if they refuse to work Somewhat comically he follows this callfor relentless harassment and involuntary servitude with a proposal toencourage more fathers to acknowledge paternity            In general I think both Gores and Bradleys approaches are somewhatflawed Many of Gores ideas seem gimmicky and polldriven Theres a DickMorris flavor to the inventive punishments applied to absent fathers thepublic enemies who have no friends The more substantive part of what Goreproposesan increase in the EITC marriagepenalty relief an expandedfamilyleave actis fine but unduly modest in its ambition There are otherthings we as a country can do about poverty offer lastresort jobs to welfarerecipients and replace public housing projects with more humane alternativesBut Gore seems to lack the guts to confront the issue of poverty directly Anddespite his reputation for wonkery most of Gores ideas are far toovaguemuch more so than Bradleys His fact sheet doesnt explain how hismeasures would really work Nor does it acknowledge how much they would cost orsay where the money would come from            Bradleys plan has many of the opposite defects His rhetoric is bold andsweeping but bears little relation to the substance of his  billion planwhich is modest and incremental Eliminating child poverty in a decade whichis what Bradley says he can accomplish albeit with the old as we know ithedge is simply an absurd goal Its waronpovertystyle overpromisingwithout any waronpoverty cavalry to back it up Continuing to reduce povertyat the rate it has been dropping during the past eight years would be a farmore plausible aspiration            Since the s the conventional wisdom has been that Democrats who are toointerested in helping poor people get their heads handed to them Goresproblem is that he seems to believe this Bradleys problem is that he seems tobelieve it too but pretends he doesnt
