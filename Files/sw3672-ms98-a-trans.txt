                 well would you like to go first or shall i   well as a science teacher i been encouraging recycling for a long time and uh we collect things at school such as foil   we have different communities   and cans and glass to a certain extent uh i coach an OM team and we save everything the kids at school bring some things in but not as much as id like and i have recyclings bins at home   uhhuh   and weve had a uh we save foil which i think a lot of people dont realize they could sell along with the aluminum i mean aluminum cans   i think its true yeah and and there are some areas where i believe they limit it they want you to just strictly go with the cans because of the different content but i think youre right the more often you can   well Reynolds aluminum has this big balls of foil competition thing going and i dont know where were supposed to turn it in another science teacher at school is in charge of that and got all the materials on it but were saving foil and accumulating balls of foil in our room   thats great       do you have um  curbside pickup in your community as well   not yet it it is in some communities but it isnt here and it is experimental in some areas at this point theyre trying it out and deciding what what theyre gonna do with it   umhum we just started it this year and its really nice to be able to have that convenience as opposed to having to go to a local dump and you know take your recyclables i know that i am much more motivated  when i know that theyll come pick it up because there can be so much that you load in your car as to as to when i had to get   thats true my husband gets irritated sometimes because of the even though i bought recycling bins   umhum   and we keep our cans in one thing and glass in another and paper in another it once it gets full getting it loaded into the car and taking it is a pain   um umhum oh it is and its dirty and   yeah and uh sometimes you go to those recycling places and like with cans often times theres a long line uh you know if its one of those where you get change for your cans   uhhuh uhhuh   now if its just a donation type of thing like at the library or some places like that sometimes peoplell just dump their stuff at right at the front they dont go to the back of the   oh   like if its a truck or whatever for paper   yeah   and then everythings just starts getting piled outside which is a pain because thats not whats supposed to be happening   right it seems like it would be better all the way around if there were more curbside recycling   i think so too i i am uh in hopes that that will be successful and that they will decide to go ahead and and spread it to our neighborhood as well      the one thing that they dont recycle uh pick up they actually dont care if we mix together the aluminum and the bottles we put those all in one big bag and then put the paper goods separately but the one thing they dont pick up are the plastic goods you know um those big milk tubs and that constitutes a big portion of our trash so i would hope at some point those things would either   umhum thats true   stop being manufactured or that that they would be able to figure out a way to recycle those economically   some of them are recyclable and i started trying to save those but we couldnt find a place to dump them   right yes   and so we just had to throw them away um   they say on the cans or on the not the cans but the um the containers in fact that they are recyclable but ive im the same with you i havent been able to at least not convenience probably outside the city limits or something   well i think i was talking to someone who lives really almost on the other side of town said she knew of one place where you could go and so once a month they made this trek with all their recyclables but they also have a pickup uh and and they would take everything but that is it used to be such a pain and its so far away from us and thats the only one she knew of   umhum   you have to be motivated to do that when youre that far away after a point   so i i guess what weve decided is that were doing our part by recycling three and going out of our area way but to have to go clear across town for plastic because   yeah well the fact that youre doing it at school with the with the kids is a great idea too because then theyre also encouraged to learn about how to do that   and theres a a little booklet called uh Fifty Things Fifty Ways You Can Save The Earth have you read that   oh uhhuh i like that yes uhhuh   yes well i read some of those to the kids from time to time so that they get some of the ideas uh from that but they are a lot more into recycling than they used to be um     umhum the children   the the children uhhuh because i teach middle school   oh is that the kids that you teach uhhuh   and its uh surprising some of them arent but that probably goes right into their families but there are even groups of parents that are Recycling Coalition type deal where theyre really making speeches to the PTA and the Dads Club and everything trying to get more parents involved   um umhum   so its um   thats great   it its on its way if we could get more support through the public utilities   umhum and i think when the government the local or the the state government attends to support it the more happens i know that in our hospital i work in a hospital im a therapist and just about three years ago when we started recycling everything um they not only recognized that they could save money with all
