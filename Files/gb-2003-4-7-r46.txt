                    Background        Since the seed and soil hypothesis of Paget in the        th century     it has been understood that the        microenvironment or soil surrounding the tumor seed        plays a critical part in its development However        investigations into the molecular biology of cancers are        often carried out on cells grown         in vitro in culture where the        environment is unlike that of the         in vivo tissue environment in which        cancers naturally develop The effects of these        environmental differences on cancer cells may account in        part for the fact that only a small percentage of        anticancer drugs that are found to effectively kill cells         in vitro are successful in subsequent        animal and human studies In this study we explored the        changes that occur at the transcriptome level as cells        grown         in vitro are transplanted into an         in vivo environment where they        develop as a tumor The         in vivo environment represented here        is that of the subcutaneous intrascapular region of the        nude mouse Two different cell lines were studied A        derived from human lung adenocarcinoma and U derived        from human brain glioblastoma Our study examined the        differences in global gene expression between A mouse        xenograft tumors and A cell cultures and between U        xenograft tumors grown in the same location as the A        tumors and U cultures We looked for         in vivo versus         in vitro differences that were common        to the two cell lines and for differences that were found        in one cell line but not the other        In modeling mechanisms of cancer development global        geneexpression profiling of humanderived cells grown as        tumors in mice has some distinct advantages over profiling        of tumors obtained from patients Whereas a great deal of        genetic variability exists among different tumors from        different patients lesser genetic heterogeneity would be        expected in xenografts of cancer cells originally derived        from a single patient Furthermore patientderived tumors        are composed of both cancer and noncancer cells making it        difficult to precisely ascertain geneexpression patterns        specifically attributable to cancer cells For example in        many cancer microarray studies the actual percentage of        cancer cells in a profiled sample may be as low as             Even when using techniques such as laser capture        microdissection which can improve tumor purity     the        relative contribution of cancer cells and noncancer cells        to the overall geneexpression profile remains uncertain        In contrast profiling human genes expressed in a mouse        xenograft using a human microarray chip might uncover genes        specifically expressed in human cancer cells in xenograft        tumors comprised of a mixture of human and mousederived        cells            The data obtained in a microarray experiment can be        overwhelming and the challenge is to understand on a        global systems level the biology behind the differences in        expression observed in hundreds of genes In this study we        have searched for significantly enriched classes of genes        among all differentially expressed genes These are classes        or functional categories of genes that appear        overrepresented in the set of differentially expressed        genes As a result valuable clues could emerge as to the        dominant biological features or processes that might        underlie the coordinate expression of these genes Such        clues could be especially convincing if it can be shown        that the enriched classes are unlikely to represent a        chance occurrence Gene classes can be defined by common        gene annotations or concepts from the biomedical        literature                    Results                  Global differences in gene expression between          xenograft tumors and cell cultures          A and U cells were each transplanted          subcutaneously into the intrascapular region of          immunodeficient mice within which sizable tumors          developed after  days Global mRNA expression profiles          from these tumors using Affymetrix HuGeneFL chips were          compared with profiles obtained from the cell lines as          grown in culture Between the A xenograft tumors and

genes with highest expression in tumors compared with          cultures for each of the cell lines          From histological analysis the amount of mouse tissue          in a xenograft tumor was estimated between  and  To          determine the extent of hybridization with the human          HuGeneFL chip that might be attributable to mouse RNA a          sample of mouse lung tissue was also profiled Whereas          the total amount of hybridization measured in the          xenograft tumor profiles was comparable to that of the          culture profiles with equal amounts of RNA the total          hybridization measured in the mouse control profile was          found to be about onefifth that of a xenograft profile          with the same amount of RNA As the control profile was          from a sample of  mouse tissue the contribution of          mouse genes to differences observed in gene expression          between cell cultures and tumors was considered to be          minimal From a comparison of the individual probeset          intensities of the mouse lung profile with those of the          culture profiles and assuming a  contribution of          mouse tissue to the human xenograft sample we estimate          that in only about  out of the  probe sets on the          HuGeneFL chip a number on the level of measurement noise          in a microarray experiment would the amount of          hybridization from mouse tissue alone have been high          enough to account for greater than twofold changes          between cell cultures and tumors In contrast nearly           probe sets showed a greater than twofold increase on          average from A culture profiles to A xenograft          tumor profiles It can therefore be concluded that in          all but a handful of genes the numerous significant          changes observed in gene expression in the xenograft          tumors are due to the cancerous human cells and not the          surrounding mouse host tissue          Principal components were extracted from the cell          culture and xenograft expression data using all           probe sets considered in the analysis The first          principal component captures the greatest fraction of the          overall variance in gene expression the second captures          the greatest fraction of variance subject to being          independent of the first and so on From the first two          principal components a pair of coordinates was          determined for each xenograft and cell culture profile to          construct a twodimensional view that reflects the          relative locations of the profiles in the          higherdimensional space On the same twodimensional          view we plotted one dataset of  profiles from lung          adenocarcinomas and another dataset of  profiles from          glioblastomas and astrocytomas generated from previous          global geneexpression studies      Figure shows          this principal components analysis PCA plot of the          geneexpression profiles from cell cultures xenografts          and human lung and brain tumors Although none of the          human tumor profiles was used to define the principal          components coordinate space lung tumor profiles appear          well separated on the plot from brain tumor profiles          A profiles both xenograft and culture are grouped          with lung tumors rather than brain tumors and U          profiles with brain tumors rather than lung tumors Of          the  genes found expressed more highly in A          xenograft tumors over A cultures            p   fold change             were also higher in stage I adenocarcinomas over A          cultures            p   Of the  genes          upregulated in U xenograft tumors over cultures           were also higher in highgrade glioblastomas over U          cultures            p                            Overrepresentation of genes

for the most enriched          classes appeared highly significant compared to what          would be expected based on simulation results in a          randomly selected set of the same number of genes For          example for the A set of  genes  enriched          LocusLink annotation terms were found that had a           p value less than E where          one term with a           p value less than E would be          expected in a given set of  randomly selected genes          Out of  simulation tests no single test had more than          eight terms with a           p value less than E Table          shows the top gene classes found in both the A set          and the U set with           p values less than  There are          far more gene classes common to both gene sets with

in cell          culture compared with tumors are highly indicative of          processes of cell division and metabolism with          significant MeSH term classes for the two gene sets          including Cell cycle  genes for A  genes for          U DNA replication  Mitosis           Mitochondria  and Cyclindependent kinases           and significant GO terms including Cell

more highly            p   fold change   in          both A and U cell cultures over tumors and the          significant classes found were the same or of the same          nature as the classes

significantly enriched GO and MeSH term classes for the          set of  genes with significantly higher expression            p   fold change   in          the A tumors over the A cell cultures and the set          of  genes upregulated in the U tumors over the U          cell cultures Again in each case the           p values for the most enriched          classes found were quite significant over what would be          expected by chance For example for the A set of           genes  enriched MeSH terms were found that had a           p value less than E where one          term would be expected to have           p less than E in a set of           randomly selected genes out of  simulation tests no          single test had more than six terms with a           p value less than E

classes were found in common          between the  genes upregulated in U tumors and the           genes upregulated in A tumors over cultures            p   fold change            only  upregulated genes were shared between the two          gene sets At a significance level of   genes were          shared between the  genes upregulated in U tumors          and the  genes upregulated in A tumors over          cultures whereas  would be expected if the two gene          sets were independent of each other By comparison           genes over four times the  expected by chance were          common to the  genes upregulated in A cultures and          the  genes upregulated in U cultures over tumors            p   fold change            Whereas processes of cell division and metabolism may be          more in common from one cancer to the next processes of          cell adhesion and ECM interaction are likely to be very          different between different cell types These          observations gave rise to the hypothesis that when          placed in comparable tissue environments cancer cells          from different lineages may express different cell          adhesion and ECMrelated genes          To test our hypothesis that A cells and U cells          each express a restricted set of ECMrelated genes in          tumors we built a classifier for distinguishing between          A and U cellculture profiles We used as the          training dataset the A and U tumor profiles with          the expression values for the  genes that had both an          association in the literature with the MeSH term          Extracellular matrix proteins and were significantly          upregulated            p   fold change            either in A xenograft tumors over cultures or in U          tumors over cultures We then tested the classifier on          the six profiles from A and U cell cultures The          classifier distinguished perfectly between A and U          profiles which indicates that the expression pattern of          ECMrelated genes upregulated in the A tumors is more          similar to the expression pattern of the same genes in          the A cell cultures than it is to the expression of          these genes in the U cell cultures and vice versa We          built three other similar classifiers one used the          expression values of the  genes that are significantly          higher in either A or U tumors and had an          association with the MeSH term Cell adhesion the          second used the values for  genes associated with Cell          differentiation and the third used the expression          values of all  genes higher in A or U tumors          with           p less than  and fold change          greater than two All three classifiers correctly          distinguished between A and U cell cultures Figure          shows a cluster diagram of the expression signatures of          the  cell adhesionrelated genes across all profiles          showing most of the genes as appearing more highly          expressed in either the A tumors or the U tumors          but not in both                            Discussion        Cells grown in culture have unlimited access to        nutrients under conditions most favorable for growth and        proliferation and little exposure to extrinsic factors such        as cytokines that modulate growth and differentiation In        contrast cells in a tumor growing in a host tissue        environment face conditions with more limited nutrients and        oxygen and are subjected to or benefit from a wide variety        of host factors The ability of cancer cells to proliferate        within a tissue depends on their response to adhesive and        growth factor cues within the ECM     and        selfsufficiency in growth signals is one of the hallmarks        of cancer     To stimulate their own growth and        proliferation in tissue tumor cells can overproduce and        release their own growth factors or obtain them from the        matrix as they are released by matrix metalloproteinases            The endothelial vasculature grows into the tumor and        provides nutrients and oxygen     This model is        illustrated by the experimental results presented here as        both A lung and U brain cell lines are observed        to upregulate one set of genetic programs related to cell        growth and proliferation when in culture and another set        related to cell adhesion the extracellular matrix growth        substances and neovascularization when developing as an         in vivo tumor        In terms of new biological insight into cancer        development our findings suggest that cancer cells of        different origins interact in different ways with the same        extracellular environment to survive and proliferate as        tumors These lineagespecific genetic programs for cell        adhesion and ECM interaction although less active in cell        culture are not lost but may be reactivated when cells        are transplanted back into an         in vivo environment even if the new        environment is different from the tissue of origin of the        cancer This conclusion is based on the significant        representation of genes associated with cell adhesion and        the ECM in both the A and the U xenograft tumors        However the genes in each case represent two very distinct        sets the set in the U tumors being more similar in        their expression pattern to that of the U cell cultures        than to the A cultures and vice versa        Although tumors are known to express high levels of        genes involved in cell adhesion and the ECM as we observed        in the xenografts assessment of the specific contribution        of cancer cells to the increased expression may be        difficult In the case of human tumor xenografts in a mouse        host however it can be determined conclusively that        expression of cell adhesion and ECM genes is upregulated in        the cancerous cells in the tumor tissue This conclusion is        based on the following two observations First profiling        mouse tissue alone using probe sets designed for human        genes gives poor hybridization to the extent that the        contribution from mouse genes would not have been enough to        account for the differences in gene expression observed        Second different cell adhesion and ECMrelated genes are        upregulated in tumors of different cell types A versus        U if the upregulation were due to a common mouse        source then the same genes should have appeared        upregulated in both cell types given that the cells were        grown in the same site        The findings presented here suggesting that different        ECM signaling pathways are active in different cancers        could have important clinical implications as knowledge of        the specific pathways dysregulated in a particular cancer        may be valuable for devising effective therapy that targets        those pathways As candidates for further investigation we        have identified genes that appear upregulated in certain        cancers         in vivo compared to         in vitro and that belong to distinct        functional classes related to tumor progression Also of        interest are genes that are upregulated in both the        cancers including         IGFBP insulinlike growth factor        binding protein  which interestingly is thought to        have proapoptotic activities     and         GSN gelsolin which has a role in        cellular motility and acts as both a regulator and effector        of apoptosis     Further xenograft studies of the type        presented here could examine the responses of the host        tissue to the tumor using a mouse microarray chip as        well as temporal changes in gene expression within the        developing tumor                    Materials and methods                  Cell lines and tumors          Both the A lung adenocarcinoma cell line and the          U brain glioblastoma cell line were cultured at C          in a  CO            humidified incubator in DMEM          supplemented with  fetal calf serum  Uml          penicillin and  Uml streptomycin The cells were          passaged weekly upon reaching confluence We produced          tumors in immunodeficient SCID CB mice by inoculating             cells either A or U subcutaneously per          mouse in the intrascapular region Tumors greater than           mm in diameter range   mm were observed within           days in all the mice inoculated The tumors were          harvested under sterile conditions and trimmed of adipose          and connective tissue Total RNA was prepared from tumor          tissue                          Geneexpression profiling          Three A xenograft tumors obtained from different          mice three U tumors from different mice three A          cellculture samples and three U culture samples were          each profiled using HuGeneFL microarray chips          Affymetrix Santa Clara CA which consist of           probe sets each representing an mRNA transcript To          assess the amount of hybridization with the HuGeneFL chip          designed for human mRNAs that could be attributable to          mouse mRNA in a xenograft tumor sample a sample of mouse          lung tissue was also profiled Preparation of mRNA          hybridization of the arrays and computation of probeset          intensities were as previously described                The exogenous probe set controls on the HuGeneFL chip          probe sets that give constant hybridization from sample          to sample were used to determine scaling factors for          comparing the mouse lung profile with the xenograft and          culture profiles For each probe set we computed the          fold changes for human cellline cultures U and A          with  mouse lung compared to the pure cell line using          the expression   human    mousehuman

differences in          mean gene mRNA expression levels between groups of          samples we used both a           p value less than  using the          twosample           t test and a fold change greater          than two either way Probeset intensities less than           were set to  Permutation testing was used to assess          the number of genes that could be considered significant          for any arbitrary separation of the profiles into two          groups Hierarchical clustering using the Eisen software               was applied using the average linkage method          as an aid to visualizing geneexpression patterns of          interest Global views of the variation in gene          expression among cell specimens were obtained using PCA                                       Significantly enriched classes within gene          sets          For a given set of genes showing significant          differences in expression between comparison groups a          search was made within the set for significantly          enriched functional classes of genes as described          previously     For the entire set of genes profiled          on the HuGeneFL chip each gene was grouped into one or          more classes as defined by one of the following criteria          a common Gene Ontology GO annotation term where on the          order of  terms were considered     and a          common MeSH literature term    association as defined          below GO term gene assignments related to categories of          biological process or molecular function were          obtained from LocusLink     and the GO term          hierarchy was obtained from the Gene Ontology Consortium              For each GO term assigned to a given gene in          LocusLink we also assigned all hierarchical parent terms          of the term to the gene          For each gene profiled in the study the summaries of          the  most recent articles that mention the gene by any          one of its common aliases in the article abstract were          downloaded from the web using the Entrez utilities          described at     An association was then made          between the gene and any MeSH index terms included within          those summaries To reduce search time and spurious or          uninteresting results before searching for common MeSH          term associations we first reviewed the MeSH terms          downloaded for the entire set of genes profiled We          removed from further consideration any MeSH term that          appeared to have no relevance to our study for example          MeSH terms describing experimental protocols or the          healthcare system MeSH terms that were associated with          fewer than  genes were also discarded leaving some           MeSH terms that were considered in the analysis          Similarly GO gene classes that applied to less than four          of the genes under study were not considered          For a given set of           k significant genes two separate          searches were made for enriched GO term classes and MeSH          term classes For a given gene class common to           n genes within the           k set where the class applied to a          total of           A genes out of the entire set of           G unique genes under study the          probability           p  for the term occurring           n or more times within a set of           k genes randomly selected from the          chip was calculated using the onesided Fishers exact          test As multiple gene classes were tested for our set of          genes of interest the true significance of a low           p value for an enriched class was          estimated using  separate Monte Carlo simulation          tests For each test           k genes were first randomly          selected from the set of           G genes and           p values for the classes occurring          within the           k set of genes were then          calculated For a           p value for a given class found in          the original           k set of genes we calculated the          number of classes that could be expected to have a           p value as low or lower in a set          of           k randomly selected genes based on          the simulation results For each class found to be          represented in two given sets one with           k genes and the other with           l genes with           p values less than  in both          cases we calculated on the basis of simulation results          the number of classes expected to be found in both a          random           k gene set and a random           l gene set with           p values less than  in both          In this case we carried out  simulation tests in          each of which one set of           k genes and another set of           l genes were each randomly selected          from the entire set of           G genes under study For each gene          class that was found to be represented in both random          gene sets           p values for enrichment were          calculated for each of the two sets                          Classification of cellline lineage based on gene          expression          In order to determine whether the lineage A or          U of a given cell population could be predicted on          the basis of its geneexpression profile we built a          classifier using a training set of profiles with a set of          genes of interest to be used as markers To classify a          test sample as either A or U we computed the          correlation coefficient between the expression values of          the markers in the test sample profile and the same genes          on each of the profiles in the training set using          logtransformed values The class identity of the          majority of the top five training profiles having the          greatest correlation with the test profile was then          assigned to that profile This strategy is known in the          classification literature as fivenearest neighbors with          majority voting                                Additional data files
