                                 Two Cheers for Cond Nasts Acquisition                        Normally when one of three big players in an industry buys one of its twocompetitors you hear rumblings about possible antitrust violations and thedeleterious effects of lack of competition But weve yet to hear any suchrumblingsexcept perhaps from advertisersabout Cond Nasts  millionacquisition of Fairchild Publications even though Cond Nast will now ownevery key fashion magazine in America with the exceptions of HarpersBazaar and Elle  And thats as it should be If anything increasingCond Nasts hold on the fashion press may have beneficial spillover effectsthat no one is really anticipating            To begin with even though after the deal closes Cond Nast will ownWd and Womens Wear Daily  in addition to Vogue andGlamour and assorted other fashiony magazines it wont have a monopolyposition And as the example of the auto industry suggests having two or threemajor players in an industry is qualitatively different from having just oneAs long as Harpers Bazaar and Elle remain outside the foldCond Nast will be limited in its ability to do whatever bad things monopolistsgenerally do            Actually thats the other thing Its hard to figure out what the badthings Cond Nast might do are and its just as hard to figure out who is hurtby this deal hard to figure out whos being hurt that we dont want to behurt that is The pricing of magazines is difficult to decipher it often infact seems irrational but its unlikely that Ws cover price is goingto rise just because its owned by the same company that owns Vogue  Andthis is despite magazine consumers tendency to be somewhat priceinsensitivewhich accounts for the fact that so many magazines are sold at the newsstandeven though the price of one copy there is often equal to the price of four orfive copies bought by subscription So consumers wont be hurt in thepocketbook            As for editorial its possible that the Cond Nast mentalitywhatever thatiswill come to rule the Fairchild magazines but if a year from now youreable to tell the difference between the pre and postCond Nast WsGod bless you That doesnt mean of course that it wont be a new experiencefor the editors of W and Jane to work with James Truman and SiNewhouse but editors dont count as a valid constituency to protest antitrustviolations            The one group that probably will be hurt by the deal is the advertisers butthis is a good thing In a business sense the deal may make all these CondNast magazines less beholden to any single advertiser which in turn will allowthe company to drive harder bargains The flip side of this is that it willmake advertisers think harder about why they advertise and where theyadvertise In other words the acquisition may have the unforeseen effect ofmaking the whole industry more businesslike            More important this deal may make it easier for magazinesof all sortstotake more critical looks at the companies and personalities in the fashionindustry Its an open secret in magazine publishing that there are somestories that just cant be done because running them would result inadvertisings being pulled that magazines cant afford to be pulled But nowCond Nast will be in the position of saying to displeased subjects of toughpieces You want to pull your advertising Fine If you think you can make itwithout W  Womens Wear Daily  Vogue  Glamour etc etc more power to you Shifting the balance of power away fromadvertisers is in that sense entirely a good thing So to take a purelyhypothetical example perhaps we might actually see a serious piece on what RonPerelman head of Revlon has done to many of the companies MarvelEntertainment Coleman Consolidated Cigar Revlon itself hes been in chargeof OK probably not But isnt it pretty to think so
