                              Diacritics Corner            A letter writer once accused The Toronto Globe andMail  Canadas newspaper of record of setting anew record for splitting an infinitive  A frontpage articleended in the phrase Premier Peterson said that in orderto after which the notice SEE P A was inserted andon page A the sentence was indeed completed aspromised balance the budget expectations would haveto be lowered  That is some split            However writing letters to editors to complain aboutsplit infinitives is childs play for the truly obsessed  As aselfconfessed obsessive when it comes to newspaperserrors my own pet peeveone which all the North Americannews services and most of its major news magazinesseem to be guilty ofis leaving diacritical marks off foreignwords  To their credit British news services eg Reutersand publications like the Observer Guardian  andEconomist  are usually quite careful to get it right  Sometimesthese omissions are genuinely trivial  Montreal isquite acceptable Montral would be pretentious exceptperhaps in Canada  But sometimes they are not trivial atall because a diacritical mark can change the pronunciationthe spelling and therefore even the meaning of a word            In general diacritical marks are all those little jotsand tittles that appear over under and even through variousletters  We dont have many in English the only commonone I can think of offhand is the diaeresis as in thetwo dots over nave  where it indicates that two vowelsside by side are not a diphthong but separate distinctvowels  Isral is an example which is not seen much anymore Zare is seen occasionally Hati is common inFrench where it is pronounced as three syllables butthe English standard seems to be Haiti two syllables  TheNew Yorker still insists on coperate             Related to diacritical marks are two constructs theligature  which is a character resulting from tying togethertwo or more standard letters and the digraph  which isa special case of the ligature   The term ligature is usuallyreserved for printers conventions that is where combinationslike fi ffi fl  and ffl are linked together to form asingle character whereas the digraph   while graphicallytying together two characters actually represents twodiphthongs which were common in Latin after the inventionof printing the LatinRomance ae became and oe became   These are almost never seen in theUS today but they are still occasionally encountered inBritish and other varieties of English influenced by Britishpractice although it is usually the unligated form thatone encounters not the digraphsThe most common example used to be US encyclopediavs traditional nonUS encyclopaedia encyclopdia However as even the British spell this word the US waynow the best examples of current USnonUS dichotomiesin the use of the digraphs can be gleaned from the worldof medicine and science as in gyncologygynecologyhmatologyhematology sophagusesophagus strogenestrogen csiumcesium demaedema strusestruspdiatricspediatrics   In Canada one rarely encountersin common usage the British spellings listed but whilethey continue to be widely used by medical professionalseven that practice has come under US influence            Diacritical marks can be broken down into two typesaccents which affect roughly speaking pronunciationonly and umlauts which affect spelling as well as pronunciationAs already mentioned English is relativelysterile when it comes to diacritical marks true gold canbest be struck in foreign fields where the accent graveaccent aigu  and the circonflexe   The two accents are usedin French to change the value of e  which is the most commonvowel in French as in English and which comes inas many varieties as Campbells souphence the need forsome kind of regulation by diacritical marks  The circonflexe on the other hand is really a sign of orthography not pronunciation being a reminder of a dropped sitis usually there for historical reasons but connoting a reasonwhich has long since ceased to make sense and whichmodern French speakers have probably been blithelyunaware of  Thus the French le reminds us that the wordwas once spelled isle  from Latin insula the name of theeight month Aot  reminds us that it came from the Latinaugustus and tre betrays its origins as Latin esse withthe same orthographical scar            French being a Latinderived language is also veryrich in digraphs which are often still retained today inFrance but are dying out in Quebec cur and uvre arecommon examples            German has no pure accents that I can think of otherthan the occasional diaeresis in foreign proper nounssuch as Isral  but it has one very common ligature andof course the umlaut which is much like a digraphinfact these characters are essential to proper spelling andit is for that reason that a dropped umlaut may be seenas an offense  The common ligature in German orthographyis the esszet   and there are three vowels whichcan take the umlaut   and    The esszet pronouncedesstset was formed when medival for US readmedieval humanists got carried away and tried to forceGerman into the GrcoLatin mould of grammar andspelling a disease that spread to the British Isles too            In Greek the sigma that is written in the middle of a word called medial sigma is different from the sigma at theend of a word  called final or terminal sigma  Inmedival Latin the two ss were also differentiated  wasthe medial s and s the terminal s  This convention persisteduntil recently  In microfilms of the  Canadiancensus I have come across names like Agnes who wassometimes noted as being a dresmaker  In German thisdoubles s eventually evolved into   The diphthongsae oe and ue appear so often in German that medivalscribes started writing the e above the first vowel somethinglike this   As they were writing with flatpointedpens which tended to emphasize the vertical strokesespecially in Fraktur the socalled gothie script of oldGerman the little superior e came to be represented bytwo short vertical strokes which then became two squaredots  Then when Germany adopted Latin letters duringthe preWorld War II era they became two round dotsI have always thought that the  was a perky little characterdrawa circle around it and you get that ubiquitousCalifornianism             The convention in English is to transcribe theumlautto restore as it were the lost e Hence theHanseatic port of Lbeck is properly Luebeck in EnglishSimilarly the esszet should be transcribed as ss neveras B which I see often            The Scandinavian languages also have characters similarto the German umlauts besides the  and  SwedishNorwegian and Danish have  a  e as in EnglishNorwegian and Danish also have  o  e and all threeuse a a  a  The rules for transcription are similar tothose for German words AlborgAalborg KbenhavnKoebenhavn of course in this case theres a perfectlyacceptable English equivalent Copenhagen  As an interestingaside German alphabetizes words as if the umlautswere transcribed so Kln would come before Kohl forinstance but the Scandinavian languages treat theirumlauts as transz characters so in Swedish phone booksdlund would come after Zetterstrm            News services that drop umlauts might deserve somesympathy given the isolation of North Americans theassumption is easily made here that the umlaut is an extraneouscharacter that can be droppedas accents in Frenchoften are when French words are transcribed into Englishwithoutdoing bodily harm to the word in questionHowever dropping umlauts is less forgivable than droppingaccents because accents describe pronunciationand anyone who is familiar with the word will know howit is supposed to be pronounced regardless of the accentIf you have heard the name of Canadas prime ministerJean Chrtien pronounced correctly or if you are sufficientlyacquainted with French to know this fairly commonname which means Christian you do not need toknow that an acute accent is usually put over an e to indicatethat it is a long e in an unstressed syllable  Henceits omission will probably not stop you from pronouncingChrtien correctly that is with the emphasis on the secondsyllable            Umlauts are not simply accents however they arefundamental to the spelling of a word and should alwaysbe transcribed as aeoeue or aa in the case of the Scandinaviana in character sets that do not provide umlautsIn any case many German and Scandinavian place nameshave English equivalents Munich for MnchenCologne for Kln the aforementioned Copenhagenfor Kbenhavn Gothenburg for Gteborg and so onHowever I recently read an Associated Press account ofa neoNazi demonstration in a place called NurnbergThe problem here is that this is neither fish nor fowl  Itis not the correct English name for this city which isNuremberg and it is not the correct German name whichis Nrnberg or Nuernberg  One strongly suspects thatthe writer simply did not know the English name forNrnberg  Yet more confirming evidence to the pessimistsamongst us who lament the deterioriation of standardsby the users

for granted that English affectsFrench  One hears expressions like le snack bar chequerinstead of verifier  and un towing a tow truck  In thebusiness world one encounters a myriad of Anglicismslike meeting cash flow downsize  and business itselfThe presence of these borrowings make some Quebecoisfeel that their language is under threat  More and morehowever the flow is not unidirectional most

the syndicate union agreementMonsieur Gendron wrote back saying that he hadrequested a subvention grant in the annex appendixto his planification policy budget to the confessionaldenominational school board in order that formationmodalities training methods could be created tomake teachers more dynamic animators group leaders                        Although terms like collaboration rendezvous  andannex might be used in nonQuebec English contextsthey read like inappropriate choices from a synonym dictionaryand cooperation meeting  and appendix seemmore natural            The trend towards the Gallicization of English inQuebec coincides with the introduction of proFrenchlegislation around twenty years ago and the use of Frenchhas gained in prestige as a result making it more likely forGallic loanwords to appear in English  Anglophones arespeaking French to a greater extent at home and at workcreating a situation in which the French term becomes morefamiliar than the English  Thus an Anglophone might usethe word demand when he means ask reparations whenhe means repairs and remark when he means noticebecause he is constantly employing demander rparations and remarquer when speaking French            These faux amis false friends as they are calledare confused both by Anglophones speaking French andFrancophones speaking English  They are also amongmany of the words likely to have their meanings changedin Quebec English  For example rsumer does not meanto resume but as Americans know from their adoptionof rsum for curriculum vitae to summarize and decevoirmeans to disappoint not to deceive  Not many Anglophonesin Quebec today use resume and deceive in theFrench sense but over time I suspect that such usageswill increase            It is often hard to know where English and Frenchbegin and end  Franglais includes such classics as hotdogsteam all dressed  and a rock music review which declaredthat a groups appeal was to male white trash de vieillesouche  Vieille souche is a term that refers to old stockQuebecers            To those who bemoan the loss of the chastity of theFrench language all I can say is that the lady never wasa virgin French is essentially mutated Latin corrupted byArabic Gaulish and Germanic to name a few of theseducers  Even the name of the country France  owes itsname as does England  to a Germanic tribe  Languagepurity is a myth  The reality is that English and Frenchhave been borrowing from one another since at least Ironically some of the dreaded Anglicisms like rosbifand club  were originally Gallicisms that had penetratedEnglish in the th century                              The King of Wordsmiths            John Updike remarked that language has bloomedfrom the infinite fumblings of anonymous men  Wemeddle

                     Dharuk Words In English            When the first European settlers arrived in Australiain  there were approximately  separate languagesspoken by the indigenous peoples  During the  yearsof European occupation these have declined in use to thepoint where not more than about twenty are active in thesense that they are being learnt by Aboriginal children andcover aspects of the everyday life experienced by thosechildren            These active languages tend to be those spoken inthe north and the west of Australia in those parts of thecountry where the Aborigines have been most able toretain their traditional way of life  The first languages thatthe Europeans encountered those once spoken on the eastcoast of Australia survive only as they were recorded bythe settlers and have been reconstructed in the light oflater acquired knowledge of the family of Aboriginal languagesas a whole  Paradoxically it is these languages thathave contributed most to the lexicon of Australian EnglishNot more than about  words have been borrowedaltogether and yet of these some  come from Dharukthe language which was spoken on the site now occupiedby the city of Sydney and not much beyond it whichexisted in an inland and a coastal dialect            Although there are still a few Dharuk descendantsin the vicinity of Sydney and these may still use a handfulof Dharuk words Dharuk effectively ceased to functionas a language by the midth century            What then survives  Names of flora and fauna namesof implements especially weapons a few miscellaneousnames of dwellings ceremonies people identified by sexor activity striking features of the environment and ahandful of pidgin terms suggestive of an only rudimentarycommunicative exchange            The flora and fauna are characterised by their distinctivenessThe Great South Land was to prove extraordinarilyrich in new species some of which like thekangaroo had an irresistible novelty about them at thesame time they were as numerous as sheep in Englandand as useful to man  The wallaby and the wallaroo werelike the kangaroo large marsupials which the Aborigineshunted the koala was also a marsupial but arboreal in habitand sufficiently unique in appearance to have had thesettlers liken it to a bear a sloth or a monkey in their namingof it the wombat was a heavy thickset marsupialsometimes known as a badger because of its burrowinghabit  The only animal immediately recognisable to Europeaneyes was the native dog or dingo  and the distinctionwas early made between the domesticated dog ordingo  and the wild dog or warrigal   Two of the small numberof birds identified were the boobook  an omnipresentowl and the currawong  a large crowlike bird whosecuriosity would have brought it to notice  The name of agood eating fish the wollami or snapper on which the earlysettlers were frequently dependent was again an understandableborrowing            When it came to plants the same sort of criteriawere observed the waratah a strikingly beautiful redflower which has become the floral emblem of New SouthWales was soon identified as were the burrawang  apalmlike plant very common in the coastal forests and thekurrajong  a plant that yields a useful fibre            The name of the dance ceremony corroboree  probablythe most immediately observable characteristic ofpeoples regarded as savages which had both a religiousand an informal social form was readily adopted as waskoradji a wise elder or as he was often described awitch doctor

the first group of convictladen ships wasknown that of Lieut  William Dawes is the most ambitiousattempting a grammar of Dharuk as well as a vocabularyBut such a resource is more an indication of whatwas available to the settlers than a record of what theyactually used  For that we must turn to their accounts oflife in the colony and to the words which they adoptedwhich they use more or less unselfconsciously as part oftheir language as colonists            And here there are three observations to be madeFirst the words used by the Aborigines were seldom asattractive to the colonists as descriptive English namesthat emphasised the perceived resemblance between thenew and the known and familiar and so made for morecertain communication  Thus distinguishing epithets likecolonial native wild black brown green  and gray qualifynames of common Old World species like apple ashoak  and pine to build a considerable and understandablevocabulary  Second a positive effort needed to be madeto ascertain the Aboriginal name and experience showedthat the geographical range of Dharuk was extremelylimited the fact that a new set of names came into useas one crossed the boundary of another Aboriginal languagemust have mitigated against borrowing  Third theAborigines were widely thought of as backward anduncivilised and while this attitude persisted their nomenclaturecarried no great

preponderanceof nouns and verbs with an accompanyingheavy reliance on conversion are obvious and enduringThe vocabulary like the grammar is determined to a largeextent by the medium of computers and the operation ofnetworking  But their insistence on speed is not entirelythe message  Nor would it be correct simply to draw comparisonswith newspeak or some other centrally decreedand regulated

contribution to comparative linguisticswas made by Sir William Jones  aBritish linguist trained in the law who was appointedjudge of the supreme court of judicature at Calcutta in  Convinced of the importance of consulting Hindulegal authorities in the original  Encyc Brit   a Jones well versed in Sanskrit became aware ofthe correspondences among Sanskrit Greek Latin Slavicand Germanic forms which led him to the conclusion thatSanskrit was another older form of a parent languagefrom which all had sprung  It was his work that formedthe basis of the linguistic studies later carried on by thebrothers Grimm Jakob Ludwig Karl  WilhelmKarl  which in turn gave foundationto the development of the comparative method  The termIndoEuropean cropped up first at the beginning of theth century as much of the work was being done inGermany it is not surprising that the term preferredthere was IndoGermanic  actually a translation of indogermanischwith a small i because it is an adjective whicharose in the late s the latter survives in the literaturelargely replaced by the former especially since thediscovery that Celtic is a member of the family            The reason for bringing up this bit of history is to introducefour terms with which some readers may be unfamiliarand which reflect to some small degree the poetrythat once lurked in the hearts of linguists educated in literatureas well as linguistics            The first is karmadharya  a Sanskrit compound ofkarma fate destiny  dharya holding bearing whichis used to describe a compound word in which the firstmember describes the second as in highway blackbird adj  n steamboat bonehead fingerstall fingernailtoenail attrib n  n            The second is dvandva  a Sanskrit redundant compoundof dva  dva pair couple which is used to describecompounds in which the elements are linked as if joinedby a copula as in princeconsort attorneygeneral postmastergeneraln  n bittersweet adj  adj            The third is bahuvrihi  a Sanskrit compound meaninghaving much ricebah much  vrhiacute rice  It isused to describe compounds composed of an adjective anda substantive so as to form principally a possessive adjectivelike bahuvrihi itself it also forms a compound thatis different grammatically from its head member andparticularly plurals that function as singular nouns as inlazybones slyboots   Other examples are rosyfingeredredcoat highpotency vitamin  and indeed all suchcompounds that might be spelled as two words in predicativeposition but are usually written with a hyphenwhen in attributive position            The fourth is tatpurusha literally his servant whichis used to describe compounds in which the first elementqualifies or determines the second while the secondretains its grammatical independence as a noun adjectiveor participle  For example bookcase yearbook summerhousewindowbox eyedoctor hairraisingfingerlicking Godfearing maneating nosepickerbottomfeeder dive bomber fighter escort             Whether the compound is written conventionally astwo words as a hypheme or solid has no bearing on itsanalysis  These are not the only possibilities for compoundingin

Appropriate Adjectives            It must be emphasized that this is not a synonymdictionary rather it is just what its title denotes a dictionaryof adjectives that are appropriately connected withthe nouns that are listed  In a more technical sense it isa collection of collocative adjectives that is adjectivesthat are often associated with the nouns that are listedFor example here is the listing under one of the nounsappetite appetites mighty enormous gargantuanendless limitless unlimited unfailinguncontrollable lusty voracious ravenousin satiable sharp ferocious rapacious devouringbrutish wolfish healthy hearty greedy keenrobust inordinate substantial unbridled avariciouspoor grotesque morbid morose raucous finickydiscriminating im moderate shrunk newfoundcatholic postprandial                        Not all these adjectives seem appropriate to me it is hardfor me to envision a context in which satiable appetiteraucous appetite shrunk appetite or postprandialappetite might be appropriate on the other hand I likemany readers could probably come up with several otheradjectives that are not listed  Without going into detail oneach one of these the difficulty I see is for instance withraucous appetite  for raucous means harsh strident gratingand is commonly associated with voice  where indeedit is listed  As shrunk is a past and past participle of shrinkand not properly an adjective I am not sure why it is therein place of shrunken  especially since Mikhail specificallywrites in his Preface Only words listed in standard languagedictionaries as adjectives are included in this DictionaryThus all other etymological forms as participlesending in  ed rejected offer or  ing playing child areexcluded  As for postprandial  that is usually applied tosomething edible or drinkable as referring to somethingthat comes after a meal in my language and culture postprandialappetite would be a rare collocution            Everyone has his own private view of how languageworks an observation seldom offered by linguists eventhose who touch on the subject of idiolect  That this bookis highly personal becomes evident in the entry immediatelyfollowing that for appetite               appetizer appetizers See also food intriguing exquisiteirresistible tasty cheesy spicy tangy                        Here one might yearn for some punctuation surelythe last four words cannot be considered alongside thefirst three  Moreover I can think of dozens of other wordsin the tasty tangy class that could be added but thoseappear in the very long entry under food             In principle I like the idea of such a book and havethought about doing one myself  But the almost insurmountablepractical considerations reared up before meand I quickly abandoned the idea  For one thing entriesbecome less useful the longer they are  In the present workfor example the entry for appetite runs to eleven lineswhich is reasonably assimilable the entry for approachapproaches however runs to thirtynine lines life livesto fiftyeight eye eyes to sixtyeight  Are users really sodesperate for descriptive adjectives that will go with nounsas to be willing to wade through almost two hundredterms  I rather doubt it  Then there is the question Whyare both singular and plural forms shown for the headwordsAlthough mention is made of the fact in the Prefaceno reason is given and one might assume that usersof such a book would have no difficulty in assuming thatthe plural of breadwinner is breadwinners  even that thesingular of teeth is tooth             A chief criticism of this book in particular is that theadjectives are jumbled together in no discernible orderor as mentioned with punctuation between except for aserial comma  Thus under architecture we find strings likeunoriginal eccentric plain austere mediocrenondescriptcivic religious pastel mosaic landscapeprehistoric                        and it is not till we get to the end where a dozen stylesare listed

theirextending to the notion that speakers of British Englishregard almond as a color for eyes rather than a shape            This collection could have been made more usefuland more usable had the

becausethey establish a rapport with generations of users  It goeswithout saying that most of those drawn to lexicographylike those attracted to art schools exhibit skills more likelyto be associated with craft than with art these days fartoo few of those who work on dictionaries have a thoroughgrounding in literature let alone the various specialtieswithin linguisticsgeneral and comparative studiesclassical and modern foreign language study phoneticsphilology etymology to say nothing of lexicology and lexicographyThe results are seen on the bookshelves ofbookshops throughout the world

solving it  This book which consistsof a series of chapters and subchapters was writtenby a committee which immediately tells the reader somethingabout its likely consistency and continuity            It is true that the principles that apply to specializeddictionaries are not the same as those that apply to generaldictionaries either monolingual or bilingual  For onething the user of a specialized dictionary can be assumedto have a level of sophistication that includes knowledgeof and some understanding of what goes on in general dictionariesIt takes the editors of the subject book severalpages to make this point which it seems to me is rathersimple  Their explanation includes Venn diagrams whichnotwithstanding their utility I thought had gone out offashion a few decades ago and other devices  It is hardto imagine that this book would be picked up by anyonebut a lexicographer or someone interested enough inbecoming one to subject himself to such a turgid presentationin the event one might assume a certain levelof familiarity with the subject  Yet the treatment is reminiscentof Washington Irvings Knickerbocker History ofNew York  whichfacetiously at leaststarts out with thecreation of the world  If one doubts the turgidity of thestyle of this work witness the following which merely saysthat entries in a dictionary can be ordered in different waysThe macrostructure of

familiar to me the work of WilliamBright Professor Emeritus of linguistics at UCLA and erstwhileeditor for twentytwo years of Language  the journalof the Linguistics Society of America is well knownto me chiefly in his latter capacity  In a preceding numberof VERBATIM XXII  appeared a review article byDr William Brashear of the Egyptian Museum in Berlinof two new books dealing with the alphabet now we havethis comprehensive work on writing systems            Interest in writing systems was dormant for manyyears some thirty years ago the onlyand bestknownscholar working with alphabets was Dr David DiringerThe spark that has ignited so many to look at the subjectis difficult to identify perhaps it can be put down to televisionand its many programs dealing with archaeology  Arecent program on the Minoan civilization mentionedthat Michael Ventris was a teenager when he listened toa lecture by Sir Arthur Evans in which he described hisstruggles trying to translate what had become known asLinear A and Linear B the ancient scripts found at Knossosand elsewhere in Crete  Ventris the program heldvowed to be the one who would one day translate thescripts a reflex of ambition rarely associated withteenagers today  In any event Ventris did finally decodeLinear B but died at thirtyfour before arriving at atranslation of Linear A  If susceptible teenagers watchedthat program perhaps they will be inspired to work onLinear A still an enigma owing largely to the paucity ofcorpus            The subject of writing systems was considered beyondthe pale by structural linguists as it was not a reflex ofnatural utterance but a secondary representation  Structurallinguists do not like to deal with meaning either satisfiedthat the meaning of a word is the sum of itscontextsa perfectly valid argument if one allows contextto include ones mother telling an infant Here darlingeat another spoon of applesauce  Unless ostensiveobjects are thus pointed to and identified how could anyoneever learn their names  As a consequence the subjectwas infra dig for serious linguists for many yearsand it is refreshing to see it brought to the surface againThe impact of writing on language cannot be denied inEnglish the conservatism of the spelling system has hadan effect on the preservation of linguistic features thatmight have otherwise faded in all languages the traditionsof literature to say nothing of scripture sic  havea profound influence as the fundamentalist effect bearswitness  To ignore or scorn writing and its influences isstruthious and unscholarly and this

essays fleshed out in full in those instances wherethey might have been cut by the newspaper for economyof space  The essays are brief and interesting and rangethroughout the entire spectrum of the subject includingliterature  There is for example a piece on spoofs inwhich Rose cites several that are well known omits otherslike Poes The Great Balloon Hoax and includesat least one that is a satire which is a different sort of animalGullivers Travels is not to my mind a spoof  I amall in favor of weekly columns on language but one mustbe careful            Rose is now seventysix and evidently going strongThe book is informative and entertaining but the readershould check the validity of some of Roses commentsbefore incorporating it into a doctoral dissertation or otherimportant work  That admonition applies also to the blurbon the back cover which presumably was composed bysomebody at Kangaroo Press but not submitted to Rosefor approval  It refers to His vulgar vocabulary and facilityin slang butmore importantit offers oddities likea reference to learning by rote on page  and to Pidginon page  upon looking both up I found nothingabout rote learning on page  and nothing

Undertaking a description of a language may beregarded as a curious occupation  Writing reviews of themis no less odd an experience  For various reasons I havechosen to comment on only certain aspects of this bookchiefly because a thorough review would occupy far morespace in VERBATIM than many readers might willingly tolerateSuffice it to say that the grammar is Chomskyan andthough a bit thin on the ground is quite adequate  I havefound other things to criticize however that may be moregermane to books in general especially reference booksand particularly to reference books on language            First I want to vent my spleen on publishers bookdesigners who havent the slightest idea of what they aredoing  As one case in point I cite The Random House Dictionaryof the English Language Second Edition  in whichpossibly in order to mimic other dictionaries but probablybecause there are few things that designers can get theirgrubby little fingers into the main entry words were resetin sansserif type presumably just to make them harder toread  Those who are not designers but typographerssteeped in statistics of readability and other scientific applicationsto typography are fully aware that because of theredundancy built into its characters almost any serif fontis more readily legible than any sansserif face and tryingto make a book look modern by using sansserif makesno sense at all  Besides there is nothing modern aboutsansserif type if anything it is moderne that is in thetradition of Art Deco  Turning to the illustrations includingthe blackandwhite maps in the RHDe  it must besaid that the originals were a model of clarity and detailI know for as Managing Editor it was among my responsibilitiesto commission them and to accept or reject completedartwork or to have it modified  That was a laboriousand timeconsuming task amply rewarded by the highquality of the drawings as published in the original editionIn the Second Edition  however the designers took it uponthemselvesmerely for the sake of change I believetolay a fine screen over every illustration except the mapsthus losing much of the finical detail originally producedThe result is a dull grayish blob on the page            As if to confirm that the various afflictions of designershave infected the UK operations of Oxford UniversityPress we are now faced with Greenbaums Grammar which can only be said to have suffered  Worse theirincredibly unimaginative work has resulted in a book thatought to have been about  pages shorter than the presentwork which I shall explain            In his Preface Professor Greenbaum suggests thatthe Grammar can be used as a work of reference  Thestructure of the bookthrough no fault of the authorsI am suremilitates against such use for the Index refersthe user to numbered sections each chapter is numberedfrom  The English Language through  Spelling withsubsections numbered sequentially eg  English Internationallythrough  Good English  A typical questiona user faces is a choice between may and might  so Ilooked up might in the Index and foundmight                            The first problem inherent in the poor design of thebook is that there is no clue in the running heads as towhich chapter and section one has turned to unless hehas chanced on the beginning of a chapter or sectiononly the page number appears  The section titles and numbersfrequently appear at the gutter column making italmost impossible to thumb through the book to find areference quickly  As it happens both the title of subsections and  happen to be in the gutters ofthe pages where they begin making it inconvenient to findthem  Had these numerals been set at the foredge of thepages instead of the page numbers which serve no discernibleuseful purpose finding the proper chapter andsubsection numbers would have been greatly facilitated            The second problem is the unexplained style which should properly be designated  there areonly  chapters so it is confusing to see a referenceapparently to a chapter that is really a reference to a subsectionUnder the Index entry for dictionaries arelisted    but chapter  contains no subsectionsbeyond  clearly a mistake            Third excluding the Appendix and a Glossary thebook contains only  pages and presumably to bulkup its page count probably at the instigation of the publisherso that more money could be charged for it thedesigner has employed a hanging indention of about tenpicas and wide interlinear spaces  The result had thebook been set to full measure is that it would have beenless than  pages long            Fourth relating specifically to the entries looked upwhile may and might are both mentioned except for thefollowing passing remark p  no comment appears  Their past forms are often used to refer to presentor future timeHe might be there nowShe could drive my car tomorrow                        That is not inaccurate but it scarcely tells the full storynor is it particularly helpful in explaining the use of may which is the present of which might is the past in constructionslike She may have said that vs  She might havesaid that   There is no internal cross reference to  Bwhere the notions of Permission and Possibility are givenperemptory coverage though there are six citations andno helpful comment is offered about their interchangeabilityin contemporary usage or what was formerly theirdistinction in formal contexts            Fifth the Glossary pp  concerns itself largelywith the terminology of Chomskyan grammar but thetreatment is unsatisfactory  For instancerhotic accent Nonrhotic accents drop the r when itis followed by a consonant sound as in partThey also drop the r at the end of a word when itcomes before a pause  Rhotic accents retain the r                        It is poor style to find the headword term defined virtuallyas an afterthought  The entry at mass noun is a crossreference See count noun but the definition at countnoun makes no mention of mass noun   Although the definitionfor common noun consists of a cross reference toproper noun  there is no proper definition for it at propernoun  only a contrastive comment from which one is supposedto derive a definition by default  As only Chomskyangrammar is covered in the book entries are lacking forsuch common grammatical conceptsalbeit from otherdisciplines like traditional grammar substantivedependent clause independent clause conjunctive adverbadverbial conjunction misplaced or dangling modifier etcall terms well established in discussions of nonChomskyangrammar  Many of the definitions use termsthat are not themselves defined and are not always transparentlyclear eg postmodify linguistic unit  etc            Some of these shortcomings can be laid at the doorof the author some at the door of the book designer mostin the lap of the editor if there was one            It is undeniable that the wordstock of a language canbe derived from a vast corpus of its writing and speechto produce a dictionary a grammar can be likewise derivedbut such exercises are rare and are usually confined to workon dead languages  Thus Champollion had little enoughto go on to decipher the Rosetta Stone and Ventris wouldhave been hard put to find a native speaker of MinoanLinear B or A  But for modern languages the situationis different  Preparing a monolingual English dictionarylexicographers who are native speakers of English may oftenturn to citations of usage in context to derive or verify sensesof some words but for words whose meanings they alreadyknow they can rely on their own knowledge and use citationsfor confirmation  Relying solely on ones own knowledgecan be dangerouswitness Johnsons definition ofpastern so one must always check and doublecheckbut that is not a difficult matter if citation material isavailable and there are usually other books or specialistsone can consult            Let me say parenthetically that not only is therenothing wrong with looking at others work but that thosewho studiously avoid doing so for any reason are extremelyfoolish how can one know how the competition has handledsomething without checking  Aside from theunavoidable fact that competition is a driving force inthe publication of such works one can scarcely expectto improve on the competitive works without knowingwhat they are up to            Writing a grammar entails many judgements but themost relevant for my purposes here is to wonder aboutthe amount of information brought to the task by thegrammarian  It is highly unlikely that the subject will beapproached with a feigned tabula rasa  relying solely oncitation materials  But the question arises whether thegrammar is constructed from what is known or foundand then verified through the application of suitablecitations whether the grammar is citationdriven ora combination of the two is employed  In any eventthe requirement for an experienced grammarian isundiminished            In principle one must question the function of agrammar  In essence such a work cannot be more or lessthan a description of how a language works  But the questionmust arise in the mind of the publisher if not thegrammarian Who is going to use the book  That is notreadily answered these days  There was a time when studentswere required to study the grammar of the languagebut that day appears to be gone  Today then wemight more logically be looking at a market consisting ofpeople who want a reference grammar that is one inwhich they can find answers to their questions about howthe language works            This raises a question germane to the Oxford EnglishGrammar   Professor Greenbaum has drawn on thehuge resources of a number of different corpora of Englishthat have been gathered at the Survey of EnglishUsage and several other research centers all of whichare listed in an Appendix pp   The sources of thecitations range widely and include telephone conversationsclassroom lessons broadcast interviews parliamentarydebates spontaneous commentaries business transactionsnews broadcasts etc  One could scarcely disagreewith the fact that all of these make up a reasonable crosssectionof what must be categorized as the popular useof language  Throughout the Grammar are interspersedquotations from these sources each carefully documented            That might well provide a reasonably accurate pictureof contemporary language  But is that what a user of theGrammar as a reference grammar might want  One of thebeauties of the Oxford English Dictionary and of say AGrammar of the English Language  by George O Curmeis that users are comforted by quotations from sourcesthat are acknowledged paragons of English usage writerslike Shakespeare Milton Dickens Scott etc even HemingwayAre they likely to be attracted by evidence fromstudents conversations with their flatmates  from recordingsof Christmasdinner family conversations  I couldfind only twenty books that had been mined for citationsand all were published in   I hasten to say thatalthough the Curme Grammar is a VERBATIM Book mypurpose in bringing it up is not to sell books but to contrastits content with that of the subject Grammar             There is still another aspect to the whole business ofcitations  Some thirty years ago I proposed that the mostrelevantly useful attribute of citations was their exposure that is the number of people who on the basis of readershipstatistics could be assumed to be reading andlistening to the manifestations of language presented inbooks newspapers magazines and radio and televisionbroadcasts  Word  XXVI  An Unabridged Word Countof English  The exposure of a word would be expressedas an index number resulting from the normalization ofunwieldily large numbers of readers and listeners andwould be likely to provide some meaningful measure ofthe frequency for a significantly large percentage of thelexicon  Prior to that frequencies had been calculated onthe basis of raw occurrences in a text selected by aresearcher at whim though it must be acknowledged thatthe books at least selected for examination were classicsof literature assumed to be widely read taught andused as models of effective expression if one insists onavoiding the concept of good English            In resorting to sources that might be justifiably viewedas natural language those who concur with ProfessorGreenbaums approach ignore this important aspect ofcitational matter  I am not sure that anyone has attemptedtheir documentation but it is well known that an enormousnumber of clichs idioms metaphors and otherexpressions used in everyday contemporary speech andwriting derive from the writings of Shakespeare and othercontributors to the imagery and poetry of the languageWhile their manifestations undoubtedly appear in thesnatches of telephone and flatmate conversations recordedin the numerous corpora cited in the Appendix to theGrammar  their exposure is virtually asymptotic to zeroIn other words there are some who believe that we mightbe well advised to attend to what Milton Donne DrydenJefferson Franklin Lincoln Byron Shelley KeatsAusten Alcott Dickens and thousands of others havecontributed to the molding of the language in all its reflexesand who find it difficult to understand the usefulness tobe derived from an analysis of idle telephone and flatmateconversations student essays read by no one other thanthe instructor charged with their marking business lettersread by no one other than their individual recipientsnonprinted examination scripts exposed to nobodysocial letters classroom lessons business transactionsbetween for example architect and  clients and solicitorand client and so on  While it is undeniable thatsome of the sourcesnews broadcasts broadcast talkspress news reports for instancecan be said to reach arelatively wide though unquantified readership or audiencethey are in the minority compared with the largenumber of sources that seem to reflect language thatoccurs as they say these days on a oneonone basis            Is that lack of representative material what peoplewant or expect from a grammar  Not I to be sure  Givena choice I should prefer to model my language on thewritings of acknowledged masters and on the speech ofRoosevelts and Churchills rather than on what appears ina student essay  I can make a clinical observation regardingthe diminution of politeness in the language attributableperhaps to the lowering of the standards of civilityand yielding typically constructions like Me and her wentto the park as contrasted with Her and me went to thepark I suppose            I was unable to find any comment by the author justifyingthe use and application of the millionword BritishInternational Corpus of English ICEGB            Also comments regarding standard and nonstandardusage are absent  For example nothing is offered regardingthe poor style of the reflexive pronouns for I or me asin Hong Kong had obviously been very carefully plannedwith Peter and myself in mind p  though why andis italicized in the original is hard to understand  It maybe argued that in a descriptive grammarhow can a grammarbe anything but descriptive  comment about goodand bad English are anathema but weasily little commentscan be inserted as they are in dictionary usage notesreferring to careful speakers educated users theirpeers and others whom users of a grammar might conceivablewish to emulate  Thus rare is the dictionary thatoffers infer as a synonym for imply without some sort oflabel  Even the permissive MerriamWebster III  whileremaining tightlipped about usage condescends to offersee IMPLY at definition  of infer   As those who use inferfor imply might be somehow stigmatized in some educatedcircles failure to report such a usage leaves thesuspicious user of a dictionary or grammar who has thewit to look it up facing a serious lacuna in the informationgiven about the language  Such information is not prescriptiveor proscriptive it is descriptive of certainattitudesright or wrongabout the language and hasits proper place in a dictionary  Comparable grammaticalusages merit mention and appropriate comment            In a subsection called Good English Greenbaummakes a passing reference to the aesthetic use of language but remarks concerning artistic use of languageare notably absent presumably lest they constitutesome sort of value judgment  As we all know the grammarhas been distorted by political correctness eg inavoiding the masculine pronoun as a pronoun of referenceand in a rare opinion the author concedes that constructionslike A Candidate who wishes to enter the Schoolbefore his or her eighteenth birthday may be asked towrite to state his or her reasons can be clumsy            The basic question is To what use can such a bookbe put  There can be no confuting the fact that the grammarof modern Englishthat is the English in use forthe past two centuriesdiffers little from that of earlierstages of the language after all languages are sorted anddistinguished by linguists on the basis of their grammarsnot their lexicons  Thus English is a Germanic languagebecause of the history of its structure or grammar wereits lexicon alone to be considered it might well be classifiedas a Romance language owing to the large percentageof words of French and Latin origin  There isno gainsaying the advantages in having an uptodategrammar of English  Though personally I am not enamoredof Chomskyan grammar despite its occasional departuresfrom traditional terminology nouns and adjectivesare still nouns and adjectives  The chief aim remains a thoroughconsistent coherent preferably understandabledescription of the structure of a language  Indeed someof Greenbaums presentation amounts to a tacit commentaryon and reflects valid criticism of the inconsistenciesfound in traditional grammar  Unfortunately the commentarybeing tacit is a bit too subtle for many of thepeople who are likely to refer to the Grammar             It is with the deepest regret that we announce thesudden death on  May  of our friend ProfessorGreenbaum while on a speaking engagement in Moscow            Laurence Urdang                              The F Word            At first the idea that there can be a single word inEnglish or in any language that merits the creation of apage volumedirectory rather than dictionarydevoted to it exclusively must seem

BeatlesThis caught my eye right away as it is a wellknownfact among Beatles fans that one of the original namesfor the band was The Silver Beatles  This name appearedafter a few changes in lineup of the members and intheir name such as The Quarrymen and Johnny andthe Moondogs            After reading through some Beatles literature itbecomes obvious there are some inconsistencies as tohow the Beatles chose The Silver Beatles after callingthemselves Johnny and the Moondogs though the factremains that they never called themselves The GoldenBeatles  The best explanation for the name Beatles canbe traced directly to the music that influenced LennonMcCartney Harrison and Sutcliffe at the time and totheir music idol Buddy Holly  The music of the earlys in the Liverpool area was often referred to as beatmusic and so modeling themselves after Hollys band theCrickets John who couldnt resist a pun suggestedBeatles as a play on beat music                        Where the Beatles got Silver from is harder totrace  One source claims that silver was an obscurereference to Long John Silver  highlighting Lennons role as band leader  This proves true when recalling otherband names from the early s such as Gerry and thePacemakers Rory Storm and the Hurricanes andDerry and the Seniors all names that point out that onemember was the leader  Other people have dismissed theadjective Silver as merely an addition to give the namesome flash                         The language of the Beatles what they said what theywrote about and first of all what they called themselvesis an important part of Western culture                              Most authorities in these matters cf Darwin OrtizsGambling Scams  p  agree that the broads tossed orfaked in threecard monte XXII item

carrying the Russian word into ModernIsraeli Hebrew was Yiddish  And in Yiddish balaganmeans mess bedlam  Uriel Weinreichs YiddishEnglishDictionary  YIVO New York             It is not unknown I think that meanings changewhen words cross language frontiers and what was a temporarybooth at a Russian fair quite probably a chaoticnoisy affair becomes a mess and a bedlam in Yiddish  Asa lover of Yiddish I hate to see its influence ignored insuch a lengthy etymological review                              Undoubtedly Uriel Weinreich would have offered thesame remark himself as his Languages in Contact made the point many times over  Editor            In his piece The Day They Took the Peck out ofPecksniffian XXIII  Doug Briggs observed Thereis a movement to decriminalize the meanings of wordsthat once described criminal conduct in unmistakableterms  Amen  And I have an additional example of whathe means            I am a child of the s a time when those who wereinvolved in what was then I believe a minuscule drugproblem in the US were called dope fiends  The implicationfor a child or youth quite intentional I am surewas that anybody who took drugs dope was not only tobe avoided but also feared  To this day I carry that reactionto drug users  Today the use of narcotics is commonlyreferred to as doing drugs  a phrase that seems toimply a harmless activity such as doing the samba   Alternativelyone perhaps might be into drugs  as if he weredabbling in one more little pastime whose attraction wouldultimately fade as he got into something else            These locutions would be of little importance I thinkif it were not for the fact that they have been adopted bymost of the news media and the entertainment industryNobody uses dope fiend any more even referring to addictswho regularly overdose  And in that word overdose we haveyet another euphemism dont we as if there were sucha thing as a beneficent normal dose of heroin or crackAs Mr Briggs seems to be saying

Canada replacedits green Queens onedollar note with an elevensidedgoldcoloured coin a schoolyard ditty made the roundsWere tiny were tuneyWe havent got a loonieBecause of Brian Mulroneyand the stupid GST                                       Mulroney rhymes with loonie   Brian Mulroney wasCanadas prime minister at the time  The most unpopularPM in Canadas modem history he introduced theGoods and Services Tax a VATlike national sales taxLoonie is the wellnigh universal Canadian slang term forthe dollar coin  Only the Royal Canadian Mint refers tothe loonie as a dollar coin            Canada almost didnt have a loonie  The originaldesign for the reverse side of the coin featured a voyageurthe same as on the older nickel dollarbut the dies werestolen on the way to the Royal Canadian Mint in Winnipegwhere the first coins were due to be minted  The backupdesign was that of a loonour unofficial national bird  Ahbut that unfortunate name loon as in loony bin  Althoughthe terms loonie  a diminutive noun from loon  and loony an adjective ultimately from lunar are etymologicallydistinct their similarity has encouraged obvious satiricalconnections our economy which is loony has as itsfundamental unit of currency the loonie many felt thatthe policies of Brian Mulroney were loony  In shortthe slang term sprang up immediately and collectively andno one person could ever claim to be the inventor of it            However a twodollar coin is due to be introducedsoon in Canada and the etymological situation here is atotally different story  The Mint as usual is no helptheyrefer to the new coin unimaginatively as the twodollarcoin so the letters columns of every newspaper in thecountry have been filled with speculation and suggestionsfor a slang term for this new coin which is slightly largerthan the loonie goldcoloured and polygonal like theloonie but with a silver centre with a polar bear picturedon it  Once the design was released the name bruin wassuggested by many people but the name that appears tobe winning is doubloonie combining the double looniewith a reference to a traditional coin said to be favouredby piratesagain a nottoosubtle satirical reference tothe appetite for taxation of most governments            I may have the dubious distinction of being the firstto propose this name in a lettertotheeditor publishedin Canadas newspaper of record The Toronto Globe andMail  on  February  long before the Mint announcedthe coin  At that time the idea had occurred to me becauseI knew that both New Zealand and Australia had onedollarand twodollar coins I had been to Australia severaltimes on business and had seen them  To me itappeared to be just a matter of time before Canada alsointroduced a twodollar coin but it took an article in theGlobe and Mail on the need for twodollar coin to concentratea kind of critical mass of public attention ontothe issue  What actually appears to happen in cases likethis is that neologisms do not appear like a single light bulbgoing off in one persons head but rather like wheat afterspring rains if the ground is fertile the seed germinatesthroughout the field                              It Figures            When it comes to counting I have always been in aweof French schoolchildren  How do they manage to domental arithmetic with numbers such as quatrevingtdixseptfour twenties plus seventeen and soixantequinzesixty plus fifteen which require mental agility just totranslate them into the figures  and   The comparableEnglish three score years and ten is certainly morepoetic than the simpler seventy  but I doubt whether itwas ever used in calculations            It is hardly surprising that the Frenchspeaking Swissand Belgians prefer their own system which like Englishhas separate words for seventy and ninety  They alongwith English and Germanspeaking children would appearto have a head start over the French  The German systemof saying numbers in reverse order like the old Englishfour and twenty  may even make calculations easieras children are usually taught to start with the units columnbefore moving on to the tens and hundreds            My admiration for the French has however paledinto insignificance since I started learning to count moneyin Mina a language spoken in Togo and parts of Beninand Ghana  I was astounded to realize that illiterate marketwomen Benin has an illiteracy rate of over  happilymultiply five by thirteen and add one hundred whilemy brain is still struggling to work out whether this comesto more or less than             Counting money in Mina involves using multiples offive as far as twentyfive and then using a combination ofmultiples of twentyfive and five as far as one hundredEven numbers greater than  are sometimes expressedas multiples of twentyfive  This means that  CFAfrancs can be expressed as one hundred plus sixteen fivesor as one hundred plus three twentyfives plus five or yetagain as seven twentyfives plus five            After this humbling experience I am inclined toreview my earlier belief that French children must be ata disadvantage when it comes to mental arithmetic  In factchildren who grow up speaking a language such as Frenchor Mina which obliges them to make connections betweennumbers and introduces them to multiples at a very earlyage probably take to arithmetic faster than those who plodalong adding one to the previous number ad infinitum
