                       JavaJibe                        I was very disappointed toread Andrew Shumans Weak Java The question of whether Java is a good platform is aninteresting and complicated one but Shumans analysis was alarminglyonesided            For instance Shumandiscussed the fact that Java is an interpreted language without bringing up thefact that many companies Microsoft included have developed what are calledjustintime compilers which largely fix the slowness problem he discussed Onthe fly a JIT compiler converts Java bytecodes normally destined to beinterpreted into machine codes which can be run very quickly Indeed recentestimates have suggested that through the use of things like JIT compilersJava will reach speeds of between  percent and  percent of the speed of anatively run C program Not nearly as slow as the article suggests            Shuman neglected to mentionthe other big advantage of Java which is security Unlike ActiveX and some ofthe other competing technologies Java applets can be run without fear of theapplet trashing your hard drive A group of German hackers demonstrated how amalicious ActiveX component can take over your copy of Quicken and makefinancial transactions on your behalf            There isa lot more to say on this issue and Im not going to try and outline all ofthe important points But Shuman should have Or rather Slate should havefound someone more likely to give a more full and nuanced view of theissue             Yaron M MinskySyracuse NY                           Refill                        AndrewShumans WeakJava and James Surowieckis Culture Warsare frightfully irresponsible Shumans breezy article largely omits theimplications of the reliability flexibility and security provided by Java inorder to emphasize the cost of these benefits in execution speed While astrong case can be made that the advantages are well worth the cost this byitself does not reflect poorly on Slate Nor does the failure of Surowieckiscolumn to note its own thinly veiled role in the culture war surrounding Javathat it describes However that Slate chose to run these poorly constructedarticles is a clear instance of Microsoft editorial influence Readers offerattention that brings advertising revenue not for misleading propaganda likethis but for information presented with the kind of journalistic integritythat usually characterizes Slate If such a conflict of interest cannot behandled gracefully the subject is best avoided             Jeff Gold New YorkCity                           Bottomless Mug                        Evangelistic movements beingwhat they are I have no doubt youll be swamped with letters responding toAndrew Shumans criticism of the Java programming language Weak Java Heresanother one though Im no Java evangelical Id much rather program inCommonLisp thanks            The assertion that Java isabout as hard for a COBOL programmer to learn as C is sent the needle on my BSdetector into the red zone One of the nice things about Java is that the mostdifficult parts of C indirection and pointer arithmetic among other thingshave been left out of the language while other convenience featuresunavailable in C such as memory management have been added to it Thesethings make it much easier to learn than C Shumans harping on slowprobably says more about the quality of Microsofts virtual machine than itdoes about Java or the Java paradigm The virtual machine is the program thatinterprets or in some cases compiles and runs the compact Java bytecodesthat make up a Java program            With theonetwo punch of items critical of Java in Shumans piece and JamesSurowieckis column Culture Wars I have to close my eyes and clap forTinkerbell to believe that Slate remains

Its Worth                        In Whos Buying WhomPaul Krugman defends himself against critics who apparently accused him ofselling out to foreign powers and multinational corporations in his July columnsupporting trade with China The East Is in the Red by attacking me as a hireling ofprotectionist interests directed by textile magnate Roger Milliken Since Ineither read his article on China nor wrote him a letter the logic that leadsKrugman to a gratuitous strike at me is unclear            What is clear however isthat he has either badly missed the mark by neglecting to do his homework oris engaged in a willful campaign of misrepresentation While it is true asKrugman says that the Economic Strategy Institute received early financialsupport from Milliken it is also the case as Krugman should have known thatMilliken ceased making contributions over four years ago when ESI overMillikens objections provided critical support to the passage of NAFTA andthe ratification of the World Trade Organization and freetrade arrangementsconcluded in the Uruguay Round Thus our support of free trade amounts to morethan pious theoretical declamations from the groves of academe            ESI does not claiminfallibility or even the absence of silly mistakes but we are not for saleWe make the best case we can based on the facts as we know them Moreover wedo not attack people only ideas Krugman says the currency of academicsuccess is creativity Perhaps but the ad hominem approach is usually themark of a weak argument            As forRoger Milliken I dont always agree with him but he is an honest andhonorable man from whom Paul Krugman could learn a lot             Clyde V PrestowitzJr Economic Strategy Institute                           Touch la Tonelson                        In his response to myletter of Aug Paul Krugman is so determined to nail me as an economic illiterate that heloses sight of our original disagreementsand some of his own previous workThe book review of mine that Krugman initially criticized in The East Is in the Redcited many reasons for thinking that consumer markets in emerging countrieslike China Mexico and Brazil are likely to stay small for decades even ifformal trade barriers come down I singled out two such reasons Firstlargely because most of these nations have huge foreign debts to pay off andtherefore need to discourage consumption by their populations they arepursuing exportled growth strategies Second if they dont keep wages andpurchasing power low they will have trouble attracting the foreign investmentthey require both to service debt and to finance growth I added that Chinahas made it abundantly clear that it has no intention of becoming a majorimporter it aims eventually to satisfy most of its own needs            Krugman responded in TheEast Is in the Red by observing that countries attracting enough foreigninvestment both to service debt and to finance growth must be running tradedeficits He added that Chinas record in particular belies my argument becauseits roughly balanced global trade indicates that it is not a net capitalimporter Krugman is of course right about the relationship between tradebalances and currentaccount balances and about Chinas internationalbalances But as I originally stated numerous forces are responsible forlimiting the consumer imports of this disparate group of countries Some likeMexico Americas most important emergingmarket trade partner are strugglingwith huge debt overhangs and therefore must restrict domestic consumption andearn foreign exchange by focusing on exporting Some believe that the Japaneseor Taiwanese models of production and exportled development are superior toconsumptionled approaches to economic growth Some are driven by memories ofdomination by the West to seek substantial degrees of economicselfsufficiency And some are motivated by combinations of theseconsiderations            China with major plans tosupply its own needs in industries such as motor vehicles aerospace andsemiconductors is clearly one country striving for selfsufficiency TheChinese are also great admirers of key aspects of the Japanese developmentmodel Indeed the amassing of some  billion in foreignexchange reserveshas been central to Chinas success at pursuing exportled growth The Chinesehave accumulated these reserves by selling their own currency in order todepress its valuewhich of course keeps export prices low and import priceshigh As a result the already meager international purchasing power of Chinasrockbottom wages is suppressed even further As for Krugmans claim that mostUS workers have seen real living standards rise over these last twentyoddyears it is based on a poor choice of datathe US governments real hourlycompensation figures This series suffers from two related problems First itincludes all workers from CEOs to janitors Second it is an average Asincome inequality in the United States risesa problem Krugman has writtenabout eloquentlyany economywide average will of course deviate increasinglyfrom the median which much more accurately describes the situation of thetypical worker            Thetypical workers situation can be more accurately gauged by looking at indexesfocusing on median figures for production nonsupervisory workerswho make up percent of the workforce Such series include the median weekly earningsstatistics published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and derived from theEarnings Files of the Current Population Survey This series and severalothers amply support my claim that US living standards have been decliningin the last two decades and refute Krugmans claim that First and Third Worldwages are converging through a process of leveling up not leveling down Nordo the results change significantly when nonwage benefits are factored in             Alan Tonelson USBusiness and Industrial Council Educational Foundation                           Unsolicited Testimony
