                                 Buy a House Lose Your Job            Governments around the worldencourage homeownership in the belief that it fosters prosperity Butunemployment statistics tell a different story Higher rates of homeownershipseem to correlate with higher rates of unemployment In Switzerland whereabout onefourth of citizens own their homes unemployment is only  percentIn Spain where homeownership is three times as common unemployment is astaggering  percent Portugals homeownership is midway betweenSwitzerlands and Spains and unemployment is a lowtomiddling percent            Thesenumbers come from a recent paper packed with evidence that homeownership andunemployment generally move in tandem The author Professor Andrew Oswald ofthe University of Warwick points to similar patterns all over theindustrialized world The patterns show up in comparisons between countriessuch as Spain and Switzerland and in comparisons between regions withincountries such as East Anglia and Yorkshire or Iowa and Nevada and theyshow up whether you look at snapshots in time or at trends that spandecades            The data suggest that on average a percent increase inthe rate of owner occupation is associated with a percent increase in therate of unemployment If thats right it accounts for a substantial fractionof the worlds joblessness Whats going on here Does homeownership causeunemployment Does unemployment cause homeownership Oswald endorses the firstexplanationhomeownership causes unemployment by tying people downgeographically The jobless homeowner looks for jobs within commuting distanceof his home The jobless renter is willing to move to where the jobs are            Thattheory is testable because it predicts that homeowners suffer longerperiods of unemployment as opposed to more frequent periods ofunemployment And in fact Oswalds theory passes at least one version of thattest As homeownership has risen over the past few decades there has been anincrease in time spent unemployed but little change in the frequency of jobloss            Alternative theories are possible Maybe thecausality goes backward Unemployment causes high rates of homeownership Myirreverent colleague Mark Bils points out that if you lose your job youll bespending a lot of time at home and youll want to buy a nice house A moreplausible explanation is that when jobs dry up renters move out so that onlyhomeowners remain The other side of that coin is that booming areas tend todraw a lot of newcomers who want to rent for a while            But whentwo things occur in tandem it isnt always right to ask which is the cause andwhich the effect After all mistletoe and eggnog tend to appear in the samemonth but neither causes the other Instead theyre brought on simultaneouslyby the Christmas season Perhaps its the same with unemployment andhomeownership But then what plays the role of Christmas the background forcethat causes both phenomena The most obvious candidates are age and wealtheither of which can increase the odds of both homeownership and longtermunemployment the young and the poor scramble harder for jobs            My cynical colleague Alan Stockman suggests an alternativecandidate namely the regulatory climate He points out that where regulatorsrun amok they tend to disrupt the rental market and the job marketsimultaneously Consider the housing market in New York City where rentalapartments are outrageously expensive Thats largely because New Yorkrealestate laws make it nearly impossible to evict a bad tenant so landlordsare skittish about leasing to strangers At the same time labor laws make ithard to fire a bad employee so employers are conservative in their hiring            Its alsopossible that the numbers themselves are wrong because of some hidden bias inthe way theyre collected Maybe when youre counting the unemployed its easyto overlook a transient and hard to overlook a homeowner So you can tell a lotof different stories to explain Oswalds numbers But for the sake ofdiscussion let me go back to the first and I think most interesting storyHomeowners stay unemployed longer because homeowners are less mobile If thatstory is true what is its moral            Oswald speculates that mass unemployment existsin the world today because of the rise in homeownership and the decline inprivate rentingtrends that are in turn the results of longrunning attemptsby most Western governments to raise the degree of homeownership largelythrough subsidies Where those attempts have been most successful theefficiency of labor markets has declined most dramatically            You couldinterpret that as a story about wellmeaning dogooders who hurt the verypeople theyre trying to help but such an interpretation would be hard todefend Surely home buyers are well aware that theyre sacrificing mobilityThats a voluntary sacrifice and so in the judgment of those who choose tobuy it must be more than compensated for by the benefits of ownership Inother words high unemployment might be the price we pay for owner occupancybut apparently owneroccupants are convinced that its a price worthpaying            That analysis is guided by an economists faith in themaxim that people are generally pretty good at looking out for their owninterests The companion maxim is that people often make no attempt at all tolook out for the interests of others So if we really want to pull everypossible moral out of our story we should think about the other people whoseinterests are at stake when you decide to buy a house In other words weshould think about your children            Residential stability isextremely important for children If your family moves during your school yearsages  your chance of graduating high school falls by  percent thechance that youll be economically inactive out of school and out ofwork at age  rises by  percentand if you are female your chance ofgetting through your teens without an outofwedlock birth falls by  percentI learned this from the book Succeeding                Generations  by theeconomists Robert Haveman and Barbara Wolfe Like Oswalds numbers on housingand unemployment these numbers might allow a variety of explanationslikefamilies that move are more likely to be poor and thats why their kids dontdo as well But in fact Haveman and Wolfes statistical analysis is designedto rule out this and similar alternative theories leaving us to conclude thatthe moves themselves are harmful            Perhaps when parents movethey carefully weigh the damage to their children against competing benefitsand act in the interests of the entire family Or perhaps when parents movethey selfishly put their own interests ahead of their childrens In the lattercase a government that cares about children would want to discourage householdmoves say through subsidies to homeownership even at the cost of higherunemployment
