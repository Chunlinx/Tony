                    Background        There is currently great interest in using extracellular        signaling proteins to influence the gene expression program        and differentiation of embryonic cells in particular        embryonic stem cells Of the factors that contribute to        specifying cell fate during development Wnt proteins are        among the most attractive candidates to use in such         in vitro experiments Wnt proteins        control numerous aspects of development ranging from stem        cell control to differentiation and cell polarity             It has been problematic however to test directly whether        Wnt proteins can be used as reagents in cell culture        because working with soluble Wnt proteins is difficult and        few cell lines are known to respond to Wnt proteins Wnt        signal transduction proceeds through a complex series of        protein interactions initiated by binding of the Wnt        protein to cell surface receptors Frizzled and LRP              which generates a signal to downstream components A        key event in signaling is the regulation of the GSK        protein kinase and its substrate catenin In the absence        of a Wnt signal GSK phosphorylates catenin which then        becomes targeted for degradation     The binding of Wnt        to its receptors initiates a cascade of events that inhibit        GSK and ultimately prevent degradation of catenin        Together with the DNA binding protein TCF catenin        activates expression of Wnt target genes In this work we        have identified Wnt target genes using microarray        technology                    Results                  Identifying Wnt targets on microarrays          We tested human teratocarcinoma cells NCCIT cells          for a Wnt response Despite the cancerous origin of these          cells they share many properties with embryonic stem          cells     These cells express several members of the          Frizzled family including FZD one of the receptors          for Wnt data not shown Figure A To stimulate the          NCCIT cells with Wnt we used tissue culture medium          containing active WntA protein produced by mouse L          cells WntA CM     in comparison to control          conditioned medium CCM In initial experiments we          found that WntA protein elevates the levels of          catenin  fold Figure  and that a transiently          transfected TCF reporter construct is activated  fold          not shown                          Cooperativity between WntA and BMP          Several of the Wnt target genes had been identified          previously as targets of BMP signaling     We were          therefore interested in comparing the effects of BMP and          WntA and examining their combined effects As has been          reported before for other cells     MSX MSX and          ID are elevated by BMP in NCCIT cells Figure  When          WntA and BMP were combined gene expression was          increased to yet higher levels MSX expression was          markedly elevated by the combination of BMP and WntA          Similar but less dramatic effects were found for ID and          MSX Figure  Hence BMP and WntA appear to have          an additive or perhaps synergistic effect on target gene          expression However when the time courses of Wnt and          BMPinduced gene expression were compared it appeared          that BMP acts as soon as at  minutes but that Wnt          takes  hours to have an effect Figure  Hence          Wntinduced changes in gene expression are slower than          BMP even on the same target genes and in the same cell          type                          Wnt signaling is blocked by cycloheximide          The delay in transcriptional response to soluble Wnt          raised the concern that the genes we identified might not          be primary targets of Wnt but dependent on the prior          induction of other genes Such concerns are usually          addressed by blocking protein synthesis in cells because          the expression of primary target genes or socalled          immediate early genes should not be sensitive whereas          secondary targets should be blocked This approach is not          readily applicable to the Wnt response because the          critical step in signal transduction is the block in          catenin phosphorylation and degradation leading to the          accumulation of newlysynthesized catenin Whether Wnt          target gene activation is cycloheximide sensitive has          never been tested however When we incubated cells with          cycloheximide the accumulation of catenin by WntA          was blocked and Wnt targets like MSX were not          elevated Figure  The inhibitory effect was also seen          for MSX ID Follistatin Versican and Cyclin D not          shown In contrast cycloheximide did not block          induction of target genes by BMP Figure  the          mechanism of which does not involve protein accumulation              These findings underscore the importance of          catenin protein elevation in the response to Wnt This          unique aspect of Wnt signaling may explain its relatively          slow effects on target genes  protein synthesis is          slower than protein phosphorylation or other signal          transduction events          The requirement for protein synthesis in Wnt signaling          means that we cannot use cycloheximide sensitivity as a          criterion to discriminate between primary and secondary          targets                          The Follistatin promoter is dependent on a TCF          binding site          In the Wnt target gene promoters that are functionally          mapped MSX MSX ID ID Follistatin RESTNRSF          Versican we invariably found TCF binding sites          Moreover we found that a luciferase reporter gene          placed under the control of the Follistatin promoter was          activated by WntA protein added to transiently          transfected NCCIT cells Figure  Mutating the single          TCF binding site on the Follistatin promoter eliminated          the response These data suggest that Follistatin is          activated directly through the Wnt signal transduction          pathway and not by another pathway Because the kinetics          of Follistatin activation by Wnt are similar to that of          the other target genes Figure A we suggest that there          are no earlier targets ie all identified targets are          direct                            Discussion        The overall pattern of gene expression observed in        response to Wnt has important implications for the role of        Wnt signaling in development and cancer Of particular        interest are the ID MSX and RESTNRSF genes Expression        of each of these genes can interfere with differentiation        of cells ID was recently shown also to be a target of        activated catenin in colon carcinoma cells     It is        a general inhibitor of the bHLH proteins such as MyoD and        EE    and can interact with the tumor suppressor        RB     MSX expression can revert differentiated        myotubes into an undifferentiated state     RESTNRSF        is known to block neural differentiation by binding to and        inhibiting the expression of neuronal genes      To        what extent these genes are controlled by Wnt signaling in        intact animals or in other cell types is not clear yet but        we do note that MSX mutants have phenotypes similar to        LEFTCF mutants             The MSX and ID genes are also activated by BMP           and we found indeed synergistic effects of Wnt plus BMP        There are several examples of interactions between BMP and        Wnt family members in vivo particularly in Drosophila           and this crosstalk adds to the potential of these        pathways for cell type specification However Wnt        signaling also promotes the expression of such genes as        Cyclin D    and MYC     which are not elevated by        BMP The ability to block differentiation and        simultaneously promote cell division is a distinctive        characteristic of Wnt signaling which could be instrumental        in the role of Wnts as stem cell growth factors such as in        the crypt of the colon and in carcinogenesis                     Several of the Wnt targets genes encode components of        the Wnt signaling transduction system The increased        expression of TrCPslimb    and the ubiquitin        conjugating enzyme UbcE Figure  both involved in        degradation of catenin     could act as a negative        feedback loop in Wnt signaling Moreover Frizzled        receptors Versican and other proteoglycans which        contribute to Wnt protein activity are also controlled by        Wnt signaling as previously described in Drosophila             At the level of transcriptional regulation we found        upregulation of CBPP which partners with catenin            but also TLEGroucho which is an inhibitor of TCF        function     These responses suggest a rich system of        homeostasis and feedback control mechanisms but they        complicate the interpretation of experimental studies of        Wnt signal transduction in which the time course of        induction cannot be controlled easily        The delayed response to Wnt signaling raises interesting        developmental issues Timing of gene expression is very        important during embryogenesis A slow response is likely        to be an important feature of the activity of Wnts as        morphogens when not only the concentration but also the        duration of the stimulus is important In considering these        issues it is of interest to note that in the early C        elegans embryo Wnt signaling proceeds through a        noncanonical pathway through phosphorylation of the TCF        homolog but not using the increase in catenin            Cell divisions and polarization in the worm embryo occur on        a time scale of minutes and the different mechanism of Wnt        signaling in that context may be more suitable than the        inherently slower translationdependent catenin        increase                    Conclusions        We found that Wnt signaling can activate genes that        promote stem cell fate and inhibit cellular        differentiation and regulates a remarkable number of genes        involved in its own signaling system The overall pattern        of gene expression provides clues to the diverse functions        of Wnt proteins in cancer cell fate decisions and other        developmental events                    Methods                  Cells          Mouse L cells secreting WntA were established in our          lab by transfecting expression constructs in which the          WntA cDNA    is driven by the PGK promoter In          order to get cells secreting relatively high amounts of          WntA we selected clones from the transfected cell          population The tissue culture supernatant was added to          NCCIT cells                              Hybrizations and array experiments          mRNA isolated from WntA exposed cells was reverse          transcribed and labeled with Cy red and cDNA from CCM          treated cells labeled with Cy green Samples from          induced and control NCCIT cells were mixed and          cohybridized to array slides containing  different          human cDNAs representing  different Unigene          clusters and including  characterized genes          Hybridized arrays were imaged using a GenPix Axon          scanner and data were analyzed by hierarchical clustering                                       Depletion of Wnt protein          The medium was specifically depleted of WntA by          adding an excess of a fusion protein containing the          cysteinerich domain of the Frizzled receptor of          Drosophila which binds to WntA protein and alkaline          phosphatase     By adding antibody to alkaline          phosphatase all of the detectable WntA protein could          be removed from the medium In addition an antibody to          WntA itself was used for depletion although it worked          less efficiently than the Frizzled fusion protein                          Mutating the Follistatin promoter          The Follistatin promoter    contains one putative          TCF binding site CTTTGAT at position  to  from          the start of transcription This site was mutated into          CATCGAT which led to abrogation of the WntA          response                            Authors contributions        JW
