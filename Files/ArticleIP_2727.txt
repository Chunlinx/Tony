Kendall has also done legal work forthe Enquirer  editor Steve Coz denies that he got the tip through hisconnections to the White House            This week theEnquirer seems to take a different tack on Starr Instead of a possibleadulterer he is presented as less than a manly man Embarrassing secrets abouthis past are revealed by a source who wont end up receiving one of Starrssubpoenas his sweet yearold mom Vannie In its exclusive interviewwith Mom the Enquirer extracts the information that as a boy Starr wasspoiled and temperamental and so got a lot of spankings This turned himaround and by
