                                  Flight Stimulator            The deaths of John F Kennedy Jr and the Bessettesisters have inspired myriad debates over the safety of private planes as wellas a lot of criticism of Kennedys decision to brave the night sky over oceanin his Piper Saratoga II HP Obviously its not the governments role toprevent people from taking the sort of risks they think makes life worthliving But should Washington be spending hundreds of millions of dollars eachyear encouraging the risky business of private air travel            How risky In  a private plane was  timesmore likely to be involved in an accident and  times more likely to suffer afatal crash than a commercial carrier Six hundred twentyone people died inprivate plane crashes in the United States last year but only one died on anairliner Yet the government continues to subsidize general aviationthecatchall category that covers everything from singleengine Cessnas piloted byweekend hobbyists to Learjets carrying corporate execs Partly due to all thisgovernment largess the United States has more private pilots and aircraft thanall the other nations on Earth combined            The biggest directsubsidy is the air traffic control system According to Richard Golaszewski ofthe consulting firm GRA Inc general aviation imposes about  billion a yearin air traffic control costs on the Federal Aviation Administration but thefuel taxes levied on general aviation cover only about onethird of that Theshortfall is covered by the  percent federal tax on commercial airlinetickets Also since  the FAA has furnished  billion in grants togeneral aviation airports to pay for construction and improvement and has givenfederally owned land to  airports Heritage Foundation analyst Ron Uttpoints out that the  biggest US airports which serve  percent ofcommercial air travelers get less federal money each year than the smaller ones that cater almost exclusively to private fliers            When planes go down the federal government conducts costlysearchandrescue missions Few victims of lightplane crashes can expect theCoast Guard to spend days trying to recover their corpses under the gaze of TVnews cameras but the bulk of the efforts deployed in the Kennedy accident wasnot out of the ordinary About  to  searchandrescue operations formissing aircraft are undertaken by the federal government each year nearly allof them private Nearly  million is spent annually on all  federalsearchandrescue missions The amount spent on general aviation search andrescue is not broken out as a separate category            Additionally all private plane accidents whetherthey involve a fatality or not require a costly National Transportation SafetyBoard investigation The NTSB conducted  such investigations last yearbut the agency doesnt detail its costs The Air Forces Civil Air Patrol alsogets money to help find downed planes and pilots            Other inducements togeneral aviation include easy access to airports Commercial passengersfrequently find themselves trapped in holding patterns over the nationsbiggest and busiest airports as corporate turboprops carrying a few peopleland Increased landing fees and less generous treatment have reduced generalaviation traffic at big hubs in recent years but they havent eliminated itAt Chicagos OHare International nearly  percent of all landings are privateplanes At Los Angeles International the figure is close to  percent            All those corporate planes highlight another reality whichis that general aviation benefits from the abuse of the business tax deductionDeep in their hearts the captains of industry know that corporate jets are aripoff Warren Buffett once christened his company jet The IndefensibleLegal fees and photocopying expenses of course are just as deductible as thecost of owning and flying a private plane So why doesnt anyone worry abouttheir being abused Because traveling on a cushy corporate jet quite unlikeconsulting with attorneys inevitably involves a large component of personalpleasure and comfortlike staying in the Four Seasons instead of the MarriottThe extra expense required to avoid the sweaty traveling public may yieldnothing in terms of higher productivity or profits but with Uncle Sam footinga third of the cost top managers may find the perk too tempting to resist            JFK Jr was pretty normal for a private pilotahardcharger who fell in love with the freedom excitement and romance ofprivate aviation But like most of his fellow fliers he had the resources tofinance his pricey hobby without imposing so much on earthbound mortals Whilewere free to secondguess his decision to fly to Marthas Vineyard maybe weshould be pondering another question Why were the rest of us paying him to doit
