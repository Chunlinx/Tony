                    Background                Yersinia pestis  the causative agent        of bubonic plague harbors a large virulence plasmid that        is essential for pathogenicity This plasmid called pCD           in         Y pestis  encodes for a type III        secretion apparatus necessary for the translocation of        effector proteins Yops into eukaryotic target cells            The net result of this polarized toxin translocation is        the disruption of eukaryotic cell signalling and structure            Induction of the virulencerelated genes on pCD is        linked to an in vitro phenomenon termed the Low Calcium        Response LCR The LCR is believed to mimic the response        of         Y pestis in contact with eukaryotic        cells when calcium ions are removed from the growth medium        at C The result of this in vitro induction of virulence        genes is the massive secretion of Yops into the growth        medium accompanied by a characteristic growth restriction        that is a hallmark phenotype of the LCR            Secretion of Yops by the type III secretion system is        not constitutive Control of secretion is complex and        involves several proteins that positively and negatively        regulate the activity of the secretion apparatus in        response to environmental conditions     LcrG has been        implicated in blocking the secretion apparatus either        directly or indirectly     as strains lacking         lcrG constitutively secrete Yops            regardless of inducing conditions In addition YopN        TyeA SycN YscB LcrH YopD and LcrQ are all also        required for the negative regulation of Yops secretion                       LcrV the V antigen is        thought to positively regulate Yops secretion as         lcrV strains do not secrete Yops        even under conditions that normally favor secretion                    LcrG and LcrV have been demonstrated to physically        interact in the bacterial cytoplasm     Disruption of        the LcrGLcrV interaction or overexpression of LcrG in a        lowLcrV background both result in a constitutive blockage        of Yops secretion      This evidence led to a model        of how these two proteins may control Yops secretion The        LcrGtitration model theorizes that LcrG blocks the        secretion apparatus Ysc from the bacterial cytoplasm and        that interaction with LcrV is required to relieve the        blockage Upon induction by eukaryotic cell contact or        removal of calcium from the growth medium the        intracellular level of LcrV becomes elevated relative to        that of LcrG The increased amount of LcrV removes LcrG        from its secretionblocking role resulting in full        induction of the LCR and secretion of Yops Evidence        accumulated to date clearly demonstrates that the LcrGLcrV        interaction is critical for the regulation of this complex        virulence system      Therefore dissection of the        LcrGLcrV interaction is warranted        Utilizing yeast twohybrid analyses we further        investigated the LcrGLcrV interaction We determined that        the Nterminus of LcrG is essential for LcrV interaction        The smallest linear region of LcrG required for the        interaction is predicted to form a coiledcoil motif a        structure often associated with proteinprotein        interactions We used both alaninescanning and a radical        sitedirected mutagenesis strategy to identify amino acids        critical for the interaction within this region of LcrG        While alanine mutants failed to disrupt the LcrGLcrV        interaction radical mutations of three residues revealed a        region important for the interaction These residues are        likely to reside on the same face of the protein if a        coiledcoil structure is assumed Based on this evidence        we predict that the interaction of LcrG with LcrV occurs        within an Nterminal coiledcoil domain of LcrG via        hydrophobic interactions        Additionally we investigated whether the         Pseudomonas homolog of LcrG PcrG        could transcomplement an         lcrG strain of         Y pestis  The opportunistic        pathogen         Pseudomonas aeruginosa utilizes a        type III secretion system for intracellular delivery of        toxins      that is the most similar to the         Yersinia system     Several        components of the         Pseudomonas system have been        demonstrated to functionally complement genetic defects in        the         Yersinia homologs including the LcrV        homolog PcrV      Homologs of LcrG and LcrV ie        PcrG and PcrV have only been identified in         P aeruginosa suggesting that this        pair of regulatory proteins may fulfill similar roles in        these extracellular pathogens In the present study we        found that PcrG could not substitute for LcrG although        both proteins interacted with LcrV This result led to a        genetic selection for PcrG variants that could        transcomplement an         lcrG defect Isolation of a PcrG        variant that could substitute for LcrG led to the        identification of a region within LcrG that may be involved        in blocking the activity of the         Y pestis type III secretion        system                    Results and Discussion                  Delineation of the LcrVinteraction domain of          LcrG          LcrG and LcrV physically interact in           Y pestis     and that          interaction plays a significant role in the regulation of          Yops secretion     LcrG and LcrV interact in a yeast          twohybrid assay     therefore this technique was          used to further investigate the region of LcrG required          for its interaction with LcrV Truncations of LcrG were          constructed and fused to the GAL activation domain of          pACT These plasmids were cotransformed into yeast          strain Y with fulllength LcrV fused to the GAL DNA          binding domain of plasmid pAS to determine if the LcrG          truncations could continue to participate in an          interaction with LcrV Using a filterlift assay as a          qualitative determination of an interaction and a liquid          galactosidase assay to quantify the results we found          that the LcrVinteraction domain of LcrG lies in the          Nterminus of the protein The smallest linear region of          LcrG that was still capable of interacting with LcrV was          determined to be amino acids  Fig  shown          highlighted in yellow in Fig  Deletion of five          additional amino acids from the Nterminus of the           construct or seven amino acids from the Cterminus of the           construct eliminated our ability to detect an          interaction using this system Fig  Interestingly          this approximate region of LcrG amino acids  is          predicted to form a coiledcoil domain when LcrG is          analyzed using the COILS algorithm    data not          shown These results suggest that the LcrGLcrV          interaction requires the Nterminus of LcrG and may          involve a coiledcoil domain                          Alaninescanning mutagenesis of the LcrG          Nterminus          To determine individual residues of LcrG required for          interaction with LcrV a systematic sitedirected          mutagenesis strategy was used to change conserved or          charged residues within the delineated interaction          region Initially alaninescanning mutagenesis was used          for this study as alanine substitutions are generally          thought to minimally effect protein folding              Sequence conservation from the alignment of LcrG with the                    Pseudomonas aeruginosa homolog          PcrG Fig  allowed the targeting of specific residues          likely to be important for the interaction After          construction of specific missense mutants each          fulllength LcrG alanine variant was screened for          interaction with LcrV using the yeast twohybrid assay          Surprisingly the alaninescanning mutagenesis results          failed to demonstrate amino acids of LcrG involved in the          LcrGLcrV interaction All of the alanine mutants          screened were capable of interaction with LcrV as          demonstrated in a filterlift assay Liquid          galactosidase assays showed that the strength of the          interactions were not significantly reduced from that of          wildtype LcrG Table  These results showed that          single alanine substitutions are insufficient to disrupt          the LcrGLcrV interaction A likely explanation for the          failure of alaninescanning to reveal residues in LcrG          important for LcrV interaction is that alanine is a          residue capable of interaction with hydrophobic residues          Our subsequent studies suggest that the interaction of          LcrG with LcrV occurs at a hydrophobic patch within          LcrG                          Radical sitedirected mutagenesis of LcrG allows          the LcrGLcrV interaction to be disrupted          Based on our experience with the alaninescanning          combined with the similar results of Francis et al              it seemed likely that the LcrGLcrV interaction was          occurring between hydrophobic residues Accordingly we          continued to examine the interaction domain using a          mutagenesis strategy described by Francis et al termed          radical sitedirected mutagenesis     This method          involves replacing hydrophobic residues with charged          residues or changing charged residues to oppositely          charged residues This method was used to mutagenize          several conserved residues in the interacting region in          the effort to disrupt the LcrGLcrV interaction Table           These radical sitedirected mutants were then          screened using the yeast twohybrid system for their          interaction with LcrV Radical mutagenesis revealed          several residues with decreased galactosidase activity          in the yeast two hybrid system The LcrG mutants AR          AD SR and LR all had significantly decreased          activity when assayed for galactosidase expression          Table  LcrG mutants IR AE and IR demonstrated          somewhat decreased activity Table  These results          suggested that residues A S and L red asterisks          in Fig  all participate in the interaction of LcrG          with LcrV and that residues I A and I may also          contribute to the interaction Of the residues identified          in these experiments only changes to A S and L          were detected with a more sensitive filterlift assay for          galactosidase activity and were therefore chosen for          further characterization          The alanine at position  was previously identified          as a critical residue in the LcrGLcrV interaction              Two mutations were characterized at this position AR          and AD and they failed to interact with LcrV showing          that single substitutions of this kind can disrupt the          LcrGLcrV interaction     Additional data from this          study showed that a substitution of the leucine at          position  with an arginine also prevented the LcrGLcrV          interaction in yeast Table  Interestingly when L          is replaced with alanine Table  or threonine Table           the interaction is not effected Mutagenesis of the          serine at position  to arginine resulted in an LcrG          variant that weakly interacted with LcrV as determined by          a filterlift assay for galactosidase activity The          color change of the yeast colonies due to the hydrolysis          of bromochloroindolylDgalactopyranoside          Xgal by galactosidase was significantly delayed and          less intense than the reaction we observed for strongly          interacting mutants The liquid galactosidase assay          confirmed that the strength of the LcrG SRLcrV          interaction was reduced Table  indicating that this          residue is likely involved in the interaction of LcrG          with LcrV As coiledcoil motifs show a characteristic          seven amino acid repeat pattern with each repeat          representing two turns of the helix it is interesting          that three positions identified as important to the          LcrGLcrV interaction   and  are each separated          by seven amino acids When this region was analyzed using          a helical wheel projection the three residues fall on          the same face of the helix which appears to be largely          hydrophobic in nature Fig  These results and          observations further indicate that the LcrGLcrV          interaction may require the participation of a          coiledcoil motif and occurs at a largely hydrophobic          interface          To evaluate the biological significance of the changes          in interaction seen in the yeast twohybrid system          between LcrV and LcrG SR or LcrG LR LcrG SR and          LR were expressed in           lcrG Y pestis where their ability          to control Yops secretion was examined Neither the SR          or the LR mutant displayed the calciumindependent          growth phenotype previously observed for LcrG AR              LcrG SR displayed a wildtype growth and secretion          phenotype while LcrG LR was Ca blind data not          shown To further understand the phenotypes obtained          the ability of LcrG SR and LR to interact with LcrV          was examined in           Y pestis  Wild type LcrG LcrG          SR LcrG LR and LcrG AR were independently          coexpressed with His            tagged LcrV in a strain of           Y pestis deleted for           lcrGV  The cells were French          pressed and the cleared lysates were applied to Talon          columns to purify His            tagged LcrV As previously reported              LcrG copurified with LcrV and LcrG AR did not          copurify with LcrV Fig  lanes  and  When LcrG          SR was coexpressed with His            tagged LcrV a small amount was          recovered in the elution fraction from the column Fig           lane  This result is indicative of a weaker          interaction between LcrG SR and LcrV than the          interaction between wildtype LcrG and LcrV The weaker          interaction seen in           Y pestis between LcrG SR and          LcrV corresponds with our yeast twohybrid data for the          SR mutant which showed an interaction with LcrV and          suggests an interaction with decreased affinity Table           The interaction results for LcrG SR provide an          explanation for the failure of LcrG SR to confer a Ca          independent phenotype like the previously described          LcrG AR mutant LcrG SR still interacts with LcrV and          therefore LcrV can neutralize the LcrGmediated secretion          block In fact this result is consistent with the fact          that very low levels of LcrG are required to provide LcrG          function     LcrG LR either interacts weakly with          or does not interact with His            tagged LcrV in           Y pestis Fig  lane  This          result also corresponds with the lack of interaction          observed in the yeast twohybrid assay for this mutant          Taken together these results suggest that the residues          found to be involved in the LcrGLcrV interaction using          twohybrid analysis are relevant in the bacterial cell          However the inability of LR to function like our          previously described AR mutant was somewhat surprising          One explanation is that the protein with the LR change          is simply misfolded The second explanation is that the          secretionblocking and the LcrVinteraction domains of          LcrG overlap Currently we do not possess the data          required to differentiate between the two possibilities          and we are pursuing the reasons for the failure of LR          to function like wildtype LcrG                          PcrG does not complement an lcrGstrain but          interacts with LcrV          Because the residues of LcrG required for interaction          with LcrV are strongly conserved in PcrG of           P aeruginosa red asterisks in          Fig  we determined if PcrG could interact directly          with LcrV First PcrGGALAD and LcrVGALBD chimeras          were coexpressed in a yeast twohybrid assay Activation          of galactosidase by the chimeric proteins was          demonstrated by a filterlift assay showing that LcrV and          PcrG interact data not shown To determine if PcrG and          LcrV also interacted in           Y pestis  we attempted to          copurify the two proteins from bacterial extracts PcrG          and His            LcrV were coexpressed in a           Y pestis strain with           lcrG and           lcrV deleted and the cleared          lysates were applied to a Talon column PcrG reacts          weakly with antibody to LcrG allowing us to detect the          presence of PcrG on immunoblots PcrG was present in the          elution fraction Fig A lane  indicating that PcrG          was retained on the Talon column This result          demonstrated that PcrG and LcrV interact in           Y pestis  The interaction of PcrG          with LcrV supports the mutagenesis and sequence data          indicating that residues conserved between LcrG and PcrG          are likely to be important for interaction with LcrV          Since PcrG and LcrV interacted in           Y pestis  the ability of PcrG to          complement an           lcrG strain of           Y pestis was examined Cultures of                    lcrG strains transcomplemented with          either LcrG or PcrG were grown in the presence and          absence of calcium and harvested after four hours of          growth at C Culture supernatants were examined for          the presence of secreted proteins by immunoblotting for          LcrV YopE and YopM Fig Bshows that LcrG expression          blocked secretion in this strain in the presence of          calcium and allowed secretion in its absence Fig B          lanes  and  However when PcrG was expressed          secretion was not blocked in either the presence or          absence of calcium calciumblind phenotype similar to          the parent strain Fig B lanes  and  Therefore          while PcrG is capable of interacting with LcrV it          differs from LcrG in its ability to block secretion of          Yops in           Y pestis                           Selection of PcrG mutants that block          secretion          PcrG of           P aeruginosa can interact with          LcrV but cannot block secretion of Yops in           Y pestis Fig B This result          suggested that mutagenesis of           pcrG could be used to isolate PcrG          mutants capable of blocking Yops secretion in           Y pestis  This genetic screen          allowed the isolation of PcrG mutants that functioned in           Y pestis in a manner          indistinguishable from LcrG Fig B compare lanes  and           to lanes  and  DNA sequencing of seven independent          isolates revealed the presence of a phenylalanine to          leucine change at position  of PcrG in all seven of the          isolates This result suggests that a region of PcrG          including amino acid  is capable of interaction with           Y pestis secretion components and          suggests that the homologous LcrG region is likely to be          involved in LcrGs secretionblocking activity                          Analysis of the putative secretionblocking region          of LcrG          Change of residue  in PcrG from phenylalanine to          leucine made the PcrG sequence look more like that of          LcrG That is position  of PcrG became identical to          the corresponding LcrG residue L Fig  boxed          residues This information suggested that residue  of          LcrG was an ideal candidate for sitedirected mutagenesis          to disrupt LcrGs secretion blocking activity          Accordingly the leucine at position  in LcrG was          mutated to both phenylalanine and arginine Surprisingly          neither mutant LcrG protein LF data not shown or LR          Fig B lanes  and  effected LcrG function          Subsequent mutagenesis of the phenylalanine at position           of LcrG to arginine resulted in an LcrG mutant FR          blue asterisk in Fig  that was defective for secretion          blocking activity Fig B lanes  and  Mutation of          F to either alanine or leucine had no effect on the          function of those LcrG variants suggesting that the          hydrophobic nature of F is important for LcrG function          The expression level of LcrG and LcrG FR from our          plasmid constructs were also analyzed in whole cell          extracts LcrG FR was expressed as well as wild type          LcrG demonstrating that its inability to block secretion          is not due to a change in the expression or stability of          the protein Fig A lanes  and  An interesting          point to note is that when Skrzypek and Straley deleted          residues  of LcrG highlighted in blue in Fig           they obtained a mutant protein that did not block Yops          secretion     The LcrG FR mutant like the           mutant interacts with LcrV data not shown and              demonstrating that the protein likely folds in a native          conformation Additionally the mutant confirms previous          work that the two known LcrG functions secretion          blocking and LcrV interaction are genetically separable              Further experiments will more precisely delineate          the region of LcrG required to block the type III          secretion apparatus                            Conclusions        The interaction of LcrG with LcrV is a critical factor        in controlling the activity of the type III secretion        system in         Y pestis     In order to gain a        deeper understanding of this critical interaction we        determined the region of LcrG required for interaction with        LcrV Results presented in this study demonstrate that the        smallest linear region of LcrG required for interaction        with LcrV is residues  to  highlighted in yellow in        Fig  Interestingly this region is predicted to form a        coiledcoil domain We have identified several residues        indicated with red asterisks in Fig  within the        interacting region of LcrG that contribute to the        interaction with LcrV When residues  to  of the protein        are analyzed with a helical wheel projection these three        residues A S and L appear to lie on one face of        an amphipathic helix Fig  The seven aminoacid        periodicity of the residues is consistent with a        coiledcoil protein motif These data strongly suggest the        LcrVinteraction domain of LcrG is contained within an        amphipathic coiledcoil domain Additionally we exploited        the inability of PcrG to block secretion in         Y pestis as a point to start mapping        the region of LcrG required for blocking the type III        secretion apparatus We found that mutation of residue         in PcrG boxed in Fig  allowed the protein to function        in         Y pestis  This information coupled        with a previous observation that deletion of residues  to         within LcrG highlighted in blue in Fig  abolished        the secretionblocking activity     allowed us to        identify amino acid  as a residue blue asterisk in Fig         required to block the activity of the         Y pestis type III secretion        apparatus                    Materials and Methods
