performance management systems link individualperformance to organizational goals In October  the Office ofPersonnel Management amended regulations to require agencies tolink senior executive performance with organizational goals toappraise executive performance by balancing organizational resultswith customer satisfaction employee perspective and other areasand to use performance results as a basis for pay awards andother personnel decisions Agencies were to establish theseperformance management systems by their  senior executiveperformance appraisal cyclesBecause they implemented a set of balanced expectations prior tothe Office of Personnel Management requirement GAO studied theBureau of Land Managements Federal Highway AdministrationsInternal Revenue Services and Veterans Benefits Administrationsuse of balanced expectations to manage senior executive performancein order to identify initial approaches that may be helpful toother agencies in holding senior executives accountable forresultsWhat GAO FoundThe agencies GAO reviewed developed an initial set of balancedexpectations for senior executives to address in their individualperformance plans GAO found that these agencies are in the earlystages of using a set of balanced expectations to appraise seniorexecutive performance and there are significant opportunities tostrengthen their efforts as they move forward in holding executivesaccountable for results Specifically more progress is needed inexplicitly linking executive expectations for performance toorganizational goals In addition while these agencies addresspartnering with customers and other stakeholders greater emphasisshould be placed in fostering the collaboration within and acrossorganizational boundaries to achieve results Successfulorganizations understand that they must often change their cultureto successfully transform themselves and such change starts withtop leadership Senior executive performance expectations to leadand facilitate change could be a critical element as agenciestransform themselves The agencies generally agreed with theseconclusions as well as the selected initial implementationapproaches GAO

ManagementRestructuring and the District of Columbia Committee onGovernmental Affairs United States SenateLeading organizations have recognized that a critical successfactor in fostering a resultsoriented culture is a performancemanagement system that creates a line of sight showing how unitand individual performance can contribute to overall organizationalgoals and helping them understand the connection between theirdaily activities and the organizations success Effectiveperformance management systems first align leaderships performanceexpectations with organizational goals and then cascade performanceexpectations through all levels in the organization Effectivesystems are not merely onceor twiceyearly expectation setting andappraisal tools but can help the organization manage on adaytoday basis Leading organizations use their performancemanagement systems to achieve results accelerate change andfacilitate communication throughout the year so that discussionsabout individual and organizational performance are integrated andongoing Thus an effective performance management system can be astrategic tool for organizations to drive internal change andachieve external resultsWe have observed that modernizing performance management systemsand linking them to agency strategic plans and desired outcomesshould be a top priority as agencies seek to transform theircultures in response to existing and emerging challenges andopportunities Performance management systems in leadingorganizations typically seek to achieve three key objectivesFirst they strive to provide candid and constructive feedback tohelp individual employees maximize their contribution and potentialin understanding and realizing the goals and objectives of theagency Second they seek to provide management with the objectiveand factbased information it needs to reward top performersThird performance management systems provide the necessaryinformation and documentation to deal with poor performers Mostfederal performance management systems fail to achieve theseobjectivesIn January  GAO designated strategic human capitalmanagement as a governmentwide highrisk area One of the keyareas challenging federal agencies is creating resultsorientedorganizational cultures Many agencies lack organizational culturesthat promote high performance and accountability which arecritical to successful organizations To help agency leaderseffectively lead and manage their people and integrate humancapital considerations into daily decision making and the programresults they seek to achieve we developed a strategic humancapital model The model highlights the kinds of thinking thatagencies should apply as well as some of the steps they can taketo make progress in managing human capital strategically Asdetailed in that model one critical success factor is to link unitand individual performance to organizational goalsTo help agencies hold senior executives accountable fororganizational results the Office of Personnel Management OPMamended regulations for senior executive performance management inOctober  These amended regulations on governing performanceappraisals

agencieshave taken to manage senior executive performance that may behelpful to other agencies as they implement OPMs amendedregulations governing senior executive performance managementsystems We selected the Bureau of Land Management BLM FederalHighway Administration FHWA Internal Revenue Service IRS andVeterans Benefits Administration VBA because they used a set ofbalanced expectations to manage the performance of all or asignificant portion of their senior executives prior to the OPMrequirement IRS incorporated balanced expectations into its seniorexecutive performance management

senior executivesEach agency has taken the first step in developing an initial setof expectations for senior executives to address in theirindividual performance plans that are intended to balanceaccountability for organizational results with a focus on customersatisfaction and a consideration of employeePage  GAO Senior Executive Performance Managementperspectives The agencies offered a menu of expectations forsenior executives to choose from and incorporate into theirindividual performance plans The agencies subsequently used theseexpectations as the basis of senior executives performanceappraisalsOrganizational results To appraise senior executivescontributions to organizational results the agencies identified core competencies and supporting behaviors for seniorexecutives to follow that are intended to achieve results such aslearning about current issues and applying that knowledge to makesound decisions or pursuing business excellence and  to only alimited extent targets for senior executives to meet that aredirectly linked to organizational goals such as the average returnon sales of acquired properties or the percent of cases meetingaccuracy standardsCustomer satisfaction The agencies set expectations forsenior executives to address customer satisfaction in theirindividual performance plans and appraised their performance on thebasis of partnerships formed customer feedback and improvedproducts and servicesEmployee perspectives The agencies set expectations forsenior executives to address employee perspectives in theirindividual performance plans and appraised their performance on thebasis of the training provided to staff safe and healthy workenvironment teamwork employee satisfaction and fairness anddiversityIn addition we identified an initial set of selectedimplementation approaches BLM FHWA IRS and VBA are taking thatmay be helpful to other agencies as they manage senior executiveperformance against balanced expectations BLM FHWA IRS andVBAProvide useful data The agencies provide seniorexecutives with objective data to help them manage their balancedexpectations during the year For example data systems at BLM andVBA provide realtime data to help senior executives track theirindividual performance against organizational results and allowthem to compare their performance against others In addition theagencies disaggregated data from agencywide surveys so that theresults were applicable to the senior executives customers andemployeesRequire followup action IRS and FHWA require seniorexecutives to identify action items to follow up on customer andemployee issues For example IRS requires executives to holdworkgroup meetings and develop action plans to follow up oncustomer and employee issues identified through agencywide surveysIn addition FHWA requires senior executives to use degreefeedback instruments to solicit employee views on the executivesleadership skills and then incorporate action items into theirindividual performance plans based on the resultsMake meaningful distinctions in performance The agenciesare working at implementing effective performance managementsystems that make meaningful distinctions in senior executiveperformance such as by identifying varying levels of significanceand complexity among senior executive performance and consideringthese levels in awarding bonuses Towards this end IRS establishedan executive compensation plan for determining base salaryperformance bonuses and other awards for senior executives thatcorresponds bonus levels to different levels of responsibilitiesand commitments FHWA weights the elements it uses to appraisesenior executive performance to make distinctions among itsexecutives performanceBLM FHWA IRS and VBA recognize that they are in the earlystages of implementation in using a balanced set of expectations aspart of their senior executive performance management systems Notsurprisingly therefore there are significant opportunities tostrengthen their efforts as they move forward in holding seniorexecutives accountable for results In particular more progress isneeded in explicitly linking senior executive expectations forperformance to resultsoriented organizational goals Efforts atmaking this direct linkage were often very limited In additionwhile these agencies address partnering with customers and otherstakeholders greater emphasis should be placed in fostering thenecessary collaboration both within and across organizationalboundaries to achieve resultsLastly there is a growing recognition driven by a variety ofworldwide trends and pressing longterm fiscal challenges that thefederal government is on the brink of an enormous transformation inwhat the government does how it does business and in some caseswho does the governments business Ultimately successfulorganizations understand that they must often change their cultureto successfully transform themselves and that such a change startswith top leadership SeniorBackgroundexecutive performance and accountability for change managementwill therefore be critical to the success of the federalgovernments transformation A specific performance expectation tolead and facilitate change could be a critical element as agenciestransform themselves to succeed in an environment that is moreresults oriented less hierarchical and more integrated TheCommissioner of Internal Revenue provided written commentsgenerally agreeing with the contents of a draft of this report Inaddition cognizant agency officials from BLM FHWA and VBAgenerally agreed with a draft of this reportStrategic human capital management and specifically the need todevelop resultsoriented organizational cultures is receivingincreased attention across the federal government The Congress hasunderscored the consequences of human capital weaknesses through awide range of oversight hearings held over the last few years Inaddition to foster a resultsoriented culture in federal agenciesthe Congress is considering legislative proposals to among otherthings focus attention on the impact poor performance can have onthe effectiveness of an organization and require agencies to have achief human capital officer to select develop and manage aproductive highquality workforceThe Presidents Management Agenda released in August identified human capital as one of the five key governmentwidemanagement challenges currently facing the federal governmentSubsequently the Office of Management and Budget and OPM developedcriteria that recognized the importance of creating a performanceculture that appraises and rewards employees based on theircontributions to organizational goals as a key dimension ofeffective human capital

leadership  strategic human capital planning  acquiringdeveloping and retaining talent and  resultsorientedorganizational cultures Within the cornerstone ofresultsoriented GAOSPorganizational cultures a critical success factor is linkingunit and individual performance to organizational goalsOne way to reinforce accountability and alignment of individualperformance expectations with organizational goals is through theuse of resultsoriented performance agreements We have reportedthat other countries have begun to use their performance managementsystems as a strategic tool to help achieve results Inparticular they use performance agreements to align and cascadeorganizational goals to individual performance expectations throughseveral levels in their organizations They also use performanceagreements to help identify the crosscutting connections bothwithin and between agencies and align the performance commitmentsof toplevel executives with broader governmentwide prioritiesFurther our work has shown that US agencies have benefitedfrom their use of resultsoriented performance agreements forpolitical and senior career executives Although each agencydeveloped and implemented performance agreements that reflected itsspecific organizational priorities structures and cultures theperformance agreements met the following characteristics Theystrengthened alignment

targets set for the national andregional office levels According to VBA officials the scorecardhelps employees understand how they can affect the results of theorganization Senior executives refer to the balanced scorecarddata at their leadership meetings discuss how they performedrelative to the scorecard and identify the causes behindoutstanding and poor performanceDisaggregated survey data Specific customer and employeefeedback helps senior executives pinpoint actions to improveproducts and services for customers and to enhance employeesatisfaction BLM FHWA IRS and VBA disaggregated the data fromagencywide customer and employee satisfaction surveys so that theresults were applicable to a senior executives customers andemployees For example from its Use Authorization Surveyadministered to its various customers in fiscal year  BLMdisaggregated the survey data to provide the applicable results toindividual senior executives who head the state officesSpecifically the senior executive in the Montana state officereceived data for his state showing that  percent of the grazingpermit customers surveyed gave a favorable rating for thetimeliness of permit processing and for service quality In hisselfassessment for the  performance appraisal cycle he statedthat issuing grazing permits has progressed without any problem orbacklogs and that permittees have not experienced any delaysVBA disaggregates its survey results to the regional offices andpolicy and program support offices that are larger than employees in order to allow the senior executives to determineactions that are appropriate for their offices In  VBAadministered its most recent employee survey to measure aspects oforganizational climate related to high performance For eachquestion on the survey VBA provided the office results and the VBAaverage as well as baseline data from surveys conducted in and  For example  percent of the employees surveyed in theSt Paul regionalRequire Followup Actionsoffice either strongly agreed or agreed that managers providedan environment that supports employee involvement contributionsand teamwork According to the  survey results this percentageis slightly higher than the VBA average of  percent and indicatedan improvement from the  percent the office scored on thisquestion in both the  and  employee surveys VBA compiles anational report of the results so that senior executives cancompare how their office scored against other offices and VBA as awholeIRS disaggregates data to the workgroup level from itsIRSNational Treasury Employees Union Employee Satisfaction Surveywhich measures general satisfaction with IRS the workplace andthe union The Gallup Organization administers this survey to allemployees which is comprised of Gallups  questions Qadditional questions unique to IRS such as views on local unionchapters and employee organizations as well as questions on issuesIRS has been tracking over time Gallup provides the results foreach workgroup For example a senior executive can compare how hisworkgroup performed to other operating divisions and to IRS as awhole Specifically one senior executives workgroup scored out of a possible  for having the materials and equipment theyneed to do their work right compared to the IRSwide score of on the survey To allow senior executives and managers to benchmarkexternally Gallup compares each workgroups results to the thmedian and th best practices percentile scores from GallupsQ database To benchmark internally IRS provides theservicewide results from the previous years survey in eachworkgroup reportAs part of its senior executive performance management systemIRS and FHWA require their senior executives to follow up oncustomer and employee issues To improve customer satisfaction theCommissioner of Internal Revenue set an expectation that thebusiness units headed by senior executives develop action plansbased on customer survey data that are relevant to the needs oftheir particular customers IRS provided guidance to seniorexecutives and managers to help them understand and interpret thecustomer survey data identify areas for improvement and developaction plans to respond to customers issues and concerns Gallup identified  questions that measure employeeperspective and according to Gallup the responses to thesequestions link directly to organizational outcomesPage  GAO Senior Executive Performance ManagementFor example to address the customer satisfaction expectation inhis fiscal year  individual performance plan an IRS seniorexecutive who is the area director for compliance in Laguna NiguelCalifornia requires each of his territory managers to present anaction plan identifying ways to improve low scores from customersurveys He then rolls up these managers plans into a consolidatedarea action plan for which he is responsible Specifically anexpectation in his action plan is to improve how customers aretreated during collection and examination activities by ensuringthat examiners explain to customers their taxpayer rights as wellas why they were selected for examination and what they couldexpect Further the senior executive plans to ensure thatterritory managers solicit feedback from customers on theirtreatment during these activities and identify specific reasons forany customer dissatisfaction In his midyear selfassessment forfiscal year  the senior executive stated that substantialprogress is being made in achieving the collection and examinationcustomer satisfaction goalsSimilarly to address employee perspectives IRS requires seniorexecutives to hold workgroup meetings with their employees todiscuss the workgroups Employee Satisfaction Survey results anddevelop action plans to address these results According to asenior executive in IRSs criminal investigation unit theworkgroup meetings were beneficial because they increasedcommunication with employees and identified improvements in thequality of worklife For example through the workgroup meetingsemployees identified the need for recruiting supervisory specialagents to even out some of the workload Subsequently the seniorexecutive set an expectation in his fiscal year  individualperformance plan to ensure that the field office has a strongrecruitment program to attract viable candidates He also has anexpectation to ensure his field offices hold timely workgroupmeetings and develop and implement action plans to address concernsidentified during these meetingsTo reinforce the importance of followup action IRS developed aWebbased database system to track workgroup issues across IRSAccording to an IRS official the system is being upgraded toimprove its usefulness for senior executives and will allow them totrack their progress in completing the actions identified in theworkgroup meetings In addition all employees will be able toaccess summary information to help identify trends in the dataacross workgroups The system will also provide employees with theopportunity to share best practice information on resolvedworkgroup issuesMake Meaningful Distinctions inPerformanceTo help meet their employee perspective performanceexpectations FHWA requires senior executives to use degreefeedback instruments to solicit employee views on their leadershipskills Based on the degree feedback senior executives are toidentify action items and incorporate them into their individualperformance plans for the next fiscal year FHWA piloted thedegree feedback instrument for half its leadership team ofsenior executives in fiscal year  and scheduled the rest forfiscal year  The degree feedback process is designed toprovide an executive direct input from various sourcespeerscustomers and subordinates and to compare those results to aselfevaluation and input from a supervisorWhile the degree feedback instrument is intended fordevelopmental purposes to help senior executives identify areas forimprovement and is not included in the executives performanceevaluation executives are held accountable for taking some actionwith the degree feedback results and responding to the concernof their peers customers and subordinates For example based ondegree feedback a senior executive for field servicesidentified better communications with subordinates and increasedcollaboration among colleagues as areas for improvement and asrequired he then incorporated action items into his individualperformance plan In fiscal year  he set a performanceexpectation to develop a leadership selfimprovement action planand identify appropriate improvement goals In his selfassessmentfor fiscal year  he reported that he improved his personalcontact and attention to the division offices as evidenced by a percent increase in visits to the divisions that year Also hestated that he encouraged his subordinates to assess theirleadership skills Consequently  of his  subordinates are usingdegree feedback instruments to improve their personalleadership competenciesAccording to OPM the amended regulations were designed torecognize that effective performance management requires agencyleadership to make meaningful distinctions between acceptable andoutstanding performance of senior executives and to appropriatelyreward those who perform at the highest level Effectiveperformance management systems provide agencies with the objectiveand factbased information they need to distinguish levels ofperformance among senior executives and serve as a basis for bonusrecommendationsOPM data on senior executive performance ratings indicate thatagencies across the federal government are not making meaningfuldistinctions among senior executives performance Specificallyagencies rated about  percent and  percent of senior executivesat the highest level their systems permit in their performanceratings in fiscal years  and  respectively Nearly all ofthe senior executives are rated using three and fivelevel ratingsystems with the majority of senior executives rated underfivelevel systems When disaggregating the data by ratingsystem the percentage of senior executives that received thehighest level rating under fivelevel systems was approximately and  percent in fiscal years  and  respectively In thesame period the percent of senior executives receiving the highestlevel rating under threelevel systems was about  percentIn addition OPM data show that governmentwide approximately percent of senior executives received bonuses each year sincefiscal year  Between fiscal years  and  the averagebonus payment increased from about  to  OPMofficials told us that they plan to closely monitor thedistribution of fiscal year  performance ratings andbonusesIRS FHWA VBA and BLM recognize that they are still working atimplementing effective performance management systems that makemeaningful distinctions in senior executive performance Forexample IRS established an executive compensation plan fordetermining base salary performance bonuses and other awards forits senior executives that is intended to explicitly linkindividual performance to organizational performance and isdesigned to emphasize performance To recognize performance acrossdifferent levels of responsibilities and commitments IRS assignssenior executives to one of three bonus levels at the beginning ofthe performance appraisal cycle Assignments depend on the seniorexecutives responsibilities and commitments in their individualperformance plans for the year as well as the scope of their workand its The rating levels for fivelevel systems includeunsatisfactory minimally satisfactory fully successfulfirst level above fully successful and second level above fullysuccessful and the threelevel rating systems includeunsatisfactory minimally satisfactory and fullysuccessful By regulation bonus amounts paid to individual career seniorexecutives are limited to between  and  percent of theexecutives basic pay Agency bonus totals cannot exceed thegreater of  percent of the aggregate career senior executivebasic pay or  percent of the average rates of career seniorexecutive basic pay In compliance with the Internal RevenueService Restructuring and Reform Act of  IRSs bonus totalscannot exceed  percent of the aggregate career senior

levelwith the highest responsibilities and commitmentsonly if they area part of the Senior Leadership Team IRS restricts the number ofsenior executives assigned to each bonus level for each businessunitIn addition for each bonus level IRS establishes set bonusranges by individual summary evaluation rating which is intendedto reinforce the link between performance and rewards The bonuslevels and corresponding bonus amounts of base salary by summaryrating are shown in table Table  IRSs Bonus Levels and Bonus Ranges of Base Salary forSenior Executive Summary Evaluation

trend data before they evaluate the link betweenperformance and bonus decisionsFHWA weights the elements it uses to appraise senior executiveperformance to make meaningful distinctions among its seniorexecutives These elements include  strategic and performanceplan accomplishments and corporate management improvements andresults and  job significance and complexity The seniorexecutives receive a score totaling  points with a maximum of points for strategic and performance plan accomplishments andcorporate management improvements and results and a maximum of points for job significance and complexity FHWA providesdefinitions for assigning points For example to receive all points for strategic and performance plan accomplishments theexecutive must achieve all the performance expectations identifiedin the individual performance plan including exceptionaladvancement on the corporate management strategies To receive all points for job significance and complexity the executive musthave a position that is highly visible with a high degree ofdifficulty due to legislation court decisions politicalpressures and other factors Rating officials use these scores

identified corecompetencies and supporting behaviors for senior executives tofollow that are intended to contribute to results they identifiedto a much lesser extent targets for senior executives to meet thatare directly linked to organizational goals In addition theyidentified expectations for senior executive performance forcustomer satisfaction and employee perspectivesThese agencies have taken the first steps in creating aperformance management system for senior executives that is astrategic tool for holding individuals accountable for theircontributions to results and organizational success Their initialimplementation approaches to manage senior executives performancerecognize the importance of providing useful data so thatexecutives can track their individual performance againstorganizational results on a realtime basis and the benefit ofrequiring followup action on customer and employee issues throughworkgroup meetings and action plans However these agencies alsoacknowledge that they are still working at implementing effectivesystems that can make meaningful distinctions in performanceThere are significant opportunities to strengthen these effortsas they move forward in holding senior executives accountable forresults In particular more progress is needed in explicitlylinking senior executive expectations for performance toresultsoriented organizational goals fostering the necessarycollaboration both within and across organizational boundaries toachieve results and demonstrating a commitment to lead andfacilitate change These
