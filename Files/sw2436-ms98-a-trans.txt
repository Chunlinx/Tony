        well i havent had too much of a chance to watch TV lately so probably everything im going to say is kind of dated   yeah well i can understand that its its that time of the year uh we just uh my wife and i just recently moved into our house so were   yeah oh   spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but um i like to keep up to date too um i guess   yeah yeah uhhuh   in the since i got out of college which was about five years ago ive my TV viewing started to tend more towards uh documentary news programs things like that something thats going to keep me up to date ive kind of kind of gotten away from uh being a series watcher having to keep up to date with uh   umhum umhum oh yeah i think when youre in college you kind of you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week   umhum yeah that makes a big difference   so so yeah i i used to when my kids were real little and i was home i watched uh i was home more i watched things on a more regular basis but right now the last thing i watched regularly was Thirty Something when it first came out did yall ever watch that   okay yeah i yeah started too and uh kind of kind of worked away from that   yeah yeah   i i have a hard time sticking with something like on on on on TV because it like it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or two  you feel kind of left out but um   yeah yeah yeah right right i know but ill tell you what um were really strict with our kids about television and one night a couple of weeks ago   umhum   it was just a just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch and we said okay well well sit down and well you know look at what you want to see lets just turn it on and see whats on we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it   i believe that   and so we you know and it was prime time it was what seven thirty eight oclock on a week night and no we have cable and there wasnt anything on any channel and and the stuff that was on the prime the networks you know ABC NBC CBS   umhum umhum   was it was just um dribble   yeah   do you know i mean it wasnt even funny it wasnt creative it it was the worst ive seen i mean i have not watched prime time week night TV i guess in a real long time  because i was shocked   thats right yeah well i i know exactly how you feel   you know what im saying   thats right i i uh when i first moved down here uh moved into the apartment and got cable and uh i guess i sort of kind of became numb numb uh nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the TV you know and then all of a sudden i started paying paying attention to um   umhum     to network TV again once in a while right now we dont have cable and its surprising how much its changed the you know the the whole moral situation everything is just just gone one whole complete direction different   right right umhum yeah   and uh we we dont have any kids yet but i i feel the same way its really tough to find something   umhum umhum   thats thats uh thats going to be good and interesting for the kids even even cartoons um you you know you  you watch uh you watch some of the cartoons and   right right oh yeah   kids kids arent even going to understand half the humor thats in there it none of its probably damaging lot of times but uh   right right its just its just uh like a necessary evil i mean when we when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we we just had Sesame Street and that was about it you know   right right   but now in order to seem you know humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff but its just one of those things you know you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if youre   oh yes yeah thats right   if youre in the room so but its such a shame because it could be so good i i dont understand why first of all why the public puts up with it and second of all why the networks think that   thats right well thats true   you know we enjoy that kind of stuff i cant its hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that that cant be the problem it must be the marketing pressures and   uhhuh   you know their demographic studies that they do that show you know that everybodys IQ has dropped dramatically  or something   thats  im glad you said it and i didnt have to but that that thats the i feel the exact same way i sit i sit and watch some shows and uh and im embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show you know why do you do this to yourself     i know why do you do this   yeah   i know im trying to think if theres anything i do you like uh i like stuff thats on Great Performances and i we used to watch mystery quite quite a bit and enjoyed that   okay yeah   stuff i guess thats mostly public on public TV as a matter of fact you know when i was a kid  excuse me my parents used to have we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular TV that we watched we had to watch an hour of public TV   right now theres an idea   that was just the rule and if they saw us watching something theyd say all right what did you see on Whats New or there was some other the childrens program i think at the time was called Whats New so we had to give a little oral report before we could   um okay yeah   watch our program but do you watch do you watch sports on TV are you a sports fan   yeah yeah thats thats pretty good i cant handle it very long  i i mean im im a sports fan but its   yeah  yeah uhhuh   well its kind of its kind of like reading magazines any more If half of the time wasnt spent watching commercials it probably wouldnt be so bad but uh it its youre missing an awful lot id rather personally rather watch   umhum right yeah yeah   see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium but uh but uh no i dont sit down ill sit down for the big games the Super Bowl and the championship   yeah thats true the traffic um yeah yeah   you know things like that But i dont follow any team i check the scores the next morning and i know how everybodys doing and that suffices me But   umhum umhum yeah yeah   i like i like good comedy good humor once in a while   yeah i i enjoy that but what do you where do you   well   oh do you get the comedy you dont have cable now i was going to say they have a comedy channel now but again youre in a situation where youre watching mostly uh commercials and then youre   no we dont yeah yeah   you know trying to pass the time to wait till the next comedian comes up you know what i did there was a time there where i could um tape things and then id fast forward through the  commercials saved a lot of time that way   right uhhuh yeah it works you bet yeah   but that takes too much planning   yeah no i dont know if theres any any series that i pay attention to i try to watch Cheers once in a while   um now that yeah is that still real good it used to be real good is it   yeah it is in fact its i think its on tonight  i just got in from outside so i so im kind of   oh oh okay   out of it Things like that and i consider that fairly intelligent humor you know   yeah yeah yeah   you can tell they pick up the words every once in a while   right right right isnt it such such a long running   yeah   program yeah they do have a good they do have good writers for that oh that makes me think do you watch Saturday Night Live at all   i try to   yeah we try to stay up too   yeah  if   its getting harder and harder ten years ago wasnt so hard to stay up to watch it   well yeah you know and and it was it was just automatic too no matter where you were you stopped and and sat down and watched it i think its come around again its gone through cycles but uh     yeah right yeah yeah it was it we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there but we started watching again   uhhuh   but its a real different show than it was when it started its its funny now and its better but its real different than what it used to be but you cant be uh so um you cant be outrageous   yeah thats right thats right right   you know if you keep that same format theres only so long that you can be outrageous so   thats for sure  that is for sure   so   well i guess theres a few things around still but uh   yeah you have to hunt hard for them i guess   yeah sounds like we pretty much agree   yeah i guess so   well   well   its been uh good talking to you   yeah good talking to you   okay   take care bye   you too bye
