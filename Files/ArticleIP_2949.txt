                                 Sweetness and Bite            Early in June  acertain Detective Young in Scotland testified before a Joint ParliamentaryCommittee examining issues of public morality He had seen boys and girlskissing and smoking and cuddling away at each other in an icecream parlor hesaid He had encountered yearold girls lured into prostitution by sugarThen the following exchange occurred                                                          Q Do you ask us to believe that the downfall of these women was due toicecream shops                                                A I believe itis                                       That delirious transcriptis part of the story of the triumph of refined sugar over oldfashioned honeythat takes up almost half of Sidney Mintzs new book Tasting Food TastingFreedom Excursions Into Eating Culture and the Past  Mintz ananthropologist at Johns Hopkins University and author of Sweetness andPower a more detailed look at sugar and its meaning also explores othertopics ranging from the broader relationship between political power and foodto more idiosyncratic excursions such as the chapter entitled Color Tasteand Purity Some Speculations on the Meanings of Marzipan            But its the saga ofrefined sugar that forms the core of this book a tale Mintz punctuates withtelling historical surprises In the sweetener competition for example sugarreceived an early and unexpected boost from Henry VIII In  when the kingabolished the monasteries the decline in demand for candle wax slowed thehoney output and opened a window for sugar Detective Young was able to indulgein his cheap moralizing four centuries later because back then everythingabout sugar was suspectits novelty and potency its exotic origin in MoorishSpain its pure pharmocopoeal whiteness Honey on the other hand was one ofour first foods dating to the Paleolithic Era It was comparatively mild intaste always locally produced natural and gooeytrustworthy even good forthe youth            In time sugar became thefirst imported luxury to become a cheap daily necessity of the masses andalong with tea and tobacco it probably provides us with the first instancein history of the mass consumption of imported food staples As th century British aristocrats wallowed in sugar the workingclass yearned for it creating a demand that would underlie the expansion ofenormous sugar plantations in the Caribbean and hence the slave trade Forpoliticians sugar became an eminently taxable commodity and acquired manychampions in the press in the medical journals in the Foreign Office and inParliament It introduced the West to a new source of political powermassproducers before whom elected officials would need to bow and scrape            Wevenever stopped linking sugar with notions of good and evil Mintz quotes someastonishing speeches by Abolitionists who easily equated cane sugar withmurder one of them even providing the precise calculus In every pound ofsugar used the product of the slaves imported from Africa we may beconsidered as consuming two ounces of blood Sugars aura of evil endures tothis daythats what those pink and blue packages on every restaurant tablesignify At the same time vestiges of its virtuedating from a time when agift of confectionery was both rare and prizedsurvive in every box ofValentines Day candy No one who reads these chapters will scoop up anotherspoonful of sugar without reflecting on the history of ambivalence globalturmoil and centuries of suffering needed to put it on the table            None of Mintzs other chapters is quite as satisfying asthe three devoted to sugar Still this is a book whose bibliography includesmonographs entitled Private Tooth Decay as Public Economic Virtue andtomes such as The History and Social Influence of the Potato so therest of it is still loaded with nuggets worth finding The dominance of Cokefor example in the cola wars may date to the influence of Gen George Marshalla Southerner who was able to get CocaCola Atlantabased exempted from thewartime rationing of sugar As a result  bottling plants were built in boththeaters of battle and  bottling technicians served there Three bottlersgave their lives for their country            Toward the end of thebook Mintz tells a story about offhandedly mentioning in a lecture thatAmerica has no cuisine The students reaction was swift and contentious asif their feelings had been hurt Mintz seems puzzled musing that it wasnt asthough hed said America had no literature But it does hit a nerve so Mintzspends his last chapter pondering the question of whether America has a cuisineafter all            Heanswers with an academic distinction Regional cuisines Mintz says areauthentic because they use local ingredients and involve a community ofpeople who eat it cook it have opinions about it and engage in dialogueinvolving those opinions On the other hand national cuisines are largelyartificial constructs You wont find a French restaurant in France forobvious reasons The blueplate specials typically offered as Americancuisinehamburgers pizza fried chicken baked beans hot dogsarent worthconsidering Mintz says despite such irrepressible enthusiasts as Edna Lewisand Betty Fussell His nouns in this chapter do begin to grate He thenconcludes I dont think anyone wants to call that array a cuisine Thatsright array            Mintz dismisses our regional cuisinesNew EnglandSouthern Cajun Pennsylvania Dutchbecause they have been ruined by theenvironmental impact of overfishing local stocks and by ferocious marketingthat dilutes their authenticity and ends in bowdlerization But this isfood which means that its not easy for all irrepressible enthusiasts to sitstill and listen Mintz means to start an argument to lay out a polemic butwhats nettlesome is not his answer but the question If cuisines emergeorganically over time from rooted people then why pose the question about apeople who have come to epitomize rootlessness            Instead he might haveconsulted the works of JB Jackson the architecture critic who observed thatmost American architecture isnt meant to last Americans throw up office parksand strip malls one year tear them down the next and build something else Soto judge Americas fleeting architecture by Europes canonical standards ispreposterous Ditto with food Americans make no time for dialogue much lesscuisine Theyre scouting out new food fads scarfing them down and thenrooting about for the next one Had a blackened redfish lately Probably notPaul Prudhomme was so  Enjoy this years mesclun salads The end isnigh            Even Mintz senses thebathos of ending his book on such a weak note So he tacks on different endingby turning in his own words to an unbelievably grim scenario He cites oneof those suspiciously Malthusian studies forecasting a biblical future ofscarce water arid fields and a desperately hungry America Then he  wellsurprisingly he moralizes Mintz suggests that consumption gluttony willprompt another Operation Desert Storm but this time for meat Its effects onAmerican moral integrity he intones would be utterly disastrous Worsewe might let our obsessive notions of individual freedom destroy ourdemocracy Oh for the restraint of Detective Young
