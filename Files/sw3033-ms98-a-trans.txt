            okay well good morning and uh i guess the topic here is going to be hobbies hobbies and if you have any just tell me what they are   right well right now the main thing that ive been doing craft wise anyway is uh i make earrings out of paper and buttons and i do sweatshirts and um     really   yes how about you   oh that sounds fascinating um well im im pretty traditional ive ive been doing um a little bit of quilting and uh made my first quilt ever i mean its wonderful its beautiful i dont know if therell be a second one but the first one is you know hand pieced and hand sewn and it took months upon months to do this anyway um       theres that and then uh now i ive developed an interest in watercolor so im taking some classes over at Michaels and im trying to uh make it look good   that sounds really interesting my husband does uh painting hes been doing in acrylics and he wanted to do some things in watercolor i hear thats one of the hardest mediums to work in however   i dont know that i just someone gave me some paints for Christmas one year and i said okay ill try this   are you pretty artistic   i guess i am im ive ive been sort of painting stuff and people say why dont you let me hang that in my room you know so ive got stuff hanging in peoples houses that i look at now and i go oh i can do so much better than that so i guess ive you know       developed somewhere along the line but um you know its its an interesting thing and i really do like it its real peaceful its real quiet you know   well to me the quilting sounds like the thing that would be the hardest to stick with because it is so time consuming   it is its amazing the results are incredible   have you thought about selling them   um no because i cant get beyond making this first quilt im afraid  if i make another one im keeping it  the watercolor i can dash off in twenty minutes and thats you know its finished but um yeah the quilting forget it   oh   um i would even join a quilting group maybe to help somebody else finish their quilt sort of thing   well you know what ive kind of been looking for i sew not as much as i used to but uh i have scraps of fabric and i thought itd be nice if i could find you know maybe uh in senior citizens home or something to give the pieces to maybe these people could use a little bits of uh you know leftover fabric   youre right yeah they love that that would be good really and uh   all you have to do is figure out how to get hold of some of these people   yeah i yeah im finding out that um there there are an awful lot of quilters out there and and its not just traditional quilting either people you know are using it for making clothes   huh   they have of they make they call them crazy quilts   like the vests or something   the vests and things like that and they make whole outfits out of you know scraps of this and that and its getting to be a real art form what you wear on your back  you know  maybe youd like to try it  um but i think its great that we have the availability here to you know um like Michaels       and and be able to be trained and and do some things like that so thats a lot of fun i   well i was looking into uh i wanted to take a flower arranging class class and i called i think i called Michaels and Zaks both and as it turned out the month that i called they didnt have anything and then i didnt call back   oh oh   but i think itd be nice to learn how to arrange silk flowers and uh save yourself some money on some of the flower arrangements   oh sure oh absolutely and i just i love flowers i you know i got to have flowers around me you know kind of thing um but the button thing now that sounds really interesting you make earrings   uhhuh umhum some of them ill just uh well years ago when i was sewing quite a bit i found a place that you could buy bags of buttons   uhhuh   you know assorted buttons and oh sometimes you got ten of a kind sometimes you got one of a kind but anyway i decided when i started making paper earrings maybe id branch out a little bit and i got out my button collection and there were a lot of things in there that i could make particularly the metal ones you know i could just put backs on them   oh right   um id have to clip off the uh shanks and all but then some of them after i ran out of that i just started painting them with my uh sweatshirt paints and you know making things to match my outfits   oh how clever   so ive been having a good time with that   right my my sisterinlaw up uh in Illinois she was well in a real rural area and shes starting to collect antique buttons and she makes big huge pins out of them and these big wooden buttons are just  um you know theyre all sort of layered and put together and glued and back and everything but they are just incredible theyre so pretty   uhhuh well a friend of mine said uh had a pin that was made out of antique buttons and the thing was just gorgeous   yeah and its theyre all wooden buttons its really neat and she says everybody up there wears buttons on their socks   oh really   yeah they just you know um do some artistic thing with the buttons and i dont know if they hot glue them on or whatever but   i guess that hasnt hit in Dallas yet i havent seen any of that   yeah i know well this is this is mid state Illinois i dont know how long it will take if it ever gets here you know but thats what theyre doing with buttons down or up there but its really neat i i uh       and and you do the painting on the Tshirts too the sweatshirts   uhhuh well thats what we did for Christmas as a matter of fact for all our friends and family we gave them the hand painted sweatshirts and thank goodness my husband helped me with it because i think i had about fourteen to do   oh oh there you are   and uh i thought ill ill either be working on this constantly or im never going to have these finished by Christmas but they really did turn out pretty i was really pleased with them   what kind of medium do you use on them or do you like glitter and painting scenes and   uh i usually use a transfer weve done some southwest things and uh ive done some flowers but i havent gotten so far as to do oh you know some of the little pin on   yeah   uh bows and everything its strictly been painting so far but ill use um i did use some glitter paint on a Christmas one and some in some of the metallic paints   oh well still     and you know each time i do one i try something a little bit different   um oh well see thats thats really neat thats a great outlet   the only problem is ive done so many i dont know when i want to touch another sweatshirt again     well Christmas is only six months away now  really i  the year goes so fast its  an incredible thing well im sure we enjoyed talking to you today   oh i know i better get started right   well thanks for calling   and uh i think this is great and keep on with those sweatshirts   well its fun you get other peoples ideas on things too   really thats true well you too byebye now   have a good weekend byebye
