                                 Economic Data An Infinite Loop                        Everyone knowsor at least were supposed to knowthat the market for USstocks today is dominated by momentum traders day traders and technicaltraders none of whom are paying attention to the underlying fundamentals ofthe companies whose shares theyre buying and selling and all of whom areputting the US economy at risk by converting the stock market into anelaborate shell gamepyramid scheme            As it happens this is wrong There are lots of momentum traders and daytraders and technical traders but there always have been and in any case theincreased volume on the stock market and the greater number of traders hasalmost certainly made stock prices more efficient and more accurate indicatorsof underlying value than they once were            Whats interesting about this though is that the same picture is veryrarely drawn of the bond market even though if you talk to or listen to bondtraders what you mostly hear is a host of technical informationstuff aboutthe trend of bond prices over the last month or last week about support levelsthat bond prices have to hold or break through and about overboughtoversoldindicators that are or are not flashing green or red And you also get a lot ofrapid reaction to things like Alan Greenspan speeches or employmentcostindexnumbers The conventional image of bondholders is that theyre conservativelongterm careful investors Why else would you be content with a  percentyield for  long years But bond traders are as manicno more manic thantheir counterparts in the equity market            This doesnt mean that the bond market is any less efficient than the stockmarket though it does seem a bit curious But what bond traders reliance ontechnical analysisthe idea that future price movements can be deduced bystudying the patterns of past price movementsspeaks to is just how impossibleit is to successfully predict a market in which every piece of potentialinformation seems to point in two different directions at once and in whichthere seems to be nothing that doesnt count as potential information            Take todays tradedeficit number Although it was the third worst in UShistory it was still weaker than expected and smaller than last months tradedeficit That was good news for the US dollar which rallied and since bondshaveat least recentlybeen following the dollar it might have been goodnews for the bond market On the other hand a weaker trade deficit meant thatUS exports were up sharply which means that people were working more andfactories were producing more which probably means higher growth andpotentially higher inflation That seems like it would be bad news forbondholders who hate inflation            But then you had to consider that imports actually rose  percentsuggesting that the American consumer is still buying foreign goods freely andthat potential inflation from the weaker dollar which would drive up the priceof foreign goods hasnt had much of an impact So maybe inflation is stillreally just a mirage But wait If US exports are up that must mean thatforeign demand is rebounding and since the slump of the rest of the globaleconomy has helped keep commodity prices down a global rebound could haveinflationary implications So that could be bad news            Then you have to divide the import side of the trade deficit ledger intononcommodity and commodity goods particularly since oilprice hikes had a bigimpact in the last month And you probably want to take a look at capitalflows too And then theres             This is all fascinating no really it is but it is also a Moebius stripin which its difficult to tell where anything begins or ends And we haventeven taken into account that the bond market needs to interpret not only allthese numbers but also what impact the numbers will have on the Fed and thenin turn what impact the Feds interpretation of the data will have on futurenumbers            Given all that its not too surprising that the bond market preferred tomeander around today basically ending where it began Set yourself theimpossible task of predicting a macroeconomic future and your head will startto hurt too
