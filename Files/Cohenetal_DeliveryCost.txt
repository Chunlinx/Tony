Delivery Cost Heterogeneity and Vulnerability to EntryStephane BernardLa PosteRobert CohenPostal Rate CommissionMatthew RobinsonPostal Rate CommissionBernard RoyLa PosteJolle ToledanoLa PosteJohn WallerPostal Rate CommissionSpyros XenakisPostal Rate Commission INTRODUCTIONVirtually every post in an industrialized country deliversmonopoly products everywhere at a uniform price in spite of largedifferences in the cost of serving different geographic areas Thisraises the possibility of an entrant competing successfully eventhough it has higher costs than the incumbent A simple exampleillustrates this Suppose a post serves a country composed of twoareas and its cost to deliver a piece of mail in one area is fivecents and is  cents in the other A breakeven post with a uniformtariff would charge its average cost of  cents a piece fordelivery throughout the country If a less efficient entrants costfor serving the low cost area were six cents a piece it couldcharge less than  cents in that area and be profitable Eachpiece of mail that the entrant delivered would raise the averagecost of delivery in the country Ceteris paribus inefficient entrymeans that the total resources required to deliver mailincreasesThe views expressed in this paper are those of the authors anddo not necessarily represent the opinions of La Poste or the PostalRate CommissionIf in the above example the cost had been nine cents in the lowcost area and  cents in the high cost area it would be much moredifficult for inefficient entry to occur Delivery costheterogeneity is an essential condition for inefficient entry andthe degree of the heterogeneity would play an important role indetermining the vulnerability to inefficient entryThe delivery function is the most important source of inherentcost differences between the geographic areas served by a post andindeed between posts themselves This paper explores the reasonsthat underlie differences in delivery costs among geographic areasWe do this by comparing delivery costs in two diverse countriesFrance and the US We think that international comparisons canlead to important insightsWe first present demographic and postal delivery characteristicsfor the two countries This leads us to develop the concept ofpostal density as a measure that reflects the impact of thesecharacteristics on delivery costs We examine differences in postaldensity for rural areas and for densely populated areas to identifythe effect of different delivery practices in each country Acomparison is then made of the heterogeneity in delivery costs forFrance and the US We proceed to explore the relative roles ofpostal density and volume as delivery cost drivers Finally wecompare the engineering and econometric approaches used to estimateunit delivery costs for France and the US respectively overreasonable ranges of the delivery cost drivers The data used forthe analysis are described in the Appendix SOME BASIC COMPARISONSIt would seem that the variation of delivery costs within theUS would be greater than in France Population density in theformer ranges from very high New York City to very low Wyomingand Montana France on the other hand has densely populatedcities but no areas as sparsely settled as in the United StatesSurprisingly however we will find that France has a greatervariation in delivery costsFrance has  persons per square kilometer and the US has A greater percentage of the French population lives in citieswhile a larger percentage of the US population lives in suburbsThe distance between delivery points in France is much smaller thanin the US and consequently the modes of delivery are verydifferent as can be seen in Table The conditions for competitive entry depend on several otherfactors as well Cohen et al  Cremer et al The population density people per square kilometer of the fiveleast densely populated states in the continentalUS are Wyoming  Montana  South Dakota  NorthDakota  and Nevada  The population density of the two leastpopulated departments of France Creuse and Lozre is  personsper square kilometerTable  Comparison of Mode of Delivery by Route in France andthe USaRounds to less than one percentbPark and loop refers to a route where the carrier parks his orher vehicle and serves a group ofhouses on foot returns to the vehicle and drives to anotherlocation where the process isrepeated cAutomobile includes small trucksThe geographic concentration of the French population permitsmuch more efficient delivery by foot or bicycle than in the USIn France only carriers serving rural areas use automobiles but inthe US it is the primary means of delivery The quality ofdelivery service is also higher in France where all delivery is toa building In the US delivery is made to buildings and also tocurbside mailboxes in cities and suburbs and to rural roadsidemailboxes This allows the carrier to place mail in the mailboxdirectly from the vehicle In addition in US rural areascarriers serve principal roads only and residents who do not liveon the carriers line of travel must place their mailboxes on thatroad This frequently results in roadside boxes being clusteredwhere the carriers line of travel intersects with roads not on theline of travel These boxes are less expensive to serve than ifthey were spread out along the intersecting roadUnlike France the US also makes extensive use of kiosks fordelivery They allow more efficient delivery because the carriermakes only one stop to deliver to several addresses commercial orresidential This requires recipients to walk some distance fromtheir homes or offices to the kiosk to collect their mail Eightand a half million addresses or seven percent of the totaladdresses served have mail delivered to kiosks POSTAL DENSITYThe variable cost of delivery depends on volume delivered thusthe comparison of variable costs between France and the US isstraightforward It might seem that population density could beused to compare differences in the fixed cost of delivery We haveseen however that population density is not the only explanationfor fixed cost differences The fixed cost ofThe smaller volume per capita for France  in  incomparison to the US  also contributes to efficient deliveryby foot or bicycleKiosks are free standing structures containing locked mailboxesas few as three or four and as many as sixty or so They arecalled neighborhood delivery centralized box unitsdelivery called route time in US delivery cost analyses isaccounted for by the need for the carrier to move from one stop toanother whatever the mode of delivery Therefore we use postaldensity as the driver of fixed costsPostal density is the number of delivery points that can bevisited by the carrier in one hour of time excluding loading timeand the variable portion of access time and the variable portion oftravel time to and from the route It renders endogenous all of thephysical characteristics of the route including the mode ofdelivery the groupingratio addresses per stop and thedifficulty of accessing the buildings This measure also makescomparison possible in spite of the differences in quality ofdelivery serviceDelivery to a multiple address building or to a multiple addresskiosk means that the fixed cost of traveling to that stop is spreadamong the several addresses which receive mail there The conceptof postal density conveniently expresses the cost consequences ofboth multiaddress buildings and multiaddress kiosks We will seebelow that the variations in postal density are different fromvariations in population density Postal density is a measure thatcontains two dimensions exogenous cost drivers such as geographicand demographic characteristics of the areas served and endogenousdrivers reflecting the quality of delivery service On theendogenous dimension postal density could in principle be tunedby the postal operator by adjusting quality of service Of coursean increase in postal density would require a reduction in thequality of service that may not be compatible with the wayuniversal service obligations are defined in a country Comparison of French and US Postal DensitiesTable  compares French and US postal densities at variousquantiles The French postal density is higher at every quantilebut the ratio is strikingly high at the th and th quantileswhere it exceeds  to  On average the French postal densityexceeds the US by a ratio of  to  This is somewhat less thanthe ratio of population density between France and the US whichis  to See PRC Docket No RA stop can serve one or more addressesIt also gives a better view of the parts of the country that areactually populated Totally deserted areas are notreflected in this driverWe mean by quality of delivery service such things as doorcurbside or roadside line of travel delivery Theterm as used here is not meant to include frequency ofdeliveryThe ability of an operator to adjust quality of delivery servicecan be affected by the applicable postal law in eachcountry For example French law requires delivery to the doorThis level of delivery service treated as auniversal service obligation in France is primarily defined byhistory and tradition Thus delivery quality andtherefore postal density can in theory be tuned by the operatorbut in practice may be constrained by law Part of the reason that the US postal densities have suchlow values with a narrow range may be due to stale dataThe USPS determines the amount of current carrier time based onthe percentages of time spent in route and loadactivities calculated with data collected in  New data mayshow an increase in variable load time to reflectthe increased use of kiosks and a decrease in route time Thiswould produce higher postal densitiesTable  Postal Density Comparison with Routes Ranked by PostalDensity Rural AreasPostal densities in rural areas of France and the US are verydifferent owing to the quality of service We have found that thepostal density in France of the  percent of addressees with thelowest population density is  while it is  in the equivalentareas of the US This is remarkable in light of the much lowerpopulation densities in the US Addresses in the most rural areasof France are much closer together than in the equivalent areas ofthe US A French carrier must however turn into the farmersdriveway and proceed to the dwelling Once there he or she mustalight from the vehicle and proceed to the mailbox then return tothe vehicle turn it around and proceed to the road In the USthe carrier remains on the road stops at a roadside mailbox andplaces mail in it without leaving the vehicle This contributesto the affordability of postage in the US Each country has made adifferent costservice tradeoff which is reflected in eachcountrys concept of universal serviceWithin the US it is surprising that the average postal densityof the bottom quartile of routes ranked by cost is lower than thepostal density for the rural routes serving the least denselysettled  percent of the population  versus  This isbecause rural routes in the US have a higher postal density thanmost park and loop city routes and business routes This in turnindicates the greater efficiency of delivering mail to roadsidemailboxes compared to walking to the front door of a detacheddwelling or business Park and loop routes serve cities and theirinner suburbs while curbline routes serve the outer suburbs Thusthe postal density of carriers walking between nearby stops islower than that of carriers driving between greatly separatedstops The postal density of  addresses per hour for the mostrural population corresponds to roadside mailboxes that are meters apart on average Many detached houses in cities are asclose as  meters apart In France the bottom decile of routesranked by population density averages  The average distancebetween two stops is around  meters and the delivery to thedoor increases time between two stops Moreover on many roads served by rural carriers mailboxesmust be placed on only one designated side of theroad This relieves the carrier from the need to travel backdown a road to serve curbside boxes on the other sideof the road Densely Populated AreasAt the extreme US population densities are as high as Frenchpopulation densities For example Table  shows that the innerarea of New York has a higher population density than that ofParis But on average US population densities are much lower asindicated in Table  which shows that the urbanized area of Parisis much more densely populated than that of New YorkTable  Population and Population Density in New York andParisaaData Source Demographia  bVille de Paris for Paris and theborough of Manhattan for New YorkThis is reflected in the ratio of multiaddress stops to singleaddress stops in the two countries Figure  displays thisrelationship It shows the ratio of delivery points to stopsranked by cost At the left side of the graph where volume is leastcostly to deliver we find the most multiple address stops As theratio of points to stops decreases mail gets more expensive todeliver La Poste has a much higher ratio of multiple address stopsthan the USPSFigure  Ratio Delivery Points to StopsSemidecile of Volume Routes

volumeper address that encompass approximately  percent of the routesin France and the United States It shows much greater variation inFrench postal densities than for the US and much smallervariation in volume per address in France than in the US The areaof overlap is quite small relative to the ranges for each countryThe greater variation in volume per address in the US is probablydue to the fact that mail volume and income are highly correlatedand the fact that the US has a much larger variation in incomeper household than France The smaller variation in US postaldensities is due to differences in the quality of delivery servicewhich dampen the impact of low population density on many routesBecause France has a uniform quality of delivery its postaldensity differences are much greaterFigure  Range of Postal Densities and Volumes for France andUSAUSA France          Postal Density Possible Deliveries Per Hour HETEROGENEITY AND RELATIVE VULNERABILITY TO INEFFICIENTENTRYFigure  displays the distribution of normalized French and USdelivery costs for each semidecile of volume or traffic whenroutes are ranked from least to most costly To protectcommercially sensitive data and to facilitate comparison we displaynormalized costs and not actual unit costs All unit costs aredisplayed relative to the mean of the distribution of unit costsFor purposes of this analysis we discard the first and lastsemideciles for each country because the observations upon whichthey are based contain data of questionable accuracy See Cohen et al  Unit costs refer to carrier street time measured

Delivery Costs Mean                     Semidecile of Volume Routes Ranked by Increasing DeliveryCostsWe see that the range of the French distribution is greater thanthe US distribution The former begins with a cost of relative to the mean and ends with a cost of  relative tothe mean The US on the other hand begins with a cost of and ends with a cost of  The standard deviation of thenormalized French distribution is half again as large as thenormalized US distribution  vs  Thus the Frenchdistribution is more heterogeneous than the US distributionVulnerability to inefficient entry can be addressed usingdelivery cost heterogeneity Some indicators of vulnerability arethe percentage of the volume that has a unit cost less than halfthe mean the size of the area between actual costs and the averagecost and the average slope of the cost curve These are based onthe conjecture that an entrant would seek to compete where the unitdelivery cost was very low while using the uniform tariff as anumbrella price These measures of vulnerability make sense ofcourse only with a uniform tariff constraint and more generallywhen geographical cost oriented tariffs are not appliedFigure  reveals that in France  percent of the volume has acost less than half the mean while in the US only  percent ofthe volume is below this threshold Ceteris paribus France is morevulnerable to inefficient entry Another relevant factor would bethe geographical concentration of the low cost volume We believethat the low cost volume is scattered over perhaps a hundred ormore US metropolitan areas while in France the volume isconcentrated in relatively few cities Thus it would be far easierfor an entrant to market its alternative service in France than inthe US In addition France has about half the per capita volumeof the US giving it less economies of scale This means that theconsequence of volume erosion would be greater in France than inthe US There are of course other relevant factors affectingentry such as wage premium efficiency of operation andclassification efficiency See Cohen et al Figure  compares French and US traffic and French and USpostal densities when routes are ranked by cost We see that inboth countries the volume for the least costly areas isapproximately twice that of the most costly areas Thus the volumerange for both is about two to one The range of postal density ismuch greater for both countries The maximum is eleven times theminimum for France and  times the minimum for the US Thegreater variation in French postal density leads to a greatervariation in French unit costs relative to the US As discussedbelow the lower French volume magnifies the impact on unit costfrom the variations in postal densityFigure  Volume Per Delivery Point and Postal Density                Semidecile of Volume Routes Ranked by Increasing DeliveryCostsThe different ranges in postal density and volume when routesare organized by cost rather than organized by postal density orvolume as displayed earlier in Figure  demonstrate theinteraction of postal density volume and delivery costs Inparticular the actual volume ranges shown in Figure  are muchgreater than the two to one ratios observed in Figure Figure  displays an interesting phenomena in that for the mostcostly  percent of the routes the postal density in France islower than in the US This is due to the fact that in theUS the most sparsely populated areas do not correspond to thehighest cost routes This is partly explained by the lineoftravelrequirement which greatly reduces the cost of delivery in areaswith low population density Moreover in the US the routes withthe lowest postal density are not the routes with the lowesttraffic In France on the contrary routes with the lowestpostal density have the lowest volumes This also explains whythere is greater heterogeneity in costs in France than in theUS This is probably linked with a wealth effect as volumes aredriven by the wealth of the recipient see Kolin and Davis Berthelemy and Toledano  INTERACTION OF THE COST DRIVERSIn this section we examine the impact of changes in postaldensity and volume per address on the average cost in each countryFrench average costs are derived from an engineering modelmentioned in the Appendix and described in detail in RoyThe US average costs are derived from an econometricallyestimated translog equation of street time The equation relatesstreet time to volume per address postal density and the numberof addresses The number of addresses is set as a controlvariable in the equation allowing us to develop average costsTable  presents La Poste and USPS normalized street deliverycosts for each combination of quartiles of low medium and highpostal densities and volumes per address Data for each country arepresented with the US values immediately below the Frenchvalues Postal density in France is higher than in the US in allquartiles and ranges from  addresseshour at the low quartile to addresseshour at the highest quartile This range of postaldensities is much greater than the corresponding US range of to  addresses per hour The annual volume per address is higherin all quartiles

countries volume is a more importantcost driver at low postal density than at high postal density Thisis because ceteris paribus at low postal density the fixed costsare higher and the potential for scale economies is thereforegreater Conversely at high postal densities the fixed costs arelower and thus the potential for scale economies is not asgreatSimilarly postal density is a more important cost driver inboth countries at low volume because at low volume the savings infixed costs realized from increasing postal density are spread tofewer pieces Conversely postal density is a less important costdriver at high volume because the savings from an increase inpostal density are spread across a greater number ofpieces It should be noted that the impact of postal density on cost isgreater in France than in theUS since France has a wider range of postal densities andlower volumes In contrast the impact of volume is greater in theUS than in France because the US has lower postal densities anda greater variation in volumes Finally postal density appears tobe a more important driver of unit street delivery costs thanvolume over the actual ranges in France and the US UNIT COST BEHAVIORThe La Poste simulation model and the cost function developedfor the USPS described above provide alternative means ofestimating average unit costs over a range of volumes per deliverypoint and postal densities Figure  displays average costsgenerated with the La PosteUnit Delivery Cosst secpiecesimulation model and data for French postal activities Figure displays the

delivery costsvalues reflect different input prices in the two countriesThe figures visually demonstrate the relationship between lowpostal density andor low volume and high average unit costs andconversely the relationship between high postal density andor highvolume and low average unit costs Also the figures exhibit therapid change in unit delivery costs as either volume or densityincrease However once either high volume or high density isachieved the opportunities for further reductions in average unitcosts by increases in either volume or density are minimal CONCLUSIONSThe analysis of delivery costs for France and the USdemonstrates that street delivery costs are more heterogeneous inFrance than in the US Ceteris paribus France is more vulnerableto inefficient entry than the USThe heterogeneity of delivery costs is driven by differences involume geographical characteristics and quality of deliveryservice The concept of postal density captures the nonvolumefactors in a single measure Rationalizing street delivery cost bydecreasing the quality of delivery service can have a profoundimpact on the postal density and consequently on deliverycostDue to this rationalization of delivery cost in the US thepostal densities of the most sparsely populated areas are higherthan the densities of the most sparsely populated areas ofFrancePostal density appears to be a more important driver of unitstreet delivery costs than volume over the actual ranges in Franceand the US Furthermore high postal densities reduce the impactof volume on unit street delivery costs and high volume reducesthe impact of postal densityAPPENDIXDelivery DataFranceThe delivery data for La Poste are obtained for each deliveryarea A delivery area represents a postcode or several postcodesin some cases The territory is divided into nearly  deliveryareas Each area averages  routes with of course a very highdeviation The unit costs expressed in seconds and normalizedas explained are estimated by an engineering model to allow forsimulations over variations of traffic They are obtained thefollowing way The information system allows the description ofeach area with geographic characteristics population number ofstops number of delivery points surface length of streets orroads and traffic The delivery model constructed by La Poste useshundred of parameters and allows the calculation of the unit costsof street delivery with an error of less than three percent in eacharea At this stage one unit cost is calculated for each area Itgives a quite aggregate view of street costs compared to thefineness of US costs In reality each area is quiteheterogeneous it generally consists of a small town and anoutlying area with different geographical characteristics To havea more precise view of unit costs and to have a better level ofcomparison with US costs which are by route instead of bygeographic area the costs are then divided into two groups perarea We finally obtain  unit costs in  areas Thesubareas are then ranked on the criteria of increasing unit costsThey are reaggregated into increments of five percent of trafficthe first five percent of traffic delivered is reached with areas and the last five percent of traffic is obtained with areasUSUSdelivery data are from the City Carrier Cost System andthe Rural National Mail Count System City carriers make up percent of the routes and rural carriers make up theremainderThe City Carrier System contains a stratified sample of routes and the  Rural National Mail Count
