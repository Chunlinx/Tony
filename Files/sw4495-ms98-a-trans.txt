        i havent done any camping lately how about you     oh not recently we weve done a little bit of car camping  uh since since i got married and did a little bit of backpacking several years ago but uh not recently   were these extended trips or just a weekend or   well not real long maybe three four days at the most how about you   uh thats about what ive done but it goes back even further to my childhood camping went out camping and and the purpose was not to camp the purpose was to fish   umhum umhum   and there were no motels in in the wilds of New Mexico so if you wanted to go fish for a few days you would uh and at certain lakes that were definitely off the beaten track you would do what you i think what you call car camping   right   i mean the cars there and and you may or may not sleep on a cot outside of it or inside the car or but uh nothing too elaborate in the way of tents and   umhum   ive actually even slept on the ground   yeah well ive done a little bit of that too um i guess ive kind of done the full range of camping anywhere from backpacking in the mountains for for a week at a time to the the car camping kind of thing   where did you do your backpacking   well ive done some down in um Tennessee and Kentucky that area North Carolina and then done some in New Mexico and some out in Montana Colorado so ive kind of gone around and done it number of places   but this was in years past or yeah   right i used to work at um summer camps um a lot when i was in high school and college and i worked at some summer camps in New Mexico where um the emphasis there was on backpacking exclusively   around Philmont or something   right umhum youve been there   no i havent no but every Boy Scout ive ever known has camped at Philmont   umhum yeah yeah well its a very popular place and i worked there  three summers so  got to know it pretty well   yeah i guess i dont know do you think its its as safe as it used to be to go camping   well probably the biggest concern that i would have now is getting safe drinking water um cause a lot of times wed just pull water out of a stream and um use that and i was never really big on using a lot of chemicals for water purification and treatment um and nowadays i think id be a little bit more cautious about that than i used to be   yeah when when i was in growing up in New Mexico if we went on a picnic or whatever it was always in the mountains we lived in the southwestern corner of the state so we could go to the mountains or the desert just pick a place and if you were needed water the youd find a stream and drink right out of the stream   umhum   when i left New Mexico and moved to Missouri i would not have dreamed  drinking out of any stream that i saw there   right   so i guess partly it depends on on how isolated the river is   umhum   but uh course i i mean even in in New Mexico you always had the possibility of a cow or uh some other critter upstream  a ways from you   umhum   um what about crime in camp sites do you think thats a problem   well i suppose in some of the real big parks and stuff that could be an issue but generally i havent ever found that to be a problem usually people are very friendly and um cooperative all the way around so ive never deemed that as a threat to myself but   yeah   been been fairly careful about not leaving tempting things out in the campsite and stuff like that   oh yeah yeah it you hide your fishing gear and your camera and all that sort of stuff dont tempt people   umhum right and usually if im backpacking of course there i dont worry about it much at all because if theres something there that they want  theyd have to haul it out a long ways so they usually would think twice about it     thats right   so   i have a good friend who goes backpacking about twice a year in the Grand Canyon   umhum   hes hes really uh hung up on that Grand Canyon   you know ive had some friends of mine that have made the trip down through there a couple of times they really enjoy it but theres something about going down in a hole that  just um doesnt really relate that strongly to me i suppose ill try it someday but i always like to climb mountains and get up where i can see something   yeah yeah i i think with the case like in the case of the canyon you see more from the rim than you would ever camping down inside of it   umhum   yeah are there mountains in Wisconsin for you to go out and climb or   well no its more mostly just some rolling hills so there isnt really much
