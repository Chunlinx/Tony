                                 WTO Protesters Chastise Cuba Not Nike                        Starbucks and NikeTown may make irresistible targets for the antiWTOprotesters who have been tying up and tearing up Seattle But the realengines behind the WTOs hesitancy to take up environmental and labor standardsare not Nike and Boeing Theyre the developing countries to which thosestandards would be applied            This point seems either incredibly naive since we all know thatmultinational US corporations really rule the world or incredibly banalsince the WTO cant really do anything if threequarters of itsmembershipthe developing countriesdisapproves Perhaps the point is bothnaive and banal But its still true and imagining that low wages and poorworking conditions are realities imposed upon developing countries by theUnited States is a delusion that makes understanding the actual operations ofthe WTO impossible            It was a Cuban minister after all who said yesterday thatdeveloping nations needed to stick together because we produce goods andservices with comparative advantages that they that is the United States andEurope are trying to take away under the pretext of socalled laborstandards And its Mexico Thailand and Indonesia who are insisting thatthose standards stay off the table precisely because they fear that theirinclusion in trade talks will eliminate any incentives for foreign or evendomestic investment            Now just because the Indonesian government is against higher laborstandards doesnt mean either that the Indonesian people are against themor that we in the United States should simply defer to the wishes ofother countries There are powerful indigenous movements in almost everydeveloping country in favor of better working conditions and higher wages andin any case the fear of engaging in cultural imperialism is a poor guide tomaking policy But there is still something in the absence of developingnationsupport for new standards that should give us pause            From a Buchananite perspective of course developingnation hostility toWTO intervention is irrelevant because in Buchanans ideal world the UnitedStates wouldnt be trading with those nations at all From what you might callthe internationalist antiWTO perspective though theres a real paradox heresince the WTO is simultaneously excoriated for being a kind of supranationalgovernment smashing down local regulations and excoriated for not being enoughof a supranational government to create global living and workingstandards            The paradox exists though because opposition to free trade depends upontwo antithetical ideas both of which interestingly enough are wrong Thefirst is that free trade is lowering the standard of living in developedcountries by encouraging the migration of jobs and the creation of tradedeficits The second is that free trade is widening the economic gap betweenrich and poor countries A common corollary to this is that trade is wideningthe gap between rich and poor in all countries For both these to be truerich countries would have to be losing jobs and productive capacity andgetting richer at the same time even as developing countries would be takingaway jobs growing faster and yet getting poorer            Thats not happening of course Its almost certainly true that certainsectors of developed economies textiles steel are hurt by free trade butits equally true that other sectors computer software and hardware financialservices are helped More to the point the fundamental truth of free trade isthat when countries produce those goods in which they have a comparativeadvantage both sides benefit because capital ends up being allocated to itsmost productive uses which is the only way real wealth can be created            I dont know whether that Cuban minister has suddenly started reading DavidRicardo but his invocation of comparative advantage was right on target Fordeveloping countries the one meaningful road to economic development which isto say the only way they can narrow the gap between themselves and the UnitedStates Europe and Japan is via free trade Its a mistake for thesecountries to argue that having minimumwage laws or regulations keepingcorporations from running toxic dumps will wreck their chances of competing inthe world market just like its a mistake for small businesses to argue thathaving a minimumwage law in the United States does irreparable harm to themBut its not a mistake for these countries to believe that the fewer barriersto tradeof whatever sortthere are the better The really interestingthing of course is that its not a mistake for the United States to believethat either
