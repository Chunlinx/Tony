                    Background        CADCAM technologies have found increased use in        dentistry during the past  years Cerec a system        invented by Mrmann and Brandistini      was the first        commercially available CADCAM system Cerec was designed        for making ceramic inlays and veneers and these should be        etched and bonded to the tooth with resin based luting        agents      Resin bonding was promoted because it        improved retention and sealed gaps around Cerec        restorations Such gaps were often wider around the early        Cerec restorations than they were around cast restorations        In addition clinical experience evolving at that time        suggested that the fracture rate of ceramic restorations        decreased if they were resin bonded rather than cemented        with traditional zinc phosphate or glass ionomer cements            However because of high equipment cost and a not yet        optimised technology the Cerec system did not capture a        big market share Instead it was Procera a system        originally developed for industrial production of titanium        crowns that become the CADCAM system of choice during the        late  thand the early  th      Procera did not        become popular because of its titanium crowns but rather        for its allceramic crowns     These crowns consisted        of Al          O          copings    with good fit and high        strength on which dental ceramics were fired to produce        strong and aesthetically appealing allceramic crowns In        contrast to Cerec Procera did not rely on an intraoral        camera to make an electronic impression Instead Procera        relied on traditional impressions and gypsum dies The x        y zcoordinates of the dies were recorded at a dental        laboratory by use of an electronic stylus    and        transferred electronically to the Procera laboratory where        the Al          O          coping was made As a result very        little extra investment cost was needed for the dentist        The lower cost probably explains why Procera rather than        Cerec was the CADCAM that took off among dentists        At the time the first ceramic Procera crowns were        introduced ceramic restorations were often cemented with        zinc phosphate or glass ionomer cements despite the fact        that research had started to show the advantages with resin        bonded ceramic restorations     Resin bonding was        achieved by first etching the ceramic surface with        hydrofluoric acid and treating the ceramic surface with a        silane     However acid etching did not work on the        hydrofluoric acid resistant Al          O          copings Because of the acid        resistance of Al          O           and the knowledge that existed when        the first Procera crowns were introduced at the end of the         thand the early  th the first Procera crowns were        cemented with zinc phosphate and glass ionomer cements            These cements were used because it was believed that        the high fracture toughness of Al          O          copings a property superior to that        of traditional dental ceramics would result in strong        ceramic crowns Several years earlier McLean    had        showed that after seven years of clinical service only         of anterior aluminous core crowns cemented with zinc        phosphate cement failed His explanation was that the        higher fracture toughness of Al          O          decreased the risk of fracturing the        allceramic crown In addition by using zinc phosphate and        glass ionomer cements rather then resins Procera profited        from other advantages too For example at the time of the        introduction of Procera crowns dentists were        bettertrained and more used to zinc phosphate and glass        ionomer cements than they were with bonding resins In        addition removal of set phosphate cement excess was        perceived as being easier to do with zinc phosphate cement        than with resin cements As a consequence dentists felt        more comfortable with using zinc phosphate and glass        ionomer cements something that facilitated the        introduction of Procera crowns Today we know the outcome        of cementing Procera crowns with zinc phosphate and glass        ionomer cements      Of the placed  crowns  had        been cemented with zinc phosphate cement and the remaining         crowns with glass ionomer After  and  years of        clinical service the cumulative survival rate showed to be         and  respectively      The failure rate        after  years due to copingporcelain fractures was         while the remaining  failure rate was due to poor        marginal fit that had resulted in caries     In        addition to these failures minor fractures occurred in         of the remaining crowns     These chipped crowns were        polished and continued to function normally A total of         of the crowns came loose during the observation period and        were recemented     It is important to realize that        these crowns were not included in the failure frequency            However the published results    suggest that        the use of zinc phosphate andor glass ionomer cement is        not a major factor considered contributing to permanent        failures of Procera crowns        During the past few years ZrO          has been introduced to dentistry             The partially stabilized ZrO          has a fracture toughness twice that of        A          O             suggesting that ZrO          based copings could become a major        competitor to Procera in the future One such ZrO          based system is the Decim system that        makes ZrO          copings Denzir by milling zirconium        dioxide rods These ZrO          copings like the Procera copings        cannot be etched because of the acid resistance of ZrO           Although a resinbased cement such        as Panavia is the recommended luting agent for Denzir at        the present time there is an interest in determining        whether zinc phosphate and glass ionomer cements are        acceptable alternatives That interest relates primarily to        properties such as simplicity of use easiness of removing        excess from marginal regions after cementation and last        but not least important easiness of removing a previously        cemented crown if so needed As we know from the previously        quoted Procera study       of the crowns were        remade because of copingdental porcelain fractures and        caries  Another  suffered from acceptable chipping            These findings are important because they suggest        that fractures and caries may require removal of the        ceramic restoration If the coping is well bonded to the        tooth surface the old unit must be cut away Such a        removal is not easy to do with strong ceramics and there        is a potential risk that incomplete cooling during cutting        could cause pulp irritations Because of the latter        aspects a clinically important question to address is        whether zinc phosphate cemented Denzir crowns compare as        well clinically regarding low ceramic fractures as resin        based cemented Denzir crowns do However before such        clinical trials can be justified ethically         in vitro tests must prove that the        retention of Denzir crowns is as good as that of Procera        crowns If the retention of Denzir is as good as that of        Procera one would expect that Denzir crowns will provide        as good or even better clinical results than those reported        with zinc phosphate or glass ionomer cemented Procera        crowns             Because of the above considerations the objectives of        this study was to determine         in vitro whether Denzir copings        cemented with zinc phosphate cement to metal dies could        provide as good retention strength as Procera crowns        cemented to similar metal dies We also wanted to determine        if sandblasting would improve the retention of the Denzir        copings or if retention over time would behave differently        if the cemented crowns were stored in water or artificial        saliva                    Methods                  Metal dies          Thirtysix metal dies were machined out of carbon          steel to dimensions shown in Figure  During the          machining procedure all the surfaces to which the zinc          phosphate cement would be attached were finished to          roughness values around  m The reason we used the           m surface roughness was that a preliminary          evaluation of dies with surface roughness values of             and  m had revealed that a surface          roughness value of  m was ideal for our study With          such surface texture the cement did not separate from          the cementmodel surface Instead it fractured within the          cement or at the crowncement interface          To verify the surface roughness values the finished          die surfaces were recorded with a profilometer Federal          Surfanalyzer System  Federal Products Co          Providence RI The surface roughness value R           a  represents the arithmetic average          of the absolute values of the measured roughness profile          height deviations taken within the scanned length and          measured from the mean line These scanned recordings          were made in a cervical to occlusal direction over a          length of  mm on each metal die The surface roughness          value for that distance was then used to determine the          average value for all the dies                          Impressions and gypsum dies          Before impressions were made of the metal dies a           mm thick ring was inserted and located to the marginal          part of the simulated crown preparation Figure           Impressions were then made in a polyvinylsiloxane          impression

attachment and the space          between the tray and the die was  mm One hour after the          impression had been made it was poured with a Type IV          gypsum SilkyRock WhipMix Corporation Louisville KY          and allowed to set during the night After impression          removal and die inspection the  gypsum dies were sent          to laboratories making Denzir and Procera copings                          Ceramic copings          Twentyfour Denzir and twelve Procera copings were          ordered from Denzir and Procera certified laboratories          All ceramic copings were made  mm thick and with a          cement space corresponding to  m That spacing started           mm from the cervical margin and reached its maximal          thickness after  mm from that margin When the copings          arrived from the laboratories all  copings were          checked regarding their fit                          Sandblasting          Twelve of the Denzir copings were sandblasted on the          inner surfaces with A            O            particle size   m using an air          pressure of  bars  kPa The sandblasting process          was done with the sandblasting tip located at a distance          of  mm from the ceramic surface The centre of the          sandblasting stream targeted the transition from the          occlusal to the proximal inner surfaces The entire inner          surface was then sandblasted by rotating the coping four          times each time  degrees Each of these locations was          sandblasted for  s                          Inner surface roughness          The inside of each coping was scanned with the          profilometer The scans were collected within the  to           mm interval from the cervical margin From these          scans the R           a values were calculated                          Cementation          The  mm ring located in the cervical region of the          preparation when the silicone impression was made was          removed and replaced with a  mm thick washer with an          outer diameter of  mm Figure  A zinc phosphate          cement Phosphate Cement Heraeus Kulzer Dormagen          Germany was mixed on a room tempered glass plate For          each portion  g powder was mixed with  mL liquid          The powder was divided into six portions two  th          one  th and three  thportions First one           thportion was mixed for  s then the second           thportion for  s followed by the  thportion for          another  s A  thportion was then added and mixed          for  s followed by another  thportion also mixed          for  s The final  thwas then added and mixed for           s Thus a total mixing time of  min and  s was used          The mixed cement was then placed inside the ceramic          coping which was rotated  degrees as the coping was          seated on the metal die Thirty seconds after completed          mixing a load of  N was placed on the crown and the          load acted on the crown for  min Excess material was          removed after  min counted from the time the coping          was loaded with the  N load          Fifteen minutes after the initiation of the          cementation process the cemented copings with the steel          dies and washers were transferred to distilled water or          artificial saliva and then stored in an oven at C The          artificial saliva    was of the following          composition  L each of  mM K            HPO              mM Na            HPO              mM KHCO              mM NaCl

Statistical evaluation          The force values needed to dislodge the copings were          used for the statistical evaluation Oneway and twoway          ANOVAs were used to determine significant differences          between materials storage medium and storage time as          well as interactions of these ANOVA SAS Institute          Cary NC USA Comparisons between the individual groups          were also conducted using Duncans multiple range tests          All test were conducted on the  significance          level                            Results                  Metal dies          The profilometer readings of the metal die surfaces          gave an average surface roughness value R           a  of    m These roughness          values were primarily based on wave shaped surface where          the distance between the peaks was around  m and          where the main peaktomain valley distance was around           m Figure                           Ceramic copings and effect of sandblasting          The surface roughness values of the insides of the          different coping groups are shown in Table  No          significant difference existed between the three          combinations p                            Retention force          The statistical analysis revealed that the most          important factor affecting the retention force was          storage time Tables and  There was no difference          between the two main materials or whether the Denzir          copings had been sandblasted or not Table           Comparing the storage media could not prove whether          such a difference existed p   Table  In this          comparison no consideration was taken for the different          material groups and storage times When storage time only          was compared there was a significant increase in          retention force with time Table           As seen in the Tables  and  there are large          differences among the different test groups standard          deviation  of the mean value From Table  we can          also see that there are no significant interactions          although the materialstorage and storagetime          interactions are pretty close          Of the Procera copings two copings fractured during          testing after  days of storage and one coping fractured          after one year Of all tested Denzir copings not a          single coping fractured However careful inspection with          transilluminating light revealed that one of the Denzir          copings tested after  year had a crack that extended          from the cervical region to the occlusal region                            Discussion                  Effect of coping composition and          sandblasting          Table shows that there was no significant difference          in surface roughness between the three evaluated ceramic          coping groups The low value of the sandblasted Denzir          copings suggest that the machining process generated a          surface roughness that was at least as rough as a          machined and sandblasted Denzir surface Because of these          findings sandblasting conducted under the conditions          evaluated in this study is not recommended for Denzir          copings                          Effect of storage          The statistical evaluation of variables such as          material storage and time as well as interactions of          these variables revealed that storage time was          significant regarding retention force Table  Storage          medium and interaction between time and storage medium          were almost significant on the  significance          level          There was no difference between the three material          groups regarding retentive force Table  That finding          most likely relates to the similarities in surface          roughness values among the three groups Table  The          similarities in retentiveness among the three material          groups are important Because of the published success          rate of Procera after  years in clinical service              our           in vitro results suggest that          Denzir copings sandblasted or not and cemented with          zinc phosphate cement are likely to perform equally well          as Procera crowns at least regarding retention          Based on the lower fracture frequency identified among          the Denzir copings our findings suggest that Denzir          copings might perform even better than Procera crowns Of          the twelve tested Procera copings three complete          fractures occurred in the Procera copings while of the          twentyfour tested Denzir copings only one had a          detectable crack that did not even result in a clear          fracture during testing At the present time though one          cannot exclude that these differences are coincidental          However the higher fracture toughness of Denzir almost          twice as high as that of Procera probably explains the          lower fracture tendency of Denzir identified in this          study          Future studies regarding CADCAM technologies need to          focus on flaw formation that might be induced during          manufacturing One may suspect that a milling process          like the one used to make the Denzir copings induce more          flaws than a pressing and sintering technique as the one          used to make Procera copings However there is no proof          available supporting that assumption at the present time          In the case of Procera one cannot exclude the          possibility that flaws are induced when copings are          pressed and that these flaws may not heal completely          during sintering Besides during sintering and cooling          thermal stresses may be induced that trigger crack          formation in the future          From the above argumentation flaws may very well be          induced during manufacturing of both Denzir and Procera          copings Thus differences in either fracture toughness          or flaw sizesdensities or a combination of the two          would explain why the Procera copings had higher fracture          tendency The higher fracture toughness of zirconia          favours Denzir and would explain the lower fracture          frequency seen in these copings However whether the          flaws introduced in Denzir copings are smaller or bigger          than those present in Procera copings is not known and          needs to be investigated further Flaw formation during          manufacturing becomes very important when we compare          different zirconia crowns that now are available on the          market Some of them are made by milling industrially          sintered and processed zirconia while other are made by          milling presintered zirconia that is then sintered          During our evaluation we used the force levels          generated by the copings that fractured during testing          One could argue that such values should be excluded          because the samples fractured However we did not          exclude those samples of the following reasons First          the force levels on the copings that fractured were not          lower than those of those that did not fracture Second          we were not able to determine whether the fracture          occurred before or after debonding had occurred because          of the speed of the dislodgementfracturing process          Storage of the copings in artificial saliva resulted          in force values almost significantly higher than those          stored in water Table  A possible explanation is that          some of the ions for example phosphate ions diffused          into the cement and pushed the setting reaction toward an          increased precipitation reaction Such an explanation can          be related to the setting reaction of zinc phosphate          cements As the storage time increased the required          force needed to dislodge the copings also increased          Table  A likely explanation is that as time passed          the setting reaction became more complete There is also          a possibility that corrosion of the steel dies and          release of iron ions from the dies affected the setting          reaction of the zinc phosphate cement Such a corrosion          process might also have increased the surface roughness          at the cementdye interface and thereby also increased          the mechanical retention          Even though time improved the retention of the          cemented copings one should not extrapolate that value          to the clinical situation Clinically the coping would          be exposed to different loads during the entire          observation time In our study no such forces acted on          the cemented coping from time of cementation to time of          testing However the improved results with time shows          that storage media such as water and artificial saliva by          themselves do not decrease the retention force This          finding is important because it implies that other          factors are more important when we try to explain why the          retention of zinc phosphate cemented crowns sometimes          fail over time Loading conditions and fracture toughness          of the luting agent are such factors          Our results suggest that a clinical evaluation of          Denzir crowns cemented with zinc phosphate cement are          likely to perform as well as Procera crowns cemented with          zinc phosphate cement However based on Burke et als             review which supported the use of resin cements one          can question the rational of even considering using zinc          phosphate cement as a luting agent in a clinical study          There are at least two reasons justifying such a clinical          study First by assuming that the high success rate of          zinc phosphate cemented Procera crowns is likely to be          equally high with Denzir copings justifies such a study          ethically Second the simplicity of using zinc phosphate          cements their ease of removal from marginal regions          after setting and the ease with which a zinc phosphate          cemented crown can be removed if remake is needed are          beneficial clinical advantages that cannot be          neglected          Having justified the use of zinc phosphate cement in a          clinical study it is also important to emphasize that          such an evaluation should consider retention and          solubility of the luting agent too In the Procera study          conducted by dman and Andersson     retention          failures requiring recementation were not included in          their impressive success rate Present evidences suggest          that resin bonding improves the results with ceramic          restorations     even though these claims are not          conclusive      There is no doubt that retention          is an important factor to consider but one must also          accept that strong bonding can also be a drawback if the          crown needs to be removed In the latter case a          wellbonded ceramic restoration can be a bigger clinical          challenge than the need for recementing a less          wellbonded restoration          One often hears the claim that resin cements decrease          the fracture frequency of ceramics Such a claim is          justified for some ceramic systems but is may not be          valid when we are dealing with high strength ceramic          copings like the ones used in both Procera and Decim          Instead some clinical studies dealing zinc phosphate          cemented alumina copings are so good that one can          question whether resin bonded copings will outperform          these results It is first when comparative studies take          all these pros and cons into consideration as we know          whether resin bonded alumina or zirconia copings          outperform zinc phosphate cemented alumina or zirconia          copings                            Conclusions        Denzir copings cemented with zinc phosphate cement to        steel dies perform at least as well as Procera copings        cemented with the same zinc phosphate after storage in        water and artificial saliva for one year when tested in        vitro The use of sandblasting under the conditions given        in this study does not enhance the internal surface        roughness or the retentiveness of the Denzir copings        During a oneyear storage time in water or artificial        saliva the retentiveness did not decrease Instead the        retentiveness of the samples increased                    Competing interests        Decim AB Skellefte Sweden funded this study The        contract was supervised
