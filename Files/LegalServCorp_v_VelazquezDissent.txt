SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATESNos  and LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION PETITIONER  v CARMENVELAZQUEZ ET ALUNITED STATES PETITIONER  v CARMEN VELAZQUEZ ET ALON WRITS OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FORTHE SECOND CIRCUITFebruary  JUSTICE SCALIA with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE JUSTICE OCONNORand JUSTICE THOMAS join dissentingSection a of the Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions andAppropriations Act of  Appropriations Act defines the scopeof a federal spending program It does not directly regulatespeech and it neither establishes a public forum nor discriminateson the basis of viewpoint The Court agrees with all this yetapplies a novel and unsupportable interpretation of ourpublicforum precedents to declare a faciallyunconstitutional This holding not only has no foundation in ourjurisprudence it is flatly contradicted by a recent decision thatis on all fours with the present case Having found the limitationupon the spending program unconstitutional the Court then declinesto consider the question of severability allowing a judgment tostand that lets the program go forward under a version of thestatute Congress never enacted I respectfully dissent from bothaspects of the judgmentI The Legal Services Corporation Act of  LSC Act  U SC  et seq is a federal subsidy program the stated purposeof which is to provide financial support for legal assistance innoncriminal proceedings or matters to persons financially unable toafford legal assistance ba Congress recognizing that theprogram could not serve its purpose unless it was kept free fromthe influence of or use by it of political pressures has from the programs inception tightly regulated the use of itsfunds See ante at  No Legal Services Corporation LSC fundsmay be used for example for encouraging    labor or antilaboractivities fb for litigation relating to thedesegregation of any elementary or secondary school or schoolsystem fb or for litigation which seeks to procure anontherapeutic abortion fb Congress discovered throughexperience however that these restrictions did not exhaust thepolitically controversial uses to which LSC funds could be putAccordingly in  Congress added new restrictions to the LSC Actand strengthened existing restrictions Among the new restrictionsis the one at issue here Section a of the AppropriationsAct  Stat   to  withholds LSC funds from everyentity that participates in any    way    in litigationlobbying or rulemaking    involving an effort to reform aFederal or State welfare system It thus bans LSCfunded entitiesfrom participating on either side of litigation involving suchstatutes from participating in rulemaking relating to theimplementation of such legislation and from lobbying Congressitself regarding any proposed changes to such legislation See CFR   The restrictions relating to rulemaking andlobbying are superfluous they duplicate general prohibitions onthe use of LSC funds for those activities found elsewhere intheAppropriations Act See a   The restrictionon litigation however is unique and it contains a provisospecifying what the restriction does not cover Funding recipientsmay represent an individual eligible client who is seekingspecific relief from a welfare agency if such relief does notinvolve an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing law ineffect on the date of the initiation of the representation TheLSC declares in its brief and respondents do not deny that underthese provisions the LSC can sponsor neither challenges to nordefenses of existing welfare reform law Brief for Petitioner inNo  p  The litigation ban is symmetrical Litigantschallenging the covered statutes or regulations do not receive LSCfunding and neither do litigants defending those laws againstchallengeIf a suit for benefits raises a claim outside the scope of theLSC program the LSCfunded lawyer may not participate in the suitAs the Court explains if LSCfunded lawyers anticipate that aforbidden claim will arise in a prospective clients suit theymay not undertake the representation ante at  Likewise ifa forbidden claim arises unexpectedly at trial LSCfundedattorneys must cease the representation at once ante at See also Brief for Petitioner in No  at  n  if theissue arises at trial the lawyer should discontinue therepresentation consistent with the applicable rules ofprofessional responsibility The lawyers may however andindeed must explain to the client why they cannot represent himSee  F d   CA  They are also free to expresstheir views of the legality of the welfare law to the client andthey may refer the client to another attorney who can accept therepresentation ibid See  F Supp   EDNY II The LSC Act is a federal subsidy program not a federalregulatory program and there is a basic difference betweenthe two Maher v Roe  U S    Regulationsdirectly restrict speech subsidies do not Subsidies it is truemay indirectly abridge speech but only if the funding scheme ismanipulated to have a coercive effect on those who do nothold the subsidized position National Endowment for Arts vFinley  U S    quoting Arkansas WritersProject Inc v Ragland  U S    SCALIA Jdissenting Proving unconstitutional coercion is difficult enoughwhen the spending program has universal coverage and excludes onlycertain speech such as a tax exemption scheme excluding lobbyingexpenses The Court has found such programs unconstitutional onlywhen the exclusion was aimed at the suppression of dangerousideas Speiser v Randall  U S    internalquotation marks omitted see also Regan v Taxation WithRepresentation of Wash  U S    Proving therequisite coercion is harder still when a spending program is notuniversal but limited providing benefits to a restricted number ofrecipients see Rust v Sullivan  U S   The Court has found such selective spending unconstitutionallycoercive only once when the government created a public forum withthe spending program but then discriminated in distributing fundingwithin the forum on the basis of viewpoint See Rosenberger vRector and Visitors of Univ of Va  U S   When the limited spending program does not create a public forumproving coercion is virtually impossible because simply denying asubsidy does not coerce belief Lyng v Automobile Workers U S    and because the criterion ofunconstitutionality is whether denial of the subsidy threatens todrive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace NationalEndowment for Arts v Finley supra at  internal quotationmarks omitted Absent such a threat the Government may allocate   funding according to criteria that would be impermissiblewere direct regulation of speech or a criminal penalty at stake U S at In Rust v Sullivan supra the Court applied these principlesto a statutory scheme that is in all relevant respectsindistinguishable from a The statute in Rust authorizedgrants for the provision of family planning services but providedthat none of the funds    shall be used in programs whereabortion is a method of family planning Id at  Validregulations implementing the statute required funding recipients torefer pregnant clients for appropriate prenatal    services byfurnishing a list of available providers that promote the welfareof mother and unborn child but forbade them to refer a pregnantwoman specifically to an abortion provider even upon request Idat  We rejected a First Amendment freespeech challenge to thefunding scheme explaining that the Government can withoutviolating the Constitution selectively fund a program to encouragecertain activities it believes to be in the public interestwithout at the same time funding an alternative program which seeksto deal with the problem another way Id at  This was notwe said the type of discrimination on the basis of viewpointthat triggers strict scrutiny ibid because the decision not tosubsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe theright ibid quoting Regan v Taxation With Representation ofWash supra at The same is true here The LSC Act like the scheme in Rust see U S at  does not create a public forum Far fromencouraging a diversity of views it has always as the Courtaccurately states placed restrictions on its use of funds anteat  Nor does a discriminate on the basis of viewpointsince it funds neither challenges to nor defenses of existingwelfare law The provision simply declines to subsidize a certainclass of litigation and under Rust that decision does notinfringe the right to bring such litigation Cf Ortwein vSchwab  U S   and n   per curiamgovernment not required by First Amendment or Due Process Clauseto waive filing fee for welfare benefits litigation The Courtsrepeated claims that a restricts and prohibitsspeech see eg ante at   and insulates laws fromjudicial review see eg ante at  are simply baseless Nolitigant who in the absence of LSC funding would bring a suitchallenging existing welfare law is deterred from doing so bya Rust thus controls these cases and compels theconclusion that a is constitutionalThe Court contends that Rust is different because the program atissue subsidized government speech while the LSC funds privatespeech See ante at  This is so unpersuasive it hardly needsresponse If the private doctors confidential advice to theirpatients at issue in Rust constituted government speech it ishard to imagine what subsidized speech would not be governmentspeech Moreover the majoritys contention that the subsidizedspeech in these cases is not government speech because the lawyershave a professional obligation to represent the interests of theirclients founders on the reality that the doctors in Rust had aprofessional obligation to serve the interests of their patientssee  U S at  Blackmun J dissenting ethicalresponsibilities of the medical profession which at the time ofRust we had held to be highly relevant to the permissible scope offederal regulation see Thornburgh v American College ofObstetricians and Gynecologists  U S   professional responsibilities of physicians overruled in parton other grounds Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa v Casey U S   Even respondents agree that the true speakerin Rust was not the government but a doctor Brief forRespondents  n SCALIA J dissentingThe Court further asserts that these cases are different fromRust because the welfare funding restriction seeks to use anexisting medium of expression and to control it    in ways whichdistort its usual functioning ante at  This is wrong on boththe facts and the law It is wrong on the law because there isutterly no precedent for the novel and facially implausibleproposition that the First Amendment has anything to do withgovernment funding that though it does not actually abridgeanyones speech distorts an existing medium of expression Noneof the three cases cited by the Court mentions such an oddprinciple In Rosenberger v Rector and Visitors of Univ of Vathe point critical to the Courts analysis was not as the Courtwould have it that it is part of the usual functioning ofstudent newspapers to express many different points of viewante at  it surely is not but rather that the spending programitself had been created to encourage a diversity of views fromprivate speakers U S at  What could not be distorted was the public forumthat the spending program had created As for Arkansas EdTelevision Commn v Forbes  U S   that casediscussed the nature of television broadcasting not to determinewhether government regulation would alter its usual functioningand thus violate the First Amendment no government regulation waseven at issue in the case but rather to determine whetherstateowned television is a public forum under our FirstAmendment jurisprudence Id at  And finally the passagethe Court cites from FCC v League of Women Voters of Cal  US    says nothing whatever about using theforum of public radio in an unconventional way to suppress speechinherent in the nature of the medium ante at  It discusseswhy the Governments asserted interest in preventing publicradio stations from becoming a privileged outlet for the politicaland ideological opinions of station owners and managers  US at  internal quotation marks omitted was insubstantialand thus could not justify the statutes restriction oneditorializing Even worse for the Court after invalidating therestriction on this conventional First Amendment ground League ofWomen Voters goes on to say that of course the restriction oneditorializing would plainly be valid if Congress were to adopta revised version of the statute that permitted public radiostations to establish affiliate organizations which could thenuse the stations facilities to editorialize with nonfederalfunds Id at  But of course that is the case hereRegulations permit funding recipients to establish affiliateorganizations to conduct litigation and other activities that falloutside the scope of the LSC program See  CFR pt  Far from supporting the Courts nondistortion analysis League ofWomen Voters dooms the Courts caseThe Courts nondistortion principle is also wrong on thefacts since there is no basis for believing that a bycausing cases to be presented by LSC attorneys who cannotadvise the courts of serious questions of statutory validityante at  will distort the operation of the courts It may wellbe that the bar of a will cause LSCfunded attorneys todecline or to withdraw from cases that involve statutory validityBut that means at most that fewer statutory challenges to welfarelaws will be presented to the courts because of the unavailabilityof free legal services for that purpose So what The same resultwould ensue from excluding LSCfunded lawyers from welfarelitigation entirely It is not the mandated nondistortablefunction of the courts to inquire into all serious questions ofstatutory validity in all cases Courts must consider only thosequestions of statutory validity that are presented by litigantsand if the Government chooses not to subsidize the presentation ofsome such questions that in no way distorts the courts role Itis remarkable that a Court that has so studiously avoided decidingwhether Congress could entirely eliminate federal jurisdiction overcertain matters see eg Webster v Doe  U S   Bowen v Michigan Academy of Family Physicians  U S n   would be so eager to hold the much lesser step ofdeclining to subsidize the litigation unconstitutional under theFirst AmendmentNor will the judicial opinions produced by LSC casessystematically distort the interpretation of welfare laws Judicialdecisions do not stand as binding precedent for points that werenot raised not argued and hence not analyzed See eg UnitedStates v VerdugoUrquidez U S    Hagans v Lavine  U S n   United States v L A Tucker Truck Lines Inc U S    United States v More  Cranch   Marshall C J The statutory validity that courtsassume in LSC cases will remain open for full determination inlater casesFinally the Court is troubled because in cases where theattorney withdraws from a representation the client is unlikely tofind other counsel Ante at  That is surely irrelevant sinceit leaves the welfare recipient in no worse condition than he wouldhave been in had the LSC program never been enacted Respondentsproperly concede that even if welfare claimants cannot obtain alawyer anywhere else the Government is not required to provideone Brief for Respondents  accord Goldberg v Kelly  U S   government not required to provide counsel athearing regarding termination of welfare benefits It is hard tosee how providing free legal services to some welfare claimantsthose whose claims do not challenge the applicable statutes whilenot providing it to others is beyond the range of legitimatelegislative choice Rust rejected a similar argumentPetitioners contend however that most Title X cliSCALIA J dissentingents are effectively precluded by indigency and poverty fromseeing a healthcare provider who will provide abortionrelatedservices But once again even these Title X clients are in noworse position than if Congress had never enacted Title X Thefinancial constraints that restrict an indigent womans ability toenjoy the full range of constitutionally protected freedom ofchoice are the product not of governmental restrictions on accessto abortion but rather of her indigency  U S at internal quotation marks omittedThe only conceivable argument that can be made fordistinguishing Rust is that there even patients who wished toreceive abortion counseling could receive the nonabortion servicesthat the Governmentfunded clinic offered whereas here somepotential LSC clients who wish to receive representation on abenefits claim that does not challenge the statutes will be unableto do so because their cases raise a reform claim that an LSClawyer may not present This difference of course is required bythe same ethical canons that the Court elsewhere does not wish todistort Rather than sponsor truncated representation ante at Congress chose to subsidize only those cases in which theattorneys it subsidized could work freely See eg  U S C Attorneys providing legal assistance must have fullfreedom to protect the best interests of their clients And it isimpossible to see how this difference from Rust has any bearingupon the First Amendment question which to repeat is whether thefunding scheme is manipulated to have a coercive effect onthose who do not hold the subsidized position National Endowmentfor Arts v Finley  U S at  quoting Arkansas WritersProject Inc v Ragland  U S at  SCALIA Jdissenting It could be claimed to have such an effect if theclient in a case ineligible for LSC representation could eliminatethe ineligibility by waiving the claim that the statute is invalidbut he cannot No conceivable coercive effect existsThis has been a very long discussion to make a point that isembarrassingly simple The LSC subsidy neither prevents anyone fromspeaking nor coerces anyone to change speech and isindistinguishable in all relevant respects from the subsidy upheldin Rust v Sullivan supra There is no legitimate basis fordeclaring a facially unconstitutionalIIIEven were I to accept the Courts First Amendment analysis Icould not join its decision to conclude this litigation withoutreaching the issue of severability That issue although decided bythe Second Circuit was not included within the question on whichcertiorari was granted and as the Court points out was notbriefed or argued here I nonetheless think it an abuse ofdiscretion to ignore itThe Court has said that we may consider questions outside thescope of the limited order granting certiorari when resolution ofthose questions is necessary for the proper disposition of thecase Piper Aircraft Co v Reyno  U S   n  I think it necessary to a proper disposition here becausethe statute concocted by the Court of Appeals bears littleresemblance to what Congress enacted funding without restrictionwelfarebenefits litigation that Congress funded only under thelimitations of a Although no party briefed severabilityin Denver Area Ed Telecommunications Consortium Inc v FCC U S   the Justices finding partial unconstitutionalityconsidered it necessary to address the issue Id at plurality opinion We must ask whether a is severableaccord New York v United States  U S    Ithink we have that same obligation here Moreover by exercisingour discretion to leave the severability question open we failto resolve the basic realworld dispute at issue whether LSCattorneys may represent welfare claimants who challenge theapplicable welfare laws Indeed we leave the LSC program subjectto even a greater uncertainty than the one we purport to haveeliminated since other circuits may conclude as I do that if thelimitation upon welfare representation is unconstitutional LSCattorneys cannot engage in welfare litigation at allThe inquiry into whether a statute is severable is essentiallyan inquiry into legislative intent Minnesota v Mille Lacs Bandof Chippewa Indians  U S    If Congress wouldnot have enacted those provisions which are within its powerindependently of that which is not then courts must strike theprovisions as a piece Alaska Airlines Inc v Brock  U S   internal quotation marks omitted One determineswhat Congress would have done by examining what it did Perhaps themost that can be said on the subject is contained in a passagewritten by Chief Justice Shaw of the Supreme Judicial Court ofMassachusetts that we have often quotedIf a statutes provisions are so mutually connected withand dependent on each other as conditions considerations orcompensations for each other as to warrant a belief that thelegislature intended them as a whole and that if all could not becarried into effect the legislature would not pass the residueindependently and some parts are unconstitutional all theprovisions which as thus dependent conditional or connected mustfall with them Warren v Mayor and Aldermen of Charlestown Mass   It is clear to me that the LSC Acts funding of welfare benefitssuits and its prohibition on suits challenging or defending thevalidity of existing law are conditions considerations andcompensations for each other that cannot be severed Congressthrough the LSC Act intended to provide high quality legalassistance to those who would be otherwise unable to affordadequate legal counsel  U S C  but only if theprogram could at the same time be kept free from the influence ofor use by it of political pressures  More than a dozentimes in a Congress made the decision that certain activitiescould not be funded at all without crippling the LSC program withpolitical pressures See eg a reapportionmentlitigation a local state and federal lobbyinga class action lawsuits a training programsfor inter alia boycotts picketing and demonstrationsa litigation with respect to abortion The severabilityquestion here is essentially whether without the restrictionthat the Court today invalidates the permission for conductingwelfare litigation would have been accorded As far as appears fromthe best evidence which is the structure of the statute I thinkthe answer must be noWe have in some cases stated that when an excepting proviso isfound unconstitutional the substantive provisions which itqualifies cannot stand for to hold otherwise would be to extendthe scope of the law    so as to embrace situations which thelegislature passing the statute had by its very terms expresslyexcluded Frostv Corporation Commn of Okla  U S    seealso Davis v Wallace  U S    Where anexcepting provision in a statute is found unconstitutional courtsvery generally hold that this does not work an enlargement of thescope or operation of other provisions with which that provisionwas enacted and which it was intended to qualify or restrain Ifrankly doubt whether this approach has been followed consistentlyenough to be called the general rule but if there were ever aninstance in which it is appropriate it is here To strike therestriction on welfare benefits suits is to void aaltogether Subsection a prohibits involvement in three typesof activities with respect to welfare reform lobbying rulemakingand litigation But the proscriptions against using LSC funds toparticipate in welfare lobbying and rulemaking are superfluoussince as described above subsections a a and a of withhold LSC funds from those activities generally What isunique about subsection a the only thing it achieves is itslimit on litigation To remove that limit is to repeal subsectiona altogether and thus to eliminate a significant quid proquo of the legislative compromise We have no authority to rewritethe statute and give it an effect altogether different from whatCongress agreed to Railroad Retirement Bd v Alton R CoU S    quoted in Carter v Carter Coal Co U S    It is illuminating to speculate how these cases would havebeen decided if Congress had enacted a without itsproviso prescribing only the general ban against litigationlobbying or rulemaking involving an effort to reform a Federal orState welfare system and if the positions of the parties beforeus here were reversed If the LSCfunded lawyers were here arguingthat the statute permitted representation of individual welfareclaimants who did not challenge existing law I venture to say thatthe Court would endorse their argument perhaps with stirringlanguage about the importance of aid to welfare applicants and theCourts unwillingness to presume without clear indication thatCongress would want to eliminate it And I have little doubt thatin that contextSCALIA J dissentingthe Court would find its current First Amendment musings asunpersuasive as I find them todayTodays decision is quite simply inexplicable on the basis ofour prior law The only difference between Rust and the presentcase is that the former involved distortion of that is to sayrefusal to subsidize the normal work of doctors and the latterinvolves distortion of that is to say refusal to subsidize thenormal work of lawyers The Courts decision displays not only animproper special solicitude for our own profession it alsodisplays I think the very fondness for reform through thecourts the making of innumerable social judgments throughjudgepronounced constitutional imperatives that prompted Congressto restrict publicly funded litigation of this sort The Court saystoday through an unprecedented and indeed previously rejectedinterpretation of the First Amendment that we will not allow thisrestriction and then to add insult to injury permits to stand ajudgment that awards the general litigation funding that thestatute does not contain I respectfully dissent
