                    Background        Certain genetic loci are known to modify the expression        of other allelic or nonallelic partner loci in a        meiotically heritable fashion If allelic such        nonMendelian interactions are referred to as paramutation        In the nonallelic case the term heritable        transsilencing may be used Paramutation has been studied        extensively for four maize loci that encode transcriptional        regulators of pigment biosynthesis     Paramutation has        also been investigated in the Arabidopsis         PAI gene family at the         a and chalcone synthase CHS        transgene loci in petunia and in a number of other cases              The Arabidopsis resistance gene         BALCPR displays a related form of        epigenetic instability      Interactions resembling        paramutation also occur among nonallelic transgene loci        with DNA sequence homology In these cases one master locus        tends to suppress the expression of its target locus        transsilencing         Paramutation and        transsilencing are related processes For example an        inverted repeat allele of the tryptophan biosynthetic gene         PAI resident in the WS ecotype of        Arabidopsis silences homologous         PAI alleles as well as unlinked         PAI genes from the Columbia ecotype            Likewise complex synthetic transgenes composed of         PAI inverted repeats were able to        transmethylate homologous yet nonallelic target loci            Similar events have been observed in other species        eg            Epigenetic activity defined here as partnership in        heritable transsilencing or paramutation is not        predictable from the DNA sequence alone and its molecular        basis is incompletely understood Arguably the most widely        implicated factor is the presence of complex DNA sequence        repeats These repeats are often part of the transsilencer        locus or paramutagenic locus or its target                However the repeat can sometimes be located at a        considerable distance from the affected locus itself as        has recently been shown for the singlecopy maize         b gene     Other than        transcriptional gene silencing paramutation is only weakly        correlated with DNA methylation The methylation status of        the maize         r genes and Arabidopsis         PAI genes is altered upon        paramutation      while that of maize         b is not     except in the        nonconventional way in the distal paramutationcontrol        region of         b     Conversely extensive        exposure of a wildtype Arabidopsis         SUPERMAN allele to a heavily        methylated and transcriptionally silenced epiallele did not        reveal any transsilencing            The stochastic nature of gene silencing has been        documented on numerous occasions eg      including        in one of the initial descriptions of cosuppression            However with specific regards to epigenetically active        transgene loci it is often not transparent whether their        silencing behavior was stable over successive generations        nor when and how individual loci acquired their epigenetic        activity Certain loci are known to acquire their        epigenetic activity spontaneously     suggesting an        epigenetic control mechanism For instance at the         b locus one specific allele can        switch spontaneously from a nonparamutagenic        transcriptionally active state to a paramutagenic        transcriptionally silenced state     Whether the same        is true for transsilencing is not well established        Whether the imprint imposed by a paramutagenic locus is        relayed effectively from the first target locus to a        secondary target locus is a variable characteristic of        paramutation systems and this has implications for the        speed of epiallele conversion within outcrossing        populations Paramutable maize alleles of         b and         pl are highly effective in relaying        such an imprint     also see     whereas other        loci although sensitive to imprinting are less effective           or apparently ineffective    in relaying the        imprint to secondary targets Likewise Arabidopsis         PAI and         PAI genes that have been        transmethylated by the         PAIPAI locus do not transfer their        methylation status to naive singlet genes     In fact        there are few welldocumented cases for the nonallelic        relay of transsilencing ability      Does this        amount to an operational difference between allelic        paramutation and nonallelic transsilencing        interactions or does it simply reflect a lack of data        A translational fusion between green fluorescent protein        GFP and the Arabidopsis Constitutive Photomorphogenesis        protein COP has been established as a reporter for        transsilencing events in Arabidopsis     A        cauliflower mosaic virus S promoter driven         GFPCOP locus named C        exemplifies an epigenetically active transsilencer locus        C contains at least three copies of a TDNA comprising        the         SGFPCOP gene as well as a        kanamycin resistance gene driven by the nopaline synthase        promoter          nosnptII  The C locus is        silenced transcriptionally TGS but retains partial        expression of both         nptII and         GFPCOP          GFPCOP remains expressed in the        seedling root but is largely silenced in the shoot Other         SGFPCOP loci become        transcriptionally silenced upon exposure to the C locus        Fig  The transsilencing activity of C is        conveniently visualized by its negative effect on the        coplike cosuppression phenotype that is associated with        the target locus For example L is a single TDNA        locus that causes homozygositydependent cosuppression of        its         GFPCOP transgene and of the        endogenous         COP gene at the rosette stage of        development type Llate silencing which in turn results        in a characteristic dwarfing and other aspects of a         cop like phenotype     In        contrast E type Eearly is an oligomeric TDNA locus        that causes homozygositydependent         COP endogene silencing at the        seedling stage in particular deetiolation in darkgrown        seedlings E also causes essentially dominant        cosuppression at the adult stage Both L and E are        silenced posttranscriptionally PTGS and both are        representative for a larger group of loci with similar        transgene silencing characteristics Note that PTGS is        often homozygositydependent     The transsilencing        of the PTGS loci L or E by the C silencer locus is        most easily apparent by the loss of the typical         cop like cosuppressionphenotype        Fig      Similar results were obtained for another        transsilencer locus C        The experimental strategy of monitoring heritable        epialleles via their effect on visible cosuppression        patterns has been pioneered in the chalcone synthase CHS        family of petunia and Arabidopsis       For        comparison         CHS transsilencing offers exquisite        sensitivity in part due to the cell autonomy of its        pigmentation phenotype whereas         COP essentially yields a wholeplant        phenotype Petunia         CHS also lends itself to detect        somatic transitions in epialleles due to its indeterminate        growth habit whereas Arabidopsis         COP is more suitable for monitoring        early epigenetic activity in seedlings and rosette        plants        We have begun to define the determinants of epigenetic        activity of the         GFPCOP loci The transsilencers as        well as their targets reside in singlecopy generich        regions that are only sparsely populated with repetitive or        transposable elements features that have been shown to        mediate epigenetic activity in other cases              Therefore transsilencing of         GFPCOP is probably not mediated by        transgene flanking sequences     In contrast as with        other genes cited above transsilencing ability is        correlated with transgene locus structure given that the        C and C transsilencers contain multiple TDNAs while        their targets E and L are essentially dimeric and        monomeric respectively        Here we report that the Arabidopsis C and C        transsilencer loci displayed TGS and transsilencing after        first passing through a transitory phase of PTGS over the        course of the first two transgenic generations A similar        epigenetic instability of the initial PTGS phenotype was        typical for a subset of other oligomeric loci but was        never observed with monomeric         SGFPCOP loci It is this        instability of cosuppression that originally prompted us to        categorize certain loci as type C rather than type E We        also characterized the heritability of the imprint imposed        by the C transsilencer locus with respect to a        cosuppression of the         COP endogene and b a        characteristic yet unusual expansion of transgene        expression at the target locus Finally our data suggest        that the L target locus acquires limited transsilencing        activity of its own after exposure to C which is an        unusual case for transgenes However these data must be        interpreted in light of another novel observation namely        that even relatively simple transcriptionally active        transgene loci can interact with nonlinear gene dosage        effects that have characteristics of epigenetic        transsilencing                    Results                  The silencing phenotypes of C and C were          acquired epigenetically          Many of the most potent epigenetically active loci are          endogenous rather than transgenic and therefore their          early epigenetic history is not completely known In          contrast transgenes have a defined date of origin within          a plant lineage In our transgenebased system the          silencer loci           GFPCOP C and C underwent an          apparently spontaneous transition in their silencing          behavior between the T and T generations Fig A In          detail the progeny of the primary transgenic plant T          plant C which possessed a single transgene locus as          determined by segregation of antibiotic resistance          segregated almost one quarter coplike seedlings in the          darkgrown T generation This dosage dependence of          endogene silencing was the same as for the PTGS locus E          Fig  Unambiguous evidence for a cosuppression of          transgene and endogene as opposed to a dominant negative          effect of the transgenic protein has previously been          shown for line L and others     and COP endogene          suppression was also associated with GFPCOP silencing          in T generation type C lines not shown At the adult          stage  of T plants in line C were visibly          cosuppressed In contrast the T generation derived by          selfing of T plants and known by runon transcription          assay to be silenced by TGS     had few coplike          seedlings and no coplike adult plants Similar results          were obtained for line C The C line is the only line          in this work that contains two unlinked loci              which may have contributed to the high incidence of PTGS          in T seedlings Neither of these loci retained its          endogene silencing ability in the T Fig  No           COP cosuppression was observed          beyond the T generation of C or C not shown Two          additional oligomeric           GFPCOP loci C and C which          have not been tested for their transsilencing behavior          also changed from a cosuppressing state in the T          generation to a noncosuppressing state in the T Fig          A In contrast none of four single TDNA type L loci          lost their endogene silencing ability Fig B The          apparent increase in adult COP cosuppression from the T          to the T of some type L lines was not statistically          significant The type E loci E and E were also stable          Fig C Together these results suggest that PTGS in          certain oligomeric TDNA loci is unstable and has a          tendency to progress to TGS In line C the transition          probably began in T seedlings as suggested by the small          fraction of adult T plants with a coplike PTGS          phenotype                          Transgene locus structure of the E locus          In order to distinguish the L and E loci more          confidently in subsequent experiments we defined the          structure of the E locus in more detail The L locus          is a simple TDNA locus at a defined chromosomal          location In contrast Southern blots probed with the          TDNA right border RB revealed two fragments for E              Early attempts to isolate the E flanking          sequence by TAILPCR repeatedly recovered a fortuitous          junction between a left border LB and a partial TDNA          truncated near the  end of the           GFPCOP gene A schematic drawing          of the E locus structure incorporating all of these          data as well as data from blots probed with LB and           COP sequences not shown is          presented in Fig  This model was subsequently          confirmed in two ways an           NdeI restriction site predicted          from Southern blots was confirmed in the flanking          sequence     and PCR amplification with specific          primers across the flanks of the transgene and across the          internal LBRB junction resulted in the expected product          lengths Fig  Thus we propose that the E locus          consists of a direct repeat which is joined at the tail          end by a partial TDNA in an inverted orientation                          Transsilencing by C results in variable novel          transgene expression patterns including spatial          expansion of transgene expression          The C transsilencer locus caused transcriptional          silencing of two target loci tested L and E which          is most easily detected by a suppression of the typical          endogene cosuppression of the target loci Fig               As expected the spatial expression pattern of Ls           GFPCOP gene was restricted          though not completely abolished upon exposure to C          not shown see Fig Dbelow In contrast F families          segregating for C and E contained many plants with an          expanded spatial pattern of expression namely          reactivation of transgene expression in the cotyledons          and the first two pairs of leaves especially in          trichomes Fig panels B E H and K For comparison          the naive E locus as well as C alone were silenced in          the leaves Fig ADGand Jand Fig CFIand M          Such a reactivation had previously been observed in the          dihybrid CE F parent plants     The          reactivated expression was subsequently ascribed to the          E locus rather than C by testing F segregants          lacking C see Figure below In summary silencing of          L and E by C was incomplete as especially E          recovered partial transgene expression in organs where it          was not normally expressed          These results underscore the similarity between          transsilencing and paramutation because in both cases          epialleles are often silenced incompletely and may also          adopt novel regulatory patterns      for example          light inducibility     Perhaps silencing at the          dimeric E locus involves a hierarchical relationship          between its two intact TDNAs The C locus may          preferentially target a postulated master TDNA which          in turn loses its ability to posttranscriptionally          silence the subordinate TDNA within the E locus                          Two target loci of C maintain their epigenetic          imprint heritably for up to five generations          A diagnostic PCR assay was developed for the L E          and C loci to unambiguously identify F segregants          containing a transsilenced L or E target locus but          lacking the C silencer locus Fig B compare lanes           with lanes  In addition hemizygous segregants          were distinguished from homozygotes by segregation of the          kanamycin resistance gene in their selfed progeny          compare lanes  with  Subsequently the rate of          phenotypic reversion from transsilencing was observed          for hemizygous and homozygous lineages of E and L A          legend for scoring the           cop like cosuppression and           GFPCOP transgene silencing          patterns is shown in Fig A Unless exposed to C E          plants are always           cop like and silenced for          GFPCOP and the same is true for homozygous L plants          In contrast E plants and homozygous L plants were          wild typelike rather than cosuppressed in the F if          the transgene had been exposed to C in the F Fig          Cand D previously summarized in     Both the          reactivation of Es GFPCOP transgene expression as          well as suppression of endogene silencing were maintained          for up to four additional generations in the absence of          C in hemizygous and homozygous families while C          remained silenced Fig C The L lineage also          maintained its imprint from C over up to five          generations Specifically the coplike cosuppression          phenotype typical for homozygous L plants remained          suppressed Fig D          Although the imprints on the E and L loci proved          to be fairly stable reversion was observed in two ways          First a small fraction less than  expected for full          reversion of coplike E plants and L plants          appeared in the F generation not reflected in Fig           and second the GFPCOP expression of E gradually          reverted back from the reactivated pattern to the          silenced pattern especially in hemizygous families Fig          C The transgene expression data for the imprinted L          lineage were less informative However it appears that          the hemizygous L lineage gradually recovered its           GFPCOP expression but without          reaching the threshold required for posttranscriptional          cosuppression of the           COP gene                          Imprinting relay Do transsilenced E and L          loci acquire transsilencing ability          Our data suggested that the C locus may have          acquired its transsilencing activity as part of an          epigenetic transition from type E to type C silencing          between the T and T generations Thus it is reasonable          to ask whether the transsilencing activity be farther          transferable from the type C locus to other loci It          seemed problematic to test whether the transsilenced L          locus henceforth termed L can paramutate a naive L          allele because we cannot distinguish between the L          master and the L target at the molecular level          Instead L was tested for its effect on a naive E          locus and E was tested against L because these loci          are distinguishable by diagnostic PCR assays Because          L and E no longer cause           COP cosuppression it was easy to          monitor the interaction by following the cosuppression          phenotypes of the naive E and L loci Figure          provides an overview over the crossing scheme and          experimental data are presented in Tables to           Significantly the L locus suppressed the           COP endogene silencing by the E          target locus in the majority of F dihybrid plants          whereas a naive L locus did not Table  Although          only four relevant plants were recovered by genotyping in          the L  E control experiment the entire L  E          family contained a large fraction of silenced plants          larger than with L and E which was compatible with          an additive interaction between L and E not shown          As expected at the level of transgene expression both          L E and L E plants were silenced          Table  Fig  Likewise in the F progeny L          continued to suppress the endogene silencing by E          Table  Fig  which is normally expected to affect          about three quarters of F progeny Importantly upon          genotyping of individual F plants five wild typelike          plants were identified that carried only E and no L          locus confirming that L can leave a heritable imprint          on E Table  However two additional pieces of data          distinguish the transsilencing activity of L from          that of C First the F families clearly contained          plants displaying endogene silencing In the one case          tested this was due not surprisingly to an E locus          that had escaped from L and resumed its endogene          silencing Table  Therefore L is a less effective          transsilencer than C     Second and more          surprisingly even naive L and E loci which had          shown no transsilencing in the F displayed a loss of          the E cosuppression phenotype in the F Table           Instead of an expected Mendelian ratio of            cop like plants only  were          observed a significant shortfall Genotyping of          individual F plants revealed a stochastic escape from           COP endogene silencing in plants          containing both E and L and including even a single          E plant that lacked L Table  Such a loss of          cosuppression has not been observed among hundreds of          plants containing just E alone our unpublished data          These data suggest an epigenetic modification of E          after exposure to a naive L locus          In contrast to the epigenetic activity of          transsilenced L E had no such activity When E          was combined with L both loci cooperated to cause          endogene silencing as seen with unmodified E and L          Table  This was unexpected given that E caused          little or no endogene cosuppression with L or on its          own Cooperative cosuppression between bona fide          imprinted E and a naive L locus was again detected          in the F progeny Table  Thus E was clearly          unable to transsilence a naive L locus and in fact          seemed to lose its imprint when exposed to L therefore          these families were not analyzed further E also did          not transsilence a naive E locus not shown          Taken together these data allow three conclusions          First experiments with naive L and E demonstrated          that even relatively simple transgene loci associated          with PTGS can display nonadditive gene dosage effects          as apparent by heritable suppression of PTGS Second the          imprint left on the L locus by the C transsilencer          did modify Ls epistatic interaction with a nonallelic          target locus E as seen in the F generation However          it remains to be determined whether this transsilencing          effect is more likely to be heritable when L is in an          imprinted state L than in the naive state L          Third the imprint on the E locus E was more          labile than the imprint on L and showed no evidence of          being transferable                            Discussion        Epigenetic imprints affecting the expression of nuclear        genes differ in the efficiency with which they are relayed        onto homologous sequences In the classical case of        paramutation at the maize         b locus the imprint is relayed with         efficiency     That is a paramutated allele is        turned into a paramutagenic allele In contrast to our        knowledge no transsilenced transgene has been shown to        acquire heritable transsilencing ability suggesting that        perhaps transsilencing ability is more difficult to relay        between nonallelic transgenes than between allelic loci        However the endogenous         prr allele of maize did acquire        paramutagenicity after exposure to a specific         P enhancer transgene            Against this background we investigated the possible relay        of an imprint triggered by the Arabidopsis C        transsilencer locus asking specifically whether targets        transsilenced by the C locus a acquired        transsilencing activity and b were able to pass their        imprint on to a naive target locus in a heritable        fashion        In summary the imprinted E locus E displayed no        significant ability to transsilence a naive L locus In        contrast L was initially able to transsilence E as        judged by suppression of the endogene cosuppression        phenotype associated with naive E importantly the        unmodified L control locus did not have this ability        Table  Thus we demonstrated aspect a of the        imprinting relay Moreover the suppression of silencing at        the E locus was partially but not fully heritable given        that some but not all E segregants lacking L were        wildtype Table  Yet these data fall short of proving        aspect b of the imprinting relay because surprisingly        the combination of naive L and E loci also caused        nonlinear gene dosage effects that could result in the        heritable transsilencing of the E locus in at least one        instance Whether L might paramutate an allelic L        locus remains to be tested The nonlinear gene dosage        effects between L and E were surprising to us because        in tobacco similar experiments conducted with         SGUS transgenes did not raise the        suspicion of epigenetically heritable effects            It is informative to compare the epigenetic interactions        of the         SGFPCOP transgenes with those of        the         PAI transgenes the only other        wellcharacterized system in Arabidopsis     Both gene        sets consist of relatively simple repeat structures and        singlet loci which reside in essentially singlecopy        environments of Arabidopsis     and unpublished        observations The first comparison relates to the speed of        epigenetic change Here combining a master locus C        with a nonallelic singlet locus possessing  sequence        identity L resulted in immediate transsilencing as        seen by a reduction of GFPCOP expression and block of        cosuppression which was stably maintained in the presence        or absence of the master locus In contrast in the         PAI gene family combining the master        locus WS ecotype         PAIPAI  with a nonallelic        singlet target locus possessing  sequence identity        Columbia         PAI  resulted in methylation after        two generations of heterozygous contact and methylation        became more pronounced after another two generations            Likewise in the petunia         CHS gene family interaction between        an epiallele of the directrepeat locus CHS with two        types of target loci either an unlinked inverted repeat        locus or a more nave allele of CHS was initially        additive and only became suppressive in the second        generation             The second comparison relates to the relay of epigenetic        activity In our system a transsilenced singlet gene        L was able to transsilence a naive homolog E        within a single generation In contrast a transmethylated        singlet         PAI gene did not transmethylate a        naive allelic         PAI gene within three generations            Additional experimentation may eventually provide an        answer to the question of what controls the efficiency of        such epigenetic interactions        Cosuppression of the endogenous COP gene is a        consequence of posttranscriptional silencing while        transcriptionally transsilenced loci do not cosuppress        COP     In our hands a subset of four         SGFPCOP transgene loci shifted        from a cosuppressing state bona fide PTGS to a        noncosuppressing state ie TGS within two transgenic        generations These loci are therefore referred to as        complex loci Note that type L and type E loci did not        lose their PTGS phenotype Fig B This includes the L        locus which has a reduced penetrance of cosuppression that        may be attributable to its pericentromeric location            Intriguingly both transsilencer loci C and C        belong to the complex group adding weight to the        proposition that like paramutagenicity transsilencing        activity is encoded epigenetically Vice versa this        transition raises the question whether the originally        strong transcription of the         GFPCOP genes or perhaps the        ensuing PTGS phase somehow sets the stage for the        subsequent transsilencing activity especially if        multimeric TDNA loci are involved PTGS and        transsilencing are similarly intertwined in other cases        for example in the epimutable petunia CHS locus            PTGS often leads to DNA methylation although primarily in        coding regions     However DNA methylation of        promoters more easily aligned with transcriptional        silencing can be RNA mediated if suitable double stranded        RNA versions of the promoter sequence are transcribed        either fortuitously or by design                Therefore there may be a natural tendency for PTGS loci to        mature to TGS and associated transsilencing which in turn        could prove problematic in applying PTGS in commercial        plant breeding programs Our data are certainly consistent        with this notion Such hypotheses are testable with the        model system we have established                    Conclusions         Posttranscriptional gene silencing by structurally        complex transgenes loci may be unstable and may be        supplanted by transcriptional gene silencing over the        course of a few plant generations         Heritable modifications of transgene expression        caused by exposure to a transsilencer locus may be stable        for five generations or more         Upon exposure to a transsilencer locus certain        Arabidopsis transgenes display an alteration in their        epistatic interaction with other transgenes These data        suggest that the competence for transsilencing may be        transferred between nonallelic transgenes reminiscent of        the allelic transfer of epigenetic activity during        paramutation         Cosuppression phenotypes can serve as sensitive        indicators of epigenetic interactions between transgenes in        Arabidopsis thaliana                    Methods                  Transgenic Arabidopsis lines and plant          growth          The GFPCOP expression cassette contains a double S          enhancer translational enhancer and S terminator          Most GFPCOP lines and the GUSCOP line L have been          described       Unsilenced GUSCOP and GFPCOP          transgenes complement the cop mutation      The          C and C loci contain at least three and two linked          TDNAs respectively as seen by Southern blotting not          shown Plants were germinated on agar solidified MS          medium containing  sucrose in either constant light or          constant darkness and subsequently grown in soil in          growth chambers at C under constant white light from          fluorescent tubes                          Test for acquired transsilencing activity          Transsilenced L and E plants that lacked the          C silencer locus primelabel were crossed in          pairwise combinations with naive E and L plants          Because transsilencing of E was observed regardless of          whether L was the male or the female parent data from          reciprocal crosses were pooled Individual F dihybrid          plants were inspected for GFPCOP and COP endogene          silencing phenotypes Representative F dihybrids were          checked for the presence of two different transgene loci          by diagnostic PCR assay and by segregation analysis F          segregants containing only the target locus were          identified by PCR based genotyping analogous to the          strategy exemplified in Fig  Plants in which GFPCOP          expression was restricted to roots and cotyledons were          regarded as silenced whereas plants with GFPCOP          visible beyond the cotyledons were considered active                          PCR assays          The diagnostic PCR assays for the C and E loci          display unique PCR products arising from fortuitous and          distinct junctions between the TDNA right border and the          COP cDNA which we recovered in early attempts to          isolate flanking sequences For E the primers are          ATATTTGCTAGCTGATAGTGACC and          GATCCTAGGGGTCTCGTGATTTCTTGTGAT for C they are          TGTCAGTTCCAAACGTAAAACGG and          GACACATCACAAGATCTTTGTAGTGC The assay for the L          locus was based on oligonucleotides specific for the L          flanking sequence AGGCACACAAGCCCAAAAAGAC and the RB          of the TDNA     PCR fragments representing the          structure of the E locus were made as follows Fragment
