                okay how do you keep up with current events   um well actually usually um  in the mornings i am getting ready to either go to work um usually catch the news in the morning   yeah what what channel do you watch or what station   uh NBC   thats the one i watch i usually keep up with TV i dont i am a student so i really dont have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff   umhum   so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isnt   yeah   too great sometimes   yeah i usually tend to just you know rely on you know TV um again you know just through the grapevine just just to know like yeah  what  what todays stories are and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know im interested in any particular one   yeah the radio doesnt really have much news sometimes the stations i listen to are just mainly music   yeah i think you you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all   yeah do you think that TV is um pretty accurate i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized or   well what i really dont like about TV especially local news as compared to like national news is just um it seems it seems like everything is very spoon feed and you know its its more like the news shows is now is is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom   yeah   or like the news because they would always have like the wonderful investigative reports you know is is youre kids bus driver smoking crack on the way to school you know     yeah its they mainly go with like popular topics just not like basic news   umhum yeah also also i have the observation with um with the press is that like any any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press you know which only happened like ten times in my life   huh   you know first thing you know for anything of you know or anything that actually had had more than just a blurb about it that the press has managed to just mess up some aspect of the story its something wrong   yeah going theyre looks like theyre going more for ratings than for   umhum   you know actual news i think you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers   umhum   they typically have a better i am from a small town too here in Texas   umhum   and so that then like local news is really who grew the biggest tomato and   yeah the farm report   yeah farm report and oil reports       thats pretty pretty sad or who killed who   umhum yeah also i have um founded like in newspapers probably arent as bad as television but i just you know read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down and   yeah well in um in Dallas um i dont know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into Lubys and the story was uh   was that like  he started shooting people people in this cafeteria or something   yeah and the news covered it   umhum   right you know hours after it happened and they were taping people who were crying who   umhum   had everything and then like three days later this local news station was using as a as their promo   umhum   to promote themselves i just thought that was really   oh yeah i have seen that happen lots of times you know   thats kind of cold   you know Channel X gives you the best coverage  you know we were on the scene with our team players you know   yeah and it was just they were showing like these dead people and they were showing people crying i mean just taking advantage of you know   umhum uhhuh uhhuh   it real personal moment   they are trying to get the you know most emotional response for   yeah it didnt seem like there was much coverage of the story but just the play on peoples emotions its just gotten so i mean somewhere theres its lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in Walter Cronkite days you know   yeah   and everything   yeah i have you know ive pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know   yeah   um  you know even the national news i just find it to be you know   yeah   very watered down very   yeah what did you think of the coverage of the war   um i found i found it very one sided   did you   um you know i mean it just it just seemed to lack any sort of debate   yeah   um you know you know not saying that we should that we that we definitely should have been there or shouldnt have been there but it just seemed like you know   they kept just showing you know how great we were doing and it never really showed what actually   umhum   the damage that really happened thats   umhum   a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the you know the guys who didnt get hurt coming home and all the big parties and they kind of you know   umhum   if they were going to show that why didnt they show the guys who you know   umhum   got really hurt and everything and   yeah and i really think that you know in the in the involvement that the press states you know that the the military basically sets the press
