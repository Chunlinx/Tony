                                 Strangers in Town                        Dear Ester            I understand your appreciation for urban life I too love citiesas aresident tourist professional visitor etc It generally is one of theconditions of my visiting a city to lecture or consult that I stay at adowntown hotel rather than one on a highway someplace The inspiration formuch of my work has been Jane Jacobs wonderful book The Death and Life ofGreat American Cities             I take your point about making the city a place for tourists at theexpense of residents and neighborhoods Certainly in the subway although I wasconcerned about tourists using the subway my primary concern was the fact thattravel on the subway had become intolerable for people who had to use itstudents service workers and so on The rich were using limos and cabsStudents workers and urban residents in the broadest sense deserved betterthan they were getting            On the city level while I am primarily concerned about the residents ofneighborhoods and communities I am also concerned about strangers that ispersons who come into neighborhoods to shop provide services people watchand all the other things that lovers and users of public spaces do As Jacobshas pointed out for neighborhoods to thrive strangers must both feelcomfortable entering neighborhoods and behave in ways that dont threaten theneighborhood Isolated neighborhoods such as the Robert Taylor Homes inChicago become dangerous placesnot only for visitors but for residents aswell            But of course this takes us into murky areas Clearly both residents andstrangers can take offense too easily Moreover despite the popular viewthat neighborhoods are cozy and warm they also have enormous capacity forpettiness and hostility And it also can be true that one persons disorderis another persons uniqueness Nonetheless I have found this resolvable ifone is attentive to the law the constitution and issues of freedom andresponsibility            The issues you raise about possibilities of abuse however are appropriateIn my own work I have seen the misinterpretation of broken windows for theirown purposes by both the far left and the far right Part of the trouble isthat now everybody understands the ideas in broken windows And for many itis zero tolerance of any forms of disorderly behaviora phrase that I hateand have never used except to distance myself from it It is both unrealisticand smacking of zealotry The far left likes to substitute it for brokenwindows because it proves that I am a fascist conducting a war on homelessand the poor the far right loves the term zero tolerance as a replacementfor broken windows because it justifies police ass kicking            Well I have gone on a bit Since my wife is now traveling I will haveanother cup of coffee and get set for the day            Be wellGeorge Kelling
