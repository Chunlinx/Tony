                                  The Death of MoralnbspDistance            Lately various observers have proclaimed thedeath of distance A bit melodramatic maybe but its true that in an age ofairplanes and optical fibers the world seems pretty small For that matterdistance has been in decline for millenniums Ever since boats were firstpaddled and wagon wheels first turned physical separation has become less andless of an obstacle to commerce and communication            Unfortunately distance has also become less of anobstacle to mayhem Any vehicle that can carry merchants and merchandise cancarry warriors and weapons Germs can hitch a ride too The black death thatravaged Europe in the  th century seems to have started in Asia andfollowed trade routes west In general the march of progress has brought freshreasons to fear what lies beyond the horizon            As distance enters itsdeath throes this sort of fear will have a richer grounding than ever Newconduits of harm will flourish The current scare about millenniumeveterrorism is just one small example            But cheer up The coming globalization of fear isntentirely regrettable It could actually make us in a sense better peoplemore sensitive to suffering around the world The  st century mayeven witness what you could call the deathor at least the declineof moraldistance            One big source oflongdistance fear will be the Internet The problem isnt just virusdesigners privacy invaders and other malicious hackers The Net spreadsdangerous data how to build a conventional or nuclear bomb a chemical orbiological weapon and where to get the ingredients With these weapons inhand a terrorist can use lowtech means of conquering distancesay crossinga border with an atom bomb in a trunk or a vial of anthrax in a vestpocket            Highertech transport will also be available Already amodelsized airplaneweighing  pounds with a foot wingspanhas flownacross the Atlantic Ocean steered precisely by global positioning satellitesIt doesnt take great imagination to envision a poor mans cruise missile witha payload of chemical or biological weapons            The general trend dates back at least to theinvention of gunpowder As technology advances the growing power compactnessand accessibility of lethal technologies mean that more people in more landshave the option of committing atrocities of greater and greater severity Butthe trend is now reaching critical mass a threshold that warrants a rethinkingof Americas stance toward the world            After all not even themost gungho Star Wars booster thinks that a missile shield can screen outeaglesized airplanes or nukes in minivans And the standard recipe fordeterring aggressionassured retaliationmay work fine with states but itsproblematic with terrorists            In the end we may have to try a radical approach tofighting terrorism reduce the number of people who feel alienated andaggrieved enough to become terrorists in the first place            Obviously this wont be easy given the diversityof grievances and the geopolitical complexity surrounding them Besides toindulge specific grievances once theyve become terrorist causes is toencourage terrorism Still there are a few things we can do            First we can acknowledge and maybe even dosomething about some of the disaffecting fallout from globalization such aspollution and cultural dislocation Rightly or wrongly America is seen asglobalizations prime mover and head cheerleader and will be blamed for itsexcesses until we start paying official attention to them            Second whereas traditional foreign policy hasfocused on winning respect from foreign governments we will need to focus moreand more on winning the respect of foreign peoples            And as for thetype of respect we seek Machiavellis advicethat it is better to befeared than lovedwill make much less sense in the  st centurythan it did in the  th  Goodwill toward America is becoming anationalsecurity asset worth cultivating            A prime example of an outmoded policy is the Clintonadministrations response to the African embassy bombings Even with a bunch ofterrorists conveniently assembled in a single spot the cruise missile strikein Afghanistan was selfdefeating It no doubt guaranteed Osama Bin Laden new recruits for every terrorist who was killed And torching that Sudanesepharmaceutical plant didnt do much to dampen antiAmerican sentiment inSudan            So whats a few radicalized Sudanese in the schemeof things Several decades ago the answer was not much Several decades fromnow the answer could be  deaths in midtown Manhattan            There is a second sense in which the security ofAmericans will increasingly demand attention to the plight of foreigners Ittook years for the bubonic plague to spread from China to Western Europe in the th century Today it takes hours for the AIDS or Ebola virus totravel halfway around the world            Here as with terrorism it is less feasible towall ourselves off from the problem than to address the root cause diseaseabroad especially in developing nations where industrialization has turnedsome cities into a paradise for viruses and bacteria            In one realm oflifefinancealmost everyone now accepts that technology is tying the welfareof Americans more closely to the welfare of foreigners in a globalizedeconomy an economic downturn abroad can be contagious Hence the InternationalMonetary Fund The same logic will apply more and more to medical health andwhat you might call cultural and political health The less disease abroad theless cultural alienation abroad the less political grievance abroad thehealthier and safer Americans will be            But if you care more about faraway people in faraway landsonly because their welfare may affect yours does that really count as moralimprovement Does selfinterested concern for others make you a goodperson            That depends on what you mean by good In FlanneryOConnors story A Good Man Is Hard To Find a crotchety and selfcenteredgrandmother held at gunpoint by an escaped convict in rural Georgia
