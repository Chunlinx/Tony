                                 The Beasts on the Bus            Run for your life Now thepress is actually hitting people Even saintly CSPAN has turnedviolent                           By Roger

become a contact sport until a videocamera smackedher in the head Im sorry  she said to the young cameraman who hadwhacked her with  pounds of cold steel but that was my head youhit The cameraman looked at her briefly sneered and then returned to hisshot Joan Egland was a prop Politicians staffs assemble crowds to form thebackground for TV pictures The props are expected to applaud they are notexpect to complain            Joans husband StanleyEgland  went up to the young man and tapped him on the shoulderCameramenofficially they are known as videographers though some years agothey were nicknamed Visigothshate to be touched It jiggles the camera Theyoung man whirled around and thats when Egland gave him a shove In Iowawhen you smash somebody in the head with a large piece of metal you areexpected to apologize            Bob Dole was oblivious toall this of course Surrounded by cameras sound men still photographers andreporters he could barely see the audience let alone take notice of thecasualties in it The room at the Iowa State Memorial Union was a smallonecampaigns try to get the smallest room possible to make the crowds lookbigger and so the press horde must muscle its way through tight spaces Thepencil press can sometimes hang around the edges writing sardonic littlecomments in their notebooks but the TV crews must get good pictures and goodsound That is why they exist            So themajor danger of the press is not as James Fallows argues that journaliststhreaten democracy by their shallow and relentless cynicism And the majordanger is not as Kathleen Hall Jamieson argues that political coverage isstrategy saturated polldriven and manipulated by artful consultantsThe main danger of the press corps in America today is that they can knock yourblock off The boys on the bus have become the beasts on the bus            The number of crews chasing the candidates around growslarger every election cycle At an event in Iowa this year there were fivecrews from CBS alone including a crew for  Minutes  one for a specialthe network was doing one for Sunday Morning  another for the news thatnight and one for the poolthe taketurnsandshare system sometimesimposed on the press in a futile attempt to cut down on this sort ofinsanity            Multiply that by the othermajor networks plus CNN and CSPAN add the local affiliates and independentsand you begin to get the idea Just a few presidential cycles ago you wouldsee a crew from say Tallahassee Fla or Rockford Ill only if a local manwas running            Today TV crews fromsmaller markets are in Iowa New Hampshire and other states as a matter ofroutine And its not just because time on the bird the communicationssatellite has gotten cheap Such coverage is good

I call Big Eventtelevision  Its cheaper than going out and doing hard work or breakingoriginal stories or investing time in doing investigative stories They get atruck and picture up and they look like a national news organization            At the Holiday Inn in West Des Moines in February SteveForbes showed up for a campaign brunch with  camera crews Please moveaway Kevin McLaughlin the Forbes chairman for Polk County pleaded with apress corps that insisted on standing between Forbes and the audience Thepress did not move away It couldnt There was no away Cameramen soundmen still photographers and reporters clogged all available space jostlingpeople as they sat and ate I paid good money a man yelled at a camera crewplanted directly between him and the candidate The sound man turned around andmouthed an apology but did not move            Four days later at lunchtime in Nashua NH at Marthas Exchange a restaurant and brew pub Forbesengaged in a staple of primary campaigning a meet and greet sometimescalled a grip and grin with diners It is not easy under the best ofcircumstancesfew diners actually want to be interrupted by politicians whilechewingbut Forbes was still being followed by an enormous press contingentAs soon as he exited his bus he was surrounded by camera crews and boom mikesarching overhead like brontosauri looking for lunch            Forbes entered therestaurant and walked over to the candy counter where he purchased somehomemade fudge for  handing over a  bill and two pennies SteveForbes carries pennies I wrote in my notebook He then put a piece of fudgein his mouth chewed and turned toward the cameras Which is when they surgedforward to catch whatever gems might usher forth from his lips and when aish woman waiting for a table got hit in the head by a camera            Could you please watchout she asked the cameraman            Shut up he screamed ather            What did you say shesaid to the cameraman            Shut up shut up shutup he screamed at her What the prop didnt understand was that she wasruining his sound Without thinking about it Americas TV audience has come toexpect nearperfection when it comes to sound and video The pictures must bein focus and steadyno bounces no jiggles And the sound must beinterferencefree People are listening in stereo now            Thesecrushes do get big but its what we do  says Susan Zirinsky executiveproducer for Campaign  at CBS News and model for the Holly Hunter characterin Broadcast News  Very infrequently do you miss a major shot ifyoure a network crew It doesnt happen  And they dont miss the soundeither Sound becomes so critical Zirinsky says If a whole newsstory is one comment you dont want to miss it            And so you dont miss it Forbes swallowed the fudgeGood he said            Then he strode through thepress crush knowing it would part for him But the aisles couldnt accommodateall the cameramen and photographers who wanted a good angle on Forbes Onecameraman leapt up on a table as astonished diners looked up at him ThenForbes plunged into the kitchen Guys guys we have food here a waitresswailed as one camera crew dragged its cable over a tray of cheeseburger            The camera and soundpeople blame producers who when the competition comes up with a picture orsoundbite you missed dont want to hear excuses about how you didnt want totrample some old lady            And notjust old ladies The next day Forbes went to Sunapee NH where his campaignsearched out the quaintest general store they could find to demonstrate howForbes unlike Lamar Alexander the day before knew the price of milk Quaintgeneral stores have quaint narrow aisles and the few people inside werequickly run over by a metalpacking press corps Which is where I got slammedin the head by a cameraman As I struggled to stay on my feet I looked at theside of his camera and saw a CSPAN decal Getting whacked in the head byCSPAN is like getting kneed in the groin

where he saw a cameraman accidentally slam atripod into the head of young woman knocking her into semiconsciousnessThe Associated Press reported that in Center Barnstead a tiny New Hampshirevillage
