                     OK                     Am I sitting in the right spot                     Youre fine         What stories or books do you remember reading as a child         Was there a favorite         So thats two questions         What stories or books do you remember reading                     My favorite books were all about The Boxcar Children                     OK         Did you have a favorite         I mean of any of those did you have a favorite                     No         I just couldnt wait to get my hands on the next one that would come out         And and now today they have a lot more than they ever had available when I was little                     Do you remember a particular color         Right now theyre all beige                     Right                     if Im not mistaken                     Seems to me like a lot of them were yellow         It was like a goldishyellow         Not a bright sunshine yellow a warm gold looking                     What age were you when you started reading those approximately                     Those books                     Uhhuh                     It would have been the first grade                     Did they have any illustrations         I dont think they have any illustrations do they                     No         Not many at all                     All right         This might sound like a different kind of question but is there a certain type of smell that they had to them                     Just um just an old musty librarytype smell you know                     Hmm         OK         Was there a particular place for reading that you had when you were a child                     I loved to go outside         Our neighbors had a big pasture         So actually Id go sit in the pasture and read         Sun or freezing I loved it                     All right         What stories or books do you remember somebody reading to you                     Well my cousin helped me learn to read before I ever started school and most of those were just your little basic I Can Read books         Thats what theyre called now I dont I dont know what they were called then but the Dick and Jane type books                     Yeah         See them run                              Yeah         Exactly                     All right         Did you have a favorite                     Let me think                  I can remember her helping me to read the the books         The main ones were like the Emperor with no clothes                                                               Yeah         You know that type books         Absolutely                     All right         Um are there any illustrations that you remember from books that other people read to you                              Um the one that stands out in my mind are the fables         I can remember as a child looking at all the fable pictures                     OK         Um all right         Is there a particular person that you liked to I mean that read to you that you liked to hear                     Yes yes         My um cousin Roseanne         She lived with us at the time         Shes the one who got me interested in reading                     How old was she                     She was nine years older than me         So         you know it was really a good age to                     Is there a place that she read to you                     We would sit on the living room couch by the lamp                     What stories do you remember family members telling you                     Hmm                  There again a lot of them were the fables          mostly stories that had some type of moral or a catch to it you know                     Right         Um were there any associations with events the stories that they told you with anything that happened in real life         It doesnt have to be like stories from a book any story                     I had an uncle that would tell me like WWII stories and that type of thing you know         And things that they remembered from you uh like from the Great Depression or the Holocaust or you know even though they werent directly involved in that         That type thing                     Um do you remember any of those         I mean can you remember enough to tell any of it         If you cant its not a big deal                     Well my mother she was just a little girl when during the Depression         She told about how you know it was so hard for them to get anything         They had to grow everything they ate and they had nothing         And of course her parents werent one of these that had money in the bank that they actually lost anything anyway         But of course when all the surrounding the stores or whatever everybody had lost money and so the whole economy was totally poor whether they actually lost money or not                     Thats uh my grandfather talks about that or used to talk about that                     Yeah                     They had nothing and of course he looks like           All right         Um who is the best storyteller in your family                     The best storyteller in my family         I would have to say it would have been my Aunt Lizzy shes deceased now but                     Do you know why                     She I can remember as a child that in the it was like she was ageless         And it was like she was old but she was ageless         As a child she never changed         And she would like dance a little jig you know while she was telling stories         She was oh         She was my favorite         Thats who Saras named after                     Oh OK         What kind of stories um did she tell                     Just a lot of times I think she would make up some of them you know                                                               Or just really embellish you know         She would definitely add on                                                               But uh and and there again most of hers had morals too         Like she would say Now what did we learn from that Debbie you know         And I would say Uh         And she would say Now that told you that          and she would go on         But she would if she was talking about rabbits she would jump around and shes up there and shes put socks on some kind of wires and made little rabbit ears out of them and you know                     Yes                     Just things that my mother would never have done                              Thats funny                     Aunt Lizzy would always do it so                              So what kind of reaction would she get from you or other people that heard her                              Belly laughs                  Roll on the floor laughing                     Did they ever request for her to retell something                     Oh yeah         Yeah         If we had a family reunion or something a lot of us would get her to retell a story                     Is there a particular story that you remember her telling                     There was one about a rabbit and this I cant remember all of it and in fact we were talking about it at a family reunion not too awfully long ago and a lot of them were adding bits and pieces to it         Because I can just remember her getting up and jumping around and have you heard uh its like a version of the Little Bunny Foofoo                     Uh huh                     That type thing                              OK         What stories do you tell yourself to keep going through hard times         Funny sad whatever                     I guess its um maybe a daily thing just whatever depending on whatever your mood is         If its sad you can always you could always remember a story where you know somebody who has it a lot worse than you do         Or if its happy its a I dont know its just recalling memories         Yeah I really like them         I can be reading a book and be totally lost in it and think Wow         I thought I was having a bad day         Or you know or you could be reading a really good book and thinking I wish my life were that easy you know                     Yes         Absolutely so         Is there one that um youve read lately thats like that youre kind of lost in it                     Oh         The best books that Ive read recently were the uh Left Behind series                     Yeah         Timothy LaHaye and Jenkins                     Jenkins                  Yeah         Oh                     Ive only weve only started the kids version of that but um what what Ive had so far is good         Its absolutely a lesson for you know                     Oh absolutely                  Id like to read the kids version too just to                     Yeah we need to read it         OK well I mean can you sum up one of those books or something that meant something to you in the book                     Well all of them         You know of course its talking about being raptured and its just such a good follower of the Bible         I mean it it follows really closely and um you cant wait till the next one comes out         Uh I think one of my favorite parts is when the two prophets you know they had the two         You know Elijah and Moses are at the the Wailing Wall         You know if you havent read it I dont want to tell you about it yet but oh         I mean its its just its just wonderful                                                               You know its its just like when the Bible says it says that they will be there and nothing         I mean if somebody threatens them or tries to harm them at all theyre immediately consumed in uh in uh burst of fire                     Uhhuh                     Well you know and then of course the Antichrist is trying to         trying to say that well you know that they have machine guns hidden under their clothing and but theyre theyre absolutely wearing their tattered same tattered clothes that they would wear in the Bible         And it talks about them having the long scruffy beards and theyve been standing outside for days and days and days and months and um          you know without bathing and without doing anything                     Oh                     And uh          of course then like the Bible says theyre put to death again         But I mean its you know          God lets them all of a sudden one day they have no protection and and theyre killed         And then their bodies are put out in the streets and I mean everything is just as an example                     Right                     But then you know they come back to life again and God takes them up to heaven                     Yeah                       Yeah                     Is there a particular story you like from the Bible                     Hmmm          I like a lot of them from the Bible         Umm I think one of my favorite ones would have to be oh goodness         I guess one of my favorite ones would have to be uh the one about Meshach Shadrach and Abednego         I love that one                     Um could you tell us why                     Just the fourth man in the fire you know                              Its just cool to think that theres a fourth man in there                     Absolutely                     OK well is there a story that you could tell us like you know from your life now         Something that isnt doesnt have to be you know relevant                     Hmm                     I mean my favorite in the jalapeno story but I dont think well put that on tape         They both Laugh                              Yeah         Really                              For the whole world to know                     I dont want them to know about the jalapeno story         OK          a favorite story         Hmmm         Im trying to think                  Oh Ive got plenty of stories         You know its just a matter of thinking about one of them                  Uh         I cant think of one                                 Itd be easier if we were all sitting around                     Oh absolutely         If somebody if somebody brings up a topic its like well I can do better than that         You know         Let me tell you this                                                               Umm well I could tell you that you know my husband is always saying that he thinks Im a witch because I can say something and then it happens         Youve probably heard that story before         Uh we hadnt been married long and and we were driving down the road one day         I saw a box in the middle of the road you know and I looked over at him and you know men always automatically you can just see them lining up like theyre going to hit that you know                     Yep                              Like its a point system or something         I mean like theyll get some points for it                                                               And I said Dont hit the box         And he said Why         I said Well if it gets if it doesnt come out from under the car and it gets under the exhaust pipe and catch on fire         And hes like Well that is the dumbest thing Ive ever heard in my life         OK and I didnt say another word and about two miles down the road of course you know it was fwapp fwapp fwapp you know                     Yeah                     About two miles down the road he pulled over and I said What are you doing         He said Ive got to get out and get that stupid box         Its on fire         And it was                                                               Um just little things like that         So to this day hell about three weeks ago he called me and he said Youll never guess what happened to me now         And I said What         He said Is driving down the road         And he said I saw this bag in the road         It wasnt even a box and he said I thought Thats weird          And he said I couldnt it was like interstate and I couldnt could not move over either way         I knew I was going to run over it         And he said I thought Now just wait and see if it does anything          And he said he looked in his mirror and it didnt clear         And so he said just a few minutes later he could smell something         He pulled over and it was hung on his exhaust pipe                                       Then         Just just little things like that through the years         He um we were in CA and we had been in San Francisco for about three days and this is my first trip to CA         And I was just fascinated with the big city San Francisco life so many cars and and the day that we were going the shuttle bus was taking us back to um the airport LAX         We were going to LA Well we got on the shuttle bus and it just dawned on me you know         And I said and I told him You know Ive been here three days and as many police cars as Ive seen I said you know Ive not seen a single accident         And he was like Oh dont say that dont say that         Youll jinx us         I was like you know         So we get to the airport         We fly to LA We rent a car and he decides he wants to take me to Hollywood drive down Rodeo Dr in Beverly Hills because hes been there before         So Im like OK you know Im all for it         We get in the car         Were headed down San Diego Freeway         Stop         Bap                  And we get hit                                                               And hes like you know without saying Oh goodness you know Are you all right         His head whips around and he says Hows that         Is that a good enough accident for you                                                               And of course it was all my fault because I could have said something about it earlier         Of course I was in the the um the earthquake the last earthquake from CA                     Oh really                     Uhhuh                     I didnt know that                     Oh you didnt                     No         I didnt know anything about that                     Im trying to remember what year that was         Was Sarah two         Was either          Ridgecrest         Not Ridgecrest         Ridge I cant remember the name of that         We were in Long Beach when it happened         Northridge         Northridge         Yeah um and there again Im such a sound sleeper that it was  in the morning and Tony woke me up         He was saying Debbie Debbie         Wake up         Wake up you know Its an earthquake         Im like You would say anything to wake me up you know                                          And then I I realized that hes on his knees and the whole building is shaking         And I didnt know it at the time but we were on the fifteenth story of a sixteenfloor building         And I did not know it at the time but the hotel was built on sixfoot rollers         I mean its built to sway and give                     Yeah but still                     Yeah but I mean the the then thats another reason I know now that everything is bolted to the walls                                                               Everything you know         Because youd hear furniture crashing but I can remember we went straight over to the window and we still had power but we went straight to the window and it was just I honestly I think thought we were going to die         All right you could see transformers popping everywhere         Just looking thats all you could see were lights         It looked like big flashes of light everywhere         And uh we immediately got on our knees and started praying buddy because I knew we were goners                     Yeah I would                     Absolutely         So                     I didnt know you all were in that                     Oh yeah yeah         It didnt really it didnt really hit me but later on that day we were flying to San Francisco                     Uhhuh                     And it didnt really hit me until we got to the airport         Well our shuttle the hotel shuttle bus took us to the airport and on the way over there I can remember he stayed on on his little CB thing the entire time with the dispatcher         It was so foggy or smoggy probably fog that early in the morning         It was so foggy you couldnt see three feet in front of you no more that ten         And he was like Im heading down to Ventura Blvd or whatever         And shed say well Dont go past such and such because the the bridge is out         There were reports and and after I got home         Id see film clips on TV where like a policeman got killed         He was going across the bridge and you know it was so foggy he didnt know the bridge was out and it was just there you know and the entire surrounding area around us was like that         There were bridges out just and not necessarily just a bridge         Just all of a sudden there would be a sinkhole in the middle of the highway and cars were just going down into it you know that didnt know that it was there         So if it hadnt been for that guy and that radio we would never have made it to the airport         But when we got to the airport we were the first flight that they let leave that day and we were sitting in the US Air club lounge                     Uhhuh                     Theres other people coming in and they were waiting on flights and you know         We were all sitting there         Everybody was reliving their experiences and some talked about what happened to them         And they were talking about armoires that were falling across their bed that werent you know bolted                     Bolted                     bolted down and all of the sudden I noticed that everybody we were just all sitting there just like like this right here like we were old people in a room full of rocking chairs you know                     Ooh                     And then I realized         I mean that was that was just aftershocks and tremors from the you know         And I thought What magnitude of power it would take to move the LAX airport         Here we were all sitting there you know         And for days we felt we felt aftershocks and tremors         Its like a really bad case of vertigo you know                     Yeah                     And you just just sitting there and you just get lightheaded and you just think Oh its my equilibrium thats all messed up         It was definitely an earthquake                     Were the girls with you                     No         No they were here with my mother         In fact I had called my mother and its its lucky I called her as soon as I did because later on the phones were down for hours         But I called her and I said Now mother I just wanted to let you know that were all right and she was like OK                                                               Thats good         And I thought you know Were three hours behind them out there you know         She had no idea         And I was We just had an earthquake         I want you to know Im fine         And shes like Oh my God                     Measured ten on the Richter Scale         Its all right                              Absolutely         Its a good thing that I called her when I did because later on when if she had heard about it on the news then she would have been terribly upset         So                     Yeah bet so         Im sure                     But yeah                     You remember um Hurricane Hugo                     Oh yeah                     Youd never forget it         Were you guys here                     Yes wed been here since July that year                      Welcome present                     I was at work when it happened         It tore my van all to pieces                     Oh really                     Yeah                     We had to stay in a hotel a ratty hotel at that because there was no power no         The only place that was open in Hickory was uh Dominos Pizza         That was really scary                     We only had power off for like three days here                     Right                     There were a lot of Duke Power people who lived down here so I think that kind of helped us a little bit but oh my worse I kept putting off the laundry kept putting off the laundry and I said I cant take it anymore         Drove it to the laundromat and that day our power came back on                  You know and and coffee         I couldnt get any coffee         I was dying for coffee         Thats all I wanted was coffee                                                               But yeah when Hugo hit I was at work that day and I worked third shift at CocaCola         And there was only me and one other girl were the only two people in the whole building         Of course we were in the computer room                     Uhhuh                     And we had the generator         The rest of the building was totally out         She was  months pregnant         Had to go to the restroom every ten minutes         Finally I said Look you know we got to scrounge up the flashlight because you know there were no lights in the bathroom no anything         And and you know we had a pretty good walk too         So I told her I said Look we have the little area where we have all the supplies that little computer room                     Uhhuh                     I said Well go up there         You can use the bathroom right there instead of going you know         And so thats what we did         And she said What if somebody drives by         Im like Well you know who do you expect to drive by in the hurricane                              In the storm                              Thats right         And I thought No security patrols going to be out here         But uh you know my and and when I got out there to where the little dock was at for the paper I could see my van         I parked right beside this great big tree and all that while I worried about my van but not enough to where I was going to go out there and move it         You know                     No                     And the whole time we were in there all you could hear was                  Thats all you can hear                     Uhhuh                     And so every little bit I would go and stick my head out the door and The vans OK         Well of course I worked twelve hour shift three days a week or three nights a week and that I guess about seven oclock was when the the when the next people were supposed to come in         It was about  and here come Richard         And thats Ill never forget it         He came and then he said Shh what happened to your van                                                               Im like Nice try Richard but my van is fine         Ive been going over there all night long                     Been checking                     He said No man its just awful         Im like Right         Well I went out there and I looked and was like                  You know                                                               The president of the companys room or uh office up on the top floor was on the end and I dont know if you know where the CocaCola building is in Charlotte but its kind of I dont know like an oval and arc type shape                     Uhhuh                     Well his office was like right here in the middle like right here on the end and the windows were blown out         All these metal aluminum blinds were wrapped around the wheels of my van                     Oh my God                              A piece of sheet rock I dont know how large this sheet rock was but it had blown around the curve of the building like his office is here and mine was back here         It had blown around slapped the the drivers window or my side         For years every time Id put my window down and come back up you would see little slivers little pieces of sheet rock on the side of my window         I mean it was awful         And I had pieces of it the drivers side door was all dented in         And and little later on I didnt know it until later on that uh I guess probably within a year after the hurricane hit then you could start seeing little spots all over the side of the van                     Yeah                     That was glass         You know where it had just made little things that would                     How weird                     that didnt show up immediately                     Oh my gosh                     Yeah         Oh yeah it was like  worth of damage to my van because of Hurricane Hugo         And then when uh I ended up staying at Coke like sixteen hours that day because you know the roads were shut down and nobody was coming in         Finally I got to come down Tyvola the new Tyvola above the Coliseum was pretty new at that time         And I I drove home that way and wed only been here a couple of months         I got all the way out here to the Eagle Rd at that mill                     Uhhuh                     And there was a huge tree across the street         I couldnt make it any farther         And I didnt know any back roads         I didnt know how to go around and try and find         So I just pulled the van over and at the plant parking lot and I got out and started walking and I was just I can remember live wires being everywhere crackling and popping         And the first thing I saw when I got home was my neighbor over here two houses over         He was outside he was it was really funny         He was out and here I come walking up and looking like something the cat drug in                                                               And hes like Debbie Have you seen my shutters         Every shutter on his house had blown away                                                               He was like All of a sudden we were in KS         And this was Dorothy                                       It was like No Jerry I havent                                                               But it was it was really scary the just the scary I mean I I its weird its like I during the hurricane I really felt safe in that building but driving home and all the trees that were down         It was like I was the only person on the road         And when I finally got here its like you know just seeing everything and the house         One of the first things I noticed was when I come up from the top of the hill was my house it looked like it had ivy growing all over it                     Oh really                     Leaves from trees everywhere were up against the house                     Uh         Stuck on the                     Yeah I mean it was just like moss or something grown on everybodys houses overnight                  And all of these houses around here were new         And this house right here was just being built and parts of the roof had blown off if it                     Im surprised it didnt damage this over here                     I know         We were really really lucky                     Yeah         You all didnt have a lot of big trees so thats good                     No         Uhhuh         No                     We had had um even our little peach tree made it through everything         Everything that ever we had a creek in the back of the house and whenever it stormed small storm or big storm it just floods come straight up                     Get under the bed         Mike going to say Get under the bed                              Right         You know I dont know why she did that         I think because we were all pretty fascinated with um storms outside of the window         We have sliding glass doors in our living room                     Right                     And wed sit there and just watch         But now I wasnt stupid or nothing when the lights were going shz shz you know but shes Get under the bed         in her bedroom         Shes got one of those tall fourposter beds like that w as going to save us but we had to get under there a lot when I was growing up bad storms                     Yeah                     But no Hugo we had to go to Howard Johnsons or something         No the Hickory Motor Inn                  To take a shower                              Ill tell you what         I would have gone just to get a cup of coffee                                       Thats about three more days of not taking a shower                              Oh I know                                                               Absolutely                     Thats funny         Um         Im trying to think um some stories that you told me that you know can be aired                              Without offending any members of the family                              Thats right                     Which is the most important thing here         Im trying to think because youre always telling stories and I just cant my mind is gone like your mind is gone on a Saturday                  Did Ida ever tell you any stories         Or was she not more         My aunts read to me in my family         Not my Mom a whole lot                     Well same here         I mean its she would tell me stories about my early childhood         Things you know stories about my daddy because my daddy died um before I was three         So I didnt hardly                     You dont remember anything do you                     And she would tell me a lot of stories about him and you know                     The kind of person that he was                     Right         Just real stories you know things that                  Like the first TV set you know when we used to have well water and the water had to be you know got out every afternoon         Just you know                     Yeah         The hard stuff                     that type of thing                     What was your daddy like                     Well                     That she told you                     From stories that from her and from uh other family members I mean everybody they would always say that that he would always be the first person to help you         My mother always said that that he would help a stranger you know get a car out of a ditch or whatever                     Uhhuh                     And and it would take her three years to get him to do something for her around the house                                                               You know and like she say OK Mac you know You need to weve got a hole in the roof and she would use that as an example         And Ill get to it         Ill get it fixed         And then you know get up at three oclock in the morning because somebodys called because somebodys in a ditch or something         You know         That type of thing                     Uhhuh         Uhhuh                     And then basically everybodys always told me that he was a really big practical joker                     Uhhuh                     But uh actually kind of a mean practical joker                     You got some of that then                                       Yeah         Absolutely                     And you help people                     Yeah         And I would never do anything to hurt anybody or destroy property you know                                                               But um I mean I wouldnt take a practical joke that far but theres nothing funnier than a real good practical joke                     Yeah         Do you have any         That you can share                              Like my daddy he had five sisters and one of them was his favorite         I mean they all say you know that she was his favorite and she was telling about when         it was so hard for her to get to go on a date because everybody was a friend of my daddy         Forget his daddy         They were afraid of my daddy         And one of them said that one day he walked out to the car and they got where they wouldnt come to the house and she had to walk down this long driveway to pick her up         And she said my daddy come over there and she said He was so nice to my date         And her date stayed in the car         And said she said my daddy was leaning in over the passenger side like where she was sitting                     Uhhuh                     And she said He just kept talking to us and just telling us what a good movie was playing and all this type thing         And he was so nice         She said they didnt realize it until later on that evening that even while he stood there talking to him he had painted all up and down the side of this guys car                              Oh my goodness                     That type thing you know         Thats                                                               Thats what I said I dont destroy property you know                                                               And then the sister she just built a house and you know back then I mean uh she had uh she was probably one of the first ones in the family that own a brick home you know                     Uhhuh                     And her and her husband had built a new house and my daddy did a lot of the carpentry work         And the house once it was built and they got moved in she told everybody that as soon as they got in the house to take their shoes off well from what I gather it really made my daddy mad because he had helped build it and you know         So he went and got one of uncles goats and took the goat back down there with him into the house                              You know just things like that         I mean                                                               Im not malicious so                                       My daddy well he didnt want Sherry and Billy riding in his car and he made them duck down in front of Billings Store and when they got there hed push them out of the car         They both laugh                     Because he was so embarrassed         But one time he ran over they went to   down in Hickory         I dont know if you know where that is but sort of near Longview actually         But they went to this snack bar one time thats the kind of place where everybody pulled in and they had the speakers                     Right                     And uh he ordered something and then he got out and he was cruising around acting cool and everything         But he almost killed this guy                  He turned around the curve and this guy was holding the thing like this                              He was holding the drink he was holding was going shzzzz         Sitting there holding                                       See I love stuff like that         I love stuff like that         I mean thats absolutely                     Of course he wont tell us anything because he wont tell us much of anything about his past because he had a Mohawk and he just                                 Yeah                     Hes real quiet about the things he had done                     Right                     I think we dont want to know what he did                     Thats like you tell your stories to your children and its like Who did you date when you were growing up         I dated really nice guys         You know very cleancut         Oh my God         If theyd seen some of the guys I used to date                  Oh really         They were all scholars                     Thats true                     Oh         Absolutely                       I went with him but I mean you know         But you and Tony arent very opposite         I mean not really                     No not I mean oh I dont know         Theres a lot of things we are opposites in but it all evens out                              Compliments                     Yeah all compliments each other         Like he hates to read you know                     Mark does too                     And I love to read                     Everybody has their own                     Absolutely         And Im afraid that all of them are going to be like him in the area         I mean at least its not nobody likes to read like I do                     Right                     You know                     Right         Does Sarah like to read like you do                     Who                     Sarah and Andy         Do they theyre are they kind of like Don                     Theyve slowed down         Theyre were doing really good but                     Doing OK in school                     Absolutely         I think a lot of it is that AR         Yeah         Im all for AR but at the same time like right now I had this little thing that kind of upsets me         Like right now Sarah has to have two points a week                     On the AR                     Its hard for her to read at one its hard for her to read two onepoint books                     Uhhuh         Every day its                     Exactly because it has to be done before Friday                     Uhhuh                     And if she reads a onepoint book and takes a test on it she misses a question she gets pointnine         The reading another one point book shes going to get say she gets a  on it shes still only got onepointnine and she had to have two points         So every week it seems like I have to go to the library and get these little pointfive books as I call them fillers just to fill in                     Uhhuh                     And and and I think to me Im afraid that Im taking away the joy of reading                     Exactly                     If I said Youve got to read this now         You know                     Exactly         Uhhuh                     Now Amanda she gets to read selfselected books and Sarah starting to read selfselected books         But um I think its important because not all kids are athletes not all kids like athletic books                     Uhhuh                     I probably never read a sports book in my life                     I dont think I ever have                     As much as I like to read sports just isnt one of the things that held any interest for me whatsoever         I always liked books about true stories whether it was it could be murders you know those always grabbed my attention I guess because I knew it really happened                     Right                     Thats just like historical places         Ive been to the Alamo         Ive been to Alcatraz like four times         Its like one of my favorite places in the world         Id give anything if I could stay over there                     Sean Connery on The Rock                     Actually I was there before Sean Connery                     Really                     Yeah                     Its crying shame                     The whole thing you know         I could not get enough information about Alcatraz         We got to meet one of the former inmates over there and one of the former guards         Yeah Ive got a bunch of pictures with him with a man         Actually I bought one of his books          but um I mean its just fascinating to me you know         To be on the rock and just         And the guard was the inmate was talking about he said you know he said They think that its not were not being punished enough         Like when we got to go outside to the exercise yard         He said But if you dont think that its not punishment         He said I promise you that I could stand outside in this yard and look across the harbor where you can see the whole bay area and he said If it was quiet enough you could swear you could hear champagne glasses clinking together         Your I guess your imagination you know what all going on there you know                     Uhhuh                     But I oh         I just absolutely loved it         I mean I wouldnt want to be incarcerated or anything                                                               I would love I would love to be able to stand right over there you know         Just just to see oh         This is wonderful                     Uhhuh                     I would have liked to have been there when men were over there you know         Machinegun Kelly and         Oh         I would have loved it         Love it                     When did they close that place                     Nineteen I forget         Nineteen sixty something         Yeah um                     I mean a whole is it an island                     Absolutely                     And the whole things a prison                     Yeah         Absolutely         Well they had wardens houses all the officers all the guards they all lived there                     Oh really                     Yeah         But theres no fresh water         I mean every day they had to ferry a boat back and forth and bring fresh water         You know theres because its just right there in the middle you know         Theres no fresh water and no way of getting fresh water over there other than by boat                     Uhhuh                     And so um of course everything thats over there you know how salt water damages you know                     Uhhuh                     So everything thats over there is such just such a hard place to upkeep         And it was so cold and each prisoner was assigned a little light almost like a cardigan type sweater                     Yeah                     and a blanket         And thats what they had year round         Of course its not supposed to be like you know Holiday Inn or anything                     Yeah         I know                     There are a lot of bad things about it its location                     Thats wild         How far is it off the                     Its like right         Heres the Golden you can stand right there and like pier you get under the Fishermans Wharf and the piers right there in San Francisco you can see Golden Gate Bridge Alcatraz theres Oakland Bridge                     Uhhuh                     and its just all right there together                     Cool                     If I had the its probably a  minute ferry ride         But I mean thats just a little ferry         If I was on a motorboat it would probably not take me five minutes to get over there                     Uhhuh                     You know I mean its you can see it its just right there         Its beautiful and thats why its called The Rock it literally looks like a big rock just popped out of the ocean and just you know water all the way around it                     I mean Id like to go sometime but its not on my Great ToDo list or anything                     Its wonderful         Absolutely wonderful                     I mean Id like to go to CA and see the redwoods         Thats really what I want to see                     Yeah                     Have you been to see the redwoods                     Uhhuh         We went to Big Bear Lake and we stayed at a friends house in um Alberta         Its a little town Albert         It was a little bitty town but its ski country and um theyd just finished filming a movie         And we were right beside the city called Columbia         Where um Back to the Future II had been filmed                     Uhhuh                     We went panning for gold and went horseback riding down there and um um but when we went to see the trees the trees there was one tree         I have pictures of this too         You just have to see it to believe it         I put the kids on it just so you could get an idea of about how large it was         But this tree its been years probably about six years or five years so I dont remember the exact width or anything but this tree was so large and it was the first one that they had spotted so they cut it down and there was         OK this is how big it was this tree that when the trunk part they holed it all out and made a bowling alley out if         I think like a fourlane bowling alley                     Ooh                     A fourlane bowling alley out of this tree                     God                     And right behind it the stump or whatever was leveled off and they made a bar room with a dance floor out of this tree         I mean it was so huge         It was unreal         Things like that I mean that stuff fascinates me         They had the trees where you could literally drive through the tree         The tree was kind of like sculpted out and big enough for you to drive through                     How neat                     I I have pictures like started taking a picture and I make Tony and the girls stand like this with their arms you know and still have tree on both sides of them on either side of them         Just amazing         These huge trees         And that doesnt begin to tell you how tall they were         I just couldnt get over it         Its just huge         I mean its just huge                     Thats cool         Was that your favorite vacation spot         CA                     My favorite vacation spot         That would be San Francisco                     Oh really                     Its just I mean I wouldnt want to live there         Oh God         Just the bustle and the well everyday Tony would be working normally when we were there         Ive taken the girls once         The rest of the time it would be like everywhere         I just couldnt wait for him to get up and go to work wherever he had to go that day         I was hitting the Wharf you know I mean just everything from the sights the sounds the smells the everything         I just loved it all         The cable cars everything         I would stop on the Wharf and get some um prawns for lunch or something you know                     Thats kind of cool                     It was just wonderful         I wouldnt want to live there         But it was just absolutely wonderful         Every time he goes back he has to go to San Francisco I always try to go         If we have enough points to go Ill go                     Ill have to go         Is the temperature really hot or cool                     Its pretty well cool         But most of the time when Ive been there its been around January and its not it doesnt seem like its as cold as it is here but its always foggy and Januarys pretty rainy too         But its never so bad that it keeps me from doing anything you know         I mean I can still walk all over the city and I never remember having to walk with an umbrella         So but pretty often the day is kind of cloudy and just                     And you can shop a lot                     Yeah         Yeah and theres you know in CA its unlike it is here theyve got bread stores         You know you go buy a loaf of bread its like a loaf of bread stuck in one of the old paper popcorn holders you know                     Yeah                     I mean its not cellophane with a twisttie There you go         You know         Its like a loaf of bread that you can chew on while youre walking down the street                     Yeah                     So and and the things that that are everywhere over there         You can literally just walk down the street you can get you a bowl of clam chowder in the scooped out bread you know                     Oh yeah                     And I mean just just things that you dont get here you know                     We have a hot dog shop where they actually do that put soup in the bread but its expensive                     Oh yeah         Absolutely         I think that uh where were we         Oh         Disney World         They have it there too         I was trying to think the only other place Ive seen it was Carowinds but no it was Disney World         But yeah I mean just everything about it was so complex         And then you had the people all over the street not just begging for money         Its not like theyre just standing there asking for handouts like they do here                     Uhhuh         Uhhuh                     These people are doing something for the money         And they take turns         Where the I think its Market and Powel Streets         Market Hyde or Powel         Those three streets all intersect somewhere where the cable cars are running         And where they all come down and turn around its like these people all have scheduled show times you know         Like at one oclock you have this Black guy down there theyre playing a fiddle and hell play for  minutes its time for the next cable car to come in and turn around and everybodys just gathered around there         He passes his little hat around or his fiddle case or whatever and everybody throws money in it         Well then next time its a juggler and the next time its a mime and the next time its three guys who play guitars                     Umhum                     But its always something going on         And you know its just the culture and Im always thinking you know its not at least theyre not expecting they are providing you some type of entertainment theyre doing something you know                     Uhhuh                     And uh thats the type thing that you really                     Thats neat                     Yeah just its just really nice to see all those things going on         I can remember this guy standing there and he had this little dog         I dont know what kind of dog it was but it couldnt have been more than a foot tall standing on his little hind legs and he also had a little hat and sunglasses and you could have your picture made with him for a dollar                              Just things like that         Things that you do not see every day         Its almost like going to Carowinds or someplace and seeing all these little special little things you know         But theyre all over the place         All you have to do is open your eyes and youre there         You have vendors that you know are selling homemade jewelry and theres still a lot of the old hippies and youd see a lot of the old hippies too         Theres a lot of the areas like that in CA         Thats my favorite         CA would have to be my favorite vacation spot                     Sounds like the place to go                              You got to go                     I want to go to CO for the Grand Canyon and all that                     Yeah                     See all that                     Yeah         Id like to do that too         I havent done that yet         Theres a lot in fact telling about San Francisco is my favorite spot thats my problem see         I get to travel so infrequently that when I do get to go Im always thinking Well maybe Id love to go do this and this and this         And I think Well what if I go and I dont have as much fun as I would if I had gone to you know                     Uhhuh                     So I know if I go here Ill have fun if I go here         So Ill go back there you know                     Thats what I tell Mark         I want to go back to Chicago         I wouldnt live there                     Right                     But it is so awesome                     Thats another place Id like to go                     I mean it is so busy but if you want to be alone you can be alone         In one of the busiest cities in the world                     Absolutely                     And nobody cares         And then you could walk down Navy Pier and it must be a little bit like San Francisco only they dont have well they do have people down there making money but theyre mostly drawing people and stuff like that         It is beyond cool         And nobody but you know people say theyre indifferent or whatever but not really its just that its a whole different         lifestyle                     Exactly         Absolutely                     They dont I dont their driving is         my driving I dont know but         I was getting screamed at and everything else but its just a different place         Now I like Schaumburg its a suburb and theres not you know it would be like being here you know         Or like Gastonia with Franklin Blvd stuff like that         You had everything you needed         You didnt have to go into the city                     Right                     You could go into the city for something special you know that was just there but everyday living you could just stay in Schaumburg and never to leave                     Thats one thing I liked about San Francisco         When we stayed right there right in the heart of it I could walk anywhere I wanted to go         And we werent I could literally walk out of my hotel and then two blocks to Fishermans Wharf and all the piers Pier  is my favorite it had hundreds of shops on it and you know and and these seals and nobody knows why         And I mean hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of seals just started coming to this pier         And theyve got all the little boat slips well theyre just covered with seals all the time         And nobody knows why they just started coming up there you know         But its just wonderful         Theres theres so many things that you never get the chance to see anywhere else but you can see it all just walking around         And then of course you have Lombard St the crookedest street in the world         Ive walked down that street and its amazing you know                     Just like those movie spots                     Absolutely the crookedest street in the world yeah         And all those are right there within walking distance         Then you take a cable car and go to Chinatown                     Uhhuh                     And still thats not that far but after walking up and down those hills         You are ready for bed when you go to bed that night                                                               But it is absolutely wonderful         Theres shops theres um all kinds of like comedy clubs and stuff         Um its just a whole different world         I mean everything that you can imagine seeing all at once its just         And you can smell you have to love seafood you can smell seafood all over the city and hot breads and go get you a bowl of chapino and a big old thing of bread and just                     Whats chapino                     Its like a fishermans stew                     Uhhuh                     We make it here         In fact I bought I got the recipe from the little where we went to eat at Fishermans Wharf         At the Grotto                     Uhhuh                     Got the recipe for chapino         Its got like a tomatobased soup and then its got uh oysters its got um crab claws its got shrimp but nothings peeled         So you have to have these big bibs on         Its not something youd want to eat on a date you know                                                               Because it makes such a mess         But when we make it here at home but of course we peel everything                     Thank God                     When we make it at home we put like the whitefish in it and like uh uh tilapia         Um oysters and shrimp you know         I dont know if I put any crab in it         But its just wonderful         Wonderful                     I think my favorite um food story from here is         Tony putting         pork rinds on the chicken                              Oh God         Absolutely         Atkins Diet         Yeah         Just crush up those pork rinds and roll your chicken in it                     Its much more creative really                     Yep                     Thats when you get real desperate                              Tony again somebody was asking me from church the other day he recently went to the mens breakfast the one they have once a month on Saturday mornings         And um Tony came back and said that he said I had to fix gravy for them         And Im like Uh oh         He said What         I said I didnt know you knew how to cook         But theyve been asking me for a long time         And basically thats right they have         But I told them I said Tony is one of those people who could improvise         So I have learned after  years of marriage I have learned If you dont want to know dont ask                     Dont ask                     Because he wont lie to you         He will not lie to you         If he tells you something its the truth                                                               I promise you he will not lie to you         Like for instance one day there was a little gravy story         He had made gravy         As I sat down to eat it I thought We dont have any milk         And Tony likes powdered milk he grew up on that welfaretype milk                     Uhhuh                              Yuck                                                               But anyway with a clothespin on my nose I was sitting there thinking and it was white gravy it was not water gravy                                                               And I said Tony         How did you make gravy         No answer         So then I got to thinking We dont have any powdered milk         Yes we do         I said Tony look me straight in my eyes and tell me you did not put baby formula in this gravy         And he looked at me and said Hows it taste         I knew I was eating baby formula gravy                                       Eeeww                     So you know hey         If I hadnt have known I would have been fine but knowing its like Ooh                                                               I was glad I had quit nursing or he would have had breast milk in there                              Theres some things you dont want to know                              Absolutely         I mean its just like likeIve learned if you dont want to know dont ask him         Because he can he can come up with stuff you wouldnt ever think about you know                     Was it OK                     Yeah         I mean it tasted fine but it was just knowing that it was in there                                                               Eating Enfamil gravy you know                     Thats hilarious         Thats nasty too                     Absolute ly         Uhhuh         Whew                     Well Marks told me about some of his creative stuff but Marks pretty creative too                     Yeah                     Like the time he cooked he left the                     Red vinegar                     Oh please         Well Mark says stuff about it too and Im like   and Im No we cant

married life         Uhhuh that would be nice         Hes going to marinate it and cook it later you know         And it ended up and oh God         It had the worst           It was pretty         I said What did you put in this         Red vinegar         Red vinegar and it ruined it         It had oh God         It was awful         Im not going to do that again         On salmon steak I know

         Yeah         I dont want no oyster in it                              Amanda grew up eating oysters         One time she was sitting in the highchair shed say Thats no chicken         And then an oyster I bought her at the Fish Camp and shed shed bit into it and the centers are normally gray you know                     Yeah                     Shed bite it and OK just keep it         You know         Didnt faze her in the least                                                               Nates eating um real food now         He had um well actually we tried those Gerber ones that

time         He eats fruit at the daycare                     You better watch it         I told Tony I said you know Let me think about it         Once youve tried table food can you imagine sucking on one of them bottles you know                     I know         It wont bother me because he drinks too many bottles right now                     Well Jasmines down to about three bottles a day                     Really                     Yeah um when we kept her I gave her she had one about about well its always nap time like  in the morning around  one around  or  and then one at nighttime                     Well of course Nate has to have about six or seven or eight         And its getting old by about I bet we spend  if not more dollars a month on formula                     God                     Because he heyou know I am and hes a bottle freak         And I dont know but I cant afford that much longer and I figure well he seems                     Yeah well hes  months old                     Its almost time to to                     Well I from the day I mean from the day that mine turned a year old I started buying whole milk                     Uhhuh                     Absolutely         Because even and Tony said shes complaining the other day shes saying you know between Jasmine and Darnell she said I buy          they drink at least one gallon of milk a day         Its like normally theyll drink a whole gallon and start on the second every day soyoure looking at at least eight or nine gallons a week         So but even at that at three dollars a gallon you know                     Uhhuh                     What is that          a week         Something like that         If it was nine gallons                     I must spend about  a week usually                     So youre still saving some but                     Well Im ready for it but now hes decided hed eat the real food         And then last night my brother had this surgery and we went over there and Mark said Well I guess well take chicken because thats the fastest thing         So he went in KFC and got one of those buckets with the slaw and everything         And um I shredded up little pieces of chicken and mashed potatoes and goes through these phases where he never eats and you know he never eats                     Yeah                     But he ate that up and Mark said today He acts like hes a little constipated         And I said Well when you get in there try and get me some fruit because when Colleen started eating real slow when she got hooked in cheese that was it
