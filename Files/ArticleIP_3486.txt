                                 The Gamer             The USAir Arena sits on theedge of the Beltway old and dim not much more than a big gymnasium TheWashington Bullets play here often quite badly They havent made the playoffsin eight years They were supposed to be better this year but have found waysto enforce the tradition of mediocrity The arena is usually soldouttechnicallybut with plenty of empty seats the signature of a town fullof lawyers and big shots who arent sure they want to be sports fans            But on Friday Feb everything was different A strange and powerful gravitational force surroundedthat stale and unloved arena that night People swarmed the access roadoutside begging for tickets The mayor of Washington showed up and the coachof the Redskins and then to snarl traffic once and for all the president ofthe United States came rolling up in his motorcade            Clinton took his seat withlittle fanfare No one played Hail to the Chief The crowd applaudedpolitely The real action was over in the corner outside the locker room ofthe Chicago Bulls Fans were straining at the railings of the stands Eyes wereriveted on the locker rooms exit No one dared look away The great one wasabout to emerge When he finally appeared people did not clapthey shoutedscreamed as guards told them to back off            Michael Michael            MichaelJordan didnt look up His head was bowed as he jogged toward the courtEverywhere he goes people shout his name He has mastered the art of notnoticing them            Jordan is smoother than everyone elsehis movements hisskin the top of his shaved head He looks polished Next to Jordan the otherBulls are big slabs of meat with protruding limbs Luc Longley a human hamhock Dennis Rodman all knuckles and knees and elbows and tattoos and noserings and yellow hair For Rodman every nights a full moon            On theradio the other day sportswriter Frank Deford called Jordan our LindberghWas Lindbergh really that good What was his percentage from threepointrange This night at the USAir Arena the sportswriters kept looking at Jordanand saying Hes Babe Ruth Like Ruth Jordan so exceeds the norm as to be ananomaly Ruth didnt just hit more home runs than anyone else He hit a lotmore home runs than anyone else How did he do it OK he was strong he used abig heavy bat and he had an elegant uppercut swing But the formula forgreatestever is always mysterious You cant reduce it to any obviousvariables You just say a god walked among us            Jordan is  years old borderline geriatricand he still leads the league in scoring racking up nearly  points a gamewhile the nexthighest scorer averages only about  How does Jordan do itHes got that Babe Ruth stuff The god force We just have to watch andwonder            For the national anthemJordan rocked from one leg to the other still staring at the floor in front ofhim while nearby the president lustily sangor at least moved his mouthdramatically so that even fans across the arena could see him singing            Secondsafter tipoff Jordan launched a turnaround jumper his new signature shothitting nothing but net That proved to be the anomaly for the next threequarters of the game Jordan missed a shot and then he missed four more shotsand he threw the ball out of bounds and he got slapped with two fouls and bythe end of the first quarter he had stunk up the joint He had five measlypoints while his sidekick Scottie Pippen had scorched the Bullets for             The sportswriters had a potential story line Jordan mightnot be the high scorer on his team for the third consecutive game somethingthat hasnt happened in years Was Jordan slipping Were we seeing it tonightThe sportswriters were tapping on their laptops In a night game you have towrite as the game progresses It might be too soon to write the endofanerastory but one could hint at it start practicing the inevitable eulogy            Jordankept struggling At one point hed taken  shots and hit only four By theend of the third quarter hed cobbled together  sloppy points to Pippensauthoritative  The Bulls were winning by  points but the Bullets werehanging tough Jordan had been outplayed by their Calbert Cheaney a streakyplayer            Then the fourth quarter began The fourthquarter is Jordan Time            Jordan got free on a fastbreak He streaked down the right side of the court took a pass veered towardthe bucket and went airborne The tongue emerged When the tongue comes outfans stand up to watch Jordan flying wore a face of absolute manic rage Thedunk was apocalyptic It was the kind of dunk you wouldnt want a small childto see It was as though Jordan was funneling all his frustration into a singlethermonuclear jam The fans of both teams roared The Bullets called a timeoutknowing theyd have no chance if Jordan caught fire            A minute later Jordan hit apullup jumper Then he hit another            One of the young BulletsJaren Jackson tried to smother Jordan and prevent him from getting the ballJordan knew what to do Cheat a little With his left hand Jordan almostimperceptibly held Jacksonthis showed up on the television replayand thendashed past him toward the hoop taking a pass and launching himself for atwohanded dunk hanging on the rim an extra second to make sure everyone knewwho was in charge            The nexttime down the court Jordan hit a wideopen threepoint shot The Bullets keptassigning different players to cover him but Jordan seemed to be emitting somekind of paralysis beam Even Jordans teammates were rooted in place The gameplan was Pass it to Jordan            Jordan hit an impossible foot turnaround jumper            Jordan hit foul shots            Jordan hit anotherthreepointer            Jordan juked right shook hisman dashed right past foot Gheorghe Muresan and burgled the backboard foran easy layup            Jordan hit six shots in arow missed one then hit again at which point he was laughing He knew whateveryone else in the arena was thinking Jordan had done it again ImpossibleA yearold geezer The paralysis beam still works Statisticians insistthere is no such thing as a hot hand in basketball that accurate shotsdistribute themselves in random patterns that just the fact that a player hasmade several shots in a row does not increase the likelihood that he will makethe next one So we are to believe that Jordans feat this nighthis abilityto seize a game and absolutely dominate it in the fourth quarter wheneverything is on the lineis a fluke What the statisticians dont realize isthat some things in life arent logical and that the Jordan phenomenon is oneof them He scored  points in the fourth quarter  for the game making himthe high scorer The Bulls won             Theresno way Michael was going to let the Bulls lose in front of the presidentJohnny Red Kerr a Hall of Famer and former Bulls coach said outside thelocker room            There has been talk in recent days about humancloning and you repeatedly hear people mention the idea of cloning MichaelJordan The New York Times cited the idea of a Jordan clone in its leadeditorial Such talk robs Jordan of his due It subtly suggests that he is justa natural athlete who merely has to walk onto the court and let his DNA takeover The fact is Jordans greatest gift is in his head He dominates the gameat  even though he can no longer outquick and outjump and outdunk hisopponents When he came into the league he was strictly a slasher relying onspeed and a inch vertical leap He wasnt considered a topflight shooterNow he has this deadly turnaround jumper and routinely hits threepointersWhat do you call someone who changes his game his style his tactics andstill comes out on top A genius Come to think of it didnt Babe Ruth startout as a pitcher            Like thatpolitician sitting in the stands Jordan is compulsively competitive When youapply the lessons of their successes to your life you get caught shortbecause the rest of us dont want it that badly Jordan has to win ateverything at cards at tennis at golf he has lost hundreds of thousandsgambling at that game After the death of his father Jordan took up thedoomed mission of becoming a professional baseball player He had balls thesize of an elephant to fail in public in another sport my colleague TonyKornheiser said before the Bulls game Bob Greene reports that Jordanthegreatest basketball player of all timewas motivated by a sports fantasy thathed be batting for the White Sox in his first professional baseball game andwould hit a home run round the bases and never stopping running just headstraight from home plate to the tunnel leading out of the stadium disappearingin front of the awed crowd            As the USAir Arena emptied out the sportswriters gatheredoutside the Bulls locker room The president of the United States suddenlyappeared a short distance away heading toward his limo He saw the press andfor a moment seemed to be coming toward us Then he stopped and just staredOne could imagine that he felt a little hurt when he realized that we didntwant to talk to him No one even shouted a question He boarded the limo andleft            We went into the locker roomand soon Jordan emerged already dressed in a perfectly pressed olive suit histie knotted tight at the stiff collar of a white shirt Jordan always dressesthis way in public A professional            I totally hadnt found myrhythm the first three quarters Jordan said When I found it things startedto click            Sweatpopped out on his head in the closeup glare of television lights Reporterspressed him up against the little wire cage that passes for a locker Heobliged every question then stepped outside to sign a few autographs            His agent David Falk said his client wouldplay as long as he meets his own standards Hed decide year by year Hes afree agent after this season and if the Bulls want him back theyll have to paythe big money This year Falk got Jordan  million Next year Falk wouldntsay what it would take How would one ever calculate such a thing Some thingsare beyond money beyond numbers How much would you pay the amber fields thepurple mountains            Someone asked Jordan if hedstick around town the next day to watch his alma mater North Carolina playMaryland It was a huge game in college basketball            He shook his head            I got a job to do                           Jordan drives to the hoopin Game  of the
