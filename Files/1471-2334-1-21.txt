                    Background                Mycobacterium infections are frequent        opportunistic pathogens associated with the acquired        immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS Its relative virulence        and potential for persontoperson transmission        distinguishes         Mycobacterium tuberculosis  Persons        infected with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV are        particularly susceptible to tuberculosis either by the        reactivation of latent infection or by a primary infection        with rapid progression to active disease        The        annual incidence rate of tuberculosis in Colombia during         was  per  persons     but rates        fold higher have been reported in some        HIVseropositive populations                    In addition disseminated infections with         Mycobacterium avium complex are        increasingly common in advanced human immunodeficiency        virus HIV disease and cause substantial morbidity             Persons with HIV infection and CD lymphocyte counts        less than  cellsmm have a probability of  to         per year of developing         M avium complex disease or        bacteremia      Bacteremia involving         M avium complex produces a wide        array of clinical signs and symptoms including wasting        fever and night sweats and is associated with decreased        survival        The recovery of mycobacteria in        blood cultures can help to discover bacteremia that        frequently goes unrecognized We undertook a prospective        survey in three AIDS health care units in Bogota Colombia        in order to determine the prevalence of         Mycobacterium species in HIVinfected        patients and to evaluate the diagnostic value of different        types of body fluids to detect the presence of        mycobacteria                    Methods                  Patients and study design          This study was a multicentric prospective study of the          frequency of           Mycobacterium infections in persons          infected with HIV The study was conducted in three major          AIDS health care programs of Bogota Hospital          Universitario San Juan de Dios Hospital Regional Simon          Bolvar and Centro Atencin Bsica Chapinero del Seguro          Social From October  to March  a total of           HIVseropositive patients were recruited Most of the          participants met the definition of AIDS or were in          clinical stage C CDC  The institutional review          board at each site approved the study and each          participant gave written informed consent                          Specimen collection and culture media          For all patients blood urine stool and sputum          samples were collected In brief  to  mL of blood was          obtained in previously labeled Vacutainer tubes          containing  mL of heparin as anticoagulant All          patients attempts were made to collect two paired blood          cultures samples n    urine cultures n             stool cultures n   and  sputum samples n            In one patient a sample of ascitic fluid and in other          case cerebrospinal fluid CSF were obtained          Bacteriologic methods were used as previously described               Briefly blood samples were centrifuged  min          at  g and leukocytes recovered by standard methods          with FicollHypaque Pharmacia Fine Chemicals          Piscataway NJ and then mixed with a lysing solution          that contained  sodium deoxycholate After manual          mixing tubes were centrifuged at  g for  minutes          in a refrigerated centrifuge at  g and the          supernatant was discarded The pellet was resuspended          and  bovine albumin was added to yield a final volume          of  mL          One gr of stool samples was placed in  ml of albumin          Dubos media and mixed in Vortex for  min then          incubated at room temperature overnight Afterwards          equal volumes of a solution of  NaOH were mixed in          Vortex for  min and incubated at room temperature in          continuos mixing for  min Distilled water was added to          complete  ml and the mixture was centrifuged at  g          for  min One drop of phenol red was added to the          pellet and then neutralized with  drops of HCl  N The          pellet was resuspended in  ml of saline solution mixed          and finally  ml used for culture          Urine samples were mixed in a ratio of  with a          solution of  Na            PO            H            O The mixture was incubated at room          temperature for  h and then centrifuged at  g for           min The pellet was used for culture after being          decontaminated by OgawaKudoh method Briefly sterile          slabs were placed in a solution of  NaOH during  or           min and then used to culture samples          Sputum was mixed in equal volume with a solution of           Na            PO            H            O incubated at room temperature          during  h and centrifuged at  g for  min The          pellet was decontaminated by the OgawaKudoh method as          described above and used for culture The same procedure          was used for the ascitic fluid and CSF samples          All samples were placed in  tubes with a biphasic          medium a solid phase OgawaKudoh with iron citrate and a          liquid phase of Sauton Twen albumin modified medium and           tubes with StonebrinkGiraldo medium Readings were made          after day  and at      and  week A positive          culture was identified following the criteria of the          Centers for Prevention and Disease Control CDC              Resistance assay was applied at all           Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates          using the proportion method for streptomycin S          isoniazide H thioacetazone Tb ethambutol E and          rifampicin R          All samples were stained and examined for AFB after          centrifugation                          Statistical analysis          Statistical significance for comparison of rates was          determined by an exact test when sample sizes were          insufficient and by an asymptotic test when sizes were          sufficient All tests were twosided and a P value of           was considered significant Exact  confidence          intervals CI were calculated for rates by assuming the          numerator to be a Poisson variable    and for rate          ratios using a modified binomial model     Adjusted          rate ratios for comparisons among groups defined by          demographic variables were calculated by using a          MantelHaenszel type estimator for incidencerate data          with approximate  confidence limits based on the tests                                         Results                  Demographic characteristics          In total  patients were studied    were          men and   were women The menwomen ratio was           The age range was  to  years with a median of           years Table  Ten patients  were from Hospital          San Juan de Dios onehundred thirty nine patients           were from Hospital Simn Bolvar and one hundred thirty          seven patients  were from the Instituto de Seguro          Social Fiftyeight patients were hospitalized at the          time of enrollment  and two hundred twenty eight          patients  were enrolled at an outpatient clinic One          hundred ninety five patients  were in treatment          with antiretroviral medication Sexual preferences were          informed in   patients as follows in males          ninety  were homosexual eightysix  were          bisexual and sixtyone  were heterosexual Of the          women twentynine  were heterosexual and three           were bisexual CDC staging in these patients is          shown in Table  Viral load was obtained in  patients          and results varied in a range between less than  and           millions copiesmL The median of viral load was           copiesmL          The symptoms most frequently complaint of at the time          of initial enrollment were headaches  loss of          weight  and mental status changes  The          frequency of each symptom is showed in Figure            patients complaint of respiratory symptoms  patients          had a history of diagnosis of tuberculosis and  gave          a history of previous treatment with antituberculous          drugs                          Mycobacteriuminfection          Overall sixteen of  patients  were positive          for any           Mycobacterium species by acid fast          staining or culture of any of their samples In these          sixteen cases fifteen  were positive by culture          and one patient was detected only by acid fast bacilli          staining  Fourteen patients  were men and two           were women           M tuberculosis was identified in          four cases            M avium was isolated in thirteen          patients  Two patients presented simultaneous          infection by           M tuberculosis and           M avium           Tuberculosis was diagnosed in its pulmonary form in          two cases and in another two patients as extrapulmonary          In the patients with pulmonary tuberculosis the AFB          smear of the sputum was positive in one case and in          another case the AFB smear was positive in his stool          sample Culture of stool samples was positive in both          cases of pulmonary and in one case of extrapulmonary          tuberculosis           M tuberculosis was detected in          different samples of body fluids as well in sputum          urine stool samples and in ascitic fluid Table  All          isolates of           M tuberculosis were sensitive to          the drugs assayed streptomycin S isoniazide H          thioacetazone Th ethambutol E and rifampicin          R          The only species identified as nontuberculous          mycobacteria was           M avium which was detected in           patients  Two patients had coinfection by           M tuberculosis and           M avium in their sputum culture          One patient was positive only for acid fast bacilli          staining in two stool samples but no growth was observed          in culture tubes after  weeks of incubation          Interestingly in three patients the direct AFB staining          in blood was positive and           M avium was later identified in          these blood cultures Table            M avium was also detected in other          clinical samples urine stool and sputum Table           The percent of positive AFB smears and cultures was          greater in samples of sputum followed by the samples of          stool Table  Samples of urine and stool were valuable          to identify most of patients with a           M avium infection only three          patients infected by           M avium were identified solely by          blood cultures Table and                           Association between Mycobacterium aviuminfection          and clinical data          The following factors Table  were significantly          associated with a culture positive for           M avium infections death

Table  However there          were no patients with           M avium infections in clinical          stage A or with a CD cell count higher than  cellsmm          Tables and                             Discussion        Our study was a prospective study in HIV infected        patients in whom an indiscriminate search         Mycobacterium infection was done        Clinical suspicion of tuberculosis existed previous to        enrollment only in the two patients with pulmonary         Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection        but not in the other two patients with extrapulmonary        tuberculosis        Most of         Mycobacterium species isolated were         M avium         The frequency that we found was lower than that of        previously reported studies for         Mycobacterium in HIV infected        patients in Colombia A previous study at the Hospital San        Juan de Dios in  performed in  HIV infected patients        found a prevalence of  for         M tuberculosis infection     In        another study in  patients in Cali Colombia the        prevalence was only      In the present study it was                The prevalence of nontuberculous         Mycobacterium species in Cali was             and in the current study it was  The lower        prevalence of         M tuberculosis  can be related to        the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy        HAART that was practically absent in the previous study        in Bogota in  but that was being used to treat  of        the patients in the current study Our results are also        different to the ones reported in a General Hospital AIDS        reference center in Rio de Janeiro Brazil    where        mycobacteria were recovered from   of  of        all patients and         M tuberculosis was identified in          and nontuberculous mycobacteria in          Our results suggest that when antiretroviral        therapy is introduced the relative frequency of         M tuberculosis infections is reduced        and the one of         M avium infections increases                   We found that         Mycobacterium avium infection was        related to symptomatic diarrhea and greater mortality as        has been reported previously     Our study shows that        frequency of isolation of         M avium was greater in urine and        stool samples This emphasizes the need to take multiple        body fluid samples in order to enhance the opportunity of        isolation increasing the microbiologic diagnostic        sensitivity Interestingly we found that blood AFB smears        can be useful to rapidly confirm a clinical diagnosis of        disseminated         Mycobacterium avium infection        In the present study there were no resistant strains of         M tuberculosis found In a previous        survey in Colombia it was found that         M tuberculosis isolates among new        cases in patients without HIV infection showed resistance        in   of                         Conclusions        Our study found that  of HIV infected patients in        Bogota were infected with         Mycobacteria and that         M Avium was the predominant species        It becomes evident the need to improve the preventive        measures and prompt treatment of this type of opportunistic        infection in the HIV infected individuals                    Competing interests        None declared
