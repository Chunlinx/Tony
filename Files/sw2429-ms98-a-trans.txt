        well what would you have at a dinner party   well uh lately since i have children ive cut down on having dinner parties but  when i do i try to keep it pretty simple on things that i can prepare ahead of time   uhhuh   uh i have one recipe for uh a really good um type of a meatball its called burgundy meatballs and its made with red red wine and um its its really good and you can make it ahead of time and then um make the sauce when youre ready to um to serve it thats one of my favorite things to to serve   oh gosh that sounds great uhhuh well um i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or informal dinner party but if it was informal my first choice would be crawfish   sure oh really well i guess being from that part of the country   because i mean crawfish everybody over here likes crawfish but you know i i wouldnt have to worry about satisfying my   uhhuh   guest but if it was a formal uh dinner party i would probably think of something else like um shrip shrimp fettucini is real easy   yeah   to um make and everything and its usually well liked by people i guess im just a seafood fan so i think on the lines   well how do you make how do you you cook crawfish i in fact i just came back from the grocery store and being in Texas we dont have too many you know people that that eat crawfish but they had live crawfish on sale   oh yeah um youre not supposed to i mean youre not supposed to eat them dead i mean well you eat them dead but  right because if if theyre dead for too long you can always tell whenever theyre cooked if theyve been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out and youre not supposed to eat those because theyre the bad for you   umhum dont buy them that way uhhuh okay well ill remember that   yeah so if you ever go in a restaurant and order crawfish i mean every once in a while youll see one i mean it doesnt happen very often because its just an accident but if the tail is straight on it then yeah dont eat it but um you just put some cajun well   uhhuh   lots of pepper and you just boil them and theyre absolutely wonderful but theres uh theyre a pain to peel for some people once you get used to it theyre real easy but um you know if you have nails or anything you can   uhhuh   plan on those being shot   when you were um when when you  serve it do you shell them and then serve them to   i think for a dinner party i i dont know it depends like if like   umhum   my age if there was a bunch of college kids coming over for a dinner party no i they would shell their own you know wed just have crawfish and beer or something but um if it was more formal like if i was you know working environment then i would probably um shell   sure   shell them or at least disconnect them from the head but theres a theres a big thing over here that everybody sucks the head so um   so they dont have see that ooh   it it would just depend thats the best part of the crawfish sucking the head but um       i dont know it just it it just depended on what type it was i guess but you can buy uh the crawfish tails already peeled and everything and usually you use those like for frying or to put in salads or to um   umhum   you know make a sauce with or something like that but you can go ahead and buy them cooked and shelled and theyre more expensive of course but   does it taste a lot like shrimp   um  yeah it really does i like shrimp better   uhhuh yeah   just um but crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own it also depends on whos cooking it and how much seasoning they use and stuff like that but um   sure   i think that and also to get totally off crawfish the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors doeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps   yeah we have a a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks   thats what i need   all the time and  yeah thats what i wish i had  but in our family im the one who who cooks and i i really enjoy it its gotten a little more difficult with kids but i really do enjoy cooking and we um we have them over for dinner back and forth quite a lot and before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where you know he would   uhhuh oh   cook and then the next time it would be my turn and id try to outdo him and then hed try to outdo me and  we we was really a lot of fun and     i bet that that got pretty competitive you know as far as who could come up with the best recipe   yeah it did and we we tried to be fancier or more courses than the other or uh it was a lot of fun you know it something unique you know and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be   that would be fun   ethnic food or um sometimes it would be um oh oh i dont know maybe an outdoor theme or uh uh elegant theme or you know  it was a lot of fun   uh huh sometimes it might be the candlelight and sometimes it might be the picnic out back or something  well thats you know thats fun   thats right it was fun and and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time uh just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying im   uh huh   that sounds right i would id take him up on that   it does except that knowing them they would probably do something ridiculous and terrible just just to uh         make sure that they didnt have to do it again  make hot dogs or some potato chips or   umhum maybe  i thats about how much i can cook you know im im doing a lot more cooking now       then i used to but thats only because my mom just started working so shes tired when she comes home in the afternoon so i try to have things cooked for her but   uhhuh oh thats nice   uh um i usually try to stay out of kitchen i dont know  not one of my favorite hobbies but     it can it can be fun i if you have the time but you know a lot of times its too its too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it   well um my grandma speaking of those meatballs again she um every Christmas and and Easter whenever we have at the big gettogether over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce and it has i dont know they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs and they are absolutely delicious i dont know what she calls them and i dont im sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol but       um i dont know i would i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around   yeah its um its in the other room i dont know if we have enough time for it its real easy one of the unique things in this  like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um   oh   um what ever seasoning usually just light seasonings like salt and pepper um and chopped up water chestnuts   yeah oh that would be wonderful   which is something different um makes them a little bit crunchy you need to chop them up real fine but um it makes them crunchy and that adds something new to it   yeah   and then the sauce is just made with um bouillon cubes water burgundy wine and um cornstarch instead of flour   umhum oh   so its not a its not a thick rich type of a sauce its more of a when you use corn starch in in gravy like you know when you have um Chinese food   umhum   the kind of a gravy or a sauce that comes with a lot of that they use corn starch instead of flour in all of their sauces and gravies and it gives it a bit of a different consistency   well um how long do you cook the meatballs   the meatballs you just um after you form them fry them in a pan until theyre   uh huh   uh browned on all all sides and then drain off all the grease uh then what i usually do is i freeze them and then when youre ready to serve them   oh yeah   then you cook the sauce and then put the meatballs into the sauce and heat it probably you have to heat it up for a good oh if theyre frozen you know it may take a half hour for them to thaw out but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself let them simmer in the sauce itself   hum that sounds great especially i mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so so far in advance i mean like if if you are having a dinner party on Wednesday night you could do it on a weekend that would be great   thats real good right and then freeze them sure   i going to have to keep that in mind for my future because i hope to have lots of dinner parties  because i like to i mean im     yeah   im sure that ill be involved in a big company and i know that my future husband will be you know hes going to be working for Chevron in Houston so hes going to be um   uhhuh   you know im sure that dinner parties will come in handy   yeah youll meet friends invite invite the boss over and and the friends at work   oh yeah i have to impress the boss  and clients because um im in im in public relations in school so im going to have you know my whole jobs going to be based on my clients and stuff like that so   uhhuh sure   im gonna have lots of dinner parties and have to take them out to eat and right now i am taking a class on etiquettcy and all the little bitty things that i didnt even know i mean i thought for sure id been raised properly but id been doing a lot of things wrong i didnt know about   oh really       but um  so is there anything else   well i i think weve weve covered the subject ive got some interesting information about crawfish i was in fact i was its good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for sale     oh yes you need to try them oh theyre wonderful   oh i will im sure my husband will be surprised because we were talking about them the other day even before
