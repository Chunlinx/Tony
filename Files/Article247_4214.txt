                                 The SECs Battle Against Selective Disclosure                        Sometimes a situation seems so obviously wrong that you cant believe itsallowed to continue Then someonelike say the Securities and ExchangeCommissioncomes along and says the situation wont be allowed to continueand a host of opponents spring up to say unbelievably Things are just finethe way they are To which the only reasonable response of course is to sayWho are these people            This is pretty much the story of the SECs battle against the selectivedisclosure of significant financial and business information by companies toinvestment bank analysts and large institutional investors who routinely getlooks inside companies and notifications of changes in future outlooks longbefore everyone else does SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has been publicly on theattack against selective disclosure for the past  months and yesterday theSEC issued a remarkably measured proposal Regulation FD that simply stated inessence that companies would not release any material information privatelyInstead of applauding the regulation Wall Street looks ready to fight it            From one perspective of course this is hardly surprising Investment banksand brokerage houses built their businesses around their access to informationand their ability to get that information to their clients before it reachedanyone else And while in theory that information could beand sometimesisthe product of especially dedicated digging or sharp analysis its oftenthe product of a phone call to a chief financial officer or comes from a vicepresident who lets slip that the fourth quarter is looking especially good Ifyou give up selective disclosure and create a truly free flow of informationbetween companies and all of their investors then the possibility of makingeasy profits either by getting in before everyone hears the good news orgetting out before everyone hears the bad disappears            Thats hardly an argument even Wall Street could use to defend itself Soinstead what you hear is the classic this will lead to a general chill oninformation argument which says that since companies dont want to put outpress releases all the time theyll stop talking to analysts at all for fearthat theyll be breaking the law And since markets function best when theresmore information the market will work less well if Regulation FD isratified            The truth is its not clear that there would be any damage done at all ifcompanies stopped having private conversations with analysts The privilegedposition of the analyst after all is a vestige of the days when just aboutall investors had accounts with the major brokerage houses In todays worldwith the profusion of online brokerages thats an unnecessary privilege Atthe same time if you look at analysts estimates for companies quarterlyearnings they tend to be quite similar which suggests that theyre the resultnot of aggressive independent research but rather of company guidance Ifthats the case then let the company give its guidance publicly in aconference call accessible to the public broadcast on the Internet andtranscribed on the companys Web site The same should be the case with anydisclosure of material information            Regulation FD will work though only if its followed up with a looseningof the rules on the kinds of public statements companies can make without fearof running afoul of either the SEC or minorityshareholder lawsuits Eventoday the SEC continues to limit the kinds of forwardlooking statementscompanies can make out of a desire to protect individual investorswhom itconsiders less serious and financially responsiblefrom potentially deceptivestatements And the ability of lawyers to sue every company executive who makesa prediction that doesnt come true obviously keeps executives from makingpredictions that would be of great use to investors Both of these phenomenaare legacies of Depressionera laws passed when Wall Street was purely aninsiders game and individual investors really were at a radical disadvantagein terms of separating truth from lies But protecting individual investorstoday has the ironic effect of perpetuating their informational disadvantageIf were going to have full disclosure then we have to accept the risks thatgo along with it So let companies speak and investors listen and decide fromthemselves and cut out the middle men
