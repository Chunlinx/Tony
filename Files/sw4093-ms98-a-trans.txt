            so uh does your company do any sort of drug testing   yeah they do do random drug testing i i work in the defense industry   uhhuh   and so theyre theyre theyre pretty concerned about something like that although in my mind i dont i dont like the idea of having a having like a hit squad come in   uhhuh   and suddenly like you know put my employment on the line over uh my lifestyle choices considered   uhhuh   i i dont think considering i dont think it affects my job and like nobody um nobodys life is at at risk i dont think they should really care what i do in my spare time   umhum so what are they worried about are they worried about i mean do you is this a secure environment youre in   i think im not im not really sure i think that theyre worried that you might uh if if if youre a drug addict you could probably compromise government secrets or something like that   uhhuh   but i i think its a pretty conservative approach to you know uh uh things i think its like a fifties approach to a to a an an eighties or nineties lifestyle       you know i i dont know i think drugs are pretty pervasive in our society   uh yeah and not to mention the legal ones which they dont even care about     and yeah well also i what i think is a a problem is that theres a theres a lot of things out there that will actually make let you test positive for drugs when youre youre not even   umhum uhhuh   like not even on drugs   right and youll be penalized i mean you could lose your job very easily   right i did you see that thing on uh  Minutes about the uh the Air Force pilot who um they there was a mistake at the lab   no   and oh it was on in  Minutes there was a mistake at the lab and he he tested he was a B fifty two bomber pilot   okay   and he he tested positive and he it ruined his career he   right   he uh he was drummed out of the Air Force and he spent i think something like seven years working you know before he was able to work his way back through the the courts to be uh you know i guess its called exonerated   i guess so right   but by then his career is was was ruined because   oh yes his life is over at that point   yeah hes he he was seven years and it was just like it it was a an accident   yeah ive read things that talk about the number of false or negatives   and   uhhuh   to the number of false positives and you know the number of people youre going to hurt while accomplishing you know whatever you think youre accomplishing is really quite high   yeah oh you know but i but i also uh you know you read things about uh like train car conductors   uhhuh   uh  which you think of the   you  like the ticket takers   well no im talking about like the guy no im im talking about the the engineers now that that is pretty scary though   engineer   it is the only thing is i my what i think is they theyre testing for you know especially illegal drugs is part of the real problem the real problem is you want to make sure this guy is on the ball   uhhuh   and i think that what they should be doing is performance testing not drug testing you know they should have some sort of video game or something that the guy has to play or you know something like that because if he you know maybe he didnt get any sleep the night before   uhhuh yeah   and uh just stayed up too late and for that reason is not on the ball or hes you know he hes unhappy about something or hes sick   yeah   or uh you know uh using some legal drug that they dont test for i mean i really dont want to be i dont want to die in a train wreck   right   and and its because i dont want to die that i want them to do a more meaningful test   yeah but then again uh you know i also if i was a conductor i i i wouldnt want i wouldnt want to have to like you know piss in a little paper cup whenever  you know   well i can see there be yeah i actually its some some mixed mixed feeling about feel i mean i feel like okay if youre going to do testing do a meaningful test like a performance test     umhum   uh the testing itself uh i could see where the testing if its not if it is a performance test i mean its directly related doing your job   uhhuh   uh it has nothing to do with your personal you know lifestyle uh   yeah   uh   by then i had just had a thought about like what about a what about a police officer you know      umhum   i mean that then you begin to to wonder if i understand they have like random        law enforcement officers have to go through through random random tests just to see i guess like what side of the law they are theyre on       you know and  and im beginning im im starting to think a little more a little more about this is that i guess should we really be talking about  what should we be should we have legalized drugs you know   well a lot of people say that that would       simplify a lot of things uh i tend to i tend to agree just because the attempts to make certain things illegal were such flops   yeah i i think that uh
