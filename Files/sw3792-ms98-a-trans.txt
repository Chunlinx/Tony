        well you have do you have any pets   yeah i do i have a like a seven and a half year old dog   umhum   and hes kind of a big Benji long hair and hes white and hes the baby of the house   uhhuh uhhuh   and tonight he has a friend visiting whos a pit bull so theyre kind of running around chewing on things   uhhuh hm uhhuh  yeah do you have any children  or   uh we have a child but hes like twenty so hes not like a chip you know like a little kid anymore   oh okay i see  yeah uhhuh so whether um why do you have a dog what uhhuh   and uh why well actually we bought him for my sons thirteenth birthday and hes just been with us ever since and uh   uhhuh   we spend more on him on his haircuts and medical attention than we do ourselves   uhhuh   and thats what pets are like   yeah   but hes like uh you got to have him when you come home and theres nobody here hes always here and   yeah  uhhuh   so its nice nice to have him there   umhum   what about you how come you dont have a pet     well mainly because its just uh at this point in life ive had to be available to travel and we live in an apartment right now so um theyre not even allowed here   umhum   but uh when i was growing up i always had cats and and then um later i guess uh the last few years that i was at home  my mother and father got a dog and i learned to really appreciate dogs as well theyre totally different types of pets but um       i see how dogs are really faithful friends and   yeah yeah we were talking earlier tonight one of the ladies thats visiting with us tonight her dog is her life   umhum   yeah  and she has she has a German Shepherd  tried to tell her to get a husband and for something  and let the dog go but shes not for that shes in control  shes in control with the Shepherd     uhhuh yeah okay yeah thats true  yeah my dad  i think uh finds that he really enjoys his dog he says hes the best friend he has but uh   but uh  yeah oh yeah uh its just   i dont know thats kind of sad though   i know our dog takes a nap everyday with my wife and he jumps right up in the bed and the whole bit   umhum uhhuh   its just  when we first got him  we didnt like dogs around the house or in the house and   yeah   but now we put up with about anything   umhum  yeah well ive seen that theres theres a lot of um you really have to appreciate their good qualities because there there are problems  yeah they leave a lot of hair around and   yeah yeah it it its if like now you have to vacuum three or four times a week and it just i we didnt used to have to do that but uh   umhum uhhuh yeah but obviously you find him worth it  or youd get rid of him   but uh yeah yeah could never get rid of him  yeah you get you get attached i think that like maybe the first year of his life we didnt get attached   yeah uhhuh   we were kind of timid about it and because wed wed all wed all had dogs as kids and lost them or something and  and  we do we were afraid to but he kind of rooted his way in   umhum yeah   and hey i know at times when hes had emergency problems were just a nervous wreck   uhhuh   so thats thats part of being a pet owner these days   yeah   and i dont know but cats i dont know you can have a cat in the apartment couldnt you   isnt it well not this one i its not allowed here but   oh   yeah the thing i like about cats is theyre more independent you can leave them and they can take better care of themselves than a dog it seems like you know depends   yeah um we never had much luck with cats we had some when we lived in New Mexico and coyotes ate them  so   oh wow yeah   we were kind of timid about having cats and again plus we we found out that when they were kittens we really liked them and as they got older they kind of ignored us   yeah umhum yeah theyll do that sometimes   so but with a dog they dont do that   so umhum   when i was a kid i i raised parakeets   oh really uhhuh   so those were i always thought those were good pets to have extremely messy  but   umhum yeah yeah oh i had goldfish but i didnt think much of those  they were they dont have any personality   yeah theyre theyre fun but i like to look at fish one of our favorite restaurants here in town   so umhum   has a humongous fish tank and i like to go there just uh the foods not that great but a fish tanks wonderful to look at them you know floating around   yeah yeah   matter fact we got two dogs fighting right now  yeah   do you  well maybe i better let you go and go solve the conflict there   yeah well theres enough people here actually the pit bull is from Dallas he lives up he lives up there but theyre down visiting and   uhhuh oh really uhhuh   so its kind of unusual to have two dogs in the house   uhhuh
