That hardly seems defensible            The only valid argumentis that you dont believe Clinton actually broke the law If you believe thathe broke the law then he must be held accountable Whether thats now or afterhis term is over I suppose could be up for discussion although its hard forme to believe that any rational person could believe that in the currentatmosphere Clinton will be able to

Laughing All theWay to Court                        As a sometimes evidence teacher I read BruceGottliebs item How Blind Must Justice Be with interest He states If bylaughing the audience intended to say we dont believe you it is hearsayand therefore inadmissible This is wrong both as a statement of the hearsayrule and as a prediction of the likely outcome in this case            First the rule A large amountprobably mostofhearsay is admissible Thats because the Federal Rules of Evidence whichapply at the Microsoft trial contain  exceptions to the hearsay rule someof them gaping For example Rule  the socalled catchall exceptionpermits hearsay to be admitted if it is the best available evidence of amaterial fact and the interests of justice will best be served by itsadmissiona big window            Now application of ruleto facts If the question posed ever came up I am sure the evidence would beadmitted under Rule  Thats because the danger that the outofcourtstatement is a lie the primary danger against which the hearsay rule protectsis negligible when it is the simultaneous statement of hundreds of people Thisis what my evidence professor Kenneth Graham referred to as SurreptitiousPrinciple No  A little bit of hearsay is bad but a whole lot of it isgood                           FredBernstein New York City
