                                 A Shot From the Pews                           Cross Check                        I agree with most of Steve Chapmans conclusions in I will say unashamedly that I am a bornagain Christian But I will alsosay that you are very correct in pointing out the basic statistical mistake ofimplying causation from correlation I think it is naive to think that simplyposting copies of the Ten Commandments is going to solve the nations crimeproblem            I also think it is damaging to the faith to try anduse religion to solve social problems God becomes a means to an end insteadof an end in Himself He is not a magical potion that you can sprinkle on yourproblems to make them go away I do think that genuine faith and a relationshipwith God will cure violence and murder and such however imposing religion onpeople is not the answer I think one of the reasons there is a positivecorrelation between religion and crime in the States is because large portionsof socalled Christians in this country are nominal at best            Also I think that thenumber of churchgoers in a given area is relatively inconsequential in thiswhole equation If someone could prove that it was the Christians committingall the crimes then we would have an interesting situation But if that is notthe case then it makes no difference how many Christians there are The realissue then becomes the motivations for the population of criminals which arethings such as the social structure and the justice system             JonathanMinter                        Lynchburg Va                           In Order To Form anImperfect Union                        It is wrong I think to suggest as WilliamSaletan does in Frame Game  that our current healthcare crisis iscaused by the unreasonable expectations of the people who seek medical careThe reason patients expect better care than theyre willing to pay for isthat they have already paid for it Medical advances are made throughgovernment subsidy directly through taxsupported universities orindirectly in the form of tax writeoffs for privatesector research anddevelopment The hospitals that we go to and our doctors practice inessentially all receive some level of governmental funding Our doctorsattended medical school with the aid of federally guaranteed student loans oroutright grants We paid for the ability to provide the best care in the worldand we continue to pay far more in terms of percentage of gross average annualindividual income than any other Western society            Most of the doctors I know are hardworkingcompassionate professionals They certainly provide an essential service Theyall make a ton of dough and I dont know anyone who begrudges them that Thecurrent medical payment scheme in the United States makes the very best medicalcare available but is also an active barrier to many who seek basic care andcannot afford it Radical reform is clearly called for but will never happen aslong as freemarket principles control access to this service Our currentdilemma has come about because we tried to shift cost control away from theservice providers This has had the effect of driving many capable physiciansout of their own practices and into exactly the kind of alienating impersonalbeancounting HMO setting that has caused the American Medical Association totry and become a union            It is sad that the besttechnical healthcare system in the world is delivered so poorly that theprofessionals charged with caring for us feel compelled to sacrifice theirindependence in this way Unionization is a bad idea that will only make thingsworse             William CAltreuter                        Buffalo NY                           MistakenCondemnation                        Eric Altermans in your letters column of June that my colleague Harvey Klehr and I felt the need to condemn a JacobHeilbrunn article in the New Republic is mistaken We disagreed with ajudgment Heilbrunn advanced in his essay but disagreement is not condemnationIndeed that one disagreement aside we have a very high regard for Heilbrunnswritings In view of the fact that in the letter to which Alterman referred weclearly expressed our appreciation of other remarks Mr Heilbrunn made in hisessay no responsible commentator could use the characterization used byAlterman             John Earl Haynes                        Kensington Md                                             Eric Altermanreplies I dunno This seems a semantic issue at best Heilbrunns articleattacked Yales Annals of Communism series and the decision by its editorialdirector Jonathan Brent not to offer Heilbrunns old professor VladimirBrovkin to edit a series of books about the Gulag He then accused Brent andYale of having caved in to the ethos of historical correctness governed byrevisionists who dismiss as cold war humbug the notion that the Soviet Unionwas a totalitarian country                                       Klehr and Haynes wrote a strong letter insupport of Brents editorial leadership and of Brent himself They maintainedthat he had steadfastly insisted on the academic integrity of the series andstaunchly defended their work In other words virtually everythingHeilbrunn wrote about Brent and his alleged cowardiceas well as his manycriticisms of the Yale serieswas wrong Haynes says this does not constitutea condemnation Fine Ill grant it if he feels the distinction to be animportant one I only hope no one ever decides to demonstrate his or her highregard for my writings in this peculiar fashion
