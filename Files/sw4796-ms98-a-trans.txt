        okay Randall uh uh do you have any special interest in uh space flight     oh yeah  ever since i was a young and uh used to watch the old uh Apollo missions going off in uh classroom TVs   uhhuh   uh i suspect a lot of people uh uh got uh turned on by watching watching those go off uh very exciting     umhum yeah   the uh uh ive always ive always uh wanted wanted very much uh to uh be somehow involved in all that   umhum   and uh to uh meet and and to see see it actually happen of course ive really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday   umhum   but uh that seems rather unlikely at this point unfortunately   what do you do now   uh computer programmer   oh     unfortunately that can be done from the ground   yeah to bad uh   yeah made the wrong wrong career choice to get up into space         the uh uh i used to think when i was when i was younger that uh by this time wed have lots more in stuff in space than we do now   umhum umhum   uh frustrating at times   umhum   i dont know what you think  about all that   well uh yeah i uh  im kind of young im only twenty two and so uh uh im not you know theres a lot thats happened in my lifetime as far as uh you know with the space shuttle and all although plans to uh go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to uh the sixties   uhhuh   um although i have a  i i kind of wonder uh if some if it were possible to market some uh form of uh space technology you know to uh uh to make it equitable it might severely help the economy you know in the in the uh respect that  you know theres endless amounts of research to be done endless amounts of resources and and what not it would be great if we could find some way to to uh use that to boost the economy   yeah well yeah well the uh uh ive always uh felt that uh uh one of the long term solutions that at least a few of our problems would be to have uh some sort of uh solar power satellites up   umhum   uh because thats a uh you know in singularly renewable resource that doesnt do it that doesnt require uh uh any particularly uh nasty environmental impact   exactly   and you can just get as much power as you need up there its a matter of how big you build it   umhum umhum   uh and of course the side effects of this is that you have to have uh lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no  things that i think we should be doing so the side effects of doing that which i think would be good you know very very good for all for everyone in the long run is uh is it some of the other things id like to see happen would happen also   right yeah it seems like uh theres uh so youre talking about positive side effects then okay i understand   so im yeah right right um   sure that that makes a lot of sense   right the only problem is of course that uh that requires significant commitment from people to actually decide they want to put things like that up there   umhum yeah   and they want to do the research and uh theyre all   yeah   you know no no one the only commitments that theyre interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like uh the trip to Mars   right exactly   which is would would would produce some useful scientific research and so forth but   the same money could probably be far better spent on uh uh lunar bases and solar power satellite research and and uh and uh so forth   umhum   it it would be done it would be being done for the uh glitz and show factor   umhum   to get politicians votes instead of instead of for for you know we should eventually send someone people to Mars but not just because its glitzy to do so   right   we should do it because  for the for the return we get for it and uh   umhum   uh unfortunately thats not why things happen   exactly   i i would settle for the glitz  for the glitz if the side effects were useful if they oh but uh   least nothing yeah   the downside of that is that you after you do one of those people say well we did it   right now were done   now lets now were done       no need to use this anymore to play around with this space stuff anymore thats what happened with Apollo   yeah i think youre right   uh but uh id give almost anything to get into space   i would too id id uh it was it John Denver that that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle
