                    Background        Heterotrimeric G proteins couple agonistactivated        heptahelical receptors to a variety of effector responses        For the most part this signaling activity takes place at        the plasma membranes of cells However G proteins have        been detected at a variety of subcellular locations and        have been implicated in numerous membrane trafficking        activities      This suggests that distinct though        not yet determined mechanisms exist to target G protein        subunits to subcellular locations other than plasma        membranes PM Furthermore posttranscriptional or        posttranslational modifications may play a role in        directing a G protein subunit to a specific intracellular        location        Unique subcellular localization has been observed for a        novel alternative spliced form of the G protein  subunit        G          i     This          i splice variant termed s         i  contains a novel  amino acid        sequence that replaces the Cterminal  amino acids of          i     s         i has been observed to localize to        Golgi membranes and other intracellular membranes             in contrast wild type          i is typically found at PM Based on        this unique localization of s         i  a prominent role in membrane        trafficking has been proposed for this subunit            However no report to date has supported a functional role        for s         i in vesicular transport although a        variety of functional assays have implicated other G        including          s and          i  in vesicle trafficking pathways                    In spite of its unknown functional significance s         i provides a potential model for        studying mechanisms of subcellular localization of G        Clearly some aspect of the novel splicing is responsible        for the difference in subcellular targeting of s         i          ie  Golgi and intracellular        membranes compared to wild type          i          ie PM To address the mechanism        of subcellular localization of s         i  two hypotheses were tested herein        First the possibility was tested that the novel  amino        acid sequence found at the Cterminus of s         i functions as a specific Golgi or        intracellular membrane targeting motif A second        possibility was suggested by considering the location of        the splice site Several studies have shown that deletions        or amino acid substitutions in the extreme Cterminal        region of G creates a protein defective in        guaninenucleotide binding          Rapid release        of guaninenucleotides can result in an unstable G             This leads to the prediction that s         i is also unstable due to a disruption        in the structure of its Cterminus caused by the novel        splice sequence Thus the second possibility is that        failure of s         i to localize at the PM but instead        localize at intracellular membranes is the result of a        general defect in protein stability Results presented        herein are consistent with this second hypothesis                    Results                 i and s         i differ only at their extreme        Ctermini Alternative splicing results in a novel  amino        acids in s         i that replace the Cterminal  amino        acids of          i Figure  In the studies presented        here both          i and s         i contain an internal EE epitope as        used previously for          i      The use of the EE epitope        allows the direct comparison of subcellular localization        and expression of          i and s         i  and facilitates immunoprecipitation        of the two expressed proteins This is essential since        suitable antibodies to detect and immunoisolate s         i are not readily available Attempts        to use a previously described polyclonal antibody directed        against the Cterminus of s         i     were unsatisfactory in our        hands In particular attempts to detect endogenous s         i by immunofluorescence failed due to        faint detection that showed drastically different patterns        of staining depending upon fixation technique        The subcellular localization of expressed          i and s         i was compared in COS and BHK cells        Figure  In both cell types          i was detected at cellular plasma        membranes as highlighted by bright staining at the cell        periphery Figure Aand C In contrast s         i was not detected at plasma membranes        but instead typically displayed an intracellular and        perinuclear staining pattern Figure Band D consistent        with localization to intracellular membranes as previously        described      The subcellular localization of s         i showed overlap in immunofluorescent        staining with the Golgi protein COP Figure Aand B        and the endoplasmic reticulum protein PDI Figure Cand        D localization of s         i exclusively to Golgi was not        observed even at the lowest levels of detection        Subcellular fractionation confirmed that s         i was localized at least partly to        membranes Figure E After lysis of cells in hypotonic        buffer followed by highspeed centrifugation          i was found predominantly in the        particulate fraction from COS Figure E lanes  and  or        BHK cells Figure E lanes  and  A majority of s         i was also detected in the particulate        fraction from both COS Figure E lanes  and  and BHK        cells Figure E lanes  and  although some was also        found in the soluble fraction As a comparison a        nonpalmitoylated mutant of          q  in which cysteines  and  have        been substituted with serines is found predominantly in        the soluble fraction Figure E lanes  and  as        described previously     Surprisingly in comparison        to          i  s         i was always detected in fewer cells        by immunofluorescence analysis and showed lower levels of        protein expression by western blot analysis of subcellular        fractions Figure E or whole cell lysates not shown        These expression differences suggested that s         i was either less efficiently expressed        or more rapidly degraded compared to          i  as described below        The Cterminal  amino acids of s         i  which replace the Cterminal         amino acids of          i Figure  have been proposed to        function as a Golgi targeting signal      To test the        potential importance of this Cterminal region in        localization of s         i to intracellular membranes and        prevention of s         i from localizing to PM a deletion        mutant of          i was constructed consisting of amino        acids  In s         i  the Cterminal splice occurs just        after amino acid  Figure  and thus the novel         amino acid splice sequence is removed in          i  Immunofluorescence        microscopy indicates that          i  Figure B displays a        subcellular localization pattern very similar to s         i Figure A This result is        consistent with the alternative hypothesis that a        disruption of          i at the Cterminus creates a protein        unable to localize at the PM        If the unique Cterminal  amino acid sequence of s         i functions as a Golgi targeting        signal it is important to test whether it is sufficient to        target a heterologous protein to intracellular membranes        When the  amino acid sequence was fused to the Cterminus        of GFP GFPs         i aa this unique s         i sequence failed to direct GFP to        intracellular membranes Figure B GFPs         i aa was diffusely distributed        throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus similar to what is        observed for GFP alone Figure A On the other hand when        the first ten amino acids of          i are fused to GFP to create          i GFP fluorescence is detected        strongly at the PM Figure C indicating the Nterminus        of          i  which contains the sites for        myristoylation and palmitoylation     can be        sufficient for directing PM localization of a normally        cytosolic protein In agreement with these results the s         i Cterminal sequence failed to        redirect the localization of a secreted or a nuclear        protein     Thus not only is the unique s         i sequence unable to override other        localization signals it is unable to target a cytoplasmic        protein to intracellular membranes These results are        consistent with a lack of a specific role for the s         i sequence in Golgi membrane        targeting        The above experimental results failed to support the        hypothesis that the unique  amino acid sequence from s         i serves as a specific Golgi or        intracellular membrane targeting motif Thus the following        experiments concentrated on addressing the alternative        hypothesis s         i is unstable and rapidly degraded due        to disruptions in the Cterminus and such instability        results in a failure of s         i to reach its proper place at the        PM        The ability of          i and s         i to undergo Nterminal lipid        modifications was compared Myristoylation occurs        cotranslationally at the extreme Nterminal glycine while        palmitoylation occurs posttranslationally at a cysteine        immediately after the myristoylated glycine     The        subcellular site where palmitoylation occurs has not been        well defined although in one model palmitoylation occurs        at the PM     Cells expressing          i or s         i were metabolically labeled with        Hpalmitate or Hmyristate          i and s         i were immunoprecipitated from cell        extracts and incorporation of radiolabel was analyzed by        SDSPAGE followed by fluorography Figure A No        palmitoylation of s         i was detected Figure A lane         although          i was strongly palmitoylated Figure        A lane  In contrast both          i and s         i incorporated similar levels or        myristate Figure A lanes  and  The similar level of        myristoylation was particularly surprising since total s         i protein was much lower than          i as determined by immunoblotting of        the immunoprecipitates Figure B compare lanes  and         Myristoylation is a cotranslational modification and        levels of radiolabeling should thus reflect synthesis of        new protein Accordingly the myristoylation results        Figure Aand B lanes  and  strongly suggested that          i and s         i are translated equally well as        evidenced by similar levels of radiolabeled myristate        incorporation during the labeling period but s         i is more rapidly degraded as seen by        reduced steadystate levels of immunoprecipitated protein        The lack of palmitoylation of s         i is consistent with at least two not        necessarily mutually exclusive possibilities s         i may fail to undergo palmitoylation        because it is not stable long enough for posttranslational        palmitoylation to occur or because it fails to reach a PM        site of palmitoylation Alternatively the novel Cterminal        sequence of s         i may somehow prevent direct        recognition by a palmitoyl transferase        Cells expressing high levels of s         i  and to a much lesser extent          i  often displayed very bright        intracellular accumulations of s         i as visualized by immunofluorescence        These large spots were reminiscent of recently described        aggresomes accumulations of misfolded protein that are        being targeted for proteasomedependent degradation             This observation suggested the possibility that        intracellular localization of s         i may reflect targeting to a        proteasomedependent degradative pathway To test this idea        further cells expressing          i or s         i were treated with the proteasome        inhibitor acetylleucylleucylnorleucinal ALLN and        changes in localization of the  subunit were analyzed by        immunofluorescence Figure  After h treatment with        ALLN          i localization is relatively unaffected        Figure C but s         i begins to show a slight increase in        distinct intracellular accumulations Figure D At  h        ALLN treatment many cells expressing          i display a decrease in PM localization        and an increase in intracellular staining Figure E          i is typically seen in large bright        spots and in a perinuclearintracellular membrane staining        pattern after incubation of cells for  h with ALLN In        fact the localization pattern of          i after  h incubation with ALLN        Figure E is similar to the observed localization of s         i in the absence or presence of ALLN        treatment Figure B D and F At  h treatment with        ALLN both          i Figure G and s         i Figure H are detected almost        exclusively as a large bright spot in each expressing cell        Similar results were obtained using another proteasome        inhibitor MG Interestingly ALLN treatment was        relatively ineffective at promoting accumulation of        overexpressed          s in aggresomelike structures not        shown Thus the results of Figure are consistent with        the proposal that the intracellular localization of s         i is due to its targeting to a        degradative pathway a pathway shared by          i         The subcellular localization of s         i was compared to          i AS This alanine to serine        mutation in the Cterminal region of          i AS and          s AS has been shown to greatly        accelerate GDP release to accelerate irreversible        inactivation         in vitro  and to cause rapid        turnover of the  subunit in cultured cells             Thus if the observed intracellular localization of s         i is caused by instability of the        protein due to disruptions at its Cterminus then it        follows that          i AS should show a similar pattern        of localization Indeed immunofluorescence microscopy        revealed a pronounced intracellular distribution for          i AS Figure E In addition to        intracellular membrane localization similar to s         i Figure C          i AS was detected weakly but        consistently at the PM It seems likely that the Cterminal        disruption of s         i replacing the  Cterminal amino        acids is a more severe disruption than the AS        substitution Thus the similarity in localization of s         i and          i AS bolsters the idea that        mislocalization of s         i is caused by its inherent        instability        G protein  subunits can stabilize wild type and        alanine to serine mutant  subunits         in vitro     Thus the effect of         coexpression on subcellular localization of          i AS and s         i was tested          i localizes to the PM efficiently when        expressed alone Figure A or when coexpressed with         Figure B s         i shows a dramatic change in        localization when coexpressed with  Figure D        displaying strong PM staining Not only is s         i targeted efficiently to the PM when        coexpressed with  but  coexpression increases        overall levels of transiently expressed s         i and          i  as determined by immunoblotting        Figure G and increases the number of cells expressing        s         i  as observed by immunofluorescence        microscopy not shown Similarly coexpression of         efficiently promotes PM localization of          i AS Figure F        The analysis of the effect of  was extended by        examining the localization of          i or s         i after cotransfection with  and        after treatment with ALLN In contrast to Figure  a        marked difference was observed between          i and s         i after ALLN treatment When  is        coexpressed with          i  PM localization of          i is observed as shown in Figure B        and incubation with ALLN for  h shows little effect on PM        localization of          i Figure A When  is coexpressed        with s         i  PM localization of s         i is observed as shown in Figure D        but incubation with ALLN for  h causes an increase in        bright intracellular accumulations of s         i Figure B Taken together results        with  coexpression are consistent with the ability of         to promote PM targeting of G and further suggest that s         i is less effectively stabilized than                 i by  as evidenced by ALLNinduced        accumulation in intracellular aggregates Figure B        Lastly Smethionine pulsechase labeling studies        directly confirmed that s         i was more rapidly degraded than          i Figure  After transient        expression of the  subunits cellular proteins were        radiolabeled with a brief pulse of Smethionine followed        by a chase Immunoprecipitation of the  subunit after        increasing times of chase followed by SDSPAGE and        fluorography revealed that radiolabeled s         i was rapidly lost          i consistently displayed a  fold        longer halflife compared to s         i  while          i AS was intermediate In the        experiment presented in Figure  the t          was determined to be approximately          and  min for s         i           i AS and          i  respectively Although this trend        was consistent the exact t          showed some variability from        experiment to experiment probably due to varying levels of        transient overexpression It is likely that the difference        in turnover of s         i and          i is even more profound when the        proteins are expressed at lower levels Consistent with        this idea s         i was refractory to stable expression        even though cells stably expressing          i were easily selected not shown The        inability to isolate cells stably expressing s         i can be attributed to its rapid        degradation Regardless Smethionine pulsechase        labeling studies Figure  demonstrate that s         i is indeed more rapidly degraded than                 i                     Discussion        In addition to their well characterized role at the PM        in coupling activated GPCRs to effector proteins        heterotrimeric G proteins have been implicated in a variety        of other cellular functions including membrane trafficking        pathways A splice variant of          i  termed s         i  has been proposed as a candidate to        regulate vesicle transport due to its localization at        intracellular membranes The studies described in this        report were undertaken to define mechanisms that underlie        subcellular localization of s         i  The novel  amino acids found in        s         i appear not to function as a specific        Golgi or endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence Instead        the results in this study support the proposal that s         i fails to target to the PM because it        is an unstable protein The following results support this        hypothesis  s         i and          i are equally labeled by a pulse of        Hmyristate although much less s         i protein is detected  s         i displays a propensity to localize to        potential aggresomelike structures and this localization        is greatly enhanced by proteasome inhibitor treatment         the          i AS mutant previously shown to be        unstable and defective in guaninenucleotide binding shows        a similar pattern of subcellular localization          ie intracellular membranes rather        than PM   overexpression increases expression of s         i and promotes PM localization of s         i and          i AS but  coexpression does not        prevent s         i localization to potential        aggresomelike structures when cells are treated with        proteasome inhibitors and  pulsechase analysis        indicates that s         i is rapidly degraded        A number of reports have demonstrated that disruptions        in the Ctermini of G cause reduced affinity for        guaninenucleotides and protein instability The Cterminal         amino acids of G consist of the  loop followed by        the  helix and finally several amino acids of flexible        structure Figure        The  loop        stabilizes the guanine ring of bound GDP or GTP and        mutations in this region affect guaninenucleotide binding        The AS mutation of          i and AS mutation of          s cognate to the          i AS used in this study were shown        to cause greatly decreased affinity for GDP             Defective binding of GDP leads to more G in the empty        state no bound guaninenucleotide and this form of G is        rapidly denatured         in vitro  as shown for          s AS and          i AS      Moreover          s AS was demonstrated to undergo        rapid degradation t            h in stably transfected        cells     The same mutation in          t has also been shown to greatly        decrease guaninenucleotide binding      Additional        amino acids in the critical  loop are important for        maintaining G integrity            Although the  helix Figure  does not directly        contact the bound guaninenucleotide       it is        clearly important for G structure and to maintain the        proper orientation of the  loop A recent study        identified a number of  helix residues in          t that when changed to alanines        increased rates of guaninenucleotide exchange          ie decreased affinity for        guaninenucleotides     Individual mutation of amino        acids in          t  cognate to T N V F in                 i Figure  increased nucleotide        exchange rates     Two of these critical amino acids        N and V in          i  are in fact the first two amino        acids that are replaced by the novel splicing in s         i Figure  Thus one might speculate        that the novel  amino acid sequence in s         i would impair guaninenucleotide        binding and result in a unstable protein Unfortunately        initial attempts to directly show a defect in        guaninenucleotide binding by s         i  using a GTP Sdependent trypsin        protection assay     were unsuccessful due at least        in part to the inability to solubilize expressed s         i from membranes using a mild detergent                 eg lubrolpolyoxyethylene        lauryl ether        The data in this report are consistent with a scenario        in which intracellular GolgiER localization of s         i reflects its rapid degradation rather        than specific targeting to a subcellular organelle        Particularly compelling is the similarity in subcellular        localization of          i AS and s         i Figure  In addition the use of        proteasome inhibitors Figures and  suggest that s         i is degraded by a proteasome pathway        The observed intracellular membrane ER localization and        proteasome inhibitorinduced juxtanuclear aggregate        accumulation aggresome is consistent with that reported        for other proteins being degraded by such a pathway             When treated with proteasome inhibitors overexpressed        wild type          i also accumulates in aggresomelike        structures Figure  suggesting that G may normally be        degraded by a proteasomedependent pathway However        overexpression of  prevents ALLNinduced juxtanuclear        accumulations of          i but not s         i Figure  Although little is known        regarding degradative pathways for G proteins s         i and other mutants          eg          i AS may be valuable tools for        defining such pathways        The data presented here argue against a sequence        specific Golgi membrane targeting function for the novel         amino acid sequence found in s         i  The novel sequence of s         i is not sufficient to direct other        proteins to GolgiER membranes These  amino acids did        not change the cytoplasmic localization of GFP Figure         Similarly a recent report showed that the s         i  amino acids were unable to retain        a secreted protein in intracellular membranes and did not        affect localization of a nuclear protein     However        in addition to causing rapid degradation one cannot rule        out that the  amino acid sequence of s         i functions somehow as part of a Golgi        targeting motif in the context of other regions of          i  as suggested     Other        researchers have described a specific Golgi membrane        localization of s         i     in contrast the results        presented in this report always show a much more disperse        subcellular localization of s         i to intracellular membranes consistent        with staining of both Golgi and ER The reason for this        difference in localization is unclear Interestingly in        the other study the authors found that deletion of a        prolinerich sequence corresponding to s         i amino acids  Figure         changed localization of s         i from Golgi membranes to a more        diffuse localization throughout intracellular membranes            However mutation of proline residues to alanines        failed to affect s         i localization     Thus little        evidence exists to support a specific membrane targeting        role for the novel s         i sequence         was able to promote plasma membrane localization of        s         i Figure   prevents irreversible        inactivation of          i  when measured         in vitro at C and slows the        inactivation of          i AS     Thus  may stabilize        s         i and          i AS allowing dependent               PM localization These results are also        consistent with the possibility that the primary defect in        s         i is a reduced ability to interact with         G containing mutations in known sites of contact with         fail to localize to PM but overexpression of  can        rescue their PM localization      However the        crystal structures     show that the Cterminal         loop helix region does not directly contact  Thus it        is more likely that indeed s         i is deficient in binding to  but        this effect is a consequence of its instability s         i may exist in a state that does not        interact well with  simply because it is in the process        of being irreversibly inactivated      Similarly          i AS appears not to be defective in        its intrinsic ability to interact      and        coexpression of  shifts          i AS like s         i  from intracellular to plasma        membranes Figure         What is the cellular function of s         i  The ability of  to promote PM        localization of s         i raises the possibility that        endogenous s         i is in fact localized to PM where it        can interact with GPCRs and effectors Future studies will        test the potential of s         i  when coexpressed with  to        productively interact with receptors and effectors        However this possibility is viewed as unlikely for several        reasons First others have shown that in COS cells        endogenous s         i is not detected at PM but only found        intracellularly      although one cannot rule out that        a small but functionally significant fraction of s         i reaches the PM Second the extreme        Ctermini of G are critical sites for interaction with        GPCRs     and the novel Cterminal sequence found in        s         i would be predicted to disrupt        productive interactions with GPCRs Third even though         can promote PM localization of s         i in the overexpression system        described here s         i remains less stable than          i Figure  suggesting that such        instability may also impair productive interactions with        GPCRs        On the other hand unknown proteins may function to        stabilize s         i and help direct it to Golgi        membranes A specific combination of  and  subtypes may        play such a role however one thorough study showed a lack        of  on Golgi membranes of exocrine pancreatic cells even        though a variety of G were readily detected in the Golgi            Other proteins that may specifically promote the        intracellular targeting of G have not been identified        It is possible that s         i functions as a shortlived protein        regulating some aspect of membrane transport pathways        however no experiments to directly support or refute this        hypothesis have been reported Instead it is tempting to        speculate that alternative splicing may be a mechanism to        regulate cellular levels of          i  In this model certain conditions        may favor the formation of s         i compared to          i  and the resulting rapid degradation        of s         i would decrease the cellular content        of          i  A precedent for such alternative        splicingdependent regulation of expression has been        described for Hras     Alternative splicing occurs in        Hras and the alternative spliced form is predicted to        encode an unstable transcript and a protein product that        lacks the ability to oncogenically transform cells A        mutation was identified that abolishes the alternatively        spliced form and this mutation leads to an increase in        Hras expression and transforming ability Thus it was        demonstrated that alternative splicing is a mechanism that        cells use to control expression of Hras            Alternative splicing may similarly play an important role        in regulating expression of          i  Testing of this idea will require a        comparison of s         i and          i transcript levels and an analysis of        whether relative expression is affected in response to        physiological changes such as extracellular stimuli or        cell differentiation                    Conclusions        In summary the results presented here demonstrate that        s         i  a novel splice variant of          i  is rapidly degraded when expressed        in cells Such instability is consistent with known        structurefunction data regarding the importance of the        Cterminus of G subunits The observed intracellular        localization of s         i is due at least in part to its        instability Moreover the data presented in this study        argue against the novel Cterminus of s         i functioning as a specific Golgi        targeting motif        In addition similarly to s         i  an          i mutant          i AS previously demonstrated to be        unstable         in vitro  displays a defect in        plasma membrane localization when expressed in cells These        results suggest that both s         i and          i AS may prove
