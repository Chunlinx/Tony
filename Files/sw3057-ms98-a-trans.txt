          hi you want to start first   of course were talking about the elderly and uh whether or not we would we like nursing homes and as a matter of fact i can tell you something about that     right uhhuh you apparently have somebody there in one   no actually my grandmother owned and operated a nursing home for years and her mother   oh you are kidding   no she did and then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home for years and then uh went on back to school and became the director of nurses at a nursing home   oh uhhuh i will be darned uhhuh   and uh my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses   oh for heavens sake   so i do know something about that   you are very very much aware of what goes on  that is great   absolutely actually the motivation for grandmother entering the business was that her mother was very old and couldnt seem to find companions   uhhuh umhum umhum umhum   she was lonely and she needed company for her mother and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies and then uh it it grew into a very prosperous business from that point uh then they   right right i will be darned umhum now see that is a nice attitude to go into uh   umhum   it seems like they must be waiting until its a necessity   umhum   and there is no chance of uh good companionship or doing anything   well that is not really true either uh i think that is a stigma and an i and an impression that has come from some few bad experiences you see those who had bad experiences talk about them   um right right   and those who dont may write a letter to the nursing home and say you did good but they do not talk a whole lot about that     uhhuh that is true but what i mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home   umhum   when you are still able to have good relationships with maybe other friends   umhum umhum sure well now   they wait until theyre you know unable   thats right well that is because they wait until the children make those choices they choose to not make those choices themselves however my daughterinlaw also is a nurse in a nursing home   right right right umhum   and uh she works for one here in Dallas which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home and these these i love watching these elderly people come they will come and tell her well i am going for my tennis lessons   um umhum umhum     and uh would you would you you know call down and have the van come around and take us for our tennis lessons and theyre very active and very enthusiastic and they have some excellent programs right there on site   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   their dining room looks like you know Lubys Cafeteria   yeah thats great   or or one of the lovely cafeterias and they have you know pink linen napkins for their dinners and a a well equipped library   uhhuh uhhuh yeah that sounds great   oh i am certainly very much for a nursing home and i think when the the parent gets old enough to the extent where they just dont want to be bothered with keeping house and with taking care of themselves anymore that is a wonderful alternative it is expensive it is costly   yeah umhum uhhuh uhhuh see if they could could get this idea across though better than what it is   it is costly umhum well now my daddys mother uh lived in a a retirement village and she and her sister had side by side duplexes one bedroom duplex she still had her individuality   you know umhum umhum   but they were there close and they did have uh you know the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems and there were lights that you could flip on and so forth and they he did have security   umhum umhum   no i am very much in favor i have heard horror stories   oh well you have that with anything     i know that the elderly can easily be abused but i would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than are they are in homes of their own children   oh yeah in the homes yeah well we used our nursing home as uh   umhum   like when my sister was real bad before she died uh   umhum   we took her the last month and a half into a nursing home and they were super with her   umhum umhum absolutely   they were uh   well now my grandmother of course all of my folks lived to be very old and my grandmother developed Hodgkins Disease when she was in her late eighties uh late seventies i mean   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   she went to the doctor she had surgery she got the treatments and during the period of time that she was undergoing those treatments she was in a nursing home she got better she got well she got out and went dancing again   umhum uhhuh well a lot of people do that they left them temporally maybe they had a broken hip or something or   uhhuh thats right uhhuh uhhuh i think it is a wonderful interim place it is a place that you dont have to struggle with hospital problems and uh yet it is not you know you have   uh umhum umhum and it can become home to them   umhum umhum it certainly is   it it it depends upon the individual right yeah   it certainly does but you see we have had excellent experience with that and uh i i did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill but i would not object to going to one i might i might like to be uh coherent enough to make my own choice   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   uh i would not particularly think i would want my kids to say well i think this is what i need for Mom and then dump me there but i would like   this this is the age and  there has to be consideration taken on everything so   thats right umhum umhum and i think you would shop for a nursing home just like you would shop for a church or a doctor or anything else   yeah thats right you would look into it thoroughly and do do the best job you could in choosing choosing one   umhum sure umhum when you get to the point where you are in trouble and you have got to have that help you are in no position to make those choices   uhhuh no and you do not have the time to look that is what i am saying most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity   thats right umhum absolutely i think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize theyre going to be needing those facilities one day   umhum   and to actually get involved and participate on a community level with community service go out to the nursing home help guide some craft programs perhaps work on some music programs whatever their talents are and work with those senior citizens   whatever their talents yeah yeah i have a cousin whos uh  he had a son that was epileptic from birth and he did fine at home they lived on a farm   umhum   but she made arrangements so that when she was gone she didnt want her her children her other children burdened with his care   umhum umhum umhum thats right   so he they she has made arrangements that when she she was gone that he would go into the nursing home   umhum   and hes i would say he adjusted very well and uh he he hes been there quite a long time   umhum   and uh he dont know me usually  but he goes wheeling down uh the hall to bingo somebody else hes helping him out   yeah thats right   you know and uh he has adjusted very well   well one of the things i think that is most desirable for the elderly and that is routine   umhum oh yes yes   routine and uh constancy   umhum umhum   uh the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over i do not think they pay the nursing home staff sufficiently to to get the dedication     uhhuh to keep them there uhhuh   that they have in some other profession and thats sad because i think the health profession is one of the most critical   true yes yes but for for some reason   and uh   people resist uh the fact that they should be paid as well as businesses and that type of thing you know   thats right   it seems to be a resistance   care for the elderly and care for the children i cant imagine a more costly and a more a more uh better area to invest your money   umhum umhum right right but there seems to be a resistance   youre preserving your heritage and your future there   yeah yeah   and as a matter of fact i dont see why they dont have childrens programs in nursing homes   well around here we have some you know the churches   umhum umhum   uh take your the children and i know our kids thoroughly the children thoroughly enjoy
