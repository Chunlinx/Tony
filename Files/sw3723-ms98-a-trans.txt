              okay   okay i was watching the soap opera awards um and and its its really making me wanna exercise because every single woman in the audience is   oh   about ten pounds   oh   so um i started anchoring last up anchoring uh exercising last       about last Spring when i i joined the Presidents Health Club and i was really motivated and going and i went uh for a little while uh   umhum   i went pretty regularly but its hard to go regularly for a long time   umhum   and where i live in Waco uh they dont have anywhere here that is affiliated with Presidents so now i dont have a club and im i dont have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that so im not exercising at the time at the moment so i wish i could i wish i did have the motivation to get out and do that but   umhum   i just dont like just running with no where to go and i just cant do that so   umhum   well i understand that ive been trying to get myself motivated i had gone gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor uh she had injured her back and needed a walking partner and i thought thatd be the time to get going   umhum   and uh so we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks and uh then she had to get back to work and which was traveling to New York and so shes not around   um   and i just dont like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning and i dont seem to find time in the day time and of course its motivation thats keeping me from really looking for that opportunity   yeah yeah yeah i think a lot of times if you have someone to uh work out with or walk with or something it does give you that motivation and you can also i mean you can you know pretty much do it privately if you had your own private uh   oh yeah   sort of contest you know where you would try and see if you could lose more weight than your friend or something like that and that would keep you going   yeah yeah yeah well more than weight course i could use uh lose certainly from ten to twenty pounds but i think more than that i also notice i just feel better when i exercise   umhum umhum oh yeah   and thats something that im motivated about now because i do need to get myself feeling better and just in better shape but   umhum   i um all the same its connected to my attitude because im not feeling as perky and good im also its hard to get my attitude to to get myself out there   thats very true it seems like you walk quicker and you just perky is a good word for it when you when you exercise   yeah yeah   and i understand that walking is suppose to be like the best exercise better than running things like that because it it works everything and it gets your breathing up and it it doesnt   yeah yeah and you have less less chance of of hurting yourself   yeah it doesnt you know hurt you like i understand running hurts your shins or knees or something like that   yeah yeah the last time i tried running with my daughter because shes supposed to be jogging in P E and it felt good but then i had   so umhum   pulled a muscle in my knee actually i hyper extended it or something and uh boy i was suffering for a good three weeks later   wow wow   so and id never had that problem before but i guess age is starting to catch up to me  its showing up in the weirdest places   yeah uh oh huh i guess my favorite my favorite exercise in the uh in the gym is the bikes to go yeah just with the the stationary bikes to just ride   oh is it   and if youre watching television they usually have television in there or something or if youre listening to a walkman its pretty its pretty okay   yeah yeah   again thats sort of weird because youre youve not going anywhere and it i i used to play racquetball and i really loved that because though it to me it had a point   uhhuh yeah   you know it was there was points you could you you would make and you know there was a point to it but running and jogging and just not going anywhere its just because i dont i just cant understand that so i dont do it     yeah well ive got a dog now and and of course she needs walking and so thats a little less try you know uh burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her and i do put on the earphones to have something to listen to and   oh yeah umhum hum yeah i know a lot of people just to be safe like you were talking about walking at night and in the morning early in the morning um you see a lot of uh mostly older people though but that uh walk in the malls   yeah oh yeah   you know like early in the mornings things like that i never tried that   yeah   i dont know ive i never really even thought about it really   thats kind of an idea uh we we have uh over here in Plano a little recreation center thats got a walking track that is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it anytime of the year   oh   but i find it very tedious because im watching the clock constantly and its just nothing else to look at and i actually get more tired doing that than   oh   i could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good and there i could barely make a couple miles   umhum um
