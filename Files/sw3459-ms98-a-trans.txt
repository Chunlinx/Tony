                well what uh what kind of recycling have you got in your community   well in our community we recycle everything   really   oh yeah we recycle plastic we recycle aluminum we recycle paper we recycle everything   well now do you participate in all of that   well my wife does im not real high on it myself how about   well i think i think thats great that she does that i ill applaud that um   do you do that   no and i i as a matter of fact i kind of cringed a little bit whenever i heard the topic because i think its admirable and i think its something that eventually were were all going to have to do it uh i dont but i know the   do you realize Glen that the latest Forbes magazine pointed out that it actually costs more to recycle than it does not to recycle   uh in costs more in what way   well newspapers for example for recycling papers to get rid of the ink it costs about thirty two percent more to recycle paper than it does to have new paper   well thats interesting and ive you know i wouldnt i i mean i hadnt heard that Bob and thats thats a little surprising but you know i think about the amount of of newspaper that i throw away in a week   yeah   and you know you multiply that with all the people uh im in Houston that are that are tossing out newspapers and it i remember i i was in New York several years ago and i took the wrong turn and i went over into uh State Island where the uh uh landfill is for New York City   yes   and of course thats not where i wanted to be so i turned around and beat it by hasty retreat but you know just the the amount of garbage that we generate uh is is staggering and i just i dont know how much longer we can continue to just dump everything     well its uh its a problem that uh is probably at the moment over emphasized because there is apparently more landfill available than its a matter of economics and economically right now uh its more of a scare tactic it appears that we are running out of things and the facts   yeah   in some cases are particularly paper which trees obviously by being a renewable resource and being a crop no more different than corn in effect   yeah   its a situation that of economics where its less expensive to have new newspaper than using and recycling old paper   yeah and i can i can understand that i think i think about uh you know and they say that now uh a lot of the new cars for instance i read an article not long ago about this uh uh new Honda that they had come out that theyre identifying on the car those uh particular different parts uh uh that are plastic so that that whenever the car is worn out and dismantled uh they can recycle the the plastic components   right those are uh plastic is very recyclable and uh it should be uh thats something that just wont go away when you dispose of it and uh   yeah   plastics and and your metals are very worthwhile being recycles its uh   its just a matter right now of whos going to take the time uh to do it and i i mean its something that i personally feel is it its worthwhile i just uh i havent gotten into it and uh i i think im probably like a lot of people in that uh until it gets to the point that its kind of mandated uh i dont think im im going to do it unfortunately i know   what what city do you live in   in Houston   well in i live in Plano and uh they have a very big recycling program where uh for your grass clippings for example if you dont put them in a paper sack they wont pick them up they have special pick up days for for uh leaves and debris uh you know clippings type thing and if you put it in a plastic one they wont pick it up yeah   really i saw an article i mean a a program on a TBS not too long ago that uh  they were talking about uh recycling and they uh were showing  uh in a city i think it was Portland Oregon if i remember it was either but it it was either in Washington or Oregon and of course you know those people up there are very uh uh environmentally conscious and they were uh talking about the the recycling effort up there and how theyve got uh uh all these different bins and containers and   thats what theyre coming out with here matter of fact   really yeah   i havent received ours yet but uh thats the plan in Plano also they uh bring out these humpty  bins and youre supposed to fill it up with   i know  and you know and ill tell you when you you know and ive been accustomed all my life to throwing everything in one bag and then uh dumping it in the dumpster its going to be a rude awakening to have to uh start sorting everything     well i i frankly
