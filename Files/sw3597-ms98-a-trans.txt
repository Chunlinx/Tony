        do you see as uh the changes that have occurred in the last ten then Beverly     i think one of the thing that i notice a lot i know its touching social changes but uh to me what becomes socially acceptable and i i dont know if its a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if its a factor of our society actually moving in that direction but i notice things on TV being more um open  more i i believe that they portray things on TV obviously that they never wouldve years ago and you know and specifically nudity things like that um i i dont know i ive said several times to my husband that i feel like jeez in ten years theyll have just full nudity on TV and nobodyll think anything of it and to me thats surprising to me thats thats a big change to accept it and it comes across i think subtly you know little at a time to where you get so used to seeing a little change that you know when they go uh one step further you dont notice it that much so thats one of the biggest ones ive seen   huh yeah thats a big one   what about you   well i think that society has come to a point where theyre theyre not responsible for any of their actions somebody else uh made them do it uh thats what i seem to see a lot of that uh no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices its rather sue these guys because they made a faulty uh a seat belt that didnt work right or   umhum   well thats what i think is a big one but   i tend to agree with you and i think theres a lot of that um ah yeah we have become lawsuit happy any little thing its like lets see what i can get dont you think that maybe a lot of that came from um oh you know the the the era we went through that was like you know hey if it makes you happy do it you know kind of like disregard to others do what makes you happy and and yes we should take care of ourselves you know and we should see to our own lives but not to a total disregard of others um i dont know i think its come to that a lot i see it a lot in my daughter i have a four year old  and   uhhuh   hers isnt a social thing as much as its a stage they go through but whenever something happens its you made me hit that you made me do this and so i try to tell her Brianna everything isnt always somebody elses fault you know you have to watch where youre going  and and so its what you just said kind of hits home to me just through her   sure   so   yeah and another thing i think has changed quite a bit is uh the roles that men and women play thats really in the last thirty years has changed significantly   i think youre right um in your opinion good or bad or both   well both you know theres some great things that uh have come about with more equality but i think that also i dont know whats causing society to have so many broken families and things like that because i think thats bad for us   i do too  i think part of that i i dont know i think the role of women changing has been good in that women are feeling like in in terms of their self confident confidence their selfworth you know i can do something i can be somebody you know if i put my mind to it i can accomplish things too and i think thats good but um i think when you push you know maybe i think when that was first trying come about with you know what we know as the womens lib movement  i think it was too extreme um   umhum   i think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too you know and i think theres definite roles and i think you know part of the break up of the family maybe its because of the the the social changes i dont know the fact that ah during their early changes where you know women did come more speak maybe maybe speak out i was gonna say come more out of themselves but speak out i think a lot of men were threatened by that i think now less men are you know because theyre used to it its around them um   umhum   but i i dont know i i i dont know why the families are breaking up i think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions because its like they dont go into the marriage with a commitment that this is gonna work they go in and say well hey you know ill stick with it while its good and then ill get out and i i i think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment   yeah i would agree with you ah so
