        pets     no as a matter of fact i do not have any pets   you dont   no im i uh travel quite a little bit with my work   uhhuh okay   and i love pets i mean you know i have friends who have cats and dogs and all that   uhhuh uhhuh   but since im out of town so much i um am hesitant   right   to get a pet because i dont you know i i feel that such i feel its a responsibility   right   you know and i would want to be a a good pet owner and i do have friends that uh you know go off and leave their pets for what i think are just long periods of time and that seems so cruel to me   uhhuh it is you know i you know im home all the time or not all the time but um you know im home at night and everything and i do have a Siamese   uhhuh   cat and we lived up in South Dakota and i got her there at the Humane Society   yeah   somebody had dropped her off but um shes got a crooked tail and the whole bit   yeah well you know its so  so often the uh the animals that come from the pound are the best ones   uhhuh oh shes great shes you know shes a character shell sit with anybody shell play with anybody   yeah   and shes you know a a great cat   well you know its  its funny i mean i i know i really id like to have a pet im single and i know that you know theres a great therapeutic value   uhhuh uhhuh   uh but like i say im im at this particular juncture in my life i i dont feel i would be a you know a good uh uh parent if you will for a for a pet but i know my parents um had had uh   right   a pet for years and then they that dog died and they went for several years that they didnt have a pet and now theyve got a German Shepherd that they are just nuts about   uhhuh uhhuh oh great   and its you know and its great to see that because and you can just see that that you know it adds something to their lives   yeah its its great my husband is gone a lot   umhum   and so shes great to have around   good company   you know when im you know sitting here by myself and and have somebody at least something in the house you know besides sitting here by myself   right right   but thats a good thing i think when people are alone a lot   have you ever   then i think theyre a great thing   have you ever thought of getting her a companion cat   no shes one that will not handle another cat   is that right very territorial huh   right um when they had her at at the Humane Society she was okay as long as she was by herself   uhhuh   but as long as soon as i what im thinking as what theyre thinking is that she was in a in an environment with a lot of cats   uhhuh   and what their thing is she got the broken tail with from a cat fight   uh   and um it looks like well she was declawed and everything when they took her there and they just found her on the step and uh theyre thinking that she they couldnt handle her being with the other cats   uhhuh   and so they left her there and so i got her and you can tell when shes around other cats shell pick a fight real fast   yeah   but as long as shes by herself with us its no problem shes really shes great with people   how old was she when you got her   one year old   yeah was that i mean thats one of the things ive often wondered about if you get an animal that you know i i always think about the idea of getting them whenever theyre very young so its i kind of always kind of wonder how well they adjust or how long it takes them you know as an adult   uhhuh uhhuh uh she adjusted the that same day   no   yeah she was great you know she   she said this is home huh   yeah she says this is home she knew right where the bed was she laid on my pillow she you know did everything she laid on me on my stomach and you know went right to the cat litter box and where that was and she was great     thats great yeah yeah i   i think she was a good cat its just that the other cats were a problem for her   yeah i have a friend who has a uh a cat that she got from the pound   uhhuh   well actually i take that back she didnt get it from the pound she found it in her yard okay and you know and it was just the poor cat was just a mess it was the most horrible looking thing and of course her heart went out to it and she started feeding it and the next thing you know she had a cat   oh really uhhuh um uhhuh     and it turned into a beautiful animal long hair lot of hair and an odd markings and i think it you know is a Heinz Fifty seven variety but really a a handsome cat   oh great oh   but the crazy thing about it is this cat has a severe allergy to fleas   oh really   so she has to she she bathes the cat       and the cat with this special you know uh uh formula medicine that the vet gave her and which i had never heard of anyone bathing a cat but it you know   uhhuh oh   fairly regularly she bathes this cat and the cat you know is not  not particularly crazy about it but at the same time has kind of gotten used to it   uhhuh oh yeah   and it sits really wild i couldnt i couldnt believe it whenever she was telling he well i got to you know bathe my cat   oh my mom has a Himalayan and shes grown up with ten kids in the house and she has no more kids and so this cat is just her baby   uhhuh   and its a Himalayan longhair you hear of that cat having beauty appointments       hair appointments she goes gets her hair done and comes home with a bow and the whole ten yards and its just great  my mom takes it she thinks this is great you know   uhhuh   yeah   but she just you know she the cat just loves it She sits there and gets her hair blow dried and everything and   yeah they said this uh friend of mine in Dallas  started off with just a couple of cats   its just funny uhhuh   now i think shes got three or four cats and a dog   oh real ly
