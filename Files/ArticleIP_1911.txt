                                 Economic Culture Wars            Economics writer Bob Kuttner devotes anessayin the American Prospect a journal he edits to an attack on my writingsin Slate and elsewhere Dont worry I wont respond here to that attack Ifyoure interested you can read my response in the NovemberDecember issue ofKuttners journal What I would like to discuss is what I think is the truereason people like myself and Kuttnerwho also writes columns for BusinessWeek and the Boston Globe have so much trouble getting along Weare both after all liberals I have even written for the AmericanProspect  It is not I claim really a political issue in the normal senseWhat we are really fighting about is a matter of epistemology of how oneperceives and understands the world            If youtry to follow arguments about economics among intellectuals whose politics aremore or less leftofcenter you gradually become aware that the participantsin these arguments are divided not only by particular issuesdeficitreduction NAFTA and so onbut by the whole way that they think about theeconomy On one side there are those whose views are informed by academiceconomics the kind of stuff that is taught in textbooks On the other thereare people like Kuttner Jeff Faux of the Economic Policy Institute and Labor Secretary Robert Reich Somemembers of this faction have held university appointments But most of themlack academic credentials and more important they are basically hostile tothe kind of economics on which such credentials are based            If the antiacademic faction does not draw its ideas fromtextbook economics however where does its worldview come from Well heres astory that may sound trivial but which I regard as revealing Back in  Isupplied the American Prospect with an article on the problem of growingincome inequality In the published piece the editor Kuttner improved onmy drab title but also added a dreadful subtitle The Rich the Right andthe Facts Deconstructing the Income Distribution Controversy                           Deconstructing  Why on earth would anyone not a member of the ModernLanguage Association want to use an academic buzzword that has been the butt ofso many jokes What do you get when you cross a Mafioso and adeconstructionist Someone who makes you an offer you cant understand Howcould the cause of liberal revival be served by making me sound like acharacter out of a David Lodge satire            Astrong desire to make economics less like ascience and more like literary criticism is a surprisingly common attribute ofantiacademic writers on the subject For example in a recent collection ofessays  Foundations of Research in Economics How do Economists doEconomics  edited by Steven G Medema and Warren Samuels            James KGalbraith a constant critic of the profession and a frequent contributor tothe American Prospect  urges economists to emulate vibrant humanitiesfaculties in which departments develop viciously opinionated inbredsometimes bitter and tyrannical but definitely exciting intellectual climatesEconomics in short would be a better field if the MIT economics departmentwere more like the Yale English department during its deconstructionistheyday            Academiceconomics the stuff that is in the textbooks is largely based on mathematicalreasoning I hope you think that I am an acceptable writer but when it comesto economics I speak English as a second language I think in equations anddiagrams then translate The opponents of mainstream economics dislike peoplelike me not so much for our conclusions as for our style They want economicsto be what it once was a field that was comfortable for the basically literaryintellectual            This should sound familiar More than  years ago thescientistturnednovelist CP Snow wrote his famous essay about the warbetween the two cultures between the essentially literary sensibility thatwe expect of a cardcarrying intellectual and the scientificmathematicaloutlook that is arguably the true glory of our civilization That war goes onand economics is on the front line Or to be more precise it is territory thatthe literati definitively lost to the nerds only about  years agoand theywant it back            That iswhat explains the litcrit style so oddly favored by the leftist critics ofmainstream economics Kuttner and Galbraith know that the quantitativealgebraic reasoning that lies behind modern economics is very difficult tochallenge on its own ground To oppose it they must invoke alternativestandards of intellectual authority and legitimacy In effect they are sayingYou have Paul Samuelson on your team Well weve got Jacques Derrida onours            A similar situation exists in other fieldsConsider for example evolutionary biology Like most American intellectualsI first learned about this subject from the writings of Stephen Jay Gould ButI eventually came to realize that working biologists regard Gould much the sameway that economists regard Robert Reich talented writer too bad he never getsanything right Serious evolutionary theorists such as John Maynard Smith orWilliam Hamilton like serious economists think largely in terms ofmathematical models Indeed the introduction to Maynard Smiths classic tractEvolutionary Genetics flatly declares If you cant stand algebra stayaway from evolutionary biology There is a core set of crucial ideas in hissubject that because they involve the interaction of several differentfactors can only be clearly understood by someone willing to sit still for abit of math Try to give a purely verbal description of the reactions amongthree mutually catalytic chemicals            But many intellectuals whocant stand algebra are not willing to stay away from the subject They arethus deeply attracted to a graceful writer like Gould who frequentlymisrepresents the field perhaps because he does not fully understand itsessentially mathematical logic but who wraps his misrepresentations in somany layers of impressive if irrelevant historical and literary eruditionthat they seem profound            Unfortunately Maynard Smithis right both about evolution and about economics There are important ideasin both fields that can be expressed in plain English and there are plenty offools doing fancy mathematical models But there are also important ideas thatare crystal clear if you can stand algebra and very difficult to grasp if youcant International trade in particular happens to be a subject in which apage or two of algebra and diagrams is worth  volumes of mere words That iswhy it is the particular subfield of economics in which the views of those whounderstand the subject and those who do not diverge most sharply            Alas there is probably noway to resolve this conflict peacefully It is possible for a very skillfulwriter to convey in plain English a sense of what serious economics is aboutto hide the algebraic skeleton behind a more appealing facade But that wontappease the critics they dont want economics with a literary facade theywant economics with a literary core And so people like me and people likeKuttner will never be able to make peace because we are engaged in a zerosumconflictnot over policy but over intellectual boundaries            The literati truly cannot besatisfied unless they get economics back from the nerds But they cant haveit because we nerds have the better claim
