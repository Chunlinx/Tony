Fruitful andMultiply by Steven E Landsburg makes no sense He argues thatrefraining from having a child may impoverish those who would have been yourchilds friends and mates But that wouldnt be the case if the parents ofthose potential children also refrained from reproducing Also there are over billion people on earth surely more than enough to provide everyone withpotential friends And one does not tend to encounter small acts of kindnessbetween strangers in overcrowded cities                           Chris Ryan                                       MakeLove Make War                        The article Be Fruitful andMultiply by Steven E Landsburg explores a key area in the search fornew directions in economics the connection to biology Unfortunately it islikely to sow considerable confusion by suggesting that an individual could orshould add value to humankind through additional reproduction            Reproduction is not guided by a moral imperative toward humanity as a whole butby a competitive struggle to pass on genes This includes the effort to giveones progeny the power to pass genes even further hence family namesmansions and monuments But as the species grows to fill its biological spacenature itself provides limiting forces like single lifestyles wars andfamines            Paul Kailor                           Steven ELandsburg replies Chris Ryan thinks that among the  billion people onearth he has more than enough friends Good for him Surely hes aware thatthere are others less fortunate Among all his many friends is there none forexample who has had difficulty finding a friend who will make a suitablemarriage partner            PaulKailor says that reproduction is not guided by a moral imperative towardhumanity That was exactly my point If they were guided by moral imperativespeople would have more children than they do In the absence of those moralimperatives theres a case for subsidizing reproduction                           FashionSense                         I was greatly encouraged tosee Michael Goffs proposal of a Microsoft fashionupgrade strategy titledDressing Up the Nerds The development of Microsoft FashionSense is long overdue and I for one would like to offer my services as avolunteer beta tester            I agree that your initialrampup strategy of having everyone wear more black is an excellent startingpoint It will be especially helpful to inexperienced FashionSense users manyof whom are likely to encounter usability issues related to thecolorcoordination decisionmaking process You may want to clarify howeverthat polar fleece is not a recognized attribute of FashionSense in anycolor            As you move through yourfirst product cycle you may also want to consider some of the followingadditional features or revisions             As Microsoft employeetime is at a premium and offsites are quite expensive you may wish to considerhaving Barneys perform weekly onsite seminars instead Preferably these wouldbe held between  and  pm to accommodate everyday activities such asfeature cutting server breakdowns office moves crossdivisional reorgs andthe like Right before ship dates these seminars could be held between  pmand midnight to provide additional convenience for employees attempting tofinish their daily tasks             You might want to addBirkenstocks to your list of footwear banned between Labor Day and MemorialDay Wearing Birkenstocks with dresses should be prohibited at all times             Small VR glassesheadsetswould make both a chic hightech alternative to sunglasses and provide userswith something additional to do during discussions of SQL server andODBCconnection failures             Increased revenuepotential may also be realized by leveraging existing Microsoft Moneytechnologies to create directdebit relationships between approved fashionvendors and Microsoft employees stock accounts            Thank youfor your attention to these suggestions I look forward to further statusreports of this products development and am certain that you will do a finejob in your implementation             KerryCarnahan                                       TootLiu                        I was impressed with EricLius article on AsianAmericans Feng Shui America With thecurrent demonization of AsianAmericans it was refreshing to find an informedAsianAmerican voice here            Afterhaving lived in Hong Kong for five years I was shocked upon my recent arrivalin New York While Asian influences are being bandied about there is clearly abacklash against AsianAmericans especially the Chinese Also allAsianAmericans like Latin Americans are effectively lumped into one group bymainstream America Its as blinding as saying that French German Englishand Spanish cultures are all alike I welcome more of what Slate has offeredthoughtprovoking and unsung viewpoints             AndrewIngkavet
