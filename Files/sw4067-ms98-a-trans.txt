                okay so what do you think about uh uh health care for the elderly   well ive got a mom who is uh eighty six years old this year and uh she she uh sometimes well she lived with us for a few years six actually six years and then she moved uh to live with my bother because she got tired of teenagers but uh in my house       uh i think health care for the elderly is uh is uh its kind of a difficult i say difficult i mean theres as your body is running downhill they can spend an infinite amount to keep you alive   right   and on the other hand its kind of nice uh if youre taking care of an elderly person to have somebody come along and pick up the the uh the tab the the one thing that that mom got into was that was pretty nice was an HMO they took all the money from from uh Medicare       how should i say it uh this HMO thing said uh had an agreement with Medicare that said uh on the average youre gonna spend X amount of dollars per year so if youll give us that money we promise to take care of of uh all the bills   all the bills does that include um nursing home type care   no this is just you know standard   just strictly health care   health care like youd get from your employer   right   and uh so at one point uh and and that was pretty good for her because uh there was a set of things that she knew she was covered for and uh and   right thats hundred percent coverage so its thats good   well it was close to a hundred percent there were things that they wouldnt cover but they like they bought her a uh   hm   a uh lets see they bought her a wheelchair and uh one one thing that was good about it was that it uh uh before that time she was always subject she shed have these salesmen that would call and say hey if youll just buy this handy dandy motorized uh easy chair for three times the the real price uh Medicare will pay for it and so she was always buying stuff that she didnt need   um   and then finding out that Medicare was either going to pay just a small fraction or no Medicare wouldnt pay for it   hm   so it kind of put the uh salesmen at bay put it that way   right so where does does she well um   so how about you   i guess in terms of where do you is your mother now in a a nursing home is   no shes still shes staying with my uh actually shes staying with my my brothers son whos doesnt have teenagers   right i guess thats the big question is um what what happens when they begin to get older i have a grandmother and it shes not really uh you know shes getting to the point where she almost cant be in a nursing home she spent some time with my parents some time now shes with an uncle of mine living with them   yeah   but she requires a lot of attention and she cant really exist on her own any longer       and thats thats kind of a difficult situation that that she has to live with one of her children   yeah it was difficult for us to because uh   well actually it it was all right as long as she could could get back and forth to the uh you know to the bathroom and things like that but when she got when she got really sick and she couldnt move very much then it was exhausting absolutely exhausting   right yeah   you know so   yeah my uh my grandmother is hers is physically shes in not too bad of shape shes in her upper eighties i guess forgetting in my order but uh shes uh Alzheimers i guess   oh yeah   and so her memory is very poor  and so she cant really be on her own but she can still do things by herself but you just have to uh kind of direct her   yeah uh and that  to that extent i think like i say this health care for the elderly is is uh i i think they do a lot there was one thing that that uh that helped pull my mom out of uh this oh i dont wanna know fog so to speak uh we had uh a a baby fairly late in life and uh as soon as that baby came along uh uh she paid a lot of attention to you know something to take care of ill put it that way and something to pay attention to and and uh   umhum   the other thing ive noticed is that that uh pets and and uh if they have pets to take care of uh like she got yeah she got uh   thats true
