                                 Frankensteins Minister            Many years ago the editorof this magazine who was then the editor of the New Republic  coined anaphorism for political influence peddlers who defended their shady methods onthe grounds that they didnt violate the law The scandal he observed isntwhats illegal but whats legal Since then politics has stagnated sciencehas exploded and the art of moral rationalization has mutated to suit the newenvironment In this world the game is redesigning human beings the stakesare ownership of the fountain of youth and the scandal is what passes asethical            Lastweek Sen Arlen Specter RPa and Sen Tom Harkin DIowa convened ahearing to examine the moral implications of two recent experimentsResearchers funded by one company Geron testified that they had taken stemcells from human embryos and fetuses and had grown them into neurons musclecells and other tissues Meanwhile the CEO of another company Advanced CellTechnology testified that by putting the nucleus of an adult human cell into acows gutted egg cell his researchers had converted it into an embryonic humancell which presumably could be manipulated in the same way As we learn tocontrol the pathways that take stem cells down the road to neurons bloodvessels and heart cells Gerons Vice President Dr Thomas Okarma testifiedwe can immortalize them by telomerase gene transfer so that sufficientquantities of these cells can be grown for transplant applications Old folksdegenerating organs would be repaired with young healthy and fullyfunctional cells And one of the first organs to be repaired in this way theresearchers promised would be the brain            All this sounds wonderful We can cure diseasesimmortalize cells and theoretically live forever without the nasty old moralproblem of harvesting fetuses But the prospect of a human spare partsindustry modeled on cooking farming and car repair raises a new moralproblem Human ingenuitya grand synthesis of agriculture manufacturing andinformation technologyis dissolving human nature            The ethicists who advisepoliticians and biotech firms cant comprehend the gravity of this step Likelawyers they dwell on details instead of the big picture While taking carenever to cross the line they ignore anything short of crossing it and theydont notice that the line is gradually receding They look for moral problemsin costs but never in benefits And they quarrel over yesterdays issues whilebeing overrun by tomorrows            For yearsbiotechnology ethics has been mired in the politics of abortion Since federallaw restricts research on fetal tissue and human embryos the debate over stemcells has focused on whether they are embryos and if not whether scientistsare killing embryos to get them The token biotech critic at last weekshearing Richard Doerflinger of the National Conference of Catholic Bishopsignored the novel implications of the latest experiments complaining insteadthat the researchers had destroyed embryos in the process Converselyprobiotech witnesses argued that the stem cells in the experiments were onlypluripotent capable of forming many tissues not totipotent capable offorming an entire body and therefore werent organisms or embryos The issuethat were dealing with said Harold Varmus the director of the NationalInstitutes of Health is complying with the law knowing the legal definitionof an organism            But this lawyerly parsing misses the largermoral challenge The distinction between organisms and nonorganisms iscollapsing In embryonic development totipotent cells ostensibly organismsdivide into pluripotent cells ostensibly nonorganisms which in turn divideinto cells that are committed to become specific tissues The differences intime and in degree of versatility can be subtle Moreover the coweggexperiment like the previous cloning of a sheep proved that the cycle isreversible Committed adult cells can be restored to embryonictotipotency            Theethicists who testified at the hearing were obtuse to this conundrum Theexecutive director of the National Bioethics Advisory Committee confessed thatin the course of discussing the stem cell experiments NBAC hadnt got aroundto the question of defining an organism Doerflinger the Catholic spokesmanwas so intent on asserting the unique personhood of totipotent cells that hedismissed pluripotent cells by contrast as nonorganisms Rather than confrontthe new moral questions raised by stem cell technologies the witnesses praisedthem for abolishing the old moral questions Banks of stem cells Varmusobserved would reduce the need for fetal donors The biotech executivescomments on ethics were even more diversionary Click for an example            The panels discussion of the cowegg experiment wasequally shallow Harkin quoted from a letter in which President Clinton hadsaid he was deeply troubled by this news of experiments involving the minglingof human and nonhuman species The senators joined Michael West the CEO whohad supervised the experiment in debunking this misinformation the cowsgenomic DNA was never mixed with the human DNA and deriding the halfbovinehalfhuman monsters drawn by editorial cartoonists as science fiction Westexplained that he had used the cow egg only to reprogram the human cellmaking it young again and restoring its ability to become any cell typeThe fake issue of mixing species thus obscured the genuine issue ofreprogramming            The otheroverhyped controversy that distracts ethicists from the real action is cloningThe notion of replicating whole human beings transfixes biotech alarmists Thisconcern like species mixing is easily dispelled We are not cloning humanbeings West testified at the hearing Indeed why manufacture whole peoplewhen theres more money in the parts business The horror moviescenariocloning your whole body freezing the clone and harvesting itsliver and kidneys when you need themdiverts scrutiny from the real scenariobanking your stem cells and growing them into new organs including braintissue a la carte            This erosion of the distinction between wholehumans and their partstechnicians will be able to tweak your cells eitherwaybrings into question the moral privileges we attribute to whole humanssuch as personhood and bodily integrity But no one broached these questions atthe hearing Instead as with abortion the panelists praised the newtechniques for solving the old questions Doerflinger happily argued that bydemonstrating other ways of deriving stem cells the new experiments had provedthat the cloning of whole embryos could be banned as Catholic scholars haveproposed without disrupting biotech research            Ethicists also have troublerecognizing the new issues because theyre trained to look for moral problemsin technologys costs not in its benefits Dr Arthur Caplan the onlyethicist at the hearing who betrayed any awareness of the new issues focusedinstead on the morality of tradeoffs We should seek to achieve the mostgood or benefit with the least harm and destruction of things that we valuehe argued But the benefits of the new technologiesultimately immortalityand the rewriting of the recipe for human beingsare precisely whatphilosophers ought to ponder Where are we going What are we becoming            Theimmediate threat posed by the unraveling of the old physical and moraldistinctionsbetween human beings and human parts organisms and nonorganismssubjects and objectsis that private interests will come to own the stuff ofwhich were made As the hearing ended Harkin expressed alarm that biotechcompanies were claiming licenses and patents to human stem cells He said thisconcern had to do with the law not with ethical and moral implications Butif ethics is relegated to peripheral and obsolete questions while industrydeconstructs redesigns and manufactures human components just like any othercommodity laws that exempt these components from patenting licensing andother property rights will lose their moral basis And critics who object thathuman life is sacred wont have a leg to stand on
