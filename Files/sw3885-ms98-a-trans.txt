        declined that San Francisco has more crime than Texas   than Plano Texas yeah i sure am     its a its a difficult question i dont know that i uh can easily come up with an answer to what can be done   i dont think there is an answer of what would make crime go away theres no such thing   i think probably drugs have a lot to do with crime in our society today so   yeah i think youre right have you ever had your house broken into   no no   i havent either   its its hard to know actually whether the crime um impact would be better or would would decrease or would increase if there were some changes in the way drugs are legislated i dont know if   yeah   i have uh an opinion yet about uh legalization of certain kinds of drugs but uhhuh boy theres certainly a lot connected with that you know   thats for sure   organized crime as well as   thats for sure   huh   ive never really been a victim of a crime and ive never had my car stolen or my house broken into or any of that so   well i guess   ive always lived in suburbs i dont know if that has anything to do with it or not but     yeah i grew up in a pretty small town and im not sure that um the size of the community or the general appearances safety really has as much to do with it because because youre seen as an enclave You might get hit by somebody from the outside anyway   yeah   um i guess on a on a local level uh i i was thinking when i heard the question about major changes in the country today but its probably a little easier now that i think about it if i look at what an individual could do and obviously       if you have lights on and you have uh uh a timing system for your lights in your own home youre going to reduce the risk of being broken into   right theres so many things that you can do in that way and you know going into parking lots with with your keys out being prepared you know being on the defensive   right right looking less like a victim   right   neighborhoods watching each other   yeah we have a neighborhood crime watch where i am where did you grow up   yes in a southern California suburb It was outside of Long Beach kind of near Huntington Beach   uhhuh yeah well my girls and i were just just down there this Christmas they play soccer and so we were down in that same area   oh really yeah     yeah   ive lived in San Francisco for about thirteen years now and um probably have learned by   but   uh indirect and direct experiences about things to do to you know avoid those kind of situations but i think part of its just as you grow   yeah   as you mature you you recognize um how to present yourself in a public situation so that you dont look like you are a victim a potential victim   thats right yep   its a hard thing to communicate to kids isnt it   it sure is do you have children   i have a two year old   yeah theyre not afraid of much at two   no no but you know as a child we were able to uh ride our bikes around the neighborhood and go to our friends and those are things that im not sure id be comfortable with when she gets to bike riding age you know     yep i can understand that you know as we were traveling back from that same toc soccer tournament i was telling you about we stopped in Mesa Arizona   uhhuh   and i was just amazed at the freedom that those kids felt they just dont have i mean even here in Plano Texas i worry when my kids walk you know a block   uhhuh   and we talked to some of our relatives there and they said you know we just dont worry about that there arent kidnappings and there arent there isnt that element here yet   thats interesting how large a community is that   um i dont really know  its not real big its right outside of Tucson   uhhuh and and Plano what would you say is the population   uh i dont know that either its   because sometimes its hard to you know i i look at small towns that have had problems with kidnappings and i think well the you know theyre not on the edge of some large metropolis Um you know its hard to even   yeah   look at the factors that influence that happening why why in that particular you know   why it would happen here and not there   uhhuh uhhuh   yep i guess you just have to kind of look for a family environment and and neighborhood and hope for the best you know and just   uhhuh do you find yourself teaching your children things that uh you you know that they need to do but you didnt have perhaps in the way of level of awareness at an early age   sure sure it and its so frightening because you have to teach them to be scared all the time   uhhuh       uhhuh how how do they respond to that when you tell them about kidnappings at what age were they ready for that   and to really be cautious   well they dont know any other way they dont know any other way i mean they werent raised when i was when you didnt worry about that everyone worries about that now so they just assume that youll always have to be on your guard   uhhuh how old were were they when you introduced that subject   and this oh real young i mean i can remember when my my oldest daughter is thirteen today and when she was just three i took her to the Sun Valley Mall do you know where that is   uhhuh huh   yeah i grew up there in Concord   uhhuh   anyway and um she had gotten lost and it started right then you know and every person i would see that had a little girl you know tucked under their arm id run you know   oh gosh a scary experience   to see if that was her oh yeah
