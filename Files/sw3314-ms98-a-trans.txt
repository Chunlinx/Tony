        what are some of the TV shows that you watch     um Major Dad the Monday night comedies on CBS like Major Dad  Murphy Brown is one of my favorites  for huh for some reason she reminds me a lot of myself  its just the writing i think the writing on thats real good   yes i love those   yes she is great i just love her uhhuh   it is   one i miss is uh Doctor Doctor   did you watch that one   i use we used to when it was on because i i thoroughly enjoyed it   uhhuh i didnt did you i guess i never really watched that one i guess by eight oclock im watching football   uh yeah i understand that  i do understand that no   with my husband so   yeah thats a big one in our house is Monday night football   uh uh yeah well he used to be before we got married but my husbands not a real big football person so my well he is if its Dallas and if theyre on TV but if its not then well watch anything else because he really likes Major Dad and and Murphy Brown and all those too   oh he isnt   right umhum well thats nice uhhuh and and uh whats the other one oh with the four women Designing Women yes i like that one   oh  uh Designing Women yes with the Sugarbakers i think thats one reason i named my daughter Julia  well that well and my great grandmothers name is Julia so we named her that too um   yes oh really oh thats great uhhuh yeah   do you have kids oh okay i was going to say because we also have to watch Dinosaurs on channel eight because oh not the mama not the mama   um no we dont believe me we do too  we do too yes i love that show its so cute   well when my two year old starts saying that its like okay we we know what hes been watching too for too long i just i   oh no yes no we watch that all the time we do its a good show  i like it and then we watch the Thursday night Cosby and uh um Cheers we watch all the time and   oh i like those i   thats fun but thats normally on Thursday nights we just kind of turn the TV off because neither one of us  really we usually either watch CBS on Monday nights and then the rest of the times its ABC its like oh well  we dont watch anything else fine oh   uhhuh okay uhhuh uhhuh yeah Thursday nights a big one in our house but um   uh we used to when NBC had no that was on Tuesday night um Matlock because i got my mom got me started watching that show just because she liked Andy Griffith so that was fun   okay uhhuh oh yeah my husbands a big like mystery watcher like the the late night Hunter and all those he really enjoys those   uhhuh uhhuh i like yeah i used to like it when Columbo and and all those were on and and Rockford Files but its like  gosh that seems like a long time ago   uhhuh well my husband really likes those  yeah they are and then were on were on a big one with uh Home Front   theyre fun theyre fun yes yes i like that  well no i guess you probably dont get to see Northern Exposure then if hes watching football on Monday nights   he thats a real good show sometimes i do if im at my sisters house she has two TVs   thats its its a real strange one its almost well its like Twin Peaks but funny   it is its its right   and we did we used to like to watch Twin Peaks for the first season it was like oh this is really neat   uhhuh   and then it got weird   yeah i and it was a show i never started watching until like one night i decided well they always say this is so weird lets lets watch it and see if we can get the hang of this   like real strange   uhhuh   huhuh i couldnt understand by the by the end of it i was just going now what did i just watch for the last hour     this this no no who did what yeah because its you really have to be dedicated we would like tape it and send the kids to bed say okay now we can watch this because you have to watch every scene to kind of figure out what its doing and it   uhhuh yeah because i was just like huh   even then its like huh       what   and then we got like the Time magazine because we used to order that and his face was on the front half distorted and half regular   uhhuh uh   and it kind of talked about Twin Peaks and i still just didnt understand what he was talking about  he was something else i just     it was a really really strange show but  its like well im sorry its gone but i really didnt got towards the end we didnt watch it at all anyway   yeah i think it got too strange because you couldnt pick up on it if you just yeah yeah i like the sitcoms   yeah give give me comedies ill Ill watch those i like those im yeah im a im a comedy kind of person   umhum i really do like just those half an hour sitcoms and that maybe a couple   yeah  well because yeah because you can like turn it off  you only have to watch half hour at a time   yeah and its not right and its always not um week after week and you have to watch every week and you can pick up something the next week and   uhhuh uh well unless its like you have kids and you have to watch Full House and you have to watch Dinosaurs and you have to watch Urkel on Friday nights and you  you know   right so you know my husbands a kid we have to watch Urkel yeah           i understand that did you did you happen to see it last night   yes   that was cute Pablo Pablo   where he where Carl killed his bug uh yes  oh yes   i was like its just a stupid bug   i know it it was it was something that that a four what was it six hundred dollar bug or four hundred dollar bug   yeah but i know i think it was four hundred and eighty something dollars s o they went to Citizens Court ooh ah   uhhuh but i did see Urkel regular he was on some show and he is hes a good looking kid he is a great kid yes   did you really huh without the glasses and the suspenders and   umhum he is dressed normal and acted normal he doesnt have that high voice and     but
