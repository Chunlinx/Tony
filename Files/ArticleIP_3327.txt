                                 The Net Net            I was jittery last weekWould he play or wouldnt he Would he or wouldnt he            By heI mean of course University of Kentucky basketball star Derek Anderson whoblew out a knee a few months ago The NCAA championship tournament had startedso I needed to know Would Kentucky coach Rick Pitino let Anderson return tothe court All day I combed sports Web sites for a rumor a hint a tea leafto read The more I looked the gloomier I got According to the SportsTicker Andersons rehabbed knee was stronger than hisundamaged one The Sporting News reported that Anderson had gone to practice Thenthe Sports Network quoted Pitino as saying Anderson had played betterin practice than anyone else on the team Finally bingo Pitino announced hewouldnt risk Andersons pro career for the sake of this years tournament            My Anderson frenzy might make sense if I were say acompulsive gambler whod pawned his fiancees engagement ring to wager againstKentucky But I have just  riding on the office tournament pool The onlyexplanations I can muster are that  I hate Kentucky basketballRick Pitinois so smooth its creepy and  this is the NCAA tournament the beall andendall for sports fanatics an event in which no fine point is too fine nominutia too minute            Where doesthis madness come from I could try to justify my tournament obsession as thenatural extension of my romance with college basketball I could sing hymns tothe majesty of The Game the monochromatic neversaydie fans the bandtrumpeting out the tuneful college song the slap of leather against pine            But that would be a lie I feel the same wayabout the Super Bowl the NBA Finals the pennant race the Masters Sportsjunkies hoard trivia for the same reason political junkies lock their remoteson CSPAN and Hollywood obsessives salivate over the Academy Awards pregameshow Power Trivia allows the junkie to master a small by definition trivialcorner of the universe We can explain the tournament you cantWe speak a private languageThe Big Dance PTP zone press subregionalsandyou dont The junkie watches a tournament game entirely differently than thecasual fan For the casual fan the game is art an aesthetic delight For thejunkie its science            Allsports junkies bore their friends with stories of their astounding predictionsTo this day I congratulate myself for picking lowseeded Louisville out of teams to win the  NCAA title I knew that Denny Crum was a greattournament coach that Pervis Ellison could dominate that Louisvillescompetition was weak What I rarely mention is that I failed to guess thechampion for the next eight tournaments Junkiedom does not require knowledgeso much as it requires the pretense of knowledge To really understandcollege ball you would need to spend most of the fall and winter watching BigSky conference games on satellite television and reading back issues ofInside Metro Conference Basketball             Until this year being an NCAAtournament devotee washarmless Read the sports section watch earlyround games until  amvideotape the highlights on the local news and fill out an entry for the poolThen the USA Today sports section came along adding to the load SoonESPN arrived and cable became a must But now the sports Web has arrived Thecocaine has become crack            Idiscovered this innocently on the opening day of the tournament I logged on toYahoo to searchfor scores I found a mindboggling array of sports Web sites Among commercialsites alone ESPNET SportsZone CBSs SportsLine SI Online the Sporting News Nandonet MSNBC USAToday MarchMadNET Alleyoopcomthe Sports Network and Yahoo itself were covering March Madness This is not tomention the NCAAsexcellent site and the  million pages maintained by fans colleges and localnewspapers            Ihave spent the last two weeks surfing the Netand I must report it is magnificent Sports Web sites are one of the Webs fewfinancial success stories and deservedly so The NCAA tournament is chaos teams play  openinground games at eight arenas in two days The frenzyoverwhelms traditional media Newspapers satisfy themselves with inchstories and box scores TV sportscasters rush through a highlight or two Thesports Web brings order to the anarchy Unrestricted by space the sites runmore articles and statistics than any newspaper and deliver more audio andvideo clips than any TV show Their online tournament pools operate better thanany office pool ever could and their fantasy sports leagues outshine anynonelectronic sports game Sports Web sites are category killers            ESPNETSportsZone is theRollsRoyce of the Web Like RollsRoyce it costs  a month If youdont want to pay you can view some of the site free SportsZone does notcover the tournament so much as carpetbomb it On March  for example Ivisited SportsZone to learn who won the UCLAIowa State roundof game whichhad ended too late to make the morning paper I immediately found a wire storyabout UCLAs overtime win That led me easily to a box score photographs agame summary halfadozen audio clips of postgame interviews a secondQuickTime movie of the Bruins running a fast break a comprehensive scoutingreport on both teams and an online chat room where Bruins fans were whoopingit up And every tournament game receives this treatment Nothingsucceeds like excess            Other sports sites pale next to SportsZone but they stilldemolish print and TV The Sporting News and CBSs SportsLine the other site that charges subscribers mirrorESPNs format but serve less less multimedia fewer columns fewer statsMSNBC USAToday and Yahoo behave more like wire services than the fullservice sitesThey post loads of newspaper articlesYahoo had almost  for onesecondround gamebut skimp a little on photos and gizmos SportsIllustrated  by far the bestwritten sports print magazine is moredisappointing online It prints too little original content and relies heavilyon poorly written wire copy I also found it slowloading and buggy            The SportsNetwork probably attracts more attention than it deserves Its slow uglyand textheavy but it delivers the one key morsel the big sports sites wontthe Vegas line SportsZone SportsLine et al practice the antigamblingpuritanism of TV which dumped its oddsmakers years ago But the Sports Networkposts Vegas odds from the Stardust and Mirage casinos no less It also advertises Intertopsa German online bookmaker In the spirit of unfettered investigativejournalism I tried to place a bet on Intertops but was completely flummoxedby its complicated logon            Still the gamblingfreesites are entertaining enough Fantasy basketball baseball and footballleagues are thriving on SportsLine SportsZone and the Sporting News At least halfadozen sites including all the major ones hosted free onlinetournament pools They were a breeze to entera few mouse clicks and apassword I signed up for all of them But instead of achieving power anddomination I suffered a mammoth blow to my junkie ego Entering Final Fourweekend I rank no higher than  th place in any of them
