                                 The Taste for Taboo                           NOTE This articlecontains links to images that many will find distasteful                        By CharlesPaul Freund                            words postedSaturday Oct                         At the height of the popmisery following Princess Dianas death one of Americas eminent historiansappeared on a PBS panel to discuss the meaning of it all Asked if the intensegrief would have any lasting results she suggested that it might affect thepublic approach to celebrity and predicted that the paparazzi accidentphotos then known to exist would never see the light of day Shed barelyfinished her prediction when the other panel members broke in Those pictureshad already been published they noted glumly The German tabloidBild had printed them that morning If you want to see the crash photothat appeared in Bild  click here and scroll down            The printing of such a photowas news in its own right Because Diana allegedly was hounded to her death byphotographers displaying or even looking at pictures of this kind wasinterpreted by commentators as venal an assault on Dianas memory if not anendorsement of the crime But tabloids like Bild are an old media modelnow the Internet soon kicked in with even more pictures overwhelming the newphotomoralism For a sampling of distasteful Internet offerings click             The Diana pictorial taboo andits underlying moralism turned out to be remarkably evanescent and a secondarymorality tale has arisen to explain why Its the Internets fault The newtechnology according to this view is a tool of cheap voyeurism capable ofsmashing public decency with unprecedented speed and efficiency But even ifone assumes a degree of voyeurism in the Diana case the charge misses thepoint Such imagery has long been a tool of popular grief in Americanculture            The fact is that thevery intensity of the reaction to Dianas death made the viewing of such photosmore likely not less so Photographys relationship with grief is an intimateone In the case of Diana that relationship seems to have played itself out infamiliar ways People sought out photos of her in deathincluding spuriousonesbecause she was important to them            We have always found waysexcuses if you liketo look atdocumentary images of violence and death Whatever our level ofacknowledgmenttabloid exploitation or elite refinementwe categorize suchimages intellectually and emotionally transforming appalling scenes intoobjects of sentiment pieces of evidence and even works of art Indeed thecathartic opportunities presented by such images whether sentimental oraesthetic have a long history of overwhelming any questions of documentaryvalue            At the high end of culturedeath imagery commonly becomes art especially in the case of war photographyGenerations have pondered Alexander Gardner and Timothy OSullivans justlyfamous photos of the dead at Gettysburg The battle ended these men liehauntingly in fields of stillness a harvest of death in Gardners ownphrase Click to see A Harvest  Yet students of these photos noticedsome time ago that the same corpses seem to show up in different places on thebattlefield and they concluded that the photographer had arranged the deadin order to achieve pleasing tableaux            One of the most famous of allphotographs is Robert Capas  Moment of Death  taken during theSpanish Civil War Click to see Moment  It presents a Republicansoldier as he is shot capturing what usually is interpreted as an instant ofnoble sacrifice In his  book The First Casualty  Phillip Knightleyexamines this picture and its history at length Paying homage to the great warphotographers courage and talent he nonetheless notes the conflicting storiesof the photos origins Capas own silence about the image in his writings andother writers questions Knightley carefully concludes only that thephotograph turns out not to be the clear and simple statement of fact that itotherwise appears Yet assume that this famous still was not portraying anact of slaughter Would it be a relief or a disappointment People see whatthey want in pictures Even in pictures of death            At the level of massinformation we readily grant ourselves permission to look at such imagesTerrible scenes of massacres bombings and the like are displayed almostdaily rotten dot comprovides constant updates on such atrocities To the degree that we regardthem as goads to compassion and involvement as in Bosnia or the Middle Eastshowing them is a purported moral good But it is easy to take this idea ofdeath imagery as important evidence and to expand it into an excuse thatlegitimizes the sort of voyeurism we have just seen in the Diana case            That is just what hashappened with a number of shocking images involving famous and beloved personsThe view of Robert Kennedy lying in a pool of his own blood has been reproducedregularly for almost  years with minimal objection or concern about hisfamilys feelings It is regarded as a valid news image but what does itreally tell us            Worse autopsy photographs ofJohn F Kennedy have been published in many books including some that havebeen best sellers If you really want to see the socalled death stareclick  The conceit of course is that careful scrutiny of these images mayreveal something important about JFKs assassination For that matter thedreadful Frame  of the Zapruder film with its cranial explosion may be oneof the mostreproduced images in recent decades            There is by now a wholegallery of such images many of them reproduced to illustrate conspiracynarratives Internet sites featuring Diana pictures frequently link to Dianaconspiracy sites For some Dianas pictures are also evidence of a deeperplot Even a Marilyn Monroe autopsy picture has been published under the sameguise Those willing to confront a startlingly changed Marilyn can click People find the excuse they need to see a photo Even the wrong excuse            Its easy to interpret this as popular depravity but thematter is not so simple Autopsy pictures common enough on the Internet arenot a popular genre nor are the death photos of just any famous peopleCrimescene photos of Nicole Brown Simpson notorious as her death was causedlittle stir The death images that have received the greatest attention havesomething important in common All of them are of people who have been subjectto popular hagiography people who are the publics most beloved figures Thebiggestselling American tabloid of all time was the National Enquirerissue that published pictures of a dead Elvis Now we have Diana            The emotional relationshipbetween grief and photography dates to the very birth of the camera in theVictorian period Americans of the last century surrounded themselves withphotographs of dead family members posed in their coffins a practice sowidespread as to be an important source of income for photographers Suchphotoscompiled in Michael Lesys Wisconsin Death Trip andelsewherenow appear macabre If you want to see one click  But we arelooking at them with detachment the emotionally cool state that Americansdeveloped after World War I            American Victorians werentcool They subscribed to a veritable cult of grief No home ever reaches itshighest blessedness and sweetness of love and its richest fullness of joy tillsorrow enters its life in some way wrote one minister quite typically in an family advice manual            Their attitude applied tobeloved public figures as well as to family memberswhich is precisely whydeath photographs of Abraham Lincoln were forbidden in the wake of his murderSecretary of State Edwin Stanton apparently concerned that a trade in suchimages would develop refused to allow any to be taken Given the intensity ofthe Lincoln hysteria Stanton surely was right            The proof is that over theyears several Lincoln death portraits surfaced after all They are ofcourse all spurious One can see four of them in Twenty Days  byDorothy Meserve Kunhardt and Philip B Kunhardt Jr You can see an enlargementof the two images below by clicking  These images have various origins andit is unclear whether they were posed misrepresented or innocentlymisidentified But the result is the same in any event At some point theywere accepted as authentic by people who esteemed the dead president and theywere treasured as such            People find the value theyseek in an image Even the wrong image That may be a pseudoDiana in thenotorious Internet picture but theres nothing new about such spurious imagesand nothing false about the emotions that have led so many people to look atthem
