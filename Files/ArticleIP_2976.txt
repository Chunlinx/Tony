                                 Judicial Restraint            For the voyeurespeciallythe prissy lawabiding voyeur such as mefew literary genres satisfy as muchas the prison memoir Some of this interest must undoubtedly be attributed tosweaty Chained Heat style sex fantasies But mostly the fascinationstems from a kind of armslength sadism What happens to someone stretched tothe psychological limit What happens when you go to hell            As aconsequence I was really looking forward to Sol Wachtlers memoirs If anyonecould describe the sickening plunge from respectability to degradation and ifanyone could learn something from the experience surely it would be Wachtlerwho fell as far and fast as anyone can In November  he was New Yorkstates chief judge and a rising star in the Republican party famed for hismonstrous ego his political ambition and his jousts with Gov Mario CuomoThen he was arrested for stalking his former mistress Joy Silverman andcharged with extortion interstate racketeering and blackmail among othercrimes Wachtler had written her harassing letters in the guise of a fictionalalter ego and mailed a condom to her young daughter The judge claimed mentalincapacitation Jilted by Silverman hed succumbed to a manic depression thatwas exacerbated by an addiction to prescription amphetamines Wachtler pledguilty to sending threats through the mail In September less than a yearafter hed presided over New Yorks Court of Appealsthe yearoldfirsttime offender began serving an month term in federal prison Now hehas published the story of his time inside After the Madness A Judges OwnPrison Memoir  It is quite an accomplishment Wachtler has managed to writean uninteresting book about prison life            The best modern prison memoirs The Autobiography ofMalcolm X  Jack Henry Abbotts In the Belly of the Beast  EldridgeCleavers Soul on Ice  and Nien Chengs Life and Death inShanghai are stories about an agony that yields redemption Each booktells roughly the same tale A corrupt society imprisons the narrator for aminor offense marijuana possession in Cleavers case juvenile delinquency inAbbotts capitalist roadism in Chengs The narrators defy the prisonauthorities The authorities visit every horror upon the narratorssexualassault beatings isolation psychological tortureat which point thenarrators harden They find a code to live byIslam for Malcolm black powerfor Cleaver a freaky Nietzscheanism for Abbott They become awesometerrifying  What happens when you go to hell You become stronger than thedevil himself                           Afterthe Madness  however has little such passion in that it is true to itstitle Its a memoir that carries almost no emotional punch Wachtler isneither hero nor villain hes not even a compelling character His descriptionof prison life overflows with clich The food is inedible the noise isunbearable the stench is unimaginable the bend and spread em searches areunendurable He supplies the requisite glut of cockroaches and the necessaryquota of vicious guards Wachtler spends pages and pages excusing hisbehaviorhe was depressed he was addicted he never intended to harm anyoneetcbut even here his tone is oddly flat To his credit Wachtler does notignore the rich ironies of his situation After the Madness is sprinkledwith his awkward encounters On one occasion he meets a fellow con whose appealhe denied On another Wachtler wearing his stained tattered prison uniformis paid a visit by Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun            Perhaps the blame for After the Madness belongs tothe legal profession It may be a problem of judicial restraint Great prisonwriting is mimetic It reads like going to prison feelssuffocating and alienand frightening Consider this passage from In the Belly of the Beast  afarrago of paranoia and violence            The first prisoneramiddleaged convictwho tried to fuck me I drew my knife on I forced him tohis knees and with my knife at his throat made him perform fellatio on myflaccid penis in front of three of his partners            This is the way it isdone If you are a man you must either kill or turn the tables on anyone whopropositions you with threats of force            Comparethis vivid lunacy to a passage from After the Madness             One would assume that nowthat my depression manic behavior and causal toxicity caused by the drugs Iwas taking have been evaluated and confirmed by the governments own medicalexperts here at Butner prison there would be some understanding by thepublicnot forgiveness but some understanding That will not happen Therewill always be those who will refuse to accept the fact that a person canfunction in what appears to be a normal fashion in his or her job and stillsuffer from a mental disorder                           Afterthe Madness reads like going to court feels            At the level of policy Wachtler has written a fine book aworthy dissertation on the American penal system He is much more heartfeltabout prison reform than about Wachtler reform He spends a month in the holethen chastises his fellow judges for not considering solitary confinement acruel and unusual punishment He befriends a cocaine user doing hard timethen sermonizes about the idiocies of mandatory minimum sentences Hisblockmate confesses to robbery Wachtler takes the occasion to celebrate theMiranda warning His tales work by accretion After  pages and  months inprison Wachtler has made a persuasive case for penal reform to freenonviolent criminals scrap drug laws fund prison education and trainingprograms and more The old joke is true What do you call a Republican whosbeen to jail A Democrat            After I finished this worthyand dull book a distressing thought came to me Its banality might be thefault neither of the judge nor of the legal profession Maybe Wachtler writesclichs because prison has become clich A generation ago even  years agojail was as alien as Mars A month in the hole a cockroach infestation thestench of mystery meatthese were topics that would revolt broadmindedreaders Who knew that fellow citizenseven the scummy onesendured suchhorrors            The bleakest lesson ofAfter the Madness is perhaps that prison has lost its capacity to shockMore than a million Americans are in jail todayfive times as many as in In some communities though not the rich Long Island ones where judges live aprison term has become almost a rite of passage something that young men doWe are inundated with prison pop culturewith directors documentarians TVproducers and writers who have gone up the river and returned with tales ofrapes and cavity searches and shanks and pigs A generation ago Abbottsbook was hailed as a landmark a visionary expos Today such a booknot thatWachtler has written onewould be greeted with a shrug
