              kids too   yeah   the hat   oh you laugh how many what ages   well uh twenty seven up   ah   and we had five   youve been through the fun part     oh yeah          and how about yourself   i have a four and a half and a three   oh well   so its i im sure theres a lot of differences in the way in the way its done now and then   yeah well when mine were growing up i did some traveling and but not that extensively but i always uh just made it a point you know to spend about ten minutes with each one of them   yeah   so it was an hour you know   yeah   but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever telling them stories or reading to them but   what was the age difference between the oldest and youngest   six years   so they were all real close thats tough thats a lot of time   yeah oh yeah we look back and wonder how we did it   did you both work your wife too or   no she never did   uh well qualify that she worked at home im sure   and well yeah yeah   but thats uh well both my husband and i work and sometimes i feel like you know by the time i pick them up and get them home and get them fed i have very little time each evening maybe thirty minutes max   yeah well thats plenty though   And well he spends a lot of time with them while im cooking and then i spend time with them while you know hes doing other stuff and and of course we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend you know theres a lot of times my house may not be as clean as i particularly like it but its neat its straight and i can live with it because i do stuff with my kids you know   right right well you you know with kids youre not going to have a neat house   well ive accepted that too  thats true     and you know it its tough to find time especially especially especially with both of them working   it is yeah thats true   and you just have to set the time and say okay this is gonna be it   well thats true and and we do a lot of that on the weekends you know we try to spend Saturdays together if my husband golfs you know hell do it during nap times things like that where theyre not really missing the presence you know   right right   and we do a lot of family things together were were kind of going the other direction this weekend were planning a trip just he and i this is the first time weve gone anywhere without the kids since she was born four and a half years ago so   well thats good too yeah thats good that way too   well i decided that you know you need that once in awhile that you you need to plan the quality time and and i do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you dont have to be there twenty four hours a day     yeah well thats what they say it it all it takes is about five ten minutes a day   but yeah   and you know and as the kids got older i made them you know help me cut the grass and kind of made that a project too   sure sure   or whatever and   and they think thats a family activity you know yeah thats great fun   oh yeah and uh well yeah if you   my daughters like mommy can i help you with the laundry of course you can  absolutely yeah   yeah just keep them talking that way but uh another thing we used to do is have  family councils   uhhuh   every Sunday night   and what would you do what     discuss everything that didnt agree with them and wed take turns being president   oh   and everyone would get ones vote and i always thought wed get outvoted five to two   yeah   but it never worked that way   so they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a head that week and then   yeah well and we could bring up and we could bring up stuff too   oh   and that was always good time boy we really got to know the kids well   hum i imagine and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them   and oh yeah in fact they were all in uh over the weekend for Easter   i oh thats wonderful see i was raised in that type of family where you know you dont disobey me you mind me but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it you can always come back and talk to me about it yeah   well we did too and and i remember the one daughter saying we had a a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree   uhhuh   and she said hey i dont make fun fun of your friends so why make fun of mine     well   kind of run kind of hit us between the eyes   yeah yeah you dont think of it that way do you   no but that that was always good quality time for us   now thats good i like that idea   and they never had to attend but if if they missed it they had to abide by the rules   whatever was voted on huh   yeah and boy theyd theyd show up   well i think thats great   and wed usually take notes and you know the younger kids uh   yeah   or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another   yeah   and uh        but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us and they loved it      i i think thats true i can remember times my parents would say well what do you think would be a fair punishment   yeah   and we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done you know so i do think its right that theyre harder on themselves you know   yeah yeah but uh boy i i feel for you and your husband well yeah my my uh   oh why is that   two of my uh
