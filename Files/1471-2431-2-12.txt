                    Background        Mitochondrial cytopathies are a heterogeneous group of        disorders that can affect almost all organ systems        reflecting ATP depletion Neuromuscular disorders were the        first to be studied and direct evidence of mitochondrial        DNA mtDNA abnormalities was demonstrated in              However only  of the patients suspected of having        mitochondrial disorders have been found to have mtDNA point        mutations or deletions     Most pediatric mitochondrial        disorders are caused by defects in nuclear genes and with        an autosomal recessive inheritance     This case of        neonatal mitochondrial dysfunction presenting with        hyperammonemia and ventricular tachycardia expands the        clinical spectrum of these disorders                    Case presentation        We report the case of a  dayold neonate with unusual        presenting features of a mitochondrial cytopathy and a        unique clinical course She was born at term after an        uncomplicated pregnancy to healthy unrelated parents of        Northern European descent with a negative family history        On her first day of life she was noted to be lethargic        and was feeding poorly Persistent hypoglycemia        hypothermia and seizures precipitated her transfer to the        neonatal intensive care unit On physical exam she was        found to be a nondysmorphic term female Birth weight was         grams  thcentile length was  cm         thcentile and head circumference was  cm  thcentile        Significant findings on her physical exam included a        distended abdomen with hepatomegaly and hypotonia Tests        for bacterial and viral infections were ultimately        negative The patient was noted to have hypoglycemia         mgdl with a small amount of ketones in the urine She had        an elevated ammonia level of  molL normal range         lactic acid of  mmoll normal range         elevated transaminases with an alanine aminotransferase of         UL normal range  an aspartate aminotransferase        of  UL normal range  and hypothermia with        deteriorating neurological condition She was subsequently        treated with intravenous glucose Sodium benzoate sodium        acetate and arginine hydrochloride were administered        intravenously to treat her hyperammonemia that eventually        responded twentyfour hours after initiation of therapy In        view of her hyperammonemia she was placed on a        proteinrestricted diet  gkgday at  days of age Her        neurologic status improved steadily after her        hyperammonemia was controlled Brain MRI was reportedly        normal Electroencephalogram demonstrated diffuse        encephalopathy Her initial presentation with        hyperammonemia prompted a genetics consult Plasma amino        acid analysis showed an elevated alanine of  molL        normal range  with no other abnormalities        Measurement of carnitine levels showed no evidence of        carnitine depletion However tandem mass spectrometry of        acylcarnitines revealed a slightly elevated        propionylcarnitine of  M normal range M that        was not to the extent seen in organic acidemias        Quantitative analysis of urine organic acids by gas        chromatographymass spectrometry exhibited elevated levels        of methylglutaconic MGC acid of  mmolmol of        creatinine normal range and methylglutaric MGR        acid of  mmolmol of creatinine normal range with a        normal level of hydroxyisovaleric acid of  mmolmol of        creatinine normal range making the diagnosis of type        I MGC aciduria less likely Her urine orotic acid was        mildly elevated at  nmoles orotic acidmg creatinine        normal range nmoles orotic acidmg creatinine        At  days of age she developed premature ventricular        contractions that were immediately followed by sustained        ventricular tachycardia that eventually responded to        treatment with blockers Initial workup did not reveal        any evidence of a cardiomyopathy A skin biopsy was        performed to rule out carnitineacylcarnitine translocase        deficiency and other fatty acid oxidation disorders At         days of age the proband was noted to have a heart murmur        and an echocardiogram revealed at that time hypertrophic        cardiomyopathy with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy        and a left ventricular shortening fraction of  Her        special diet was discontinued prior to discharge since the        results of plasma amino acids urine organic acids and        urine orotic acid did not support the possible diagnoses of        a primary urea cycle disorder or organic acidemia as the        etiology of her hyperammonemia Carnitineacylcarnitine        translocase deficiency or other type of fatty acid        oxidation disorder was suspected because of her initial        presentation Once on full feeds a trial off sodium        benzoate sodium phenylacetate and arginine resulted in        maintenance of her ammonium levels below  molL The        patient was discharged at sixteen days of age on full        breast milk feeds and a blocker        Fibroblasts were incubated with palmitate labeled with        deuterium and Lcarnitine and fatty acid oxidation studies        with an         in vitro probe were conducted Normal        levels of labeled intermediates were observed from C to        C without evidence for translocase deficiency or any other        type of fatty acid oxidation disorder At two months of        age she was mildly hypotonic on a follow up evaluation and        the diagnosis of a possible mitochondrial cytopathy was        suspected Because of a suspicion of a possible        mitochondrial disorder the activities of pyruvate        dehydrogenase pyruvate carboxylase and mitochondrial        respiratory chain enzyme activities complexes IIIV were        tested in fibroblasts with normal results Ophthalmologic        and audiologic evaluations were normal Her urinary organic        acid profile remained unchanged in the fasting and        postprandial states Over a period of four years the        patient was admitted several times for recurrent Reyelike        syndrome episodes triggered by viral illnesses and        decreased oral intake Though one of these episodes was        associated with cardiac arrest at two years of age she        always responded well to treatment without apparent        neurological sequelae At  months there was a concern        about possible failure to thrive nevertheless her current        growth and development at seven years of age have been        adequate The proband has developed a clinical course        characterized by increasing tolerance to fasting and        illness without further episodes of metabolic        decompensation At seven years of age she has exhibited        fatigue exercise intolerance and palpitations as the main        features of abnormal mitochondrial energy metabolism No        episodes of sustained ventricular tachycardia have been        documented recently Her cardiomyopathy has improved and        the results of her last echocardiogram showed mild left        ventricular hypertrophy and a left ventricular shortening        fraction of                     Methods                  Muscle biopsy          A muscle biopsy was performed at  months of age          during a hospitalization for a Reyelike syndrome          episode to further pursue the workup of a mitochondrial          disorder Cryostat sections of flash frozen muscle were          stained with hematoxylin and eosin the modified Gomori          trichrome stain and for succinate dehydrogenase          cytochrome c oxidase activity reduced nicotinamide          adenine dinucleotide NADH dehydrogenase and adenosine          triphosphatase ATPase activities at pH  and           Muscle was also fixed in glutaraldehyde for electron          microscopy                          Respiratory chain enzyme analysis          Respiratory chain enzymes were measured in           homogenates using previously described methods as          follows NADH dehydrogenase     NADH cytochrome c          reductase     succinate dehydrogenase

     MtDNA mutation analysis          MtDNA from blood and skeletal muscle was extracted and          analyzed for mtDNA point mutations deletions or          duplications by multiplex polymerase chain          reactionallele specific oligonucleotide PCRASO dot          blot hybridization and Southern blot analysis          Quantitative evaluation of mtDNA content was performed in          skeletal muscle by Southern blot and Real Time          quantitative PCR analyses     To look for unknown          mtDNA mutations the entire mitochondrial genome was          screened by temporal temperature gel electrophoresis          TTGE on motherchild pair followed by sequencing of          the DNA fragments that exhibited different banding          patterns between mother and child                            Results                  Muscle biopsy          Gomori trichrome stain revealed ragged red fibers          Figure  Electron microscopy showed concentric          arrangements of

mitochondrial respiratory chain          enzymes although mostly below the normal mean was          within the normal range in skeletal muscle with moderate          increase  in the activity of

          Quantitative mtDNA analysis          Quantitative evaluation of mtDNA content in patients          muscle specimen revealed no evidence of mtDNA          depletion                          TTGE and MtDNA sequencing          A homoplasmic TC nucleotide substitution was          detected in this patients blood and muscle and it was          also detected on the probands mother and on two half          siblings Both mother and child were found to have two          common polymorphisms in homoplasmic state GA and          AG An obvious difference was found in the Dloop          region where AG was present in the proband in a near          homoplasmic state and homoplasmic wild type A was          present in the probands mother A novel germline          variation  insCCCCC was present in both mother          and the proband Four mtDNA regions that did not          exhibited any difference between mother and probands          mtDNA on TTGE analysis nucleotide position  to            to   to  and  to  were          sequenced The results confirmed the presence of TC          polymorphism in both mother and the proband No other          mutations in these regions including the  point          mutations reported in patients with cardiomyopathy as          stated above were detected                            Discussion                  Reyelike syndrome episodes          Reye syndrome a disorder of unknown cause is          characterized by acute encephalopathy and fatty          degeneration of the liver and it is usually characterized          by a history of preceding viral illness or the use of          aspirin during viral infections     Many children          with metabolic disorders present with Reyelike syndrome          episodes usually at a young age andor with a positive          past or family history suspicious for an inborn error of          metabolism     It has been reported as a presenting          sign of type I MGC aciduria and in a few cases of          mitochondrial cytopathies in older children               However in the neonatal period a Reyelike episode is          not a typical presenting feature of a mitochondrial          cytopathy                          Cardiac involvement in mitochondrial          diseases          Inborn errors of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation          should be considered in infants with conduction defects          or ventricular tachycardia In  children with inherited          disorders of fatty acid oxidation conduction defects or          arrhythmias were the predominant presenting feature              Arrhythmias in association with hepatomuscular          symptoms and hyperammonemia have also been demonstrated          in cases of carnitineacylcarnitine translocase          deficiency whose presenting features also include          neonatal distress convulsions hypoglycemia          hypoketonemia intermittent dicarboxylic aciduria          hypothermia apnea neurological deterioration and          hypocarnitinemia with grossly elevated acylcarnitines              The accumulation of arrhythmogenic metabolites of          fatty acids such as long chain acylcarnitines may be          responsible for the observed lethal cardiac defects          Cardiac conduction disturbance has also been recognized          in the mitochondrial cytopathy KearnsSayre syndrome          Mendelian inheritance in Man database           characterized as progressive external ophthalmoplegia and          retinopathy     Clinical manifestations of cardiac          disease occur in  of patients with KearnsSayre          syndrome     The complete AV block in KearnsSayre          syndrome may also be associated less commonly with          ventricular tachycardia torsade de pointes and          ventricular fibrillation as the ultimate and often fatal          stage of the condition     However to our          knowledge ventricular tachycardia as a presenting          feature has not been described in the context of          mitochondrial cytopathies in the neonatal period                          Causes of MGC aciduria in children          MGC aciduria is a rare hereditary organic aciduria          characterized by increased urinary excretion of MGC and          MGR acids At least  distinct clinical forms          associated with MGC aciduria have been described              Type I MGC aciduria Mendelian Inheritance in Man          database  due to MGC CoA hydratase EC           deficiency has a relatively benign clinical          course including speech delay and macrochephaly type II          MGC aciduria Barth syndrome Mendelian Inheritance in          Man database  has a clinical picture that          includes cardiomyopathy recurrent infections          neutropenia short stature and normal cognitive function          and is caused by mutations in the tafazzin gene G              type III MGC aciduria Costeff optic atrophy          syndrome Mendelian Inheritance in Man database           was described in patients of IraqiJewish origin with          bilateral optic atrophy accompanied in some by movement          disorders and caused by mutations in the OPA gene               and type IV MGC aciduria Mendelian Inheritance          in Man database  presents with moderate to severe          neurological disease cardiac ophthalmic hepatic and          renal symptoms and it has been associated with          mitochondrial disorders Pearson syndrome mitochondrial          DNA depletion or multiple respiratory chain defects                 This group does not have a defined primary          biochemical or molecular defect Our patient would fit in          this latter clinically heterogeneous group although the          degree of elevation of MGC seen in other cases could be          as high as  mmolmol of creatinine Barth syndrome a          cause of MGC aciduria and cardiomyopathy would be an          unlikely diagnosis in our patient primarily due to          absence of symptoms in female carriers secondary to          presumed skewing of Xinactivation and lack of growth          retardation and neutropenia We suspect that her organic          aciduria is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction It          has been speculated that an abnormality of translocation          of MGC acid across the mitochondrial membrane may be          the source of MGC aciduria in these patients              The link between MGC aciduria and mitochondrial          dysfunction may involve failure of mitochondrial uptake          of MGC acid or potentially defective ubiquinone          biosynthesis leading to increased levels of mevalonate in          the mevalonate shunt pathway with subsequent increased          synthesis of MGC acid                              MtDNA mutation analysis          Although there is no direct proof of a respiratory          chain RC defect in our patient mitochondrial disorders          cannot be ruled out as normal RC activities have been          occasionally reported in muscle samples from clinically          affected patients with proven mtDNA mutations or          mutations in nuclear genes that impact mitochondrial          function       Respiratory chain activity          studies on endomyocardial biopsy would be helpful Since          no primary deleterious mtDNA mutation has been found in          the proband and she was born to healthy parents with          unremarkable family history we hypothesize that the          etiology of her mitochondrial dysfunction could reside in          a still unidentified nuclear gene defect although          secondary mitochondrial dysfunction caused by an unknown          inborn error of metabolism cannot be excluded completely          At the present time the TC nucleotide substitution          is considered a polymorphism and it is not thought to          have pathogenic significance by itself     Although          most pathogenic mutations are heteroplasmic many          homoplasmic mutations have been reported to have          synergistic effects in the presence of other primary          mutations      The only difference in mtDNA          between the affected child and the asymptomatic mother is          the AG mutation in the hypervariable Dloop region          The AG has been reported as a polymorphism in Mitomap          database     Whether this alteration would affect          mtDNA replication or transcription is not known A          remarkable finding was the novel  insCCCCC          present in both mother and proband This region contains          a stretch of  cytosines Cs in the wild type The          insertion of  Cs results in a long polyC tract The          polyC tract is located next to the mitochondrial          transcription factor  mtTF binding site and the major          Hstrand promoter sequence It is not clear if the length          of this poly C stretch would influence promoter activity          or mtTF binding thus the transcription of          mitochondrial RNA Further investigations are necessary          to define the clinical significance of the homoplasmic          mtDNA alterations found in the proband and to know          whether they may act as secondary mutations          synergistically with a primary defect either nuclear or          mitochondrial that could affect the mitochondrial          function and result in this clinical condition                          Orotic aciduria and abnormal acylcarnitine profile          as potential markers of mitochondrial disease          It has been reported before that an increased          excretion of orotate in sick children may not be uncommon          and that a positive allopurinol load test may indicate          unrecognized mitochondrial disease making orotic acid as          a potential marker of mitochondrial dysfunction              A potential link between mitochondrial cytopathies and          urea cycle dysfunction has also been suggested by the          findings of hypocitrullinemia in patients with neurogenic          weakness ataxia and retinitis pigmentosa NARP syndrome          Mendelian Inheritance in Man database  caused by          a TG mutation in mtDNA that triggers ATPase          deficiency      It was hypothesized that the NARP          mutation would cause complex V deficiency in the small          intestine as well thus reducing the availability of          mitochondrial ATP required for citrulline synthesis The          presence of mild increase in the urinary excretion of          orotic acid in this patient could also suggest          mitochondrial dysfunction convalidating this          hypothesis          It has been noticed that if a patient is suspected of          having a mitochondrial disease abnormal carnitine esters          may help with the diagnosis    and abnormal          acylcarnitine profiles do not exclusively indicate fatty          acid oxidation disorders     Although the abnormal          carnitine ester present in the proband is elevated in          organic acidemias and is not usually present in          mitochondrial cytopathies we speculate that due to          compromised ATP synthesis secondary alterations may be          generated in these patients by changes in mitochondrial          protein synthesis decrease in Krebs cycle intermediates          and increased free radical formation that could be          responsible for a secondary impairment of mitochondrial          biotin dependent carboxylases but further elucidation is          necessary before we could arrive to a conclusion in this          regard                            Conclusions        Although alterations in mitochondrial morphology do not        necessarily reflect welldefined mitochondrial disorders        and we cannot completely exclude the possibility of an        unknown metabolic disorder with secondary mitochondrial        dysfunction we speculate that all the clinical        biochemical and histological features in the proband can be        attributed to disturbed mitochondrial energy metabolism We        suspect that this probands MGC aciduria reflects a        defect in mitochondrial energy metabolism and that her mild        orotic aciduria may be a nonspecific marker of        mitochondrial dysfunction Mitochondrial cytopathies are a        group of disorders that are clinically heterogeneous with        variable forms of presentation We conclude that        ventricular tachycardia in association with a Reyelike        syndrome episode in the neonatal period may suggest        mitochondrial dysfunction and that the investigation of a        mitochondrial cytopathy may be warranted in this clinical        scenario Our patients neonatal presentation and        relatively mild clinical course broadens the heterogeneous        spectrum of clinical phenotypes
