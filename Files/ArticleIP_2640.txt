                                 Viacoms Shortsighted Search for Synergy            Visions of multimediasynergy dance in Sumner Redstones head Redstone is CEO of media conglomerateViacom Film Paramount television MTV and Nickelodeon videoBlockbuster books Simon  Schuster Viacom owns them all and Redstonekeeps believing that someday they will all work as one Imagine a bestsellingnovelization of a hit film based on the MTV series The Real World  afilm that then becomes the No selling videotape at Blockbuster and you getsome sense of the oasis that Redstone keeps glimpsing just over the next sanddune            In thepast Viacoms dogged pursuit of media synergy led it to overpay for everythingfrom Paramount Studios to Blockbuster and burdened it with a debt load worthyof a small nation It also led Viacomat a time when corporate America wascasting doubt on the conglomerate model and stressing the virtues of playing tocore strengthsto cling to the things it bought with a discomfitingtenacity            The announcement that Viacom wanted to sell S  Sseducational and professional divisionstextbooks computer books professionalbooks and reference booksthen came as something of a welcome surprise atleast to Viacom stockholders Although the divisions were profitable moreprofitable in fact than S  Ss trade division they didnt fit verywell with Redstones idea of the company More importantly when Viacom startedtalking about getting as much as  billion for the divisions and using themoney to cut its debt in half the words fiscal responsibility suddenlysounded less improbable than they once had There remains a great deal ofskepticism in the media about whether Viacom can get its price but S  Sseducational and professional divisions are the largest in the world and thedivisions have done adequately under a company for which they were but anafterthought In the hands of a company with a real investment in publishinglike Reed Elsevier or McGrawHill they have the potential to be cash cows            Potentially a winwin deal all around Perhaps Still its odd that Viacomwent public with its plans before lining up a prospective buyer As one companysource points out saying Im really anxious to sell Make me an offer ishardly the best strategy if youre looking to drive a hard bargain Its also alittle surprising that Viacom has chosen to sell in  rather than takingadvantage of the big tax savings that the law provides had the company waited ayear and then spun off the publishing assets into a separate company ButRedstones desire to remake the companyand to placate shareholders who havebeen disenchanted with Viacom for two years nowoutweighed taxconsiderations            Whats most interesting about the deal is thatViacom will be holding on to the rest of S  S Book publishing is notgenerally a highprofitmargin business and its also not as jazzy astelevision or the movies The decision to keep S  S only makes sensethen in the context of Redstones synergistic hopes Viacom he says is nowgoing to focus on softwaredriven entertainment which is the inelegant sway of saying that Viacom wants all its divisions to be oriented towardmassmarket entertainment And he points to the success of the new MTV andNickelodeon book imprints and of books tied to Paramount film releases asevidence that the companys parts add up to a stronger whole            But thefact that S  S publishes books based on MTV serieslike the dreadedReal World booksisnt in and of itself evidence of any real synergyAfter all even if some other house published these books MTV would reap thebenefits of licensing royalties etc And Viacom wouldnt have to worry aboutwhat happens when that next Road Rules book tanks Similarly publishingbooks based on your own movies is a great idea when the movies are doing wellBut if you put out a few boxoffice duds publishing books based on those dudsmeans you pay for the failures twice            Real synergy in other words only happens when you areable to take lessons from one business and apply them to another If Viacomwere using its Nickelodeoninduced expertise in appealing to the yearoldsmarket to sell childrens books better or taking what its learned from MTV tomake readers out of disgruntled teenagers the idea of synergy would make moresense Now its possible that this is in fact happening behind the scenesBut if it is no one at S  S seems aware of it            Actuallyat this point no one at S  S is sure that theyre aware of anythingViacom got S  S when it bought Paramount but it wanted Paramount not abook company And even though S  S is probably the most profitable tradepublisher in America the book market is essentially a stagnant one at leastin terms of profits Many people there imagine that the trade division will bethe next to go The joke going around S  S these days is that MorganStanley which is handling the sale for Viacom told Viacom that it could get billion to  billion if the trade division were included and  well billion to  billion if the trade division werent included            The problem with this analysis is that itassumes that the book industry is somehow in worse shape than the rest of theentertainment industry This assumption seems intuitively rightwe no longerlive in a print culture rightbut theres actually very little evidence toback it up The weird thing about the American economy in fact is that at atime when massmarketed leisure and entertainment are supposedly more and moreimportant to our economic wellbeing the entertainment industry as a whole isbarely growing at all If as The XFiles would have it were now ruledby a militaryindustrialentertainment complex the entertainment part ofthat complex needs to take some quick lessons in management and profit growthfrom its two partners            On theface of it this seems crazy David Geffen Michael Eisner Steven SpielbergSumner Redstone These are among the most prominent faces of the New EconomyThey end up on the cover of Vanity Fair and Wired  Theyforeshadow the world in which were all either symbolic analysts or hamburgerflippers But look at the numbers Last year the music industry saw salesdecline slightly Movie attendance was down Trade publishers sold  percentfewer books than they did the year before And the audience for cabletelevision seems to have plateaued at around  percent of all US householdswhile viewership of the major networks has of course continued to drop Iseveryone watching videos instead Hardly Video rentals dropped  percent in which is part of the reason that Blockbuster is only worth about halftoday of what Viacom paid for it in             None of this is to say that there arent successfulentertainment companies although the short list would probably include onlyDisney Si Newhouse Jrs Advance Publications and perhaps CBS because of itsradio business But these individual successes cant disguise the very curiousreality that were living in a world that is somehow saturated by the mediawithout actually paying all that much attention to it For most Americancompanies today success depends on selling more of your product next year thanyou did this year But if American entertainment companies can sell as much oftheir product next year as they did this year they should count themselveslucky If you want to know what a real myth is dont bother with synergy Justlook at the entertainment industrys selfimage instead
