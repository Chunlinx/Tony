                                 Round One ABC News  Metabolife             Chatterbox finally logged on to Metabolifes up yours  Web site Asexplained in previous items see Metabolifes Lawyer Assures Cbox He Wont Sue and Metabolife Read This No Wait Dont Read This Metabolife feltillused by  s Arnold Diaz when he interviewed its chief executiveofficer Mike Ellis about the safety and efficacy of Metabolifes popularherbal diet pills So the company put an unedited videotape of the interviewmade by Metabolifes technicians with an audio feed from ABC on a specialWeb site andinvited consumers to compare that with  s report which has yet toair            Chatterbox believes the behavior of the press merits no less scrutiny thanthe behavior of companies like Metabolife Therefore he declines to join ABCNews in its whiny denunciation of Metabolifes attempt to turn the tablesHowever now that Chatterbox has examined Metabolifes annotated transcript ofthe  interview Chatterbox lacked the patience to download thevideo he is ready to pronounce the opening round of this publicrelationsbattle  a victory for ABC News            Before proceeding Chatterbox needs to state a few caveats  Chatterboxwent into this with no knowledge and no opinion about the safety and efficacyof Metabolifes herbal drug supplement  Chatterbox knows a little more nowthat hes read the transcript but not enough to render a reliable judgment onwhether Metabolife is safe and effective  Chatterbox obviously cant judgethe fairness of a  episode that hasnt aired yet the best he cando right now is try to evaluate whether the reporter Diaz conducted aprofessional and responsible interview Which unless the unseen tape revealsDiaz physically pummeling Ellis while he asks his questions Diaz seems tohave done            The bulk of the interview consists of Diaz asking Ellis in various wayswhether Metabolife is safe and effective The form these exchanges mostly takeis a debate about whether Metabolife in its labeling and its promotionalmaterial accurately presents what scientific study has found about theproduct Diaz keeps accusing Ellis in effect of exaggerating the assurancesgiven by the scientific community Ellis in turn says Diaz is misinterpretingvarious scientific studies or misstating who the lead scientist on this orthat study was Notes interjected by Metabolife into the transcript point outthat some of the scientists Diaz cites have economic ties to rival dietproducts            Though Chatterbox wont attempt to referee the scientific questions Diaz atleast gives the impression of being fairly wellinformed  whileEllis often gives the impression of being evasive  At one pointfor instance Ellis states flatly that certain language cited by Diaz declaringMetabolife to be safe and effective is not on the Metabolife Web page Butlater Ellis concedes You know to be honestly fair with you I do not knowwhat our Web site looks like            Probably the most accessible part of the interview is when Diaz quizzesEllis about his criminal past                                             Diaz Now you developed this product while you  you developed theproduct while you were on probation for a drug conviction                              Ellis Thats correct                        Here Metabolife interjects the following explanatory note Nine yearsago Michael Ellis received five years probation for the use of a telephone tofacilitate a drug trafficking offense committed in                                               Diaz Now talk to me about that You were a former police officer andyet you got caught setting up and dealing methamphetamine                                  Ellis Well its correct I was a former police officer and its correctthat I did receive probation for using a telephone to further a drugtransaction And thats something Im not proud of I think that happening tome is the nightmare of my life and Ive made it a point to kind of try to dothe right thing ever since that Its not something Im proud of                              Diaz How does a former police officer get involved with running alaboratory making illegal speed               Ellis Well I dont think I was running a laboratory I think thats amisconception But I made a grave error just a bad mistake on my part                        Chatterbox predicts that this exchange will end up airing in the broadcast When asked to explain this bad mistake Elliselaborates                                             Ellis You know its one of the people that were involved in that itsa very personal issue with him and why I got involved hes like a brother tome hes like my best friend and I allowed emotions to get in the way ofprobably better judgment                                       Diaz then tells Ellis that unsealed court records show that you wereinvolved in a very large methamphetamine lab manufacturing speed but thatEllis pleaded to a lesser charge that was nonetheless a felony                                             Ellis Yes I did                              Diaz OK So the key ingredient in the illegal drug speed is ephedrineephedrine is the key ingredient in the Metabolife pills that youre making nowIs that a coincidence                        At this point Metabolife interjects another explanatory note ADEAapproved lab found that Metabolife could not be converted into illegalspeed using the method published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences Vol  No  July                         Then the transcript proceeds to Ellis response                                             Well when I designed Metabolife in those days especially I mean it wasknown as ma huang Its only recently has been where everybody became aware ofa lot of the active alkaloids in it And that Metabolife specifically hasbeen tested and has been through rigorous testing through DEAand FDAcertified laboratories to determine if in fact you could make methamphetamineout of Metabolife it was concluded you could not do that                                       Score one badly needed blow for Ellis But within moments Diaz is up off theropes                                             Diaz  Why did you make the man who was convicted with you MichaelBlevens a partner in the company                                       Chatterbox predicts this question and the following answer will also makethe  broadcast                                             Ellis Well Michael Blevens had his personal reasons why he gotinvolved and Michael Blevens is like a brother to me I may not approve of alot of things a lot of people dolike my children I would not approve ofcertain things they do but it doesnt stop you from loving them I still loveMichael Blevens he was raised like a brother with me and I knew his motherespecially that was like a mother to me And so because of an incident that Iam justyou know I made poor judgment alsothat Im not going to sit backand judge the real character that the person might be                                       When asked by Diaz whether Blevens still plays an active role in MetabolifeEllis says he hasnt for almost a year                           To summarize  Round one goes to ABC News Chatterbox will judge roundtwo after  airs its Metabolife story
