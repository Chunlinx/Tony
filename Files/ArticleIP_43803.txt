                                  Martin Scorsese            The first reviews of Martin Scorseses BringingOut the Dead are the latest evidence of the directors status as a criticalfavorite This is not because the notices have been uniformly glowingitsbeen some time since a Scorsese picture won unanimous praise fromreviewersbut because Scorsese remains almost uniquely among Americandirectors an embodiment of the beleaguered idea that filmmaking and thereforefilm criticism can be a serious important lifeanddeath matter Here forinstance is Roger Ebert all thumbs                           To look at Bringing Out the Dead to look indeed at almostany Scorsese filmis to be reminded that film can touch us urgently anddeeply Scorsese is never on autopilot never panders never sells out alwaysgoes for broke to watch his films is to see a man risking his talent notsimply exercising it He makes movies as well as they can be made                        Never Always This is pure ideologywhich is notto say that it isnt to some extent true Even Scorseses weaker filmsbristle with energy and intelligence But look closely at what Ebert says Tobe reminded of the power of film as a medium is not quite the same as beingmoved by a particular film and Bringing Out the Dead is for all itshectic pacing and breakneck intensity an oddly unmoving experience Yes youthink movies can touch us urgently and deeply Why doesnt this one IfScorsese makes movies as well as they can be made why does one so often feelthat his moviesespecially over the last decade or socould have beenbetter            Above all to look atBringing Out the Dead is to be reminded of a lot of other Scorsesefilms Critics have noted its similarities with Taxi Driver  Scorsesesfirst collaboration with screenwriter Paul Schrader who also wrote The LastTemptation of Christ and the later drafts of Raging Bull  Bothmovies feature a disturbed outsider cruising the nightmarishasyetungentrified streets of Manhattan in search of redemption In place ofSport Harvey Keitels suave vicious pimp in the earlier film Bringing Outthe Dead features Cy a suave vicious drug dealer played by Cliff CurtisThe mood here is a good deal softer The scabrous nihilism of TaxiDriver is no longer as palatableor perhaps as accurate in its responseto the flavor of the times or the mood of its creatorsas it was in Nicolas Cages Frank Pierce saves Cy from a death as gruesome as the one DeNiros Travis Bickle visited on Sport and when Frank does take a life in themovies best most understated scene its an act of mercy            Aside from these parallels and variations theres plentyin Bringing Out the Dead to remind you that youre watching a Scorsesepicture Theres voiceover narration Theres an eclectic relentless rock nroll score and a directorial cameothis time Scorsese provides the disembodiedvoice of an ambulance dispatcher There are jarring antirealist effectsembedded in an overall mise en scne of harsh verisimilitude And ofcourse there is the obligatory religious imagerythe final frames present aclassic Piet with Patricia Arquette whose character is named Mary cradlingCage the man of sorrows in her arms To survey Scorseses oeuvre is tofind such echoings and prefigurations in abundance Look at BoxcarBertha  a throwaway piece of apprenticework he made for schlock impresarioRoger Corman in the early s if youve never seen it imagine Bonnie andClyde remade as an episode of Kung Fu  and then look at The LastTemptation of Christ  the controversial deeply personal rendering of NikosKazantzakis novel which infuriated some Christians a decade and a half laterDifferent as they are both films prominently feature  a crucifixion and Barbara Hershey naked            Well that may be a coincidence But its hard tothink of an active director who has produced such an emphaticallycrossreferenced body of work who seems not so much to repeat himself thoughhe does some of that as to make movies by recombining a recognizable andfairly stable set of narrative thematic and stylistic elements In otherwords Scorsese is the last living incarnation of la politique desauteurs                        That oldpolitique the auteur theory in plain Englishwas first articulated inthe s by a group of French critics many of whom went on to become asdirectors fixtures of the Nouvelle Vague  In a nutshell thetheorybrought to these shores in  by Village Voice film criticAndrew Sarrisheld that like any work of art a film represents the vision ofan individual artist almost always the director The artists who populated theauterist canonHoward Hawks and John Ford preeminentlyhad labored withinthe constraints of the studio system But even their lesser films according toauterist critics could be distinguished from mere studio hackwork by thereiteration of a unique cinematic vocabulary and by an implicit butunmistakable sense of solitary genius in conflict with bureaucraticphilistinism            The auteur theory was quickly challenged most notably byPauline Kael who shredded Sarris in the pages of Film Quarterly  Butthe new Hollywood of the swith Kael as its champion scold andCassandrawas dominated by young directors who attained thanks to thecollapse of the old studios an unprecedented degree of creative autonomy andwho thought of themselves as artists What resulted as Peter Biskind shows inhis New Hollywood dish bible Easy Riders Raging Bulls  was an epidemicof megalomania sexual libertinism moneywasting and drug abuseas well as afew dozen classics of American cinema            The avatars of the NewHollywood were mostly movie bratssocially maladroit nerdy young men andthey were to a man men who shared a fervid almost religious devotion tocinema Scorsese a runty asthmatic altar boy from New York Citys LittleItaly who traded Catholic seminary for New York University film school wasarguably the purest in his faith Unlike Francis Ford Coppola George Lucas orSteven Spielberg St Martin as Biskind calls him did not see directing asa route to world domination but as a priestly avocation a set of spiritualexercises embedded in technical problems Scorseses technical proficiency wonhim some early breaks While making Whos That Knocking at My Door  hisearnest autobiographical first feature independently Scorsese was hired toedit Woodstock into a coherent film His success more or less led tomore rock n roll editing assignmentsa traveling subWoodstock festivalcalled Medicine Ball Caravan  Elvis on Tour and then toBoxcar Bertha  which allowed him to join the Directors Guild and gavehim the chance to make Mean Streets  That movie helped launch thecareers of Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro and taught generations of wouldbetough guys the meaning of the word mook            Kael called Mean Streets a triumph of personalfilmmaking and even though it may be the single most imitated movie of thepast  yearscf The Pope of Greenwich Village State of Grace FederalHill Boyz N the Hood  etcit has lost remarkably little of its freshnessand power Watching it you feel that you are seeing real life on the screenbut real life heightened and shaped by absolute artistic selfassurance Or toquote Kael again Mean Streets never loses touch with the ordinary lookof things or with common experience Rather it puts us in closer touch withthe ordinary the common by turning a different light on them            This kind of realismmarks Scorseses next two films Alice Doesnt Live Here Anymore hisbest piece of directingforhire and one of the halfforgotten gems of theperiodand Taxi Driver  both of which were critically and commerciallysuccessful But the mediumbudget artisanal personal filmmaking of the earlys soon gave way to grander visions To be a New Hollywood director was toflirt with hubris Biskinds book accordingly concludes with a litany ofspectacular flameouts Coppolas Apocalypse Now and One From theHeart Spielbergs   William Friedkins Sorcerer and ofcourse Michael Ciminos Heavens Gate  According to Mardik MartinScorseses erstwhile writing partner as quoted by Biskind The auteur theorykilled all these people One or two films the magazines told them they weregeniuses that they could do anything They went completely bananas Theythought they were God Scorseses own Gtterdmmerung came with NewYork New York  a hugely ambitious jazz epic starring De Niro and LizaMinelli Scorseses mistress at the time and the first of a series of flopsthat continued with Raging Bull and The King of Comedy             Of these three Raging Bull has been singled out forvindication Its the highestranking of the three Scorsese films on theAmerican Film Institutes Top  list and its widely considered to be hismasterpiece But it remains exceedingly hard to watch not so much because ofthe repulsiveness of De Niros Jake La Motta as because of its overall sense ofaesthetic claustrophobia Its a movie lacquered by its own selfimportance sobloated with the ambition to achieve greatness that it can barely move If itconvinces you its a masterpiece it does so by sheer brute force                           Raging Bull isundone by its own perfectionism New York New York and The King ofComedy stand up rather better in my opinion in spite of their obviousflaws So does The Last Waltz  a documentary of the Bands last concertdone simultaneously with New York New York  thanks to the magic ofcocaine For one thing New York New York is virtually the onlyScorsese movie aside from Life Lessons his crackerjack contribution to theCoppolaproduced anthology film New York Stories  to have at its centerthe relationship between a man and a woman For another it ends with LizaMinelli parading through a series of phantasmagoric stage sets singing apointedly ironic song called Happy Endingsa sequence every bit as dazzlingand as mystifying as the ballet from An American in Paris  Just asMean Streets is an unparalleled demonstration of the power of film toconvey reality Happy Endings is a celebration of films magical ability tocreate it A moviegoers dream but good luck seeing it on the big screen            For its part The King of Comedy  a creepy repriseof Taxi Driver played this time for laughsis a movie made beforeits time back when celebritystalking was a piquant metaphor for our culturalills rather than the focus of our cultural life De Niro and Sandra Bernhardkidnap Jerry Lewis playing brilliantly a famous latenight talk show hostBernhard steals the movie and the ending is guaranteed to provoke longexcruciating arguments about the difference between fantasy and reality            In Biskinds account of the tragedy of the NewHollywood Spielberg is the villain Hal Ashby the martyr and Scorsese thescarred survivor After the failures of the early s he picked himself upand made some more movies the quirky protoIndie downtown comedy AfterHours  The Color of Money a respectable sequel to TheHustler  and his long dreamed of The Last Temptation of Christ  Hisfortunes revived with GoodFellas  which was hailed as a return to formand floundered again with The Age of Innocence  one of his periodicattemptslike The Last Waltz  Temptation and most recentlyKundun to defy expectation Next came Casino one of hisperiodic attempts to defy the expectation that he would defy expectationsCasino blends Raging                Bull with GoodFellas and canbe interpreted as a wry allegory of Hollywood in the sa time when guyslike us ie the freelancing gangsters played by De Niro and Joe Pesciwere allowed to run things without interference Of course they got toogreedy screwed everything up and the big corporations turned their playgroundinto Disneyland At the end De Niros character the scarred survivor pickshimself up and goes back to work            Scorsese keeps working tooupcoming projectsinclude Gangs of New York  with Leonardo DiCaprio and a Dean Martinbiopic starring Tom Hanks His extracurricular good worksoverseeing thererelease of classics such as El Cid and Belle de Jour campaigning for film preservation narrating a BBC documentary on his favoritemoviesare testament to his abiding faith But his movies more often than notfeel cold and mechanical They substitute intensity for emotion and give usbombast when we want passion Why do we go to the movies Pauline Kael used tosay it was to be caught up swept away surfeited by sensation and confrontedby reality Some of us keep going to Scorseses movies because we still want tobelieve in that and we leave wondering whether he still does
