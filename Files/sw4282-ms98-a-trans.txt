              okay   were you drug tested when uh   well actually interestingly enough a lot of times   oh where where do where do you work at   well i just retired from the Army after twenty years of uh active uh service uh uh retired out of the Pentagon  and because of the organizations that i was in in the military   oh   and the jobs that i held and particularly because of the security clearances that i had we had first of all we had regular random testing just because we were in the military   just because you were in the service yeah   right and then because of the security clearances that i held i also had uh other regular random uh drug testing for that as well that i actually had to sign an agreement saying that uh   were they like urine tests or were they blood   yeah it was all urine testing   umhum   and it was mainly because of their concern because drug use is illegal uh and of course addictive uh its a perfect thing uh for blackmail for people with high security clearances and so ive kind of over the twenty year period of time ive gotten kind of accustomed to it and   thats right thats right oh okay so it doesnt really bother you that much or   doesnt bother me uh uh because ive always been in sensitive positions that i understand the       the problems that can results uh as far as compromise and espionage and uh addiction and blackmail that that has never bothered me     exactly yeah i work for a defense contractor down here uh Pratt Whitney   and uh uhhuh and i work for a defense contractor in Virginia called Network Solutions we uh uh we actually operate the NIC for the internet   oh okay   yeah you probably got uh uh information about this program through the internet   that thats exactly where i got it from   right all of us did       yep so uh now we dont have any drug testing out there   uh oh okay so yeah at Pratt Whitney you do its the you you have to pass your drug test in order to do uh to get employed there you have to pass it   uhhuh uhhuh huh   and uh its for the same reasons uh you hold you hold a i have a secret clearance and uh   right uhhuh   you know i guess they just want to make sure that uh like you said that nobody can uh hold anything against you you know make  information and then say well well turn turn you in for these drugs if you unless you do this and that   umhum right exactly i guess so theres uh still a good bit of discussion and controversy about whether its an invasion of your privacy and uh that sort of thing   yeah yeah there is and i and i can see why you know especially especially if you do do especially especially if you use illegal drugs i can see why you wouldnt want it it to happen to you and yeah     right especially right you dont want to get caught   and even if you dont you know its like well geez you know what else what else could they use this stuff for you know and if it is kind of an invasion of privacy it is an invasion of privacy   umhum yeah as a matter of fact uh thats such a difficult question to to answer because on the one hand sure uh uh drug testing is an invasion of property or of privacy but yet on the other hand   yeah right   for example these uh guys that drive these trains and that sort of thing that uh have been high and uh killed a lot of people yeah its its uh right   thats right you i know it see what a small price to pay to to save some lives it saves us one life you know drug testing its worth it but   umhum right and i think for the most part the general public tends to support it but uh im sure organizations like the American Civil Liberties  Union uh the ACLU probably have their   yeah yeah and theyre worried about abuses of it   sure and that that can really happen   hm   uh and that sort of thing not just drug testing but  lots of other things uh for example blood tests that determine whether you have particularly diseases or not like AIDS uh can be construed to be an invasion of property or of of privacy because it effects your insurance and your employability and   yes that that that stuff should be kept confidential far as that goes   yeah and its it but yet if thats thats in any kind of a computer database  somebodys going to get access to it that and uh real easy to abuse so   its accessible thats right   its one of those problems that  its really hard to come up with an answer to   yeah   and uh   yeah you have you ever heard of anybody cheating on those uh urine tests   yeah oh yeah in   i know i know a guy who was who cheated and got in out there at Pratt and uh he took somebody elses with him and just   umhum yeah   put it in there so it you you can get around them if you have to   oh yeah there were guys in the military that were selling their own urine   yeah   because they uh just had to be careful that they didnt do the test and uh show that you came up pregnant       depending on who you got your sample from it that could be really bad  so  but uh   oh that could be real embarrassing then you could be caught real bad   and they were really protective   what do they what do they do to you in the military if you get caught what do they do to you if you get caught   umhum well it depends now if you have a you know that was the other funny thing if you had a high security clearance like my people had   umhum   uh and you got caught and these guys were shift workers it really worked out well for them because of course the first thing that happened was that their security clearance was suspended and then they were removed from access to sensitive information which means they got a straight day job at the company   oh   so it it was really to their advantage to get caught and     oh man but it wouldnt didnt look good on their record though of course   yeah and in the long run of course uh that was a problem and it kind of depended also on  on how often they uh were caught whether they were in a rehab program and
