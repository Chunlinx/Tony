          okay  so what books do you like to read   well all kinds to tell you the truth uh  mostly i like uh  um science fiction science fantasy type books   like what what authors   uh well let me see uh well the most my favorite ones are kind of an old author Edgar Rice Burroughs   uhhuh   and he had a uh series of uh called John Carter Of Mars i dont know if youre familiar with it or not but uh hes the one that wrote Tarzan Of The Apes and all that too and uh and uh   no im not okay yeah heard of that   and uh he uh he had one where this guy was a Civil War soldier and and uh made some trips to Mars and stuff i thought it was really interesting  plus i i liked Pierce Anthony uh the one about uh Zanth i dont know if youre familiar with that   oh thats interesting no i really i have never really never never read science fiction much   and well that was more fantasy i guess and uh because its kind of neat because it has a lot of puns and stuff you know in it and so its kind of funny too and then uh   uhhuh yeah   then i like uh what else do i have there oh its a series of another fantasy but its Fred Saberhagen Saberhagen and its the its uh The Sword Series which i liked and uh Gore i like too its another fantasy one   uhhuh   and uh starting i think im going to start pick up a few uh more science fiction as far as well as Isaac Asimov have a number of his books too and H G Wells   right thats older stuff   yeah uh but but i think theyre pretty good and uh and then im i think im going to start picking up some of the newer Star Treks because i hear theyre pretty good too   yeah yeah i had a professor at school whose sister wrote a Star Trek episode wrote one of those novels that yeah as under this fake name she wrote it in  shes a professor at another university and it was   oh really   kind of a hush hush thing that shed written this book so we all had to read it for a sociology class so um no i dont the author was like Madge Larson or something like that it was a kind of feminist   do you know which which one was it uhhuh   Star Trek people on a  its the the woman had been a POW in Vietnam who wrote it and so she shes one of the first female POWs and so she had um   uhhuh uhhuh   kind of paralleled that with kind of a space version of it and it was kind of it was interesting i dont know if it was interesting just because i knew the person whod written it or if it was actually a good book   uhhuh yeah   but ive never really read a lot of science fiction its   uhhuh well i sort of read mostly in high school and uh you know and i and i like it you know as as kind as the light reading and everything and uh i recently uh completed graduate school and ive really kind of got interested   right   through a number a couple of classes that i took there on on history and stuff and ive gotten a number of history books but i havent read any yet you know uh   right oh  but youve got them so that   yeah but ive got them and theyre ready to go  thats right but uh i was kind of getting into you know like uh you know like medieval times and stuff like that and just as to just to do some reading about what went on and everything   halfway there so thats good uhhuh yeah ive ive read a lot of medieval literature this year in school a lot of like took a class in Chaucer so we were reading in the Middle English and all that and that was a lot of fun kind of weird but   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh yeah and what what which ones do you like   um well im uh i like a lot of contemporary short stories um   uhhuh   authors authors like Bobbie Ann Mason shes from Kentucky and writes a lot of just kind of contemporary realism sort of stuff um John Barthelme who wrote he just died a few years ago and he wrote kind of weird avantgarde   um uhhuh   short fiction and then like in the sixties through the late eighties and he was kind of responsible for turning around the short story movement so that was  kind of neat um   uhhuh   if im reading kind of trashy stuff i like um i guess kind of mystery books and then stuff thats funny i like pretty much any humor book   uhhuh   and gosh oh   well ive got those as far as humor ive got a couple of Irma Bombecks too   oh thats fun   yeah and then also there theres another one i dont know you might have read it The Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy yeah theres a series well it was a trilogy with four books  and uh have you read those   uhhuh right no i i i have one of them sitting on my bookshelf and i just never picked it up   do you yeah theyre theyre pretty funny because its really kind of interesting and uh uh those are are kind of neat too and ive read uh i like Steve well i like some of Stephen King   yeah yeah i i like him   i im not really too i dont really like his endings so much but uh i think some of his books are pretty good and then there the other one that ive read a little bit is uh  um oh God let me go look at his name here its the one that wrote uh   uhhuh yeah i used to   um i cant even think of his see oh here oh Clive Barker   oh what have you read by him   uh The Books Of Blood and uh Cable Cable i guess how you say just you know some paperbacks and stuff   uhhuh oh ive never read anything i got a book of his out of the library just the other day to try it out id been to England and thought you know hes like the British Stephen King so oh really ill have to   oh did you uhhuh well i like him better than Stephen King yeah he he hes pretty hes pretty good   oh well hes next on my list to read im reading a little private eye book now   yeah and then of course ive read the uh Clancy books   yeah   you know uh Hunt For Red October and Red Storm Riding Rising   oh those are the ones my dad keeps trying to get me to read but i   well actually you know Red Storm i havent ive started Red Storm Rising but uh i really recommend Hunt For Red October   uhhuh   because it really its good and and it keeps going pretty quick but the Red Storm Rising ive heard and then its been apparent the first you know few pages or whatever its kind of slow in starting and everything   well thats good right   but its not a bad book at all   well thats interesting i read i like Moby Dick thats a  thats my big book that i like   yeah yeah actually i i i got an old copy of Moby Dick that i like too i read a while back   thats one i just my very very favorite book so if i had to go read something again id probably read Moby Dick or Scarlet Letter i also like   uhhuh yeah oh probably liked Star Trek Two didnt you   no i actually have never seen any of the Star Trek movies was that oh well thats interesting i had a roommate in school who did a did you ever see the movie Heathers   oh you hadnt Two was really good because he quoted a lot from Moby Dick no i didnt   oh its its kind of this sort of black comedy movie about this these kids in high school who are not real popular and they kill all the popular kids in the class its its kind of bleak but its sort of fun and they do a lot of Moby Dick i had a roommate who wrote a whole paper on Moby Dick and Heathers and   uhhuh uhhuh wow   and well i  i thought it was a little much but it was kind of fun   yeah   i like John Irving thats   John Irving yeah   he hasnt written much in a while but when he does im pretty happy with it   yeah oh yeah thats good   yeah im trying to think what else ive read that ive really just loved i dont know how i its hard to read when youre in school its like you just read those textbooks and thats it   yeah yeah i know and that will have to do   but i guess maybe in the real world too you just dont have time to read but   yeah thats pretty much the way it is usually i try to i have some a book or two by the bed and then maybe like i get to read for twenty minutes before i go to sleep or something   uhhuh and then you fall asleep and have to reread it the next night because you forgot what youve read yeah i i do that too oh i like Larry McMurtry hes good and like Lonesome Dove was   yep  thats right yeah uhhuh   it was a long book but it was really good   well i understand that Peter Benchley is coming out with a new one yeah i just read an article the other day you know uh because i have this Jaws book here and i think hes going to call it The Beast or something like that its about a squid   really uhhuh oh   so you know whether or not it will be as good as you know Jaws was i dont i dont know   i liked Jaws and The Deep and The Island those were pretty good so i would read that   uhhuh uhhuh yeah Jaws actually have have you read the first one the book   yeah
