office Unwittingly Kinsley hasprovided the most compelling argument why Clinton must be removed            Let us concede for the moment Kinsleys point thatReagan and Bush were at least as corrupt as Clinton I think sincere peoplecan differ but lets make the assumption for the sake of argument Accordingto Kinsley the United States has had an unbroken chain of corrupt presidentsfor the past  years That being the case Kinsley should give some thought tohow we might end this plague of corruption Kinsleys solution is to look theother way one more time             Perhaps the corruptionpersists because it is so consistently condoned                           Everett G Farr Albuquerque NM                           Its Not theCoverUp Its the Sex                        Herbert Steins article  is elegant in itsexplanation of why he wants Bill Clinton impeached Mainly its because he isdisgusted by the idea of Clinton representing America Some months ago in thearticle  he wrote about how much he respected Richard Nixon Nixon was acivil serious dedicated judicious and highly intelligent man Stein saidStein also did not feel I have the wisdom and moral elevation to judgehim            Steins differentreactions make it clear why Clinton is so hatedit was not the perjury or thelaws of the country It was the sex and Clintons refusal to admit hisindiscretions in front of everyone Such selfrighteousnessand thewillingness to cover it up in statements about the rule of law and theConstitutionappalls me as much as Clintons lust                           Viswanath Subramanian Cupertino

had ever wanted Clinton to represent the UnitedStates I actually did and do want this man to represent the UnitedStatesthats why I voted for him twice I suspect this is just the sort ofquestion the

  Herbert Steins article He Has To Go illustratesthe fuzzy thinking surrounding the impeachment proceedings Im sorry thatStein cannot decide whether the presidents bombing of Iraq was generated by awish to divert the nation I am sorry that Stein is distressed by the sight ofthe president visiting Israel and Palestine Steins distress is not howeveran impeachable offense nor is his perception even if accurate that Clinton isunable to lead the nation and the world Leadership ability is an issue for theelectorate which has spoken on two occasions regarding Clinton and which willspeak again
