                                             The Nobel Prize in economicswas recently awarded to Myron Scholes and Robert Merton Their work has hadtremendous practical impact on the world of finance Yet their own lives callinto question a key assumption of economic theory            The issue is simple One dayin  three hardworking associate professors of finance scribbled down afew equations on a blackboard and eureka They had discovered a method forpricing options The third man Fischer Black died in  What did they dowith this extremely valuable information They gave it to the rest of us forfree That is the problem            Theassumption that appears to be in jeopardy is profit maximization In marketsparticularly financial markets when profit opportunities arise it is assumedthat savvy individuals will take advantage of them in order to capture profitsSome economists describe it this way No one leaves  bills lying on thestreet Indeed in finance theoryincluding the Nobel prize winners ownformulathe profit motive is the engine that moves financial markets from oneequilibrium to another Equilibrium being the place where nothing reallyhappens            Modern financial theory is highly dependent on such strangetheoretical beingsgreedy fortunetellers who can compute the third derivativeof their utility function For example the creatures assumed in the CapitalAsset Pricing Model the keystone of most academic finance are assumed to careonly about risk and return The people trapped in the CAPM are assumed to applythe equations provided by Sharpe Lintner and Treynor for which only Sharpewon a Nobel to pounce on the slightest deviation from equilibrium in order toget more  This greed is their most important trait If they arentgreedy the theory falls apart as would most other economic theoriesProfessors Merton and Scholes have undoubtedly assumed unbridled greed hundredsof times in classrooms academic conferences and cocktail parties Thequestion at hand is whether our generous academics were greedy enough to beconsistent with their own assumptions            On that day in  theysurely knew that they had discovered something of great value Why didnt theytake their solution and their measly academic salaries and start tradingoptions With the formula programmed into only their calculators theycould have ruled the emerging Chicago Board of Options Exchange taking themoney of the hapless traders who were still pricing based on history rules ofthumb or their guts a potentially substantial source of wisdom here inChicago There is no way to know how much money they would have made but itsurely would dwarf the million bucks they scored for the Nobel They had thekey equation that now drives hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollarsof annual trading volume in stock options futures options mortgagesoverthecounter currency options and most of the derivatives industry            To besure these guys have made a lot of money working for Wall Street firms inrecent years They surely have been adequately greedy in the rest of theircareers to satisfy their own assumptions But their youthful charitable lapsemust still be explained            One possible explanation is that if they hadkept the formula to themselves the budding options market would have beenstunted They would have quickly taken all the money from the suckers tradingagainst them and no one would have been foolish enough to take them onPerhaps they actually have maximized their income by settling for a tiny pieceof the huge pie that their formula created This explanation ignores theunderlying premise of the financial markets Theres a sucker born everyminute The market might not have grown as big if they had hoarded theirsecret but they would have been able to dominate it            Another explanation is thatthey may have feared some other finance professor would ruin their monopolyThere usually is a pathetic close second for any theoretical breakthrough inacademia Thats the nature of the idea market Someone else eventually wouldhave stumbled onto the same formula In which case they would have had to cutthe spoiler in for half Or even worse the spoiler might have given theformula away leaving our laureates with neither fame nor fortune Any claimsthat they actually discovered it first but kept it to themselves would havebeen met with skepticism at the faculty club                         This leads us to a third possibility They couldnt trusteach other Perhaps The Treasure of the Sierra Madre was showing inCambridge that weekend and each economist realized that he would always have toworry about the other two guys As any yearold knows and game theoristscan now elaborately prove threeperson secrets are particularly troublesomein this regard because nobody can ever pinpoint which of the other two mighthave cheated Thus they may have opted for full public disclosure becausethey knew that that was the only way to ensure that they shared equally in thespoils In the end they didnt share equally though Scholes got his name onthe formula and the Nobel Black only got his name on the formula and Mertononly got the Nobel            Heres athought Maybe Black Scholes and Merton were interested in serving the publicgood and the giveaway was strictly for the betterment of humanity Before theguffaws start we should at least consider this alternative The formula wasmost directly a gift to the options traders around the world which is not agroup that usually inspires charitable acts So these three werent in the sameleague with Mother Teresa Scholes and Merton reportedly are applauded whenthey appear on the floor of the options exchange which shows that optionstraders are at least appreciative if not deserving of the rare charities thatthey receive However the benefits of this formula do extend beyond the pitsThe efficient and accurate pricing of options has helped to make the economymore efficient So we all have benefited indirectly            Another alternative is that our heroes werepursuing the noble goal of academics everywheretenure Certainly tenure wasin the bag for these fellows after coming up with the formula though itprobably was likely for them anyway Or if not tenure their goal might havebeen the eternal fame associated with having your name on an important piece ofhuman wisdom Economists are as guilty of this hubris as are members of anydiscipline Theres the Fischer Effect the Sharpe Ratio the MillerModiglianiTheorem Tobins Q the Laffer Curve the only one in which the name helpscharacterize the discovery and the greatest of them all Pareto OptimalityOf these bits of academic immortality BlackScholes is probably the mostwidely used by nonacademics so they have made a good buy on the formulas famevalue            The first three explanationsall rely on various forms of greed or other base human motivations that areclose enough to greed to be easily worked into economic theory The last threemotivespublic good tenure and famedont fit as well with the basicassumptions of economics It is possible to fit them in by the economistsmagic trick of defining any behavior as maximizing something called utilityutility being defined as whatever you choose to maximize But plain old greedshould be adequate to explain nearly everything in finance because finance isabout making money If the behavior of people who are in the profession ofmaking money isnt well explained by the motivation of making money then itseems a real stretch to apply it elsewherefor example to nurses            For straight cash greed ourNobel laureates fall woefully short of their own standard Someday a Nobel maygo to theoreticians in behavioral finance who will be able to build a modelthat explains their own behavior as well as it does that of others
