                                 House Doesnt Go Soft                           USAToday and the Washington Post lead with the imminent landfall ofHurricane Floyd somewhere along the southeastern US coast The storm is alsothe top nonlocal story at the Los AngelesTimes  The New York Timesruns Floyd topfront but leads instead with the Houses passage last night ofa campaign reform bill that would ban soft money and tightly regulateissues ads in the two months preceding an election to prevent these twoitems from becoming vehicles for flouting contribution limits that are supposedto apply to individual candidates The other papers front the bill            The dailies compare Floyd to Hugo   killed  billion damagesays the LAT  and Andrew   killed  billion damage says theLAT  The WP calls it one of the most dangerous storms of thecentury The prospects are grim enough that President Clinton took theunprecedented step of declaring Florida and Georgia disaster areas even beforethe storm arrived The coverage ticks off some of the other Cassandra factorsseveral million people fleeing their homes with all the fronts that runpictures showing the resultant traffic jams the mass cancellation of airlineflights and the firsttimeever shutdown of Disney World            The coverage notes that last year the House passed a nearly identicalcampaign reform bill which despite drawing a majority in the Senate wasfilibustered to death there The NYT reports one reason for the extentof Republican antipathy to such measures In a recent closeddoor meetingHouse Republicans were told that for the  election cycle their partyheld a nearly  million advantage over the Democrats in soft money Thereactually is one important new feature of this years reform bill It contains aprovision requiring a candidate for election for Federal office other than acandidate who holds Federal office to reimburse the government for federallyprovided transportation used for campaign purposes Can you say HillaryApparently the nations lawmakers cannot And by the way why shouldincumbents be able to fly Uncle Sugar Airlines without paying            David Ignatius in his WP column identifies what he calls ourtendency toward sequential hysteria the phenomenon in which a problem iswell recognized long before it reaches a critical stage then for a few briefdays it becomes Topic A but then before long its back to inattention allwithout anything ever really being done about it Ignatius gives as examplesthe Russian corruption scandal Chinese atomic espionage the FBI at Waco theNorth Korean nuclear threat and genocide in Africa A good point but marredwhen Ignatius trying to tie up his column too neatly with a bow made from thedays news adds Hurricane Floyd to his list The problem is Floyd hasnt beenknown about for a long time and things are really being done in reaction toit            The Wall Street Journal Tax Report depends a little too muchon IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti judging from how frequently the goodcommissioner appears in the column being a  well good commissioner Todayseffort for instance includes mention of how Rossotti always enjoyed solvingproblems when he was in business And now he says I have an unlimitedsupply of problems to solve  This is called greasing the source and is amajor source of skewed coverage Homework assignment find an example where theTax Report said something truly tough about the IRSs top man            The LAT reports that the Los Angeles Fire Department is caught up ina controversy stemming from the revelation this week that for the neighborhoodsof BelAir Westwood Pacific Palisades and Brentwood it has introduced mapsthat identify the houses with the highest risk of burning those with woodshingle roofs The city councilman for the area involved has called for a fullpublic debate about whether or not the LAFD is in fact writing off certainhomes in case of fire Fairly far in the story mentions that maps of otherparts of the city also indicate areas of risky homes apparently withoutcontroversy But the LAT utterly ignores the impact of this fact whichis the real explanation for why the maps are now news The story nevermentions that BelAir etc are the citys lushest neighborhoods housing thecitys most influential people            Tucked away on Page  of the WP is a Pentagon story that bearswatching The Department of Defense is conducting a comprehensive review of thebattle damage inflicted by NATO during the war in Kosovo and its already pastdue A delay like this is sometimes a sign that unwelcome figures are beingmassaged into the most favorable shape possible So it will be interesting tosee if the Kosovo scorecard goes the way of the Gulf Wars Patriot missiletotting up which went from a midwar near percent intercept rate to amorningafter count much closer to  percent if that Of course the Buildingstands ready to make an argument either way If the numbers are good then therefrain will be See this stuff works give us more stuff And if not itllbe This stuff didnt work as well as wed like we need better stuff
