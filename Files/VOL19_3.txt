                              What a Clich            The small girl straggles from the museum to theschool bus  Everyone else has already boardedand is waiting impatiently  Well claims the littlegirl proudly last but not lost  At least thats whatmy mother always says  Fifty other schoolchildrenhear and nod            That is how a clashing clich gets started or atany rate that is the explanatory scenario I dreamedup  Like someone who hears a pun and then searchesfor a story to use it as a punch line over the years Ihave collected mangled metaphors battered idiomsand twisted expressions always looking for explanationsbehind the novel usage  Some of this may haveto do with my chosen profession which involves poringover student essays  But I also hear fullgrownadults clearly native speakers talk that way  At therisk of opening up a whole can of beans let me proceed            The first category of altered expressions resemblesmalapropism in all its unintentional oddyseyPerhaps the simplest explanation for many of thesemissed idioms is mishearing as in You cant pull thewool over my ice  Since people rarely bother to thinkabout the meaning behind a figurative expressionanything that sounds right will foot the bill  In thisrealm are several undisputed classics cutting offyour nose despite your face is quite popular as is thegloomy reflection Its a doggydog world  Otherhighly ranked candidates are taken for granite andempiric victory  It is worth noting that some of thesewere first heard from the radio character FalstaffOpenshaw on Fred Allens imaginary Allens Alleywhere they were used for all intensive purposes            Usually these errors sound simplemindedmany are merely careless  Give him a wide birth forinstance may have been just a spelling error on astudents paper I was reading  But in slovenlinesssleeps the sound of new sayings  He wants to go outand wipe the world for instance has an idiosyncraticrightness bespeaking not a powerful conqueror buta great reformer  These newly created meanings arewhat make these expressions more than mere mistakeseven if at times they bring one upshore  Itreasure the sage advice in Savor the best for last andThe victor is spoiled   And worshipers of satin  even ifit is just a typographical slip describes a class ofpeople I know all too well  Occasionally these erasoccur on a rather high level of sophistication such asengaging in selfflatulation             A more complex category is the conflation oftwo expressions  The first time I stumbled acrossthis phenomenon I was discussing an agenda witha middleaged business executive  We got to itemthree  Hmm he mused  Ill have to touchbases with you on that one tomorrow  Only after Ireplayed his sentence in my mind did I realize that itwas a splice of to touch base and Ill get back to you Since then that hybrid has become so prevalent thatit hardly sounds peculiar at all            In fact that kind of error crops upor creepsupfrequently especially with two expressions usingthe same locution or image  John Fergusonwriting some seven years ago in VERBATIM XI termed them Bunnyisms after Bunny the wife offilm director Norman McLeod and an egregious exampleto us all  Telling me a thing one day and outthe other is one of hers  Figures like Gracie Allen onBurns and Allen  as well as Jane Ace known as radiosmistress of misinformation on The Easy Aces simply turned that kind of locution into a routine inthe s            Unfortunately that kind of routine has becomeunconscious error with many in other words routineConsequently a politician will paint a portraitof an administration both incompetent and corruptThe left hand doesnt know how to wash the right His opponent on the third hand might speak disparaginglyof proposed reforms that he

I listen for blind as apost             Figurative accuracy seems to have gone to thehogs is figurative language itself on the decline  It iscertainly not encouraged in places like The New YorkTimes  also known as the gray lady of journalism butneither does the Times often mix metaphors  Politiciansoften do as they strive for an image the Americanpublic can embrace  In fact one of thesehomemades recently made national headlines asJesse Jackson protested that the candidates on theDemocratic ticket were cut from the same stripes That is a clear conflation of cut from the same clothand of the same stripe what one of my studentsonce called a slip at the wheel             Here is another attempt at explanation in a culturethat has deserted basic agriculture for industrywhere professions such as shoemaker and blacksmithand cooper have all but disappeared many peoplenever learn the connections between mankind andnature or the crafts of working with basic materialsSince so many colorful expressions depend on thesevanished relationships uncertainty rules the roastA girl describes her boyfriend as a tough nut tocatch  a waitress tells me approvingly as she poursmy cup of morning coffee The busy bee catches theworm   Yet modern technology also baffles our culturewhich tends to confuse input with feedback as ametaphor for soliciting opinion  Maybe the problemas Anonymous has stated is

neighborschild once said  Here the trend seems to betoward deepening an image already present or shiftingto a more emphatic expression  One timehonoredway of doing this of course is to insert sexualand scatological terms  Dont crap on my paradeshouts a student activist in my earshot decrying defecationinstead of precipitation  The reductio ad absurdumof this move is the common declarative Fuckthat shit  where an allpurpose verb and an allinclusivenoun stand in for all manner of oncecurrentidioms including the hell with   An early instance ofthis change when the shit hits the fan  is by now soingrained in the public lexicon that few recall theoriginal expression when the smoke hits the fan   Inan attempt to reverse this trend a Southern friend ofmine offers the alternate when the grits hit the pan but this usage seems destined to remain a regionalismat best the kind of Southernism collected byJohn H Felts in Bumps Grinds and Other Lewd Gestures XVI            Sometimes the shift can be quite subtle as inDont throw all your eggs into one basket  eventhough the simple verbsubstitution renders the advicedevastating to anyone but an omeletmakerSometimes the shift comes about through the omissionof a word in a recollection entitled MasterMalaprop VII James Higgins describes a newspapereditor who made such proclamations as Ahand in the bush is worth two   Along a

orverbal grappling  Admittedly preposition usage isnot always clearly defined does one compare applesto oranges or apples with oranges or just stick in anand   Also certain prepositional phrases such aswaiting on a friend  probably qualify as regional usageAs a student of mine once remarked I supposeit is all part of the wonder about being alive            Let us open the drawer of conclusions  First ofall I do not mean to impugn nonnative speakersvaliantly trying to master a language that often is noteven sure of itself  Rather the socalled unerringnessof native speech is in part hit or myth  As LysanderKemp reminded us in Mrs Malaprop inMexico XV other tongues have their slips aswell  All languages are composed of dead metaphorsas the soil of corpses wrote William EmpsonSome metaphors simply suffer a sea change  If languageis a continual exercise in combination andpermutation it makes sense that such expressionsor lusus linguae  will always be with us  They mayeven infect

    Its turned out to be one of those red herringsaround our necks  Quote from Bob Porter director ofMaintenance and Engineering Services in Fontana Californiain the San Bernardino Sun    Submittedby                               Rhyme and Punishment            In  it was claimed in the Gentlemans Magazinethat A man who could make so vile a punwould not scruple to pick a pocket so who dares todeny that puns are so called because they are punishable            Yet despite the hearers conventional groan andthe perpetrators equally conventional apology everyoneknows that verbal play gives a great deal ofpleasure justifying the great deal of ingenuity thatgoes into producing it  Writers plainly value beingable to use words in ways that not only fail to reflecttheir dictionary meaning but seem flatly to reject itIn an article a couple of years ago Jan Morris refersto professional writers as those of us who live bythe sweat of our ink  Quite apart from the fact thatthe association of writing with ink has decreasing literalvalidity there is not much metaphorical senseto be made here either if we take the remark wordby word  Ink does not sweat we do not sweat inkand even the traditional fingers clutching traditionalinkfilled pens were less likely to be troubled bysweat than by chilly cramp  In fact of course weunderstand Jan Morris with no difficulty because sheknew that we would take the whole sequence liveby the sweat of our ink new to us and map it onto a similar one that was familiar to us  The similarityin structure rhythm wording etc is doublyimportant  It supplies the stimulus to make the comparisonand it hints that the degree of mismatch willbe the clue to the meaning  In consequence becausethe familiar live by the sweat of our browsmeans work hard for a living no longer entailingthe sort of physical effort that cause sweating weare prepared to conclude that the Jan Morris clonemeans work hard for a living by authorship             And maybe that is all it is meant to mean  Butwhen Thomas Wilson in his Art of Rhetoric speaks of travail and toil with the sweat of hisbrows we can be sure that he is referring toAdams expulsion from Eden and the beginning oftoil for everyone though Genesis III in the AuthorizedVersion follows Coverdale in using thewords sweat of thy face   So Jan Morriss readersare free perhaps encouraged to think of a writerslabors in mythic cosmic terms as part of postEdeniccompulsion            Such convolutions of phrasal meaning an aspectof what some call intertextuality is a common rhetoricaldevice especially perhaps at the arty end ofjournalism  In The Independent of  September the same page contained not only the JanMorris article but a review entitled Duty and theBeast another in which the author lambastes a historianwho has left unread those things he ought tohave read so there can be little trust in him andyet another in which Anthony Quinn writes aboutthe gripes of Roth            The rhymetriggered evocation of the fairy taleBeauty and the Beast even about a book on thetinsel town of Hollywood is not very rewardingand it seems just about as pointless to be led to theGeneral Confession in the Anglican prayer book toevaluate a biography of Himmler  The punning byAnthony Quinn is a different matter  He is reviewingPhilip Roths Deception which contrasts Londonand an antisemitism in which Jews seem to connivewith New York characterized by Jews with force full of anger  The contrast is strong enough tosustain the allusion to Julia Ward Howes BattleHymn bypassing Steinbeck of course when Quinnspeaks of the narrative trampling over the now familiargripes of Roth  The contrast also justifiesthe neat allusion to London whose Cockney vowelsresponsibly transmute the grapes of wrath and enrichour reflections            Such intertextual references whether or notpointed by rhyme puns and rhythmic matchingmust indeed provide depth and enrichment if theyare not to become merely a stylistic clich of thescribbling classes as they show every sign of doinganyway  Two years on and the same daily paperThe Independents arts pages in May  yieldedthe following among numerous others

program Desert Island Discs                        There is of course a very long history of suchtextual duplication whereby meaning is simultaneouslycompressed and extended  Dramatists andnovelists have been especially keen to provide theirworks with titles that are Janusfaced  For Whom theBell Tolls enabled Hemingway to look forward intoCivil War tragedy as well as back into Donnes Devotions In this instance indeed the impact of thenovel was so great that any reference to the quotationfor the past half century could not help evokingboth the Hemingway story and the Donne passagewhichwas thereby given an entirely freshcurrency            There were striking instances of such multipleintertextuality in late   One occasion was thecentenary of Manets painting Olympia and TheIndependent where else need I turn for materialran an article on how the pictures critical receptionhad changed from rejection by a scandalized Francein  to enthusiastic acclaim by an admiringworld in   The piece bore the title The LadysNot for Spurning with the reasonably obviousmeaning The subject of this painting is not to bespurned as a disreputable whore but enjoyed as asensitive portrayal  Reasonably obvious I saythough we are helped if we recall that among ChristopherFrys other normdefying titles  A Yard ofSun Thor with Angels A Sleep of Prisoners  therewas The Ladys Not for Burning    This enforcesa passive interpretation of archaic or rustic flavorthough it appears to be neither a quotation nor atruly historical echo from the wretched time whenwomen could suffer death at the stake for witchcraftAll the more remarkable then that the article onManet has a title that exactly matches Frys inrhythm rhyme and grammar the match extendingto the curious use of lady to denote in the one amedieval wench thought to be a witch and in theother a French nude of dubious virtue            But the title could not be read in  withoutevoking another text and another lady  A decadeearlier the British government led by MargaretThatcher was facing severe economic troubles andinsistent calls for a change of policy to deal withthem  There was much talk of whether or not thePrime Minister would do a Uturn but at the annualconference of her party in October  shestoutly rejected any such suggestion  In a rousingspeech she delighted her audience with a particularlyrousing sentence You turn if you want theladys not for turning            This is textually interesting in a number of waysIt is calqued upon the title of a play that few of theaudience would have seen or read significantly

plausibly active than passive withfor in its familiar supportoriented role in favor of            There followed numerous recyclings of this sentencewith an intertextual reference that was lessand less to the Fry play and more and more to theoccasion of the conference speech  Ten years laterwhen Mrs Thatcher returned from the Rome meetingof European Community leaders opponents accusedher of stubbornly refusing to heed politicaltrends and a change in British public opinion  TheIndependent on  October  summed up thisview with the headline The ladys not for learningAn even plainer link with

attentionof newspaper readers to a consumer advertisementis to juggle cleverly with the shape and meaning of afamiliar idiom or set phrase  One famous British advertisementfor eggs urged readers to Go to workon an egg  Go to work on can of course be interpretedidiomatically as attack but the presentationalso hinted wittily at the literal sense of the phraseby portraying a man pedaling to work on a cyclewith a single eggshaped wheel  More recently aquality Sunday newspaper has run an advertisementfor a nippy hatchback car under the caption Ahardy performer wins its laurels  This heading haslayers of meaning that can be peeled off like theskins of an onion  The tough little runabout has certainlywon an accolade from the motoring press  Buthardy performer also suggests hardy annual and asany gardener knows the laurel is a shrub that survivesout of doors throughout the winter just as amaidofallwork minicar has to fetch and carry in allweathers  On another level again we recognize thevintage comedy performers Laurel and Hardyonepretty light on his feet the other with solider qualities            In advertising almost any type of fixed expressioncan be pressed into service  Some familiarphrasessuch as go to work on are plain idiomswith no cultural overtones  But Laurel and Hardylike Astaire and Rogers or Rodgers and Hart arepart of the history of popular entertainment in thiscentury  In those examples the popular culture isshared the references are understood by moviegoersand radio listeners on both sides of the AtlanticIn other cases the appeal is to something

that most languages would have separatewords to identify and denote eyebrows eyelidsand eyelashes features about as easily and objectivelyobserved as ears or lips  French seemed tobear this out with sourcil eyebrow paupire eyelidand cil eyelash although the literal sense ofsourcil upper lash seemed not too appropriateNote also the obvious double duty of cil   But suchtrouble as there was stemmed largely from goingsonin Latin            Latin had terms for eyebrow and eyelid thatwere the sources of the French ones Lat superciliumand palebra  but eyelash evidently caused troubleSome Roman authors resorted to palpebrrum piluslit  eyelids hair for eyelashes  To complicate mattersthey also used the plural of eyebrow supercilia  to mean eyelashes  And cilium  whichmeant upper eyelid to Pliny the Elder acquired inlater centuries the senses of eyebrow eyelid andeyelash  Krtings LateinischRomanischesWrterbuch Stecherts  repr glossed cilium aseyebrow as the only meaning Col  No Pokorny echoing predecessors suggested that ciliummeant the lower lid and supercilium the upper But supercilium meant eyebrow            Italian has inherited some of the confusion ofLatin  It agrees with the

threeelements discussed are kept distinct or the oppositein certain languages  Welsh has a word for brow ael  and a word for lid  amrant  but although thereis an expression meaning eyelash it is a phrase blewyr amrant hair of the eyelid reminiscent of Latpalpebrrum pilus   The Breton for eyebrowabrant  seems akin to Welsh amrant eyelid whileCornish abrans eyebrow is patently closer to Bretonas

Gaelic mala also compare Bret malvenn above side by side with the synonymous braoi  whichmay be related to or borrowed from English brow Irish fabhra means eyelid and eyelash and attimes eye  Gaelic fabhradh appears to mean eyelashand may share the other senses of Irish fabhra Gaelic rosc alternating with rasg  means eyelid andeyelash as well as eye  Old Irish rosc meanteye            German

consideration of the varying ways in whichthe physiological features of brows lids and lashesare perceived in some languages despite their possibilityof being objectively observed is part of thelarger question of how the parts of the body arenamed  The often important factor of taboo seemsnot to operate here too conspicuously although thesuperstition of the evil eye is often a potent considerationIt may in fact be reflected in Irish macimreasan pupil of the eye probably literally son ofcontention or the like            English regards lungs as a plural at least itsspeakers do but German die Lunge is singular  Insome languages foot and leg are not differentiatednote Russian nog foot leg  Hebrew Chinese Japaneseand Khalkha Mongolian share that characteristicBut while Russian can denote arm and handby one word  ruk  Hebrew Chinese Japanese andKhalkha Mongolian have separate words for armand hand            In English as in German Dutch the Scandinavianlanguages etc we distinguish between fingersand toes physiologically and lexically  In some languagesSpanish Romanian Russian Czech GreekArabic Hebrew Welsh Irish and others the sameword denotes both finger and toe although it mustbe remembered that when there is need to specifythat toes and not fingers are meant or vice versathere are ways to do so in those languages            In some languages a distinction is made betweenchin and jaw in others not  Hair of the headis at times called by a different word from that forhair elsewhere on the body Welsh gwallt vs blew for example  In English this difference is not foundexcept possibly in medical contexts            We might well inquire whether a language lackinga certain distinction like that between eyelidsand eyelashes also lacks other distinctions andshares the lacks with other languages  Parallels aredifficult to discover except fragmentarily  Thoselanguages which show no difference in words for fingerand toe do not necessarily suffer if that is theright word the lack of distinction between lid andlash etc            A highschool Latin teacher used to give uswhat he called language correlations writing oneor two of them on the blackboard each day  Heaimed at general maybe universal claims andmentioned no languages by name  Some of his correlationsthat I still recall were Languages with anablative case will have no word for have   Languageswith the same word for green and blue haveno plural nouns or adjectives  Languages withmore than three degrees of comparison of adjectiveslack words for yes and no   Languages which donot distinguish thumb and finger have no word forhedgehog   Here he was no doubt pulling our legsor feet            It is possible to think of languages in which hisstrangely selected correlations apply  The firstcould be Latin the second Japanese a language hehad studied the third might be true of a Celtic languageetc  At any rate he never seemed to botherabout brows lids and lashes although his attitudewas sometimes supercilious                              Dictionaries for Advanced Learners and Users of Foreign Languages            It is widely acknowledged that complaints aboutmissing items in the range of dictionaries requiredby advanced learners and users of foreignlanguages are justified to a very considerable extentClearly distinctions need to be made about the particularfirst or native language L and the secondlanguage L of such learners if the above commonperception is to be substantiated  If we are talkingabout Finns attempting to learn Turkish or Koreanthen no one surely is going to argue that pointexcept to make the observation perhaps that suchhapless Finns are going to have to operate via aninterlingua and its dictionaries such as EnglishGerman or Russian  If on the other hand it is amatter of native speakers of English grappling withthe task of acquiring a sophisticated knowledge ofGerman or Russian then difficulties associated withdictionaries will be of a lesser order but there willstill be many occasions on which such learners willby reflex action stretch out a hand to grab hold of adictionary that simply does not exist            A root cause of this problem is the logically reasonablebut in reality fallacious contention that whatyou cannot find in a dictionary you are entitled tofind in a grammar and nota bene vice versa  Ofcourse we all know that there is a tangible overlapbetween dictionaries and grammars rather than a nomansland between them and this in spite of theirdifferent purposes  Given that grammars are oftenused on a systematic basisthe regularities dominatethe idiosyncrasiesgrammarians write and formatthem on that basis yet grammars are also usedexceedingly often on a singleshot basis a quick inand out just like a normal dictionary consultationIf learners want more than a valency pattern for aparticular verb or group of verbs or more than thetranslation equivalents of a single sourcelanguageword where do they turn  The traditional and oftencynicalsounding counsel given to students complainingabout this dilemma is Go away and readandor listen to twenty million words in your L andyou will find that the problem is diminished  Thecounselors hope is that the student will hone toquasiperfection a fine ability to detect capture andinternalize information about the occurrence cooccurrenceand patterning of lexis in context plus alot else besides  Maybe there was or is a subconsciousview that the path to L proficiency and successis open only to those who can summon up theintellectual energy and also physical dictionarymanhandlingstamina for the task  It is a mootpoint whether it is better for the student to readlet us saythe twenty million running words oftext or read the same ten million words twice oreven read the same five million words four timesover  Similar questions can reasonably be askedabout the homogeneity versus heterogeneity of subjectmatter and stylistic mode of this reasonably extensivematerial amounting to about one hundred toone hundred and fifty averagesized books            Let us assume that advanced students of a particularL have equipped themselves with the followingreference word books a top of the range LLand LL dictionary a college sized definingdictionary produced for and within their target Ldiscourse community the best available L synonymdictionary and thesaurus and a dictionary of proverbsand idioms  Ideally they should also own theirFL equivalent of Adrian Rooms Dictionary of GreatBritain  If this is not available they should start compilingtheir own on cards if necessary but ideally as acomputerized database  They should also have accessto a large encyclopedia written in the L  With thisbackup are they well prepared for the intricate taskof composing documents in their L on various topicsThey are probably reasonably well prepared ingeneral terms but not so in particular terms  Whatthey lack in terms of general lexical resources is acollocations dictionary and a synonym differentiatorsuch as in the case of a GermanDudensDie richtige Wortwahl  which subtitles itself as acomparative dictionary of senserelated expressionFor this aspect of L writing incidentally advancedRussianspeaking students of English mayhave recourse to the excellent EnglishRussian SynonymDictionary  by AA Rozenman and YDApresyan Russki

Deutschrussisches Synonymwrterbuch  byIV Rakhmanov et alii Russki Yazyk in   Thisthoroughly researched and crafted reference bookcontains approximately  entries each representinga synonymic series  All items are quasialignedwith translation equivalents and are illustratedby example sentencesnot citationsinGerman which are also given in Russian translationThe front matter of both of these dictionaries fromRussia includes substantial theoretical essays on thetheory of synonymy and on the lexicographic practicalitiesof arraying and presenting synonyms in dictionaryformat            It is clear that collocations dictionaries andsynonym differentiators may not exist at all in aparticular language community in fact very fewlanguage communities can boast of such resourcesThat is a great pity because that is exactly what advancedlearners need  In fact it is not stretchingthings too much to say that firstclass collocationalcontrol is the hallmark of the true L expert collocationalcontrol is normally the last linguistic subsystemto be mastered by learners who proceed toan advanced level  Correct deployment of collocationsis particularly important for anyone striving forauthenticity of performance within a particular professionalsociolect such as the language of medicineor economics            No one could claim that it is an easy task to createcollocations dictionaries the chief problem iswhere to draw the proverbial line on a spectrumranging from complete predictability usually on alefttoright basis to total volatility of association bymere juxtaposition for example corned beef vcheap beef   The dictionary makers job is to capturethe habitualisms without overloading the dictionarywith items which are putatively valid enough inabsolute terms by not in the statistical sense of significancederived via measurable cooccurrence            It has to be admitted that there are far too fewcollocations dictionaries around  In the Englishspeakingdictionary microcosm The Oxford Thesaurus has clearly stolen a march over all itsrivals in terms of size structure and depth of treatmentSynonym differentiation was evidentlyandrightlyseen as a crucial task and the thoroughnesswith which this task was carried out is one the dictionarysmost important assets  In fact the provisionof one example for each sense group within anentry is an innovative and pragmatically satisfactoryway of hinting at the possibility and permissibility ofcollocation with other words a writer whose nativelanguage is not English may have

 republishedby Hueber in  but dating back six decadeswas intended by its author as a reference workwhich would allow writers to formulate their ideas inGerman yet express them in English using typicallyEnglish modes of thought and linguistic templatesThe same author is noteworthy for his Petit Dictionnairede Style  which offers German speakersan open sesame to authentic French  This handbookwas conceived as a linguistic guide which wouldsomehow prevent its users from grabbing hold of aGermanFrench dictionary the moment their personalvocabulary ran out            Collocations dictionaries published in Russia foradvanced L learners of Russian date back a quarterof a century or so and have developed a very highdegree of variety and sophistication over the interveningyears  The aforementioned variety extendsfor instance from learners dictionaries of collocationsfor RSP Russian for specific purposes areasas disparate as agriculture materials science and sociopoliticaldiscourse  The main general collocationsdictionary is Slovar sochetaemosti slov russkogoyazyka Russian Wordcombinatory Dictionary byPN Denisov and VV Markovkin Russki Yazyk  Such is the depth of the lexicographicaltreatment that the dictionary whilst containing only articles occupies  pages            In Germany the nearest thing to a straight collocationsdictionary is E Agricolas regularly republishedWrter und Wendungen  written for Germansbut highly valuable for foreigners using German at anadvanced level  It is however worth examining HBeckers Stilwrterbuch Leipzig   Althoughcontaining a mere couple of hundred entriesor so the dictionary is valuable by virtue of the depthof treatment and the ramifications of the informationsupplied            Mention needs to be made finally of one otherpublication from Germany H Erks Zur Lexik wissenschaftlicherFachtexte Vols     Hueber  Its aim is to provide frequency data andmodes of use of the basic vocabulary of German academicdiscourse  The value of this work is diminishedby the fact that the citations given are merelysubsentence fragments from the corpus which wasassembled for the frequency study itself thus denyingusers the opportunity to make full use of thisimportant data            This last point opens the door for a plea or atleast a statement of a desideratum perceived by advancedusers of various Ls and by their teachersNotwithstanding the logistic difficulties of constructingsynonym differentiators and collocations dictionariesparticularly the latter it is now possiblefor information technology to deliver direct to socalledendusers lexical data retrieval systems ofgreat size power and usefulness  Any doubtingThomases should make arrangements to view anduse the CDROM implementations of dictionariesfrom such famous publishers as Oxford UniversityPress Langenscheidt and Robert  The writer ofthese lines believes that the CDROM implementationof Le Grand Robert  for instance is not only a paragonof dictionary content but of navigation softwareand of the retrieval tools provided  What advancedusers of various Ls need by comparison is ridiculouslysimple they need a lexical data retrieval systemisthis sophisticated enough to deserve theterm lexical database  which will allow them toenter a search word of interest either from L orL and view nothing more than an arbitrarily chosennumber of underlying corpus citations relatingto one targetlanguage lexeme so that they canget a feel for its semantic range and combinatorycollocatorypossibilities  Of course they should beable to choose how many citations what languagelevel they come from etc  They should also be ableto operate various controls to refine search strategiesstill when all is said and done all they want isauthentic citations and authentic collocations            The main benefit of having such a facility is toaccelerate learning and growth of confidence by dintof exposure to much more and

is aproduct of necessity and one of the most remarkabledevelopments in communication that has ever takenplace  Many have written on whether English willsupplant other languages but few have consideredwhether English among other things is simply goingto merge with many of them for certain purposesat least            This miscegenation is of course what has alwayshappened when people

doesnot have its own style of humor hence theproliferation of Irish jokes Jewish jokes Russianjokes Polish jokes etc  Humor is defined in theOED as that quality of action speech or writingwhich excites amusement and in MWIII as thatexpression of ideas in a happening an action a situationor an expression of ideas which appeals to asense of the ludicrous or absurdly incongruous  Weall know the highly beneficial effects of laughter onour physical mental and emotional wellbeingLuckily for us Caribbeans humor plays a great partin our daily lives and laughter is generally muchmore common than a gloomy face  Perhaps this isrelated to our downtoearth often rather unsophisticateduse of language especially at the folk level            A few examples from the Archives of the CaribbeanLexicography Project illustrate how our use oflanguage translates into laughter            In the s a certain manofthepeople councillorin an Eastern Caribbean island now independentit shall remain nameless could

were aSt Michael landlord a uniformed policeman andothers who she believed were undressed policeofficers carrying guns                        But if such superficial use of words suggests thattheir

any language ought to havea predictable regularity  A lot of builtin irregularitiesare merely inefficient  A proper languageshould click along like a Swiss watch doing its job ina nononsense way  As a native speaker of EnglishMalcolm has a difficult time  English has rulessome fairly regular rulesbut too many exceptionsThose arent exceptions I tell him there are subrulesHe glares at me sneaky deceiver  I am notgetting away with that one            Recently Malcolm got hold of a book on Sanskritand has been chewing away firmly at it  That is theway a language ought to be  I remind him that thereis only one Taj Mahaland that is a tomb  The massof humanity have to live in houses  Some hovels tooand caves and tents palaces are relatively few  Languagesbuilt to architects specifications are artificialand largely remain unspoken  Some are even unspeakableIf a language is to reflect what goes on inthe mind it must have a lot of flexibility tolerancefluency  The language genius exploits this flexibilityand fluencyand makes the best of it  The languagefirst learned fixes itself deeply in memory inthe fabric of the mind  It becomes normal it is theidiolectthe vehicle of thought unique to eachperson the basic layer  One is seldom aware of itbut it is still there underneath  Malcolms languageas he learned it in infancy is fixed  He does not see itas a set of rules it is simply there and he resentstampering with it  Then he has another set of rulesderived from his highschool English teacher MissMartinet about double negatives final prepositionsand other unquestionables that have an aura ofMount Sinai  Sometimes he sees me as a golden calf            Malcolm feels that language should be strictlylogical  He carries around Occams razorit is hisSwiss army knife  He has a sharp eye for any kind ofredundancy even when used deliberately for emphasisor to make a distinction or sense division  Arose is a rose is a rose so why say it three timesThere is no need for widowwoman as long as wehave the word widower   The country man whospeaks of a viper snake ought to know that vipers aresnakes and we do not need to be told so  And whenkids go swimming in the raw of course they are bareand they are naked so why barenaked  They arenot naked unless they are totally bare  Bare shouldmean totally too  Why insist  Excitement enthusiasmare always messing up logic  Also messing upthe language            Malcolm has working in his office an Englishwomanwho he thinks having been born Englishshould have more respect for the language  She isan exuberant person and it shows  I rather like herspontaneity but Malcolm finds it hard to take  Atoffice parties she finds the foods frightfully tasty ordreadfully nice and when they are covered withsugar or whipped cream they can be sinfully deliciousMalcolm cannot resist herhe has a sweettooth that forever betrays himbut he finds heroxymoronic style hard to bear  Oxymorons in generalhe says are well named and he is against themBut he is not beyond a grumbling pun on oxen andmorons  while looking hard at me  I have challengedhim with Popes line of the pun as the lowest formof wit but he says not if they are appropriate            Malcolm suspects great and dangerous socialforces underlying changes in the use of words  Notlong ago he had a running horror at what had happenedto the word awful   Milton he says had itright the way it should properly be full of aweaweinspiring an awful God   But in our populisttime with too many halfeducated people at largeawful has become etiolated  Nice wordone ofMalcolms favorites  And awesome seems now tohave gone the same wayamong teenagers at leasta raw brainless lot  I grant teenagers their lastfling of childish freedom before adulthood begins todescend  Malcolm matured earlier than I my occasionallapses into juvenility pain him  He is generallyforgiving he still has hopes for me            Malcolms objections come not only in mattersof logicthere is a moral tinge to them sometimesHe is against what seems deception selfcontradictionin public speechmaking  He finds it insidiousIn its linguistic form a speaker introduces hissubject by saying To this audience I need notexplain then goes on and explains it  To Malcolmthis is a kind of hypocrisy flattering the audienceby pretending they know something alreadywhen he feels pretty sure they do not  To tease himI recently made a list of such phrases It goes withoutsaying I hardly need to point out Itshould be unnecessary to note that I will not insiston the point but if I did And there are othersoldtimers such as Far be it from me to claim My list only put Malcolm into a dismal mood            I chatter about the psychology of speechmakingcatching and keeping an audiences attentionbut it does not impress him  Audiences shouldneed no flattery  Give them the facts the truth nosoft soap and that should be enough  I insist on theneed to repeat to emphasize even to exhort  Audiencesappreciate a bit of verbal legerdemain  WillRogers knew it and Barnum before him and ShakespearesAntony before them  To Malcolm it all reflectson the shameful gullibility of mankind and theamorality of language which should be at least logicallypure if also unfortunately anybodys strumpetotherwise            I have pleaded with Malcolm about the right oflanguage to an occasional holidayto have a bit offun  He admits the pleasure of a good punnot afalse or missed pun or a too obvious witless punbut one that activates a mental Leyden jar  But hefeels uncomfortable with the imitative uses of languagewhich often seem primitive and trivial  Onomatopeiasespeciallythe old bowwow theoryof language originit is too obvious and too limitedoral noises not language  Even when they becomeconventionalized echoic words are suspect  Theyare baby talk purely animal  They are not languageuntil they are elaborated until they develop rulessystem  I do not think Malcolm has ever seen a smallchild break the singleword language barrier and gethold of syntax a fundamental breakthrough in languagelearning  He favors a sort of Athenian approachlanguage bursts fullarmored from the browof Jove            He should follow a childs language learningnot sternly but curiously  It might impress him tohear the child regularize our odd plurals with mansand gooses and lifes  a subrule which he has to swallowwillynilly  And childrens imitative words andthe noises they make the words they invent as theyplay with their vocal apparatus and explore the possibilitiesof the language  Not children alone butadults rolling on their tongues such wondrous inventionsas discombobulate and goloptious and humongous funwordsfor special occasions word playIf all the world were playing holidays Malcolmquotes and blows the umpires whistle  He enjoysenforcing rules you do not have a game withoutrules I agree and add that rules have to be revisedfrom time to time not always on grounds of theorybut of experience learned in play  The thing toavoid is rigidity  Malcolm sniffs and tilts his chin            Malcolm bears with my frivolous ways for wehave been friends for many years  I find myself inventingwords from time to time and even gettingthem into print when they slip past weary or tolerantcopyeditors perhaps even on their meritsObviable is one of these beauties and brainworm isanother  I know I made them up all new thoughlexicographers might already have registered themThey just seem to come out naturally to fill a placewhere nothing else would quite do  I have notboasted of them to Malcolm but perhaps I should setup a subtle testslip them over on him not as mineand see the effect  One might pass on the flavor ofLatinism  But I shall never risk any syntactic

not to be fully understood neitherareall blunders  They flout logic  Jeffersonsclaim of unalienable rights in the Declarationof Independence is to Malcolm an egregious exampleof miscegenation where a Latin word is joinedto an AngloSaxon prefix  The fact that unalienablehad existed alongside inalienable for over a centuryis no excuse  I quote Miltons Alas what boots itwith uncessant care  Alas

Hall  traced his careeras an etymologist to a shipwreck  Son of a prosperouslawyer in Troy New York Hall completed hisstudies in engineering at Rensselaer in  and wasabout to graduate a second timefrom Harvard Collegein when his father sent him on an errandA younger brother inexplicably drawn by Danasgrim novel Two Years before the Mast  had runaway to a life of adventure at sea and their fatherordered Fitzedward to bring him home            Soon thereafter Hall found himself a castawayat the mouth of the Ganges and he chose to remainfirst in Calcutta where he became a journalist andteacher  Drawn to the study of Indian languages herose to professor of Sanskrit at Government CollegeBenares in  and commenced a career as editorand publisher of Sanskrit texts the first American todo so  In  he took an armed part in the suppressionof the Sepoy uprising and then rewardedhimself with a vacation in America and EuropeWhile he was in the United States William DwightWhitney Americas preeminent orientalist did allthat he could to persuade Hall to remain at homebut he could not prevail  On his way back to IndiaOxford awarded Hall an honorary doctorate in recognitionof his contribution to oriental learning            In  Hall left India to spend the rest of hislife in England  Whitneys campaign to find him anappointment at Harvard continued but with diminishedchances of success  In a letter to Charles EliotNortonlike Hall and Francis James Child a memberof the class of Whitney wrote resignedlyAnyhow one takes a kind of wicked satisfaction inseeing that England has to come even to America forher scholars in that department of Oriental studywhich it is most her duty and interest to cultivateOn settling at last in London Hall was appointedprofessor of Sanskrit Hindi and Indian jurisprudenceat Kings College London  In short order hewas made librarian of the Indian office and examinerin Indian languages for the Civil Service CommissionersHe continued the duties of examiner evenafter his retirement in  to Marlesford Suffolkwhen he completed his Sanskrit editing  Belatedlyin  Harvard awarded him an honorary doctorateand was rewarded by the bequest of his Indianmanuscripts and editions            Halls philological career had another side oneof special interest to readers of VERBATIM  As farback as  he wrote I began the practicewhich I have kept up ever since of desultorily jottingdown notes on points of English  He was then amere philological stripling of thirteen  Not until however did he compile these notes into bookform a volume with the splendid title Recent Exemplificationsof False Philology   In it he attacked vigorouslythree worthies wellknown for their opinionsabout EnglishWilliam Savage Landor Thomas DeQuincey and lengthily Richard Grant White  Allthree were inclined to uninformed etymology or ignorantcensure he alleged  In Modern English he harassed other selfproclaimed authoritiesand in both books three or four lines of textfloat above a dense mass of footnotes in tightly set sixpointtype  By this method he ensured that no claimwould stand without supporting evidence            Halls authority came from his citations a massso large that desultorily can hardly describe theintensity of his collecting  Before the OED  no onecould have easily located examples to dispute himthough Richardson Johnson as revised by Todd andLatham and Webster as revised by Goodrich allgave historical usages  Hall was immeasurably betterinformed than those he criticized and he recognizedthat a trustworthy dictionary must be founded onexamplesa thing never to be expected save as theresult of extensive cooperation and judicious subdivisionof labour  Naturally enough he was soonrecruited by James Murray as a collaborator in thepreparation of the OED   In the preface to the firstvolume of that great dictionary Murray thanked Hallexpansively for his voluntary and gratuitous serviceThose who are familiar with the pages of hisModern English  his English Adjectives in able and his numerous articles and papers on specialpoints of English know with what an amazingwealth of evidence the author illustrates the historyof every word idiom or grammatical usage uponwhich he touches  In the preface to volume  Murraydeclared to the Dictionary his death is an incalculableloss a loss that would indeed have been irreparablebut for the fact that he left directions thatall his ms quotations references notes and memorandashould be handed over to the Editor and thatwe should have the free use of the books in his ownextensive library to which these referred  Hall wassimilarly generous in opening his collections to JosephWright for the English Dialect Dictionary  andto the workers engaged in the preparation of WhitneysCentury Dictionary             Like many people Hall grew increasingly conservativeas he aged but his allegiance to usage asthe foundation of judgments about English remainedfirm  In particular he was suspicious of languagereformers who wished to revive or fabricate AngloSaxonsynonyms for Latinate words  Masses ofolder English he thought had no more chance ofrevival than waterclocks and tinderboxes  In asentence intended to poke fun at the Saxonists Halldeclared Our lingual hybridism is ineradicableRomantic yearnings for an imaginary past were tohim anathema and conservatives of many kindswere early subject to his critical strictures Therights of man the conservative has gradually grownused after long years of disquietude to hear talkedof without apprehension of catalepsy but you mustwait for his son or for his sons son if you would geta candid hearing for the rights of woman            Despite his long residence abroad Hall was selfconsciouslyAmerican and latterly all too ready tocede authority to the British in matters of EnglishToward the end of his life he wrote If egotism fora moment is pardonable no false shame deters mefrom avowing that though I have lived away fromAmerica upwards of fortysix years I feel to thishour in writing English that I am writing a foreignlanguage and that if not incessantly on my guard Iam in peril of stumbling  What a pained admissionfrom an acknowledge authority on the languageparticularly one who had earlier celebrated the revolutionaryfervor in the United States that had ledat the end of the th century to forswearingsupine parrotry  How different from his declarationat the outset of his career as a philologist Asregards everything else so as regards language thespirit of rigid conservatism operates as a principle ofunalloyed evil and mischief            Halls disputatious style in his many contributionsto magazines led him into controversy and thememorial notices published after his death were oftencircumspect  In one a lifelong friend declaredDr Hall had all the aggressive confidence of modestyadequately equipped a judgment that concealscriticism in praise  Another opined that hisprose was apt to be difficult reading  Had he combinedwith his vast learning a light and playful stylehe would not more effectually have strewn the fieldwith the slain but he would have made the processas delightful as it was edifying  As it is his works area permanent resource against the ignoramus and thecharlatan who seek to make the English languageinto their own likeness  The Dictionary of AmericanBiography is rather more blunt His style wastoo subject to his own criticism to be natural it wasselfconscious and pedantic            Despite their often dry character Halls worksbear rereading not least because of his refusal tobewail the state of the language No unprejudicedperson if he takes the trouble to observe and considercan soberly maintain that English is deterioratingYet above all Hall raised the standard ofdiscussion on the bulwarks of evidence and evenwhen he was captious or carping he compelled respectThus Ralph Olmsted Williams often engagedHall in the pages of the Dial and of Modern LanguageNotes these exchanges Williams published inSome Questions of Good English  recognizingthat with such an adversary as Dr Hall it was difficultto claim victory even when claiming the benefitof the last word  Of course Hall was often dismissedbythe British as a foreigner unworthy tojudge English usage and by the Americans as an anglophileand expatriate  But the most serious scholarsof the day took him seriously and if he did notmake uninformed allegations about English impossiblehe at least made them subject to the trial ofevidence from usage                              Australia and the Environment the First Fifty Years            Australia has recently in  celebrated itsbicentenary  The Australian National Dictionarywas published in that year and for the firsttime it has been possible to assemble and describethe set of lexical innovations used in one particularsemantic field that is the words and meanings ofwords that register perceptions and utilizations ofthe Australian environment  I have tried to build myargument not on the overinterpretation of singleapparently key words but on the evidence of the useof those words within a set within a context ofgroupings of semantically related words that gainweight and suggest directions of enquiry from theirmass  But the problem of overinterpretation remains            This article is concerned with the first fifty yearsof settlement  and begins with the twocollocations Crown land and waste land  whichsometimes coalesce in the uniquely Australian wastelands of the Crown  Crown land is used as it hasbeen in Canadian English of land that is either inalienableor unalienated of land that is either reservedfor the purposes of the Crown or the Crownsagents or held in the name of the Crown  In theformer sense it gives way to government land or tomore specific terms for parcels of land like governmentdomain government farm government gardengovernment ground government paddock governmentreserve and government run  in the latter itcomes increasingly to refer to land that is availablefor grant lease or purchase to distinguish landwhich is variously described as unlocated unoccupiedor from slightly later in the s unsettledfrom land which is located or settled  Waste land isused as it had been in American English and laterin New Zealand English to distinguish unusedlanduncultivated because unoccupied landfromland under cultivation or in some way improved aspasture  It is thus synonymous with wild land alsoso used in American English or with the apparentlycontradictory wild government ground described in as covered with trees and grass never usedbefore except for feeding blackfellows kangarooscattle horses and sheep  This description recognizesthat as yet unalienated land might have beenused as wild pasture just as an  critic of bureaucratesecan complain that the Crown landsare very frequently in Government phrase styledthe waste lands of the Crown though theycannot with propriety be called waste lands forthey are applied to the only purpose speaking ofthem in general to which they can ever be appliedgrazing                        European arrival in these waste lands was describedin terms of settlement and location   Both arevery much terms of occupation  Settlement is used in of the British community as established orfounded in the colony in  of a small town orplace where people have settled or establishedthemselves  The verb settle is used transitively of theaction of peopling a place as in to settle a districtintransitively of the action of settling oneself as into settle in the colony  By  the unoccupiedland is so designated and before  the settled districtsor settled lands are so identified  Settler  from was roughly synonymous with colonist I sayroughly because WH Breton in  distinguishesbetween settlers the farmers only and coloniststhe whole of the free inhabitants though thismay be an academic distinction as John DunmoreLang in the next year remarks that spirit of irreconcilableenmity to standing timber almost uniformlyevinced by all Australian colonists  Thepoint is that settlers or colonists  they had come tooccupy land and through occupation to utilize it  Locationis more difficult because its sense history inAmerican English is complex but in the Australianusage of the  period it meant either anallocation or grant of land or the act of establishing asettler in a place in which case it was synonymouswith settlement as in the country will shortly bethrown open to general location  To locate meant similarlyto allocate a parcel of land to settle oneselfon a piece of land or to select a piece of landLocated districts was synonymous with settled districtsthe limits of location or boundaries or boundsthe further extent of settlement the boundary withinwhich land was surveyed and available for legal tenurethe border  as it was also known  The business ofallocating land within the limits of location requiredland agents  a Land Board Land Commissioner landfund land orders and led as early as  tolandjobbing and speculation by landjobbers andlandsharks                        There was a continuing expansion into newcountry new districts new settlements as land wastaken up opened up or as the pace grew thrownopen   Movement towards the interior

landscape onwhich the settlers were imposing themselves andtheir industry  From the start there was a tensionbetween resemblance and difference between recollectionof the old world and recognition of thenew  On the one hand there were names whichwere qualified before being applied like wild currantwild fig wild geranium wild indigo wild parsnipwild spinach wild yam or native flax naboxnative cherry native cranberry native flax nativegrass native myrtle native parsley native plumor names in which the qualifier is a color as in bluegum green wattle white honeysuckle  On the otherthere were new names borrowings from Aboriginallanguages like boobook dingo koala kurrajongwallaby wallaroo waratah and wombat all fromDharuk the Sydney language descriptive nameslike blackbutt bottlebrush duckbill flooded gumand gumtree or popular adoptions of scientificnames like banksia callistemon casuarina boroniaeucalyptus and platypus  In generic terms this ismanifested in the replacement of woods by bushonce the inadequacy of woods is recognized and bythe redefinition of words like forest and plain  Theimportant contrast is between the bush vegetationin its natural state country covered in such vegetationand brush and scrub as subsets of bush on theone hand and on the other country that is naturallyopen or that has been cleared an activity which gavethe language to burn off as well

           Verbal Aggression in The Wizard of Oz            Most North Americans and many others worldwidehave watched the movie classic TheWizard of Oz many times either as children or laterwith their children  Yet few viewers are aware ofthe considerable amount of negative language inthat childrens movie  There are some ninety occurrencesof namecalling insults taunts threats selfdeprecationharsh commands scolding sarcasticremarks and other verbal aggression in that filmUnless ones ears are tuned to listen for verbal aggressionone simply does not notice most negativelanguage  This holds true for The Wizard of Oz  toocertainly most of it has escaped the attention of mostpeople even though they might have watched theannual television showing for decades            Lyman Frank Baums book The WonderfulWizard of Oz  is quite different from the filmversion not only in content but also in languageFor the books text I consulted The Wizard of Oz edited by Michael Hearn  for the movie TheWizard of Oz The Screenplay  edited by Noel LangleyFlorence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf            Most of the aggression and verbal abuse appearonly in the movie but not in the book  Among thebooks few maledicta mild and colorless ones atthatare You are nothing but a big coward Dorotheyto the Lion  This Lion is a coward   Scarecrowto the Queen of the Field Mice

harmless but such timelesspearls as You clinking clanking clattering collectionof caliginous junk are as effective and amusing todayas they were fifty years ago            Actually much of the verbal

more suggestive of its fascinatingand ancient history  The Viking invasion ofthe eighth and ninth centuries gave a strong practicalbias to the earlier existing Celtic culture andmany Norse words remain in the dialect  These givean arresting piquancy to the many proverbs still survivingin Shetland            Most of these are crisp and pithy in the extremewith an admirable precision of thought  A nativecaution is typical of many like Better da ill kentknown as da guid untried  which roughly parallelsthe old saying Better the devil you know butexpressed rather more forcefully                           Dere few rodds at doesna hae a mirae at da end ohim sums up the realism even cynicism of theShetlander and more wariness still in Never hve ootthrow out dirty water till da clean be in Amusinglythis represents a caution against burning onesboats unless one is sure of a safe exit            Exasperation with the young is a topic in manyof these proverbs  The sore feelings of a harassedparent bringing up mischievous boys might besoothed by the Shetland motto Mony a pellit troublesomefoal haes made a good horse or Dere brokenpots in aa lands  as a reminder that the problemis universal            Yet overindulgence of the young was firmlychecked by the reminder that Its late time to siftwhen da sids chaff is ida bread  meaning disciplineis only effective when started at an early age            Love courtship and marriage as might be expectedcalled forth more gems of wisdom  Too suddenand ardent a romance was typically greeted byhead shaking among the elders who had seen it allbefore  Cald is da kale at cls ida plate an cald is dalove at starts ower haet Cold is the kale that cools onthe plate and cold is the love that starts over hot            Spinsters were consoled by the proverb Betterlang lowse daa ill teddered  and a grieving jilted girlwas advised by the motto Better ee hert braks dan aada wirld winders  warning her not to show her feelingstoo strongly            More cheerful was the proverb A bonny bride isshn buskit well dressed but the wedding of twovery unattractive people was rather unkindlysummed up as Hairy butter is good enyoch for siddycoarse bread                        Such native shrewdness means excellent judgmentof character and more Shetland proverbs echothis  The hypocrite was neatly described as Hits illfor da kettle crook tae ca da kettle black  while  Caffchaff aye flees heicher flies higher dan guidcoarn summed up a false friend who deserts one in troubletrouble            True comradeship however is not forgotten  Afriend ida wye is better dan a penny ida pocket  butneighbor problems call forth Yer can win by aa yerkin bit by yer neebir ye canna win   As for the damagecaused by gossip  Ill news is lack a fitless heddercowe a witty warning that tittle tattle can travellike a rootless clump of heather            The sheer toil experienced by most Shetlandersis another source of proverbs Every mans back isshapit for his ain burden  and A moothful is as guid asa belly fu firmly reminds of the days of real want            Grit is advised rather than brooding in hardtimes  Glowerin ida lum by the chimney neverfilled da pot   As for time of plenty coming rapidlyafter scarcity watch out for Lang want is nae maethainin             Sadly the special motto of the crofterfishermanconcerns the hardship caused by lack of funds forinvestment  Da riven torn sleeve hauds de haundback   Naturally the lack of ready funds holds oneback from vital purchase of an improved farm implementor even a

XVIII  has his reservationsunfairly it seems to me about AD Mills ADictionary of English PlaceNames But he couldhave mentioned a most important function that thebook fulfills that of setting straight the many misapprehensionsregarding the origins of English placenamesIt is not just that people like a colorful orromantic origin for a name and one that they canreadily understand but that folk etymologies themselvesare perpetuated by reference works andguide books normally well regarded for their trustworthinessand authority            It is they therefore as much as anybody whoare to blame for the continuing fiction that Abingdonmeans town of the abbey that Boston is named forSt Botolph that Coventry means place of the abbeythat the second word of Leighton Buzzard representsFrench beau dsert that Lichfield meansfield of the corpses that Maidstone means Medwaytown that Morpeth means moor path that Redruthmeans town of the Druids that Southend is socalled because it is at the southern end of Essex thatWestminster is a minster west of St Pauls Cathedraland so on  At least Mr Mills lays all these revenantsto rest            Take Coventry for example and turn to the generalreference books and guides Coventre theCouentrev of Domesday Book may derive from aconvent of the Saxon period  Blue Guide to England It probably owes its origin to the erectionin the th c of an AngloSexon convent  TheNew Shell Guide to England  Established underthe protection of a Saxon convent in the th century The New Shell Guide to Britain    Yesthey are cautious and do not explicity derive Coventryfrom convent but they do imply that the wordis the source of the name                           Boston has long had its name linked with StBotolph and is explicitly interpreted by the BlueGuide as St Botolphs Town  The connection isalso mentioned in other works such as EverymansEncyclopaedia  Its name is said to be detivedfrom Botolphs Town St Botolph havingfounded a monastery here in             But all these origins are either just plain wrongor at any rate highly suspect            So what do the names mean  Abingdon meansbbas hill Boston means Btwulfs stone Conventrymeans Cofas tree Leighton Buzzard is namedfor the Busard family who owned land here in theth century Lichfield means open land nearLetocetum the latter name itself meaning graywood Maidstone probably means stone of themaidens ie where the girls gathered Morpethlike it or not means murder path Redruth a Cornishname means red ford Southend arose at thesouthern end of Prittlewell parish Westminster iswest of the City of London            How can one be so sure  Because the forms ofthe names as they are recorded over the years telluse so  To put it broadly we must be guided by languageas well as by history or geography  Historicevents and geographical attributes themselves frequentlyserve to promote many of these false etymologiesIt cannot be denied that Abingdon aroseby an abbey for example or that Maidstone is onthe Medway  St Botolphs church Boston is moreovera noted landmark the Boston Stump is morecanalso readily envisage the Bedfordshire countrysidearound Leighton Buzzard as at one time being abeautiful wild place  The village of BeaudesertHenleyinArden Warwickshire has a name thatreally does mean this            Of course one cannot be one hundred per centcertain about the exact meaning of every nameThat is way it is necessary to say probably aboutthe meaning of Maidston  But this origin is muchmore likely than the one first quoted            Maybe this is the place to shatter a few moreillusions not restricting the names to England asMills does but extending them to include otherwellknown places in Britain  The pseudooriginshave all been recorded in print even

                 Oxford does not derive its name from nearby Osneydespite ecclesiastical links with this place  Itmeans what it says ford where oxen crossThe alternative origin here was doubtless proposedfrom the outrageous idea that a venerableuniversity city should have such a rustic name                                 Rutland the historic county of which Oakhamabove was the county town

                    In the Name of Revolution            Revolution does not invariably or even usuallyhave much effect on language  The EnglishPuritan Revolution or Civil War in some ways culturallythe most radical of social upheavals so annihilatedreligious artifacts created in England beforeit that they are preciously rare today yet it affectedthe English language hardly at all even temporarilyThe survival after the American Revolution of suchnames in the former British colonies in North Americaas Georgetown Georgia and New England evidencethat the revolutionary spirit in the future USAhad little effect on nomenclature  The same can besaid of Mexico where a few words like Reforma andejido took on new meanings during and after theRevolution but where with the exception of somestreet names toponyms remained largely unaffectedGuadalupe remained Guadalupe  and Monterreyremained Monterrey             With the possible exception of the French whotried changing even the names of the months to memorializetheir revolution the Russians make moreof their language than any other people about whoselanguage I know anything  But whereas the changeswrought in French by the French Revolution werecanceled by the Thermidorean reaction in thenewly formed and freshly named Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics more commonly called the USSRor in Cyrillic CCCP  wholesale changes of toponymsfollowing changes of personal names did notreally set in till the Soviet Thermidor brought Stalinto dictatorial power            In Russia it was not names alone that werechanged in the language of the revolutionary countryThe alphabet was trimmed of a letter that hadbecome phonetically superfluous as c has become inEnglish and the orthography was simplified by theomission of the hard sign after final hard consonantsMore subtle effects were introduced through Communistdiction  For example Lenins famous definitionof Communism Communismthat is Sovietrule plus the electrification of the whole countrywith its est and plyus strikes me as rather unRussianas Communist jargon  And the profusion ofacronyms that inundated the Russian language owedmuch to revolutionary brusqueness  In Solzhenitsynsbrilliant title for his expos of Soviet forcedlaborcamps Arkhipelag GULag  he exploits the uglinessinherent in one of these acronyms  New termslike apparatchik kolkhoz and khozraschet were inventedold words like komissar soviet  and tovarishchwere given new meanings and some Russianwords of both kinds were borrowed into other languagesincluding English            Until fairly recently the Latinate Russian termnomenclatura meant about the same thing as in Englishand other languages  The  edition of theSoviet Tolkovyi Slovar Russkogo Yazyka definesnomenclatura as The totality of appellations employedin any specialization  No other definition isgiven  But the noun has acquired a secondary meaningin Russian the privileged and operative personnelof a Communist party  It is with this secondarymeaning that the word has been borrowed from Russianinto English as well as into French and otherlanguages            There is logic in the semantic drift of a derivativeof the Latin word for name to mean the toppersonnel in a Communist state  Like Christiansjoining a religious order some old Bolshevikschanged their names  The ostensible reason for suchname changes was to confuse the tsarist police butconsideration of the root meanings of the nameschosen by the revolutionaries reveals that the sobriquetswere at least as much noms de guerre as nomsde plume or cover names  Ulyanov became Lenin aname probably suggested by a strike of gold minerson the Lena River  But Ilyich as Lenin liked to becalled was a relatively modest manas long as hegot his way  Dzhugashvili selected the Russian wordfor steel stal as the root of his revolutionaryname the  in and ov off ev suffixes of Russiansurnames being only surname indicators  Rosenfeldturned to Stone Kamenev  Scriabin to Hammer Molotovand Peshkov became Bitter Gorky  Bronsteinperhaps out of a Jewish sense of irony providedthe exception to prove the rule by borrowingthe surname of an Odessa jailer Trotsky                        Despite all that embalmers and mausoleums cando people are highly perishable soon gone fromthis earth while cities and geographic sites lastlonger  So as Ilyichs body was eternalized in embalmingfluids or duplicated in wax as some skepticsbelieve and displayed much like the relics ofsaints under an impressive mausoleum in RedSquare against the Kremlin wall the city created bythe westernizing tsar and named for himself with awestern German name SanktPeterburg  was renamedLeningrad  Tsaritsyn was renamed for Stalingrad being the Russian equivalent of ton or  burgin English  And other figures in the Soviet pantheonor nomenclatura were likewise immortalized Samarabecame Kuibyshev Ekaterinburg was renamedSverdlov Simbirsk was renamed Ulyanovsk  a derivativeof Lenins original surname Nizhnii Novgorodwas renamed Gorky and so on across the map ofRussia and to a lesser extent of the USSR                        As far as language particularly toponymy isconcerned what has been called the Second RussianRevolution was adumbrated by the recoiling inhorror from Stalin and his works that followedKhrushchevs address to the Twentieth Party Congressin   Stalingrad was renamed VolgogradOf nine toponyms created to honor Stalin that arelisted in the index of a  Soviet atlas not one isincluded in a  Soviet dictionary of geographicnames  But the way in which names were changedin the period of destalinization differed significantlyfrom the reversion to tsarist names in theperiod of glasnost and perestroika  Stalingrad didnot become again Tsaritsyn nor did Stalin Peak revertto an earlier name but rather was renamedCommunism Peak  Stalinabad the capital of TadzhikRepublic did regain its original Tadzhikname of Dushanbe  but here the change was backto the old name of a caravan stop and had nothingto do with tsarist Russia            Going back to SanktPeterburg from Leningradwas reversion with a vengeance literally  It hasbeen said that some people born in Petrograd as StPetersburg was renamed with a Slavic calque inWorld War I have lived out their lives in Leningradand will die in SanktPeterburg  SanktPeterburg isawkward is unSlavic unRussian grating  Peterscity has hardly ever been called that in conversationalRussian  Peterburg is the name in common useand is the title of Belyis novel about the city  Aninformal slightly irreverent name corresponding tosuch slangy American contractions as Chi Phillyand Frisco that spans the official mutations is Piterpronounced roughly like English Peter             In November  when I mentioned to a residentof SanktPeterburg my distaste for the restoredofficial name she shrugged and remarkedWell the thing was to get rid of the Lenin   Nothinglaid bare the latent loathing of Communismeven at its best in Russia so strikingly as the changeby referendum from Leningrad to SanktPeterburg The change was made by popular demand despitethe plea of older residents that it not be made tillthey who had heroically withstood the Germansiege of Leningrad were dead and gone  The renamingof both Leningrad and Stalingrad was historicallyand psychologically costly because nothing that hashappened in either city amounts to nearly so muchas their roles in World War II  One can hardly sayThe defeat of von Paulus army at Volgograd wasthe turning point of the war  Conversely when citieslike Kuibyshev and Sverdlovsk or institutions likethe Kirov Theater or streets like Gorky Street regainedtheir original names it was rather as if theyhad got back on track as if they had been on a sidingsince say the tsar and his family were murdered atEkaterinburg            Like the October Revolution the socalled SecondRussian Revolution has brought changes to theRussian language that in some cases have spilledover into English and other languages  Glasnost andperestroika are obvious examples of old Russianwords that have acquired new revolutionary significanceand been borrowed with their new meaningsExamples of words drawn into the Russian vocabularyby recent revolutionary developments aremafia miting mass meeting and its verb form mitingovatand biznes and biznesmen in a nonpejorativesense  There is also a tendency to resurrectwords current in tsarist times and play around withthem  For example the Sunday supplement of Izvestiafor November   has an article on divorcein Russia that is titled Your Ladyship DameSeparation            During the period of destalinization Stalin Peakin the Pamirs the highest point in the USSR  wasrenamed Communism Peak  One wonders whetherthe mountain has been rerenamed or soon will beCapitalism Peak  Free Market Mountain  Well nothe peaks next appellation will probably be a Tadzhikname since the mountain is in TadzhikistanExamples of this kind of national restoration of localnames are the renaming of Stalinabad already mentionedand the renaming of the capital of KyrgyzstanFormerly renamed for the Soviet military heroFrunze it is now again called Bishkek  which I taketo be Kyrgyz for something            What is to be the fate of the Russian language inthe fragmented formerly brotherly republics  Ihave noticed that on televised newscasts LithuaniansGeorgians and Armenians almost always speakto reporters or their interpreters in fluent RussianA Viennabased cotton broker whom I met in SanktPeterburgin November  was negotiating withUzbeks in Russian  At about the same time a youngUzbek on the train between Moscow and Petersburgseemed perfectly at home in Russian I suspect moreso than he would have been in Uzbek  On the otherhand a few years ago I met a Lithuanian film makerin Tashkent who spoke or would speak no Russian atall  Perhaps Russian in most of the former Soviet empirewill be grudgingly retained as an economic andmaybe even political lingua franca somewhat likeEnglish in India  Conceivably especially in the Balticstates English could become the working languagefor trade and technology and even have acultural impact like Demotic Greek in the Mediterraneanbasin in classic times  But one can hardlyimagine that SanktPeterburgPetrogradLeningradSanktPeterburg will ever be called Peterston                               Meditation on media            Graham Green in the second of his autobiographicalbooks Ways of Escape  told this about hisfriend Evelyn Waugh Evelyns diaries have beenjoyfully exploited by the media a word that hascome to mean bad journalism  Yes of course  But Ihave noticed that is is principally the windier electronicjournalists and advertising and PR gentrywho like to use the word media often pronouncedMEEja whereas those print journalists who havesensitivity in English usage rarely use it                           Websters New World Dictionary gives this asone of several definitions for medium a means ofcommunication that reaches the general public andcarries advertising  Then it points out that in thissense a singular form media plural medias  is nowsometimes heard  I was afraid that something likethat would happen  Perhaps before long the fancierspeakers and writers will begin to use mediae as theplural  Actually that is the accepted plural for themedia that is the middle coat of the wall of a bloodor lymph vessel                           Medium was used in England in the late thcentury with respect to newspapers and media mayhave had some use in that sense during the th centuryBut the plural has come into full flower onlyduring the middle years of this century  It was notgiven in the  edition of The Concise Oxford Dictionary but is in the two most recent editions            Now we have an unseemly horde of derivativesA few times I have been called a mediaperson becausefor many years I have done a little freelancingfor newspapers and magazines  I have also beencalled a POB printoriented bastard because I haveonly flimsy interest in radio and television except asa consumer of some of what they have to offer            A word that could be useful if it were not soabominable is mediamorphosis which someone in academiacoined to designate the distortion or transformationof facts in some of the media  Then thereis the media event  an event staged deliberately andcunningly even manipulatively for extensive coverageby the media it has also been called a pseudoevent             A person who has qualities that make him attractiveto the media especially television is nowsaid to be mediagenic   I once met at a conference aman who gloried in the title media coordinator Ilearned that his principle duties were taperecordingand filmprojecting  If you are mediashy you do notlike being interviewed or reported on by mediapersons                                       Media fragmentation is the marketing conceptthat there can be too many outlets for a successfulsales campaign customers are assailed by so manyappeals for their business that the campaign backfiresThis results when the experts have not accuratelymeasured media weight  whatever that may be                              But there is a word for it  As a professionaltranslator who

can also mean accidentallyAnd se me cay cannot be rendered even literallyas it fell itself to me its meaning is somethingmore akin to it slipped away or out of my handsand fell  This type of

Adverbial Collocations            Most of those who learned English as a nativelanguage have not even the slightest idea of theproblems facing people who learn it as a foreign languageThose who do not have to give a secondthought to the idiomaticity of English word ordercan count themselves doubly blessed the systemdoes not yield readily to rules as native speakersknow from listening to the speech of foreigners whohave not quite mastered it regardless of how longthey have been using the language  Thus it is withthe greatest tolerance and sympathy that one approachesthe review of a book that in its first fiftypages attempts to provide users with some inklingas to what is going on in English word orderwhether the book was written by a native speaker ora foreigner            From a hint given on page  one gathers thatKozlowska studied at Edinburgh University fromher facility with the English used in her discussion ofcollocations one gains the impression that she hasexcellent control of the language  But difficultiesbegin to become apparent when one investigates heranalysis of English collocations            For those unfamiliar with the term collocation a quotation from the opening words of the book isusefulWhat is a collocation  It can be said to be a setof two or more words that frequently occur injuxtaposition and that seem to fit together  Wesay a pretty girl and a beautiful woman but ahandsome man  We say drive fast and expandrapidly but get tired quickly  It will be noticedthat in each of these examples the meaning of thevarious modifiers is basically the same but differentwords are used to express it depending onthe word that is modified p                         If we call the way the speakers of a given languageputs its words together idiom  then the process ofseparating out the resulting phrases produces collocations An idiom  a combination of two or morewords the meaning of which is different from theliteral meaning of the sum of its components likekick the bucket red herring  is distinguished fromthe concept of idiom  which refers to the natural orderand combination of words by a native speakerUnfortunately we do not have separate words forthe two in English in French the red herring type isconveniently called idiotisme and the conceptualone is called idiome   So far English speakers haveshunned calling anything they say an idiotism sothe ambiguity remains            It scarcely needs me to point out that Englishword order is indescribably complex so it is no smallwonder that in a brief work like this while the authorhas labored mightily and successfully to identifymany of its features she has inevitably failed tocover all contingencies            The first disagreement I have with her is in heruse of the term homonym  which she defines as aword looking the same but differing in meaningfrom another word p   She then proceeds tocall see physically and see comprehendhomonyms as well as provoke anger and provokecause run physical sense and run work functionand attack physically and attack verbally  Ieschew the term homonym because it suffers from aninherent ambiguity a homograph is to lexicographersat least a word that is spelled the same asanother but has a different etymology  bear  animalbear  carry bore  carriedbore  drill bore  tirebore  tide wave a homophone is a word thatsounds exactly like another but is spelled differently bearbare bierbeer boreboar   In this contexthomonym  which is usually defined as a word that ispronounced or spelled like another but having a differentmeaning is ambiguous if not inaccurate forthe implication is that homonyms are differentwords            In her care to be precise the author errs bywriting The language is British  No US expressionsare given  As it happens of course most ofwhat is described is American English as well so thesecond part of the statement is incorrect            As Koslowska correctly points out the choice ofadverb or adjective depends largely on the verb adverbor substantive being modified  The problemarises with the enormous flexibility of metaphor accordedby language we can use provocative ofwords situations and even lowcut dresses dependingon the focus of emphasis of what is being provokedI should not like to have to face the task oflisting all the adverbs that might be used with theverb run  even if it is restricted to cars smoothlyquietly silently uninterruptedly fitfully intermittentlyefficiently well faultlessly beautifully perfectlypoorly badly sluggishly economicallyswiftly rapidly quickly and then one must be preparedto add the multiword phrasal modifiers likewithout a hitch as if it would never stop like a clocklike clockwork  etc  There is not a finite number Iam sure but it must be a large number  The authoris spared an exhaustive listing by the constraints ofher corpus British newspapers which provides arepresentative listing but barely scratches the surfaceof the language            I would take issue with the analysis of ACTIVEONLY ACTIVEPASSIVE and PASSIVE ONLY constructionsif only because one of the nastiest areas ofgrammatical analysis of English lies in distinguishingbetween passivesthat is past participlesand adjectivesWe would say for example that gone in Hehas gone is a past participle but an adjective in He isgone if only because English does not use the verbto be as an auxiliary the way French does allegedin it was alleged is clearly a past participle but in thealleged culprit it is an adjective  It is set forth pthat contrive something can be modified by brilliantlyneatly or skilfully only in the PASSIVE withcleverly ingeniously restricted to its ACTIVEPASSIVEreflexes but that is not so for we can say They brilliantlyneatlyskilfullytreacherouslynefariouslycontrived to make the blame fall on the chairman The sentence Napoleon badlyignominiously defeatedthe Austrians and Russians is called wrongon the grounds that badly and ignominiously likeheavily thoroughly utterly can be used only with apassive verb but we can say Napoleon defeated theAustrians and Russians badly or ignominiously atAusterlitz without violating natural English idiom            In a short section in which Postmodifying adverbswith adjectives are discussed confusion isconfounded by juxtaposing stiff neck with We wereworried stiff   The latter is not readily analyzable bynormal parsing for if we are drawn to retain theadjectival nature of stiff instead of conceding that itmight be used as an adverb we are obliged to characterizeworried as having taken on the guise of acopula

pofaced treatment the subjectreceives in this analysis though the fault cannotbe said to lie with the author  The subject alas callsfor jokes to be explained surely the most painfulexperience that could be dreamt up by the mind ofwoman just to give them equal time Torquemadado your worst  It is hard to believe that anyonecould survive the mental thumbscrew that explainingjokes inflicts even if one has not got a joke andits explanation is in a sense welcomeafter all noone likes to feel left outwhat humor it might oncehave possessed is crushed out of it  I have tried towrite about humor and have found it such a humorlesschore that I have given up usually after oneparagraph  There is a great deal to be said aboutjokes and humor in general and it is hard to understandwhy the subject is so exasperatingly boringPerhaps it is because there is a huge difference betweensomethings being funny and the explanationof why it is funny often given to someone who doesnot think it is            Those jokes in ones native language that needexplanation are usually those that have referencesoutside the ken of the listener  Ms Chiaro treats notonly these but when she hits full stride the difficultiesin translating jokes between languages whereeven the explanations are often hard to get acrossbecause of either sociocultural differences linguisticdifferences or both  Puns are a common source ofjokes especially those that have come to be calledoneliners  In a recent letter in Sunday TimesBooks  October  a West Sussex headmasterwrote as followsFor years it has been subediting practice toheadline pieces in a punning manner in theBooks section of October  for example wehave The art of friction Tartar sourceReef encounters Class menagerieMy mild amusement at this is after a couple ofdecades turning to mild irritation any chance ofa change                        Jokes involve the use of language most of thetime though the author acknowledges the existenceof visual jokes too  One of the shortcomings of thebook is the failure to cover even minimally the majortypes of jokes  For example the current trendamong standup comediansparticularly as reflectedin the persistent American television broadcastsfrom various improvsis simply to retailcommon ordinary everday events and rely on theaudience to laugh appreciatively at the perceptionof the comedian to point out our foibles  I supposethat can be classified as a reaction of mildamusement at the cleverness displayed but it toosoon cloys            The author does not appear to have reached seriousconclusions at the end of the book in a shortsection titled Conclusion she offers some useful observationsabout expressions of humor and aboutthe difficulties encountered by a teacher of Englishas a foreign language in trying to impart to studentsthe linguistic skills required to understand Englishliterature but these observations can scarcely betermed conclusions for no coherent theory hasactually been set forth in the book            Chiaro always more that than oscuro in herpresentation is not only not to be blamed for thelack of theory but merits praise for having tackled asubject that most of us dread and that has not beentreated satisfactorily by any of its commentatorsfrom Plato to Freud to Hockett et al  In such a brieftreatment it is not possible to cover every aspect ofa complex multifaceted albeit deadly subject            I found only two small errors both on page homphone and the transcription tInguetIshould be tInguttIfor Italian cinguetti             Laurence Urdang                              The Oxford Companion to the English Language            Readers of VERBATIM and all who share their interestsin language should own a copy of this outstandingwork  Although it is not exhaustive in itscoverage the OCEL offers by far the most comprehensivepicture available of the English language asthe th century draws to a close  Still for historicalreasons one should have liked to see entries for IdoInterlingua and Volapk which do not merit evenmention under ARTIFICIAL LANGUAGE SyntacticStructures  listed under CHOMSKY ought to have itsown entry if only for the cross reference thoughTRANSFORMATIONALGENERATIVE GRAMMAR is inscores of individuals from contemporaries like YorickWilks to important historical commentators likeAlford Pegge and Tooke would have provided informativeuseful entries  It hardly behooves me tocomplain as there is an entry not only for VERBATIMbut for URDANG Laurence besides I must acceptresponsibility as contributor of a number of the entriesthough of course I did not see the completework till it was published            I see from the foregoing that I have inevitablyslipped into the reviewers trap so neatly laid bygenerations before me of commenting on what isnot in the book under discussion rather than what isIf I have not impaled myself on the upthrustingpoints of editors razorsharp styli I shall try to recoverSome of the more interesting kinds of entriesdeal with writers  As the OCEL is concerned withlanguage per se one would expect such entries totreat the writers style and indeed the entry onMELVILLE does so but the treatment is uneven thatfor CONRAD aside from quoting a passage from Heartof Darkness  is barren of comment on language andthat for BURGESS focuses on a quotation of nadtsatfrom A Clockwork Orange  with no mention of theauthors position at least in the UK  as a languageguru  Admittedly such entries are extremely difficultto compose but a proper treatment has certainlybeen successfully attempted in the entries forSHAKESPEARE and for ORWELL            The occasional historical comment involvinghistory recent enough for me to have been a part ofit is not always exactly right  For example underRANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY is given the informationRecognizing an opportunity in the national outcryagainst Websters New International Dictionary Merriam Random House commissioned an expansionof its American College Dictionary   As it happened the first plans for the expansionof the ACD were discussed in  when thepeople at Random House had no inkling of a forthcomingnew edition from Merriam as I have describedelsewhere from its conception the plans forthe RHD were entirely marketdriven  In the entryfor COMPUTER TYPESETTING the information is givenStarting in the s devices with film strips orfilm wheels containing images of characters werewidely used to produce master copies on photographicfilm  More recently the use of premadefilm images has given way to cathoderay tubeswhich generate characters as requested  The Photonmachine was in use during the s I wasused for the composition of the Funk WagnallsDictionaryInternational Edition in  I waspresent at a demonstration of the

of thes one was certainly in operation in  at theMcCall Corporations composition plant in PrincetonNew Jersey driven by an RCA Spectrum computerOne hopes that such factual slips can becleared up in the next edition or printing            It would have been useful had the entry FOLKETYMOLOGY included a reference to Folk EtymologyA Dictionary of Verbal Corruption or Words Pervertedin Form and Meaning by False Derivations orMistaken Analogy  Rev A Palmer Smyth GeorgeBell  Sons London   On the other handnow that I have provided the reference I supposethat there is no need to add it to the OCEL             Turning to subjects about which I know little Iwas delighted by the full and informative article INDIANENGLISH  but even that provokes a criticismprobably felt by the Editor even more strongly thanby me namely where is the Index  There is such awealth of material buried in its thousands of articlesthat remains inaccessible for lack of an Index thatone despairs of the judgment of the publishers  Iknow I know there is a thematic guide in theforematter and the two types of cross references atthe ends of the entries are extremely helpful also tohave added an Index would have run up the price ofthe book by another  per cent or whatever  Butso what  What boots it to have paid  per cent lessI shall leave it to you to do the arithmetic for abook the depths and wisdom of which it is difficult toplumb without an Index  In the entry PHILOLOGYfor instance appears a reference to dead languagebut there is no mention of that entry at DEAD LANGUAGEwhich in any event has only cross referencesquite appropriate in view of the fact that thesubject of the book is English  Still members ofThe Society of Indexers will spin in their grooveand with justification            The OCEL is surely a prodigious undertakingand Tom McArthur aided by his wife Feri deservesenormous credit for having produced a wellbalancedwork  Inevitably one encounters articleson relatively abstruse subjects that owing to concisionare not easily understood chiefly because theyassume a level of sophistication not necessarily possessedby the user  The lengthy article on LITERARYCRITICISM though conveniently broken down intofifteen sections proved difficult reading for me  In areview of OCEL in the Times Literary Supplement December  it was suggested that insertingasterisks alongside the terms that were treated intheir own entries would have helped that is certainlyan accepted and often helpful practice inlonger encyclopedic texts but it tends to interruptreading and clutters up shorter entries of the kindencountered in the OCEL   It was further suggestedthat language is not best served by alphabetic organizationbut that is merely a plea for much longermore comprehensive articles which lie outside thescope of a Companion   Given the restrictions onspace the editors have done an admirable job            One must bear in mind too that one of themost difficult of an editors responsibilities in such awork is to rewrite articles submitted by contributorswith widely disparate writing styles in order tomake them if not uniform at least compatible  Infine while there is no doubt that the Companionwilland shouldbecome a standard work on thelanguage one must not impute to its function anythingmore than its service as a guide the Englishlanguage is unimaginably vast in its origins and historyin its literary philosophical psychological socialand specialized applications and in the descriptionsof its grammar usage dialects and lexiconboth historical and contemporary  Consider that theOED  which makes no pretensions at being exhaustiveor complete occupies some twenty quarto volumesin its description of the lexicon alone considerthat a descriptive bibliography of the huge numberof lexicographical works on the myriad aspects ofEnglish alone would occupy several similar volumesconsider the multivolume works on English grammarbyCurme Poutsma Jespersen et al considerthe immense corpus of English literature andof the writings about it and then consider all thematerial ancillary to the foregoing the teaching ofEnglish not only to foreign learners but to nativespeakers as well the conventions of writing punctuationusage and pronunciation the multifarious influencesof English and on English around the worldthe study of style and of literary devices etymologyetc  It is difficult enough to assimilate all the categoriesassociated with language without trying to copewith their organization and treatment  In such anattempt there are bound to be points of disagreementarguments that important subjects havebeen accorded short shrift minor inaccuracies thatwill submit to later refinement            It is neither a matter of Dont shoot the pianoplayerhes doing the best he can nor of If yknow a better ole go to it the OCEL stands as amighty effort and in my overall estimation ahugely successful one at bringing together into a coherentcohesive work what isat leasta superbintroduction to what must be acknowledged to be asubject that is at once the most complex changeableelusive technical emotional political

taken as a whole I should imagine thatthe proportion of idiomatic expressions without confirmedetymologies may be higher than that ofwords whose provenance has not been establishedThat is not for the want of speculative comment bythose who offered largely folk etymologies whichreaders of VERBATIM will recall so sorely vexed WalterW Skeat  The expression take down a peg is purportedto have originated in a time when peg tankardswere in popular use  The following extract isof interest                           PegTankards  of which I have seen a few stillremaining in Derbyshire have in the inside a rowof eight pins one above another from top to bottomthe tankards hold two quarts so that there isa gill of ale ie half a pint Winchester measurebetween each pin  The first person that drankwas to empty the tankard to the first peg or pinthe second was to empty to the next pin c bywhich means the pins were so many measures tothe compotators making them all drink alike orthe same quantity and as the distance of the pinswas such as to contain a large draught of liquorthe company would be very liable by this methodto get drunk especially when if they drank shortof the pin or beyond it they were obliged todrink again  For this reason in ArchbishopAnselms Canons made in the Council at Londonin  Priests are enjoined not to go to drinkingboutsnor to drink to Pegs  The words are Ut presbyteri non eant ad potationes  nec ad pinnasbibant Wilkins Vol I p   This shewsthe antiquity of this invention which is at least asold as the Conquest                           Anonymiana or Ten Centuries of Observationson Various Authors and Subjects Samuel Pegge London  p Published posthumously written ca             Perhaps I am missing something but in the event itis difficult to understand how the expression takesomeone down a peg  which means demean someonereduce someone in estimation esp his ownpuncture the selfconfidence or arrogance of someoneunless it has changed somewhat over theyears could be connected with peg tankards  Itseems unlikely to me that being more precise thansomeone in a drinking competition could easilytranslate into the modern sense of the idiom  Whathas happened evidently is that peg acquired thesense of step measure degree hence take someonedown a peg meant reduce someone by a measurableamount and this is borne out by the OED atpeg sb    with variants which has citations goingback to   As the quotation above indicates the Canons were in Latin thus not valid citationfodder for the OED   Those who would derive theexpression directly from the peg tankard sense arethus not correct for while that attribution mighthave been the original source the expression itself istraceable only to a metaphor once removed from thetankard

manner yet when onelooks back it seems to have fled disappeared evaporatedheavenknows where  When VERBATIM wasfirst published though I cannot recall havinglooked forward much beyond the first issue nowthinking back I find it astonishing that seventyfournumbers have preceded this one  The life of a periodicalis quite unpredictable periodicals change orremain the same but people are more likely tochange than remain the same with the consequentdisappearance of venerable publications like Punch for example  I do not have figures for the number ofperiodicals that have met their end during the pasttwo decades but I understand that there have beenmany            VERBATIM too has had its ups and downs  Thefirst issue was mailed to  paid subscribers this issuewill go to more than  including many outsidethe United States that are not numbered amongthose listed in the audited annual circulation reportrequired by the Postal Service to maintain a SecondClass mailing privilege  According to a survey weconducted some years ago each issue of VERBATIM isread on average by about three people excludingthose that go to libraries  Thus The LanguageQuarterly has more than  readers in some oddcountries  Perhaps the most gratifying thingabout publishing it is that an average of more than per cent of subscribers renew in recent yearsthe response has been  per cent to the renewalnotices attached to certain issues  I am given to understandthat aside from journals associated withmembership in some organization anything beyond per cent is considered phenomenal  Yet we havenever sent

issuesalternating six and eight pages and a subscriptioncost  about  in   The price wasincreased to   a couple of years laterToday VERBATIM publishes  pages a year for not including this double issueFor those who do not object to very rough statisticsthat averages out to an increase of from p per page to  p per page  Thatmight seem like an unconscionable increase allowingfor normal inflation but the costs of paperand postage especially have been driven up out ofproportion            The greatest cost we encounter is that of advertisingwhich is not only expensive but yieldsmeagre results in comparison to the money spent  Itis impossible to find another publication in which toadvertise that is quite like VERBATIMthat is onethat reaches people who are interested in languagesowe advertise in media whose readers arelikely prospects and hope for the best  Our currentSeptember  to February  campaign hascost more than   yielding so farfewer than  subscribers  It is not difficult tocalculate that readers so expensively acquired arenot profitable till they have renewed for the thirdyear  Factor in the  per cent renewal rate and itcan be seen that one must wait till the fourth yearsrenewal although revenues from advertising andbook sales improve that slightly they are offset bythe fact that we have recently begun paying all contributors            The foregoing are facts not a plea of any kindfor anything except to urge those who enjoy VERBATIMwho have made it the highestcirculation popularlanguage journal in the Englishspeaking worldto encourage others who share their interest to subscribeand to send in their renewals quickly  VERBATIMmakes an inexpensive gift for any occasion and isespecially enjoyed by teachers who plunder it forideas and students

grosbeak the bird that was thought to sing only whennight draws nigh  Hesperiphona vespertina mighteven be called a double binomial because it says ittwicewestern sound songat eventide  The binomialnot only gives information it also dispels confusionThe evening Igrosbeak is also called the westernevening grosbeak  and the American hawfinch   Whenit appears in England and it has been seen in Norwaythe French get to call it the grosbec errant  butthe name known throughout the world remains Hesperiphonavespertina             The other day a young lady brought me a deadmoth  I reached back to my childhood and rememberedIts a hawkmoth   But she had alreadynamed it  She called it an army moth because ithad camouflagelike gray and green markingsWhat other kinds of moths are there  I wenthome to find the moth book my father and I hadused  Cynthias specimen was the big poplar sphinxmoth  Hawkmoths are also called sphinx moths   Butbig poplar sphinx does not say the same thing to everybodyThere are one thousand different hawkmothsand sphinx moths in the world and there areover a hundred thousand moths in other families ofmoths and among them there are many dozens ofpoplar moths big and little            The confusion can be avoided by using themoths Latin name which was established two hundredyears ago by a natural scientist named CarolusLinnaeus and by the twoname namers who followedafter him  Binomial nomenclature uses a genericand a specific term used to designate speciesOnly the binomial Pachysphinx modesta  pins downwhat Cynthia found  Its first generic generalname is a bonusgiving extra informationbecauseit incorporates meanings for two of the stagesof this animal pachy  thick it is widebodied forthe adult insect and the typical sphinxlike raisedhead for the caterpillar stage  The second name thespecial name modesta  means modest in the senseof free from ostentation Cynthia was struck by themoths drab garb  All we need to say is modestawhen we talk about this genus of moth to other peopleallover the world            Even scientists use different colloquial namesfor animals  A brown and yellow butterfly with blueeyes on its front wings is called the common woodnymph  or the wood satyr   Other lepidopteristsnamed the wood satyr the blueeyed grayling  othersthe goggle eye   Who is right  The correct name thebinomial is Cercyonis pegala  and that is the onlyname that correctly identifies this butterfly everywhereto everyone  Also anyone discussing theSatyridae family of butterflies will know that justplain pegala designates the goggle eye the wood satyr the blueeyed grayling  the wood nymph             What happens when the American Museum ofNatural History wants to talk to entomologists in Europeabout a butterfly we call the mourning cloakIn Germany it is called der Trauermantel in Franceit is le morio the moor the English named it theCamberwell beauty   What butterfly are they talkingabout  They are referring to Nymphalis antiopa  andthis binomial jumps all geographical boundariescrosses through every language through all the alphabetsand determines this animals true identity            We may not know how to read or write the lettersand symbols in Japanese Chinese Arabian orother languages but we do not have to when werefer to living things because the generic name andspecific name in Latin are the same all over theworld            A species of tick the animal that Pliny the Eldercalled one of the foulest and nastiest creatures thatbe should be known to most residents of the northeastcoast of the US because Ixodes dammini  thedeer tick is the vector for another dreadful animalthespirochete Borrelia burgdorferi  whichcauses borreliosis Lyme diseasethe fastestgrowinginfectious disease in the US after AIDS            Perhaps a good start for Cynthias further explorationof the animal kingdom would be with dinosaurscats and dogs  Young people probably knowmore than most adults about the huge lizards  sauri that roamed this planet a hundred million years agoOne of these dinosaurs frightful lizards Tyrannosaurusrex is the tyrant lizard king of them allAnd the cats Felix  Felis catus  the tiger  Felistigris  and Leo the lion  Felis leo   Canis lupus is thewolf  Another dog domesticated is bred in manyvarieties Canis familiaris is a familytype canine  Inorder to distinguish him from other varieties of Canisfamiliaris I gave my dog an extra varietal nameThunder  I also very unofficially invented a jokebinomial for him Fido fidel   He is faithful Fido            Occasionally the colloquial name by itselfadds to the information given in the binomial theplatypus Ornithorhyncus anatinas  is a ducklikebirdsnouted flatfoot  There is a lot of informationin those three words            The binomial for Cynthia and me is Homo sapiens My varietal name is Douglas   Cynthias varietalis Cynthia  and it can be as long as Cynthia ElizabethSmithJones   But the International Code of ZoologicalNomenclature for binomials in the animal kingdomdoes not accept Latin varietal names because itwould create too much clutter  Our parents had toinvent our varietal names in order to single us out tocall out to us  Other animals probably do the samefor each other and for their children  I feel sure thatThunder has his own names for his Canis familiarisfriends and imagined enemies            Although we can sometimes take the shortcut tojust the specific name it is better to use both namesat first mention unless we are sure the people addressedknow what genus we are talking about becausemany of the same specific names are used inother genera  Also since most specific names containwords that are more descriptive than those usedin the names of the various generallike the Latinwords for modest beautiful amiable  and magnificent for examplethere are not enough to goaround not just for other genera but for the millionsof other living things in all the tribes familiesorders and classes in the animal and vegetable kingdoms            Our own specific descriptive name sapiens comes from the Latin word to know  We are supposedlymore knowing and wiser than other loweranimals  About a dozen other animals bear this samespecific name  Our generic name Homo  is akin toanother Latin name humanus human and to humusearth            All living things includes of course the vegetablekingdom  All plants from seaweeds to orchidsfollow the rules of binomial nomenclature  Some ofthe most interesting names and flowers in

your life will be  fideldomesticus amabilis agilis  and magnificens  evensempervirens  but not too vociferus tristis  norneglecta             You may never see the beautiful animal that fliesthrough

Metaphors            Works of this kind are more often the productsof individuals in the great tradition of JohnsonBrewer Skeat Burger and othermostly earlierwriters than of teams of researchers and editorsWilkinson identified as having studied Classics OldEnglish and Old Norse at Cambridge worked as aForestry Commission woodman an occupation thatevidently afforded him the time and solitude requiredto concentrate on compiling and writing sucha work though no indication is given of how long hetook to complete it            The main part of the book arranged underrather odd categories covers  pages it is followedby an page Index of Themes which mighthave been made more accessible if placed at thefront the rest consists of an Index of Keywordssome  according to the blurb  Covered inthe text are over  English sayings            Although many articles theoretical essays andbooks have been written about metaphors little efforthas been made to investigate them systematicallyas all of language is itself a metaphor unlessone believes in logomancy one is continually confrontedin the compilation of an ordinary dictionarywith examples of semantic and linguistic changes aswell as amelioration pejoration etc that are tantamountto shifts of meaning that loosely could besaid to be metaphoric  So it remains to see justwhich  sayings Wilkinson has chosen to analyzeand record  With few exceptions they appearto be phrases  bridging loan wide open Hyde Parkrailings  adages or proverbs  Dont be after breakingyour shin on a stool that is not in your way When thewheat lies long in bed it rises with a heavy head Thewater that comes from the same spring cannot be bothfresh and salt Better feed five drones than starve onebee  and occasionally individual words  beeswaxbusiness grapevine stagnant   Many of the lastare likely to be found in dictionaries but moderndictionaries do not offer such useful treatmentwhich essentially links to a word or phrase the cultureof the people who use it            It would be grossly unfair to continue withoutquoting the authors purpose set forth in an Introductionwhich is all too brief considering the complexityof the subject  Here are some relevant extractsIn everyday life metaphors take many differentforms including similes a nose as red as a cherryproverbs dont count your chickens before theyrehatched transfer phrases make heavy weatherof  wellerisms everyone to his taste as theysaid when the old woman kissed the cow metonymythe knife for surgery the crown for royaltysynecdoches sixty head of cattle a cutthroat andswearing bloody bugger                        Particularly interesting are the kinds of metaphorexcludedAs the main purpose of this collection is totrace the origins of folk metaphor in Englishnearly all examples of metonymy synecdoche andswearing have been omitted as being too marginalor personalMetaphor is often used to warn or conceal froma third party as in your barn doors open  In thiscategory are all euphemisms but they contain theseeds of their own decay  Many good metaphorshave therefore been excluded because of this inevitableephemerality  There are also two largegroups which are not admissible as metaphorsbecause they derive arbitrarily from soundsimilaritieswithout the necessary senserelationshipThese are based on puns like camp as a rowof tents and on rhymesplates of meat etc  Occasionallyrhyme and reason happily coincide asin skinandblister  sister but for true metaphorsthere must be some sense connexion otherwisethe substitute word or phrase is merelyused randomly or like a secret codeAnother group of metaphors excluded is thenames of natural species such as footman and emperormoths ladys slipper shepherds purse porpoiseetcPurely literary metaphors have been excludedexcept for those which have become traditionalby general acceptance as have many Shakespeareansayings as well as titles and phrases frommodern authors                        The result is in large measure a catalogue of thetreatment once given in those older dictionaries thatmight in an entry for kink  have defined it as a conditionof a piece of wire then continued withhence kinky twisted abnormal perverted  Wilkinsonsentry for kink under theme Aa Metal differentmetals  is as followsKink Aberration abnormality as when straightwire or metal gets kinked  Hence kinky perverted eccentric to the point of abnormality                        Two matters of style should be noted here first allentries are capitalized which I find offputting secondrunover lines are indented necessary in a dictionarybut not in a work consisting of such shortentries with a resultant waste of space            The thematic categories TINKER TAILOR SOLDIERSAILOR RICHMAN POORMAN BEGGARMANTHIEF with AT HOME AT SCHOOL and AT PLAY addedto allow for entries not otherwise classifiable I find abit too whimsical especially when one finds FarmersFarm Animals and associated subcategorieslisted under RICHMAN while those who tend themappear under POORMAN the impression is that theauthor is subtly trying to pass on some sort of cynicalmessage  Also it is important to note that thecategories describe the literal content of the metaphornot the metaphoric aspect  Thus kick thebucket is listed in the category Ee Pork becauseof its presumed etymology Slaughtered pigs arehung by the heels from the bucket or beamwhile go west appears under Ge Sunset                bite thedust questionably defined as brought low appearsat Cf Winning and losing the battle                buy thefarm which I cannot find in the OED  is listed underEa Land where it is labeled as an Americanismconfuting my understanding that it originated withthe RAF early in WWII and cash in your chipschecks goes under Kc Roulette which might be allright for a British English classification but I thinkthat Americans would expect to find it at KPoker   Although the Index lists most expressions atleast twice  kick the bucket is under both kick andbucket  which is fine it seems that no expressionappears more than once in the main section notwithstandingany ambiguity or polysemy that might itmight reflect            Metaphors are the shibboleths of language andculture and proper imaginative apt control of themis an indicator of ones knowledge of both  Withina language they can be culturespecific or crossculturaldialectspecific or crossdialectal  kick thebucket die for example is probably known in alldialects of English kick into touch curtail or postponefurther treatment is unknown except to thosefamiliar with British idiom  This seems an appropriateplace to describe a personal experience that tookplace in  when I was far less conversant withBritish idiom than today though I hasten to pointout that it is unlikely that one can ever become fullybidialectal any more that one can become perfectlybilingual            The setting was a conference room at the officesof William Collins Sons since renamed Collins Publishersin St Jamess Place an engaging set ofcreaky buildings situated between the Stafford Hotelwhere we often repaired for dinner after ourlucubrations and Dukes  Sir William and LadyCollins lived in a suite at the top  At the corner of StJamess Place and St Jamess Street was the mapstore owned by Sir Francis Chichester of singlehandedsailing fame across St James Street wasstill isBoodles a club for the gentry round thecorner was the famous French restaurant Prunelles            It was a time when those attending the meetingschiefly Jan Collins who was managing directorthe companys attorney and I were trying to arriveat a viable budget for the preparation and publicationof what was to become the Collins English Dictionary Various other people drifted in and out ofthose meetings which were held sporadically overthe course of several months but we three were thechief punters as they say in Britain  The discussionsoften went on for hours all afternoon and wellon into the evening  Though hardier in those daysmy constitution was somewhat affected by jet lag asI had usually arrived only that morning or the daybefore from the US  On one occasion as our deliberationswere drawing to a close after many monthswe came to a particularly niggling point of disputeregarding the cost of some phase of the projectIhave forgotten whichand in frustration and exasperationI burst out with You must realize that ifyou want to earn a penny youve got to spend apenny whereupon much to my consternation allthose present fell about laughing merrily  Note tononBritish readers spend a penny is a British idiommeaning go to the lavatory obviously a referenceto the ubiquity of pay toilets            Despite his protest to the contrary Wilkinsonhas included a number of what can only be termedliterary metaphors in sections under Myth that includePrimeval Jewish Greek Germanic andCeltic but no Roman  The coverage is uneven sopto Cerberus is in but not Pegasus even though it isnot couched in a metaphoric phrase that I can thinkof  In the category of proper names which are notspecifically excluded in the Introduction BrillatSavarinand Escoffier are missing as metaphors forgreat chef as is Einstein for genius  One of mypersonal favorites in this category is mithridatismthe gradual immunization of a person against a poisonby administering it over a long period in smallbut increasing dosages it refers to Mithridates IVthe Great of Pontus   BC who accordingto Justinian foiled a conspiracy by just such amethod before dispatching the conspirators one dayat dinner by dosing the food with poison that had noeffect on him  Nouns and verbs are the mainstay ofthe metaphors treated but adjectives are in veryshort supply  One could write a longish essay on theallusions conjured up by the words Dickensian Kafkaesque and Orwellian  yet none of these amongthousands of others are represented            I see that I have fallen not inadvertently I fearinto the trap that I so often criticize in other reviewersnamely scoring a work for what it does not containinstead of sticking to commenting on what isthere  Despite some disappointments inevitable inany book even those one has written himself butespecially in one that by its very nature could neverapproach completeness it must be said that what isincluded is well and concisely handled useful andinteresting  Still I return to my point regarding certainomissions for the purpose of a reference book isnot solely to serve those who wish to look up metaphorsthey hear but ones they read as well  Focusingon the living language alone according to theblurb is a bit of a conceit for what people aresaying in Montgomeryshire Northumberland andPennsylvania even if it accurately represented isscarcely the living language for most Englishspeakers  It must be said that the days when everyschoolchild was at least exposed to classical mythologyand the Great Books have been supersededby an obsession with education applicable only tocommercial pursuits the syndrome reflected inWhy do I have to study Chaucer and Shakespeareto become a car mechanic or an astronaut  Theliberal arts need not be regarded as ends in themselvesthatis to produce artists writers and otherpractitionersbut to create wellrounded humanbeings who are passing familiar if only subconsciouslywith the underpinnings of their societybased on the bedrock of their culture  Of course ifby culture we mean today familiarity with the namesof the top ten rock hits and the details of
