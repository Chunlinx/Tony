                                 Taint Necessarily News                           USAToday leads with what it describes as President Clintons refusal ongrounds of executive privilege to provide Congress with documents it requestedfor its investigation of the FALN clemency The New York Timesand Washington Post each run this as their offleadschoosing to lead instead with the continued course northward of Floyd nowdowngraded to a tropical storm The Los AngelesTimes has its very own storm to lead with a widening police scandalcalled by the paper the citys worst in  years featuring allegations ofshooting unarmed suspects planting weapons on suspects and of drug dealing andsending at least one person to prison on totally false court testimony TheFALN investigation does not make the LATs front                           USAT notes high up that Clintons citation of executive privilege isthe fourth such in his presidency The WP sets the clemency dustupinside a broader context noting that while Congress is investigating the FALNclemency it is also probing the Clinton administrations role in Russianbanking improprieties as well as the possibility of a coverup about itsconduct in the Waco confrontation The NYT gives a more nuanced accountof the standoff than the others Whereas USAT says Clinton refused tohand over documents and the Post says its saying no to witnesses toothe Times says the White House will release some clemency documents itfeels are not covered by executive privilege and will allow threeadministration officials to appear at congressional hearings But everybodyagrees that there is now considerable friction between Congress and Clinton Onboth sides of the aisle USAT runs a critical quote about the clemencyfrom a Democratic senator            The fronts feature the nowroutine dayafter shooter profiles of the man whokilled seven churchgoers and then himself in Texas on Wednesday The LATheadline is almost a template calling him a loner full of rage TheNYT effort is typical in finding out that he was prone to mood swingsfantasized about murder and was feared by several of his neighbors Since thissort of information can evidently be put together in  hours wouldnt it bebetter to require authorities to do so before a gun purchase could legally bemade rather waiting for reporters to do so after a shooting            The WP front reports that high tech companies appear to haveprevailed in the longsimmering debate about whether or not national securityconcerns should prevent them from exporting software that encrypts electroniccommunications This story fronts the LAT business section and wasreported yesterday by the online version of the NYT  Yesterday theClinton administration said exporting encryption is okay while it also gavelaw enforcement increased power to combat criminal uses of computers althoughnot as much as had been contemplated in several working drafts of thedecision            The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a studyyesterday estimating that tainted food sickens about  million Americans and kills of them each year This is double the last authoritative estimate madein  What with all the attention paid to Floyd toll a dozen or sodeaths youd think that a story about a phenomenon said to have claimedthousands of lives last year would get a lot of front space Think againApparently the papers dont deem this food for thought Its not on anybodysfront            What the NYT tipped yesterday everybody has today about Bill Gatesand his wife donating  billion towards financing for college and advancedstudies for minority students in the sciences engineering and education Thehead of the United Negro College Fund is quoted by the Times saying thegift would increase by  to  percent the number of minorities who receivedoctorates in the targeted fields The coverage reports that the decision hasdrawn some fire from opponents complaining that it shuts out qualified whitestudents            The Wall Street Journal Washington Wire reports that soonafter a top Army general was court martialed for having sex with subordinateswives another top Army general was just removed from his big Pentagon jobwhile the Army sees if he did the same thing Fortunately at least one brasshat looks a lot better in the paper today In a NYT oped a retiredadmiral argues that since its in the Pentagons direct interest to haveaccess to the improved manpower pool that would come out of better schools themilitary should get behind a tenyear program to repair every public schoolfully finance Head Start and reduce class size from kindergarten through thirdgrade How do you come up with the  billion this would cost By cancelingall the unnecessary planes subs and nukes in the defense budget says theformer star            Where oh where are the stories about the presidential and congressionalpay raises passed yesterday Not on anybodys front The WP effort istypical It puts the congressional  raise to  on page  anddoesnt say that the presidents salary is being doubled to  And thewhole thing is buried deep in a story under a headline that doesnt evenmention the raises
