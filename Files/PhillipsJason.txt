                     My name is Jason Phillips         Im          Been lived in Charlotte for  years         The story that I am going to tell is about my great great great granddaddy who was a bootlegger from Yanceyville NC         Um I think this story well the story been told through my family because of uh what he had and what they tried to take from him         And he was a bootlegger and the sheriff and all the deputies I guess evidently he had the best moonshine in all of Yanceyville      so so the uh the sheriff you know was friends with them you know and use to get his liquor from him and the deputies and stuff         And he own a lot of land up there         Had a farm chickens cows bulls all that good stuff lake on the property and um a couple of the deputies was in the KKK a couple of the deputies was in the KKK and um and what uh else did they use to say         They said I mean he was the man you know they said back then you aint see too many black guys with brand new trucks and stuff like that but he had the new trucks and ah he also ran numbers too         They said that he ran numbers and um the deputies use to tell him you know to watch out you know some of the cooler ones that wont in the Klan         But the sheriff you know always said you know he told him when it was really time for him to get out he needed to get out         Evidently he got smart and got out but the story goes you know         He was going on and on and on and he was mixed at that you know he was half white and black but they aint really didnt too much bother him about that because of the fact his daddy was black and his momma was white you know         They had a problem with that but um um he had a lot of money from what I understand         He had a lot of money and then things got thick         A lot of them white people start getting jealous and start trying you know take the property and stuff doing little stuff going out killing his chickens         They aint mess with the his bulls or nothing         They use to come on he use to charge people to come on his property and hunt deer and they use to sneak on and stuff and he catch them out there but he couldnt shoot them because he know hed get lynched if he did that         And then one day um somebody got jealous came down and burnt down the trailer he had a trailer on the property then came and burned down the trailer and burnt up the chicken coop but eventually he got all that back         Kept on bootlegging and they still getting jealous and I remember going to after getting all of that back you know back         Its still there now but I remember and I still do when we when I go to the family reunions         We go out to the chicken coop and it stink         I dont go in there though but I always go out to the uh where they got the cows and the bulls at and check them out and go and get up on desk stand and see where they at         And um he even still got some of those old kettles back there they broke and all mess up and stuff and his kettles were hidden inside the chicken coop         And and um um um what am I trying to say         Oh         When it really got thick when um it got to one point where him and sheriff fell out and the sheriff you know he wasnt really I guess evidently let them tell it he was the cool guy         And the little Klan people um found out you know what the sheriffs men or whatever what was going on         And they were already jealous a black man making money or a half back man making money or whatever you want to call it and they came and burnt the house down burnt the chicken coop down and they killed a cow or a couple of cows I aint too sure about that but I think they killed a cow or a couple of cows         And um they tried to take his land from him and they took it from him for a minute and he went to jail for a little bit and he got out and still you know couldnt get his land but he bought bought and bought and he got his land back         And um now you know every family reunion is held there and and um the land is divided up you know         Every little person in the family done bought a acre of land or how many acres they wanted to buy         Chicken coop back but aint no chickens in it though               I dont know what they did to the chickens         But the um its a bull out there and I think two or three cows         Theyre all over the property and they still sell the um you know they rent the land out during I guess deer season to you know people         They got to pay though you know to come on the property because therere deer stand all throughout         And I think they should make them pay to fish because big ass lake a big old lake out there and they you know I want to go fishing there but Im driving from out of town and it aint like Im carrying some fishing rods or nothing         They got they got um I think they should make people pay to fish too and the people its his its his niece thats my Aunt Claudia         She the one live on the land         Well she live in she got a trailer out there and a house out there         They rent the house out         My Uncle Hubert own the house now         Thats his thats his son or somebody but he own the house         He rent the house and now its nice         They got four wheeler trails and stuff out there now and all kinds of stuff four wheelers and stuff         You can turn that off         And we got what else         I mean its a nice story because I would have like to live back in them days you know the bootleg and moonshine stuff myself         Um you know up there in Yanceyville         And um what else         We oh you ride pass there now you know like we going to the family reunion you just be riding down because you got to ride         Lord let me tell you about the ride         You ride down way out in the country first of all then you make a left turn         Thats all I remember         Yeah you make this left turn and you driving for about five miles and then you past part of the lake you go on down and then you see the mailbox         You think it you think you are at um Aunt well Aunt Claudia well she live you know directly on the property but um my granddaddy Owen property my great great great granddaddy Owen property and the mailbox is at the end of the street and you turn make a right and get on this dirt road         And you driving for about two more miles       two more miles and I kid you not you driving for about two more miles but thats um thats is the prettiest scenery you will ever see because you you see the lake on the right         You see deer running in and out you know just crossing street and carrying on but they need to pave that road because aint nothing but a buck of dirt and you get on down there         But the house on the property is sweet         I know why Aunt Claudine dont live in the house         She want to live in the trailer         Ill quit renting that out but it aint her house anyway aint her property but anyway back to the story         Yeah they finally done took all of his stuff well tried to take all of his stuff but he got it all back and he was a popular guy you know and um he start bootlegging again and you know still the same sheriff or whatever but he the sheriff they squash their little beef or what not and the sheriff told him you know was telling him when he really need to get out and finally he got smart and he just did it         And he stop for real and that was that         But everybody talk about how cool my my um great great great granddaddy was         Granddaddy Owen         Thats who Im named after and I think thats why I am so cool too and uh thats that I mean
