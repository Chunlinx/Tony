                                 Bradley Stumps                                             Editors note Jacob Weisberg has filed from Wednesdaynights debate between Al Gore and Bill Bradley Click here to read it                        BEDFORD NHI caught up with Bill Bradley here today having not seen himoutside of his debates with Al Gore for a couple of months A couple of thingsstruck me about his appearance at a New Hampshire forum for candidates known asa Politics and Eggs Breakfast actually a quiche lunch with a commemorativewooden egg laid at each place setting as a souvenir            The first thing I noticed was how much Bradley has improved as a publicspeaker Most of the time in my experience Bradley comes across moreeloquently on the printed page that in his own speaking voice which has allthe effervescence of dayold champagne Today it seemed just the reverseComments that might read as platitudinous rang with quiet force and sincerityBradley spoke for nearly  minutes and held the attention of a large mostlyconservative audience throughout with a mixture of gentle humor anecdote andexplicit policy talk Of course Bradley has always been the opposite of Gorein that he radiates a sense of inner calm and comfort with who he is Whatseemed different today was that he also seemed far more present and charismaticthan usual as he hopped discursively from observations on globalization tostories about his childhood in Missouri to jokes about basketball to hissubstantive proposal of the day which was a plan to eliminate  billion ayear in corporate tax subsidies            The other thing that struck me about Bradleys performance was the somewhatinconsistent quality of what one journalist recently described as his streak ofcivic mysticism There were points in the speech were I found myself entirelyswept up in Bradleys call to political reengagement In one particularlystrong riff Bradley talked about the need to turn globalization and risingprosperity into a more inclusive narrative in which ordinary people canlocate themselves Another fine bit was the meaty part of his speech in whichBradley talked about how the growth of the tax loopholes that he is proposingto eliminate fosters a corrosive distrust of government Still another was thepart about race where Bradley quoted Toni Morrison on her vision of a worldin which race exists but doesnt matter            But at other times Bradleys soulstirring rhetoric sounds pretty much likehooey as when he answered critics of his proposals to end child poverty andextend health insurance to all by repeating the mantra that in a world of newpossibilities guided by goodness we can Beware of policy proposals thatinclude a change in human nature as one of their essential requirements Therewas more of this kind of thing in yesterdays address on America in the NewMillennium which I read but did not hear him deliver Some people say wecan never achieve our special destiny Bradley concluded But I say in aworld of new possibilities guided by goodness we can and we will            At the press conference following this mornings speech I couldnt resistasking Bradley what that was supposed to mean What is our special destinyand who are the people who say we can never achieve it Bradley actually filledout the clich rather convincingly I think that our special destiny is tolead the world by the power of our example as a pluralistic democracy and agrowing economy and to do so in a way that is consistent with the promise ofthe Declaration he said And who disagrees with that view People who getcaught up in the current moment and dont have a longer view of our history andour potential Bradley said I could put a number of the Republicans inthere but I decided not to do that            As I mentioned Bradleys serious policy proposal of the day was to save billion a year and  billion over the next decade by cutting corporate taxsubsidies and cracking down on tax shelters This is a perfectly reasonableidea but it is undermined by two big flaws Flaw No  is that Bradley wantsto crack down on tax subsidies for mining oil gas and grazing but leavesethanol untouched The reason is obvioushes running in the Iowa caucuses onJan  But the inconsistency glares By proposing to cut off tax subsidiesonly in states that dont have early primaries Bradley has actually underminedhis case for cutting any subsidies at all Bradleys new proethanol positionmeans that instead of ending tax favoritism he is merely trimming it inpolitically convenient places            In answering a question about this Bradley seemed to leave the door open tochanging his mind on ethanol for a second time when he finished his answer bysaying There are many other things in the tax code that I might berevisiting so you dont know But asked to clarify his position on thematter Bradley said he would not revisit the tax subsidy for ethanol            Flaw No  is that Bradleys loophole closing isnt politically astuteenoughin a way that the tax reform he accomplished in  was Tax reform inthe s was a grand bargainit eliminated tax favoritism for some inexchange for lowering tax rates for all Bradleys latest proposal holds nosuch broadbased appeal To cut tax subsidies without reducing rates is a taxincrease However defensible as a way to increase federal revenues it has noprayer of Republican support            To my mind this insufficient idea only raises the question of why Bradleyhasnt yet come up with a more ambitious taxreform proposal An offer to dowhat he did in  once again would command widespread support It would shiftthe debate with Al Gore to a subject Bradley talks about with total confidenceand authority And it would provide Bradley should he win the nomination withan answer to the nonreformist taxcut plans emanating from the Republicanside Perhaps tax reform doesnt appeal to the new spiritualized side ofBradley Its just good government without any civic mysticism in it atall
