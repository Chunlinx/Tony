                    Background                  Ciliate nuclear dimorphism          Following pairwise mating conjugation each          exconjugant replaces its old parental MAC with a new MAC          developed from a mitotic daughter of its genotypically          new zygotic nucleus review     The mitotic sister          of the MAC precursor anlage is set aside as the new          diploid germline MIC which is then heterochromatically          silenced all known gene expression is from the MAC or          MAC anlage       Once the anlage begins          differentiation the old MAC is apoptotically destroyed              The mature exconjugant resumes feeding and          establishes a vegetative clone a karyonide propagated          by binary fission in which the MIC replicates as a          typical diploid mitotic nucleus and the MAC replicates          amitotically                          Macronuclear development          Ciliates employ a strategy of irreversible genome          alterations to generate the MAC a specialized          geneexpression organelle Analogous developmental          strategies have evolved several times outside the          ciliates scattered across phyla      thus          mammalian immunity depends on irreversible somatic genome          alterations     Initially the MAC anlages          chromosomes are endoreduplicated evidenced by visible          polyteny in a variety of ciliates The ploidy can reach           in some Spirotrichs      Thus each sequence          that survives subsequent elimination MACdestined is          represented by numerous polytene chromatids in          principle each could be processed differently Near the          end of endoreplication in Spirotrichs many transposons          and transposonlike sequences are eliminated by precise          excision Internal Eliminated Sequences or IESs              Excision directly precedes massive chromatid          fragmentation and           de novo telomere formation          chromosome healing     and the degradation of IESs          and of spacer DNAs that lie between blocks of sequences          destined for different MAC chromosomes The surviving          sequences as few as  of the germline sequences reside          on many small MAC chromosomes which are then highly          amplified to the level of the mature MAC          The           Oxytricha MAC genome is typical of          those of other Spirotrichs It consists  copies of           different tiny acentric linear chromosomes They          range in length from  kbp to  kbp number          average length  kbp J Garrett KRW D          Witherspoon and GH unpublished comprised almost          exclusively of transcription units Many carry only one          gene review     but some carry two or three genes          each      N Sanders B Fausett TGD KRW          and GH unpublished          Not all identical polytene chromatids of the anlage          are processed identically as evidenced by the generation          of alternative processing families of MAC chromosomes We          have studied alternative processing of the  MAC locus          which generates a family of three overlapping chromosomes                see Fig  below Analogous phenomena          have been described in other ciliates                                          Chromatid breakage and de novo telomere          formation          Telomeres are not encoded           in situ at the ends of MACdestined          blocks      but are polymerized onto new ends           de novo by telomerase These          processes have been best studied in           Tetrahymena thermophila and in          various Spirotrichs including           Euplotes crassus  Breakage occurs          at  cut sites in           Tetrahymena  and at  sites          in Spirotrichs A short  bp           cis acting sequence cbs is          necessary and sufficient to direct breakage at or near it          in           Tetrahymena  presumably being the          binding site of the breakage enzyme  the cutter                The cbs sits in eliminated sequence a short          variable distance from the positions that receive          telomeres An analogous sequence Ecbs has been          characterized in           Euplotes by sequence comparisons          and analyses of DNA intermediates and products of MAC          development       At a fixed distance from          itself Ecbs directs a nucleotide staggered cut with          a protruding OH to which telomerase adds telomere          repeats The Ecbs can sit within the MACdestined          sequence or in the adjacent spacer DNA in some cases          both generated ends receive telomere repeats so that the          two resultant telomeretailed ends overlap by  bp A cbs          has been tentatively identified in           Stylonychia lemnae     no cbs          is known in Oxytrichs although we assume it exists see          Discussion          The           in vitro properties of telomerase          are consistent with its known role in creation of MAC          telomeres in           Tetrahymena     as well as          presumably in all other ciliates     Telomerases          from exconjugants of           Tetrahymena and           Euplotes have been extensively          studied           in vitro  The           E crassus enzyme can only act on          oligomers that pair with telomerase template RNA at their           terminus unless assisted by a dissociable factor          chromosome healing factor which contributes extra mass          to the enzyme in exconjugants     Telomerase          assisted by this factor still requires a block of dGs or          telomere repeats internal to the  primer end              In contrast the           Tetrahymena exconjugant enzyme can          add to a primer completely devoid of telomere repeats in          special reaction conditions and shows no evidence of          increased mass beyond that of the vegetative enzyme                       Although chromatid breakage requires an endonuclease          activity the cutter directed by a Cbsbinding activity          no Cbsdependent bindercutter activity has been          detected           in vitro  The cutter could be an          activity of telomerase itself      Telomerase of          both           Tetrahymena and           Euplotes has a singlestrand          endonuclease activity      It can trim potential          primers back so that the  terminus pairs with template          RNA     Thus while it may serve a  editing          function the existence of a nuclease activity in          potential proximity to the site of chromatid breakage is          provocative suggesting that telomerase provides the          doublestrand cutting activity and thereby explaining          coupled action between chromatid cutting and telomere          addition see below However Niu           et al      in a study of a          similar endonuclease activity of the yeast telomerase          argue that since yeast perform no developmental          fragmentation this activity plays some role other than          in fragmentation          It is generally believed that the developmental action          of telomerase is tightly coupled to cleavage The           Oxytricha multiTAS regions we          describe here seem to cause an uncoupling of these steps          our models invoke the ability of telomerase to act          independently of the bindercutter           Tetrahymena telomerase and the          bindercutter appear to act concertedly           in vivo  as if in a physical          complex      However this contrasts with           in vitro properties of the enzyme          from exconjugants  it acts on nontelomeric primers               and  it apparently is no larger than the          vegetative enzyme     Furthermore telomerase can          act in the vegetative MAC of           Paramecium  uncoupled from          chromatid breakage     It remains to be seen if a          complex between telomerase and bindercutter activity          does exist We consider models that assume the two          activities exist separately in a loose complex This          assumption is supported by our results  as well as those          of Mllenbeck and Klobutcher     which indicate that          exonucleolytic erosion of new ends must sometimes occur          before telomerase caps them It is possible that the          nuclease activity of telomerase causes the erosion                          Telomere addition sites TASs          The exact nucleotide positions where telomere repeats          are added have been examined in several ciliates          reviewed by      Cloned chromosome ends from           MAC family indicated heterogeneity of TAS placement          which we attributed to exonuclease erosion of the broken          ends prior to telomerase action     Analogous          multiTAS regions have been described in           Tetrahymena      E Hamilton          and E Orias pers comm and in           Paramecium A Le Moul and E          Meyer pers comm In stark contrast no heterogeneity          of TAS positions has been reported for           E crassus MAC chromosomes          although recently Mllenbeck and Klobutcher    report          multiple TASs at the end of a MIClimited spacer          segment Thus in           Tetrahymena and           Paramecium telomeres are added at a          heterogeneous collection of clustered sites which we          here refer to as multiTAS regions whereas in           E crassus only one TAS is used for          each MACdestined end single TAS regions Here we          describe both kinds of regions in           Oxytricha  both involved in the          generation of the MAC family of MAC chromosomes                          Alternative processing of the MAC locus          A family of three nested MAC chromosomes was          discovered when the MAC chromosome cloned in pMA was          hybridized to Southernblotted MAC DNA     The          chromosomes consist of three contiguous segments of          germline sequence referred to as the common region          CR and the left and right arms Figure  Each          segment bears a proteincoding gene      The          smallest chromosome MAC III consists solely of the          common region with telomeres Armalone chromosomes have          never been observed in vegetative MAC DNA and are          proposed to be replicationincompetent     The two          large chromosomes each have a common region MAC I          carries a right arm and MAC II a left arm Therefore          the latter two chromosomes each carry two genes              a novel finding in Spirotrichs see     The          identities of the genes have not suggested any selective          advantage to such couplings but the alternative          processing of this locus has been conserved within the          Oxytrichs and with variation in some Stylonychids A          Seegmiller and KRW unpublished          We proposed that this nested set is generated by          alternative breakage patterns of polytene chromatids of          the  locus DNA      bottom Fig  While the          armdistal positions must be efficiently cut on each          chromatid alternative breakage at the regions bounding          the CR was proposed Thus not all CRarm junctions are          cut on each chromatid analogous to an incomplete DNA          restriction digest leaving arm DNA appended to CR DNA          in some cases MACs I and II and not others MAC III          Given the apparent functioning of exonucleolytic erosion          following chromatid cutting note that another way to          explain the generation of armless chromosomes is to          assume that chromatids are only cut at armdistal sites          and that erosion alternatively stops at the armdistal          TAS position or proceeds completely through the arm to          stop in the CRboundary multiTAS region By this model          armalone chromosomes never existeven transiently use          of anchored PCR see below is intended to search for          such species and to distinguish between this          massiveerosion model and the incompletecutting model          The latter model seems more parsimonious to us and we          assume it in discussing the results of this report          Incomplete cutting at the CR boundaries might be          caused by poor binding sites or poor cutsites for the          bindercutter In the work presented here we employed an          anchored PCR procedure to precisely map telomere addition          sites TASs We show that the two CR boundaries          CRRight and CRLeft are multipleTAS regions but the          two armdistal regions have single TASs Models are          proposed to explain why the two putatively          incompletelycut CR boundary regions also are          multipleTAS regions                            Results                  Karyonidal reproducibility          A karyonide is a clone of cells established by an          emerging exconjugant  that is a clone of cells that          have the same ancestral developed new MAC     If          random erosion is responsible for the heterogeneity we          see then it should be different in each different          karyonide Figure Ashows displays of the CRR TASs from          two sets of karyonides with different alleles of the          MAC locus The displays for the different genotypes          differ at many positions but interkaryonidal variation          is very slight by comparison In a separate experiment          not shown similarlyidentical display patterns of CRR          were generated from three independent ab heterozygote          karyonides displays from both Panchor and Panchor          PCR products were identical demonstrating that Panchor          PCR does not generate artifacts While the allele          composition of the locus is identical in each pair of          karyonides the karyonides are not otherwise genetically          identical unlike sister karyonides in many ciliates           eg  see     but are          independently derived so that the backgrounds differ          between karyonides which might explain these slight          variations Perhaps more interestingly these          interkaryonidal variations could be attributed to the          limited number of chromatids available to be partitioned          into the various TAS classes represented by the display          bands however the overriding reproducibility implies          that the positions of these TASs are dictated genetically          by           cis acting sequences                          Allelic specificity          Note that if TAS positions are dictated solely by           cis acting sequences then the          pattern of the ab heterozygote should be equivalent to          the sum of the two homozygote patterns aa  bb but          this is not the case Fig B Indeed weve observed          analogous nonadditivity at CRR for each of the three          heterozygotes ab a and b and at CRL for ab and          b data not shown Since independent isolates of a          given genotype have essentially the same pattern this is          unlikely to be caused by different genetic backgrounds          Rather it is possible that this phenomenon indicates          allelicinteractions particularly given that the alleles          are closely associated in a polytene chromosome at the          time they are processed homologs are paired in the          polytene anlage of Stichotrichs      For          instance transvection is a phenomenon dependent on          homolog pairing transvection normally is evidenced by          rescued gene expression in heterozygotes of two alleles          defective in different           cis acting sequence features          which interact in           trans  to essentially complement          one another review              Whatever the explanation of this complexity it does          not negate the conclusion that the patterns are          genotypesensitive and that           cis acting sequences must be          operating in the process of TAS determination Thus even          if alleles interact to determine the TAS pattern          nonetheless the alleles are determining the pattern           that is the patterns are determined by           cis acting components of the          allele sequences The results suggest that allelic          sequences predominantly determine TAS positions          autonomously additively but the nonadditivity results          indicate that the allele sequences must also interact in           trans           These two multiTAS regions roughly lie between their          neighboring genes coding regions and no TAS site          interrupts the common region transcription unit Fig           below CRL data not shown          The CRR multiTAS region of           O fallax  is larger than that          of           O trifallax Fig B To display          the fastest bands representing TASs most proximal to the          CR gene the images of the bottom of the  lanes are          shown along side the images of their respective lanes          Furthermore these clone  patterns are displayed in          two parallel lanes which illustrate the bandconfirmation          technique of telomere stepin PCR In this procedure          PCR is performed with the Panchor PCR product as          template using P in combination with an oligomer of           telomere repeats see Anchor and G            T            G            T            G             marked in Fig B generating a          set of products shortened by removal of the anchor from          beyond the telomere

verifying each responsible TAS Note essentially          all the bands in the  display shift down in concert          including the extremely slow band a marked shortchain          triplet and the marked shortestchain band The          significance of the extreme TAS position represented by          the latter band will be considered below          Figure shows the positions of detected TASs mapped          onto the sequences of six alleles of the CRR multiTAS          region Homologous nucleotides are aligned Forty six          positions are used as TASs As the displays indicate          Fig  uses of many positions are influenced by the          allele sequence Illustrating that allelespecific           cis acting sequences must dictate          TASposition use alleles differ at most TAS positions          only  are used by all alleles  positions marked          are used by more than one but not all alleles and           positions marked are used by only one allele          For instance note the most CRproximal dA TAS only          mapped to           O fallax  vA it resides in a          segment of highly conserved sequences with the exception          of a vAspecific dT  nts  of the TAS Might this          single mutation have caused the use of this unique TAS          position Given the interactions between alleles we          observe in the           O trifallax data Fig  it may          be that the vA TAS might not be dictated by a vA sequence          feature acting in           cis  but could have been induced          on vA by the vB andor vC alleles also present in the          anlage that established strain  macronuclei This vA          segment is immediately  of the Common Region genes          transcription start sites Fig      and          presumably is conserved by selection focused on          expression of that gene                The position of this mostproximal TAS in vA is          surprising indicating that some vA MAC I or II          chromosomes have as few as  base pairs between the          telomere DNA and the transcription start site of the          Common Region gene Fig      The two kinds of          possibilities are that these chromosomes cannot express          their Common Region gene for lack of promoter elements          or that they do noting that the use of this verified TAS          is genetically dictated and hence is tested for fitness          by natural selection Thus if the CR genes are silenced          on these closetrimmed chromosomes the implication is          that generation of these chromosomes with inoperative          genes is somehow useful to           Oxytricha  perhaps adjusting the          stoichiometry of expressed locus genes          Alternatively these chromosomes may be able express          their Common Region gene despite the extreme lack of           sequences Assuming that some promoter element is          required and is not provided by the  bp  of the          transcription start perhaps the telomere repeats serve          this purpose see     It is also possible that a          promoter element resides internal to this region we have          identified a highly conserved sequence block in the          genes first intron and suggested that it might serve as          a promoter element              Perhaps the most trivial interpretation of the          existence of these short chromosomes is that the          responsible TAS is positioned due to a recent mutation          that arose in the vA allele subsequent to its relatively          recent divergence from vC     thus the mutation is          relatively new and despite its potential impairment of          the CR gene on these short chromosomes the mutation may          not yet have been expunged by selection                          Single TAS regions distal to the left and right          arms of the MAC locus          In contrast to the multiTAS regions bounding the          Common Region telomeres are added to single positions at          the extreme armdistal boundaries of the MAC locus          Figure presents LMPCR displays in which both the          leftarm and rightarmdistal TAS regions show single          bands stepin verified An exception is the triple          band for leftarmdistal region of           O fallax  A more complete          study of single TAS regions will be presented elsewhere          KRW TGD DJ Witherspoon GAH manuscript in          preparation Clones of these three bands have been          sequenced KRW unpubl results showing that the          three bands represent the three versionsalleles of this          locus each of which has a different TAS Sequence          differences that might be responsible for the different          TAS locations are not obvious                            Discussion        We show that two distinct processes are determined by         cis acting sequences First         cis acting sequences must determine        that the armdistal TAS regions only generate single TASs        while the commonregion boundaries each generate multiple        TASs Below we propose that the responsible sequences are        the sites for binding or cutting by the chromatid        bindercutter Second we show that the heterogeneity of        TAS positions within the CRbounding multiTAS regions are        genetically determined the pattern is not random but        reproducible from karyonide to karyonide and it is        allelespecific indicating that each TAS in these regions        is dictated by its own         cis acting sequence which we model        below as a pause site for an exonuclease that resects the        new MAC end before telomerase can act        By trying to explain why alternatively or        incompletelycut TAS regions are also multiTAS regions        while completelycut positions have a single TAS we have        attempted to infer properties of the         trans acting machinery that works at        these sites Toward that we now present three models        involving a set of         cis acting sequences and         trans acting components        A series of assumptions has been made some of which        will be examined after the models are presented as we        consider alternative explanations First we assume the        previous model for alternative processing that the CR        boundaries are not efficiently broken on each chromatid        sometimes leaving the common region linked to a left or        right arm     We assume three         trans acting components and three        kinds of         cis acting sites The         trans actors assumed are a loose        noncovalent complex between the bindercutter enzyme and        telomerase and a resecting exonuclease that pauses The        assumed         cis acting sites are the binding        cutting and exonucleasepause sites Finally we assume        that enzyme can act either coupled to the bindercutter        action or on its own at ends exposed by the        exonuclease        The first model is what we take to be the accepted model        in the field for chromatid breakage and telomere formation        at a single TAS and what we propose also to be the        mechanism operating at the armdistal singleTAS regions        In this case all the components function with full        efficiency first a complex of telomerase and        bindercutter bind to the binding site then cutting of the        cutsite ensues with immediate coupled telomerase capping        of the MACdestined end with no interposed erosion        Two further alternative mechanisms are offered to        generate the spectrum of TASs at the CR boundaries These        models share several features Each is a kinetic        chainofevents scenario Each invokes a submaximal or        weak         cis acting sequence compared to        that at a singleTAS region as the cause of the ensuing        events and in each enzyme is portrayed anthropomorphically        for heuristic and didactic reasons        In the hesitant cutter model the complex binds but        the endonuclease is slow to cut because the cutsite is        weak recalcitrant to cutting Meanwhile the impatient        telomerase dissociates from the complex and while it is        away from the site the cutter finally cuts and the raw        end is not capped and is exposed to the exonuclease which        progresses in fits and starts stalling at each TAS When        telomerase eventually acts it usually encounters the        eroder paused at a pause site and adds telomeric repeats to        those resected chromatid ends thus generating the        reproducible spectrum of TASs observed        In the frustrated telomerase model the cutsite is        normal but instead the binding site is weak so that the        complex binds but with a high offrate In this chain of        events the complex binds transiently and cuts and        dissociates from the binding site removing telomerase        before it can cap the new end As in the previous scenario        exonuclease erodes the end and pauses telomerase returns        and caps the ends it finds and the observed spectrum of        TASs is generated In principle the binding and cutsites        might be coincident or overlap as for Type II restriction        enzymes     in that case cutting would destroy the        bindingsite and this frustratedtelomerase situation would        apply This predicts that multiple TASs should result even        at a TAS region with an optimal binding and cutsite but        this is contrary to the behavior of the armdistal TAS        regions Further         Euplotes binding and cutsites do        not overlap            A central and potentially contentious assumption in        these two weaksites models is that telomerase is capable        of acting independently of the bindercutter that is        outside the widely inferred complex However the ciliate        literature is unclear about whether         Tetrahymena telomerase might be able        to act uncoupled from the action of the bindercutter see        Introduction Furthermore the         in vitro exconjugant enzyme of         Euplotes crassus can cap        nontelomeric DNA aided by Chromosome Healing Factor            That         Euplotes is more closely related to         Oxytricha than to         Tetrahymena tentatively supports our        assumption that telomerase can heal ends well after the        bindercutter has acted In support of this we note that        the level of telomerase activity must be much higher in the                Oxytricha anlage than in the         Tetrahymena anlage in that the        density of broken ends would be all else being equal         higher  endskbp in         Oxytricha MIC DNA         vs   endskbp in         Tetrahymena         Might telomerase nuclease activity be the cutter             If so obviously the cutter and telomerase cannot        physically dissociate The weaksites models invoke        dissociation specifically to explain the correlation        between the two properties of the boundaries of the CR        their partial cutting and their broad distribution of        TASs Thus we argue that the cutter and binder        activities must reside in some entity other than        telomerase Also arguing against both activities being in        one inseparable entity is the apparent erosion interposed        between cutting and telomerase action Specifically        erosion requires that nuclease activities have access to        the ends of the break        Might the telomerase endonuclease activity erode the         ends This nuclease clips  tails that protrude beyond        internal segments that pair with the RNA template        AAAACCCCAAAA segment     While many  of the TASs        in the CRR multiTAS region have dTs which could pair        with template As several cannot specifically the  dAs        and  dCs Fig  In any case telomerase         in vitro requires that the  primer        end protrudes on a singlestrand tail review            Thus another activity is required to resect the         underhanging strand see     and this enzyme too        would need access to the break A variety of         exoncleases are known in eukaryotes review     so        it is reasonable to assume such an activity operates during        macronuclear development                    Conclusions        We have shown that the two CR boundaries share the        property of being multiTAS regions in contrast to the two        armdistal regions These properties correlate with the        previouslyinferred incompleteness of chromatid cutting        that occurs in each of these regions         Cis acting sequences must dictate        these two contrasting behaviors of the chromatidbreakage        and telomerase activities Reproducibility and sensitivity        to allele sequence show that the positions within multiTAS        regions also are dictated by         cis acting sequences The proposed        weaksites models make several predictions We predict that        a loose complex will be found in ciliates between        telomerase and a cbsdirected bindercutter activity In         Oxytricha  other alternatively        processed loci like the  locus should have multiTAS        regions that define the boundaries of segments that are        shared between differentsized chromosomes we are        searching for such loci in a growing data set of MAC        chromosome endsequences being generated in collaboration        with R Weiss and D Dunn of the Utah Genome Center We        have begun to examine this dataset for TASadjacent        sequence motifs that potentially define the bindingsites        andor cutsites of singleTAS MAC ends as Klobutcher         et al     have done for         E crassus  We can then test the        prediction that multiTAS regions bear either weak binding        or cutsites Finally we are expanding our data set of        allelic and orthologous variants of the MAC multiTAS        regions to be able to infer the identity of their         cis acting pause site sequences As        the details of multiTAS region processing unravel we        should be able to illuminate the processes of chromatid        breakage
