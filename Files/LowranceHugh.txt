                     Few people are fortunate enough to be able to pinpoint lifechanging events         Fortunately Im able to to pinpoint one that happened to me because it happened in the recent history of my life         It happened to me in in          To give you a little bit of brief history I came out of the s like a lot of people did kind of floundering trying to figure out some new directions         Id been through a lot of violent up and down swings and created peaks and valleys in my financial life and emotional life and course Im sure my my mental frame but everything settled down and I was going along had a good job was dating a lady         Just enjoying life in general had a wonderful relationship with my two precious daughters         One of my hobbiesvicespleasures was playing tennis         I played tennis out at Charlotte Tennis Club         Ive been a member out there for quite some time primarily playing mens doubles and mens singles         Played a lot more mens singles in the s than I did in the s as we had gotten older we seemed to migrate more towards mens doubles         Had a group of guys that I played tennis with on Monday nights and at the time Thursday nights and Saturday and Sunday afternoons for quite some time         On one particular Monday night we were playing mixed doubles played against played beside rather a group of women all of whom I knew and wed kind of kidded because this was a group of very attractive women three of whom I knew but the fourth one I didnt know         Like I say I was playing with some friends of mine and and I was literally smitten almost like a sixteenyearold by this new woman so much so to where it was very very difficult for me focus on my game that day and I was pretty much a a weak link in the match for that entire period         Well could never catch the eye of this new player so the match was over their match was over they left I left and just kind of went on with my life         Well a few weeks after that I ran into one of the other ladies there who along with her husband were friends of mine and I asked her who that person was         And she told me who she was she said her name is Sally Trull she lives in Gastonia shes married I mean shes uh divorced and has three children         And she said And shes looking for somebody who plays tennis and has a sense of humor         And I said Well that would definitely be me however at the time I was dating someone and didnt think too terribly much about it         Well low and behold several weeks later I received a call from this lady asked me if I wanted to play mixed doubles on a Friday night         It would be she and her husband against myself and Sally         So I said Certainly         We all agreed to meet at the club at six oclock         Well I got there Sally was there she had come straight from work         However our club closes on Friday nights so she wasnt able to get in which wasnt that much of a hindrance         The real hindrance was the fact that she had left her tennis shoes under her desk at work so he she had showed up to play tennis with all of her equipment her racket and no shoes which is just a very very bad combination         Well we had no choice but to get shoes         Of course she at the time was living in Gastonia and really didnt know her way around Charlotte very much at all         So we decided to go to Omega Sports which is at the Arboretum         We were at our tennis club which is over near Quail Corners Shopping Center its really not all that terribly convenient         So we hopped in my car and rode to Omega Sports to get some shoes         This particular ride was probably the most crucial point in our relationship         Both of us are quite gregarious and we talked to each other a good bit         And in the  to  minute ride to Omega Sports as well as the  to  minute ride back from Omega Sports we both gave each other a very good thumbnail of our lives and where we were and what was going on and and the type person that we were         It was very informative to me I could feel a very very strong attraction to Sally but I knew I had this other relationship going on um and didnt really want to do anything to jeopardize a potential relationship with Sally because of the other relationship         So we went back played our match and as has always been the case with Sally and I or most of the time has been the case with Sally and I we won this match         After it was over everyone wanted to go out and eat but I couldnt because Jocelyn was at home         And I said I cant I really thought this was just a tennis match Ive got to go home my daughters there         So I went home didnt hear anything for a while         A couple of weeks later Sally called and invited me to go to Jazz Fest uptown                  She explained a story about a group of people from work and I think maybe theyd even rented a van um and were making the rounds I cant remember all the details of it but she said and I thought maybe youd want to go and she added this cleverly unless youre seeing someone else         So I was honest with her told her I was and that it was in the process of winding down um but I really appreciated the invitation         So we once again parted ways         Several weeks later after the other relationship had run its course and had been completely wound down um I invited Sally to go to a um I think th anniversary party with some some people that I worked with         Um we ended up getting together that Friday night before to meet some other friends of mine to kind of give her a baptism by fire         Um and she played tennis at our club on Saturday and then we got together and went to the anniversary party and ended up out with some friends of ours after that was over and I think basically spent the entire weekend together and I just became closer and closer and closer to her         I know that I fell in love with her that weekend um and ever since then she has been an absolutely fantastic part of my life very integral to the person that uh I have become         And its just been an amazing period of time to me that I was so fortunate to find so much of a to use a very corny term soul mate at that particular point in time in my life when Id really kind of thrown a towel in on that         Um but thats thats a little story about how I uh I met my wife uh how important she is to me how things just kind of clicked all because she left a pair of shoes under her desk and sent us off on the relationship where we are         Now um thank you
