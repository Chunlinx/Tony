        so what do you think about a year or two of public service   well i know its hard for young people to think about giving up their years you know free their carefree years but people that i have known that have done that i like from other countries especially Germany and Finland   uhhuh yes yeah   they are just they have such a better more mature outlook on life and i think theyre better people because of it theyre much more responsible i know um   umhum   the church that i go to um the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen you know theyre encouraged to do that missionary work and i believe i really believe that the people that do that   uhhuh   are better people and uh make our society better   you know i i really agree with you um i uh though ive never done that myself i im was a basically an education major when i graduated from college and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to um very rural children in a very low income district and i spent a year teaching there and i think it was probably one of my largest eyeopening experiences because i come from nice   uhhuh   middle class white suburban home and i did it um   umhum   for one reason i wanted i was working on a masters degree so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live someplace else so totally different than my own upbringing and i it changed   umhum   it probably changed my political views it changed my understanding of the world around me   uhhuh   and i think um in fact if if i had to do it all again i you know i i after that you know you never think of it because i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans id started paying back   hm   um because so that was that was one reason why i never considered it but now that im further along and im still paying these college loans       i i think realistically you know you can have your college loans delayed now because i had them delayed because im back in graduate school at thirty years old   yeah   um ive had them delayed because im back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the Peace Corps you can have them delayed   hm   uh and i thought that was you know very interesting and i i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the Mormon church   yes yes but if   that does that umhum because one of my neighbors uh did that in Pittsburgh from Pittsburgh and i thought you know that really now that im thirty years old i think that one or two years out of my life wouldve probably like you said   uhhuh   to be able to travel someplace else whether it be the United States or outside the country i think wouldve been a very good um experience for me   uhhuh well i think so it puts you out on your own and and in a time after high school um   umhum   theres kind of a selfishness i mean teenagers in our country are kind of kind of a year that parents dont look forward to and and things like that and i think that it would help people to become less selfcentered and to be more responsible when youre out on your own trying to um   umhum yes umhum umhum   thinking less of your own needs but of other people   yeah and i think you know we have such a need now you know i taught you know i i think i was paid uh about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year and i worked in a very rural school district and i i one of the things i taught was a computer class and these kids   umhum uhhuh   um you know every girl i taught except for one was pregnant many of the boys in the room had children and they were they were high school juniors   oh no    umhum   and i and i just there you know they came from poverty they were going to continue in poverty        and it was it was the school district couldnt hire many people it was very difficult for them to hire and i think you know in the sense that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities   right   for um just social workers in some of the inner cities and some of the rural areas where they just need advice on medical um things i think its a really good idea and even if it is overseas see i never i i tell you sometimes i worry about things overseas because we have such problems right here in our own country   umhum yes   umhum   it would really um and i dont  the people that ive known like from Germany and Finland that have done that are they do military service which you know i dont exactly recommend but still      yeah umhum yeah   they have benefited from it and um you know although i wouldnt want   right umhum   military military to make people to go off to the military voluntarily but its it has helped them and they are just a lot more mature than the average student and   umhum umhum yeah i think it would also help them if they then went on to college i know that my first couple of years of college were um uh probably too carefree at the beginning and then at the end i had to be too serious   umhum well thats right a lot of people they flunk out or they get they just   umhum   are so excited to be away from home they just spend all there time partying and they do a lot of things to themselves and that we dont really want our young people to be doing and   umhum yeah thats true umhum thats right i yeah i think i think this was this was a very interesting topic   um yeah   uh because its something that you know we dont talk about in this country probably enough   umhum   uh you know   because because were so we love our freedom and our freedom of choice   umhum yep thats true   and um having people but you know our like in our church it it is youre free to do that or not youre encouraged to do it because um you know it it helps you and   umhum   of course we think its helping other people and so   oh i think it is i really think i think um people you should i you know the kids today i teach i spend a lot of my time teaching college students   uhhuh   and um i find great disgust in them in their in their um  their selfcenteredness   umhum   and their inability to understand um multicultural or multiracial situations and i really you know they dont understand uh how other people live um they dont understand   umhum and theyre preoccupied with drinking   umhum yep i think thats uh just just having a good time   uhhuh and   i uh a friend of mine is a psychologist and he always refers to it as uh shortterm pleasure oriented i guess hes a technical aspect he likes to apply to it     umhum   you know todays young people are shortterm pleasure oriented and everything has to be an immediate reward and it has to be fun   thats true thats really true   umhum yeah   yes well i i dont know how that would ever happen here but at least um   well they say i think i um have read recently that uh the Bush Administration has increased the uh funding for the Peace Corps   oh really   uhhuh because i guess because of the changes in Eastern Europe uh theyve increased funding for the Peace Corps some of the i guess its some of the peace dividend in the sense you known when theyre decreasing some of the military spending some of that money has gone into the Peace Corps and some of the other overseas programs uh   umhum hm well i have seen a big change i think in high school kids that my relatives and friends that um i know when i was in high school i had an idea of what i really wanted to do with   umhum umhum   what my what i was going to study and at least i had some interest in a lot of the youth that i come in contact with are they say oh i want to be a doctor i want to be a lawyer why because they make a lot of money   yes yeah thats true   and they dont have a goal they dont have a goal they dont have an interest in their own field of study theyre just looking whats going to pay the biggest cash   umhum yeah thats very true you know how many is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country and i guess i i live near Washington being in in Baltimore its something like one in four people in the Washington   umhum area yes   area are lawyers and and i i just sort of think thats ridiculous yeah with   yes theres too many people   you know with the great needs that we need today in science and biology and uh you know the the problems we have with AIDS and cancer and and that how come everybody is a lawyer you know you know   umhum thats right and not enough people want to do that to for     umhum   uh because of a service that they could provide you know if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need because you have to have lawyers in this country um but if youre just doing it because you think thats the best way to be rich   right umhum umhum yeah you saw statistics that lawyers and doctors make the most money in the long run yeah thats true   umhum thats kind of sad well anyway well i guess i better go   thats interesting umhum okay hey thanks so much for the conversation   well good luck to you i enjoyed it   well thank you very much byebye   thanks byebye
