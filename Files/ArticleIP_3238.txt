                                 As Slime Goes By            Sigourney Weaver who playsan acidblooded Ellen Ripley clone in Alien Resurrection  the fourthinstallment of the gory Alien franchise has made a career out ofputting herself into ridiculous situations and managing never to lookridiculous Her immersion in her roles commands respect and awe She surgespast embarrassment past fear and even when she makes a misstep she landscatlike on her feet That strong Brandoesque jaw gives her a pugilisticcastlaugh at her and shed slug you No one giggled at her when she communedwith apes in Gorillas in the Mist  and no one will giggle at her in thisepic oddity even when shes writhing around in a mucousy pit of alien visceracommuning with the queen and its unborn fetusan image so strange that it goesbeyond the Jungian vampiric phalluses and womblike hatchways of earlierAlien films into what is possibly the collective unconscious ofextraterrestrials            When welast encountered Ripley she was doing a backward swan dive into a pit ofmolten lead with a bewildered baby alien erupting from her chest That kind offinale pretty much rules out another one with Sigourney right Well GeneHackman once described how the Poseidon Adventure producers wanted himback for a sequel and when he pointed out that his character had beenincinerated in a pit of molten lead coincidentally they said he could greetthe previous films survivors as they exited the upsidedown vessel with theline Did my brother make it Now thanks to the rise of cloning in thepopular imagination no twins are necessary            In Alien Resurrection  we meet a set of conceitedsadistic scientiststhe kind of dangerously hubristic Prometheans who areconvinced that they can harness the aliens for the good of mankind Onceweve tamed the  etc Two hundred years after the events of Alien  they obtain a vial of Ripleys alieninfected blood and grow herandthe creature that she was carrying to termin a laboratory They lock Ripleyin a futuristic gothic cage and proceed with their hopeful experiments whilethe aliens their elongated black helmetheads glistening with goo regardtheir wouldbe trainers among them JE Freeman and the great Brad Dourifwith a mixture of rage and amusement the way that Clint Eastwood looks atpunks who momentarily have the upper hand but who he knows will be a bloodypulp in a matter of moments            Thismilieu isnt much of a stretch for the French director JeanPierre Jeunet whowith Marc Caro made the squishy horror picture Delicatessen  andCity of Lost Children  a surreal hybrid of Terry Gilliam andDavid Lynch Though brownish the new picture is less monochromatic than thelast two and the giant space station in which it takes place is both steelyand drippy with the technoorganic feel of the belly of a beast The aliensthemselves have never been animated with more virtuosity You get to see oneswim It whips itself forward with its tail at about a hundred miles an hourTheres also a scene in which an alien gets slowly sucked out of a hole intospace a process that makes a meat grinder look merciful The movies otherWagnerian set piece features the Ripley clonewho has an  stenciled on herarmcoming upon a room that contains the previous seven attempts to bring herback This therebutforthegraceofGod sequence almost justifies the moviesabsurd premise            Alien Resurrection is reasonably entertainingbut its the unwieldy product of what I call the Two Romans Syndrome basedon the experience of a friend of mine who worked on the soap opera Days ofOur Lives  Briefly or semibriefly Roman was married to Marlena who wasplayed by one of soapdoms divas When she decided to leave the show hercharacter got killed in a plane crash and the guy playing Roman decamped tooto be replaced by another actor about  years younger six inches taller andbuilt like the exbaseball player that he was Except that when the divarejoined the show a few years laterit turns out her character didnt die inthat plane crash but had amnesia etcshe said Wouldnt it be wonderful towork with my Roman again And they said Er theres another guy herenow and hes really popular And the diva said Work it out So in wandersRoman I to announce that he has been held prisoner on an island for the lastfive years andwait a minute whos this other guy Zounds Roman II doesntknow either It took six months to execute a plotinvolving mad scientists andpersonality transplants and amnesia and plastic surgeryto account for whatwas in essence the idiotic whim of some diva            I digressabout the Two Romans Syndrome out of sympathy for the writer Joss WhedonBecause once you immolate your leading lady you have to execute some mightyviolent narrative contortions to bring her back and by the time youveexplained what shes doing there and why half the movie is gone And whatsleftdespite all the offalfeels inorganic In addition to Ripley coping withher personhoodalienhood you have a setup out of The PoseidonAdventure  with a bunch of people trying to push their way through thewatery space station to reach their little ship with one after another gettinggobbled down by aliens at regular intervals            Aside from Weaver theres another wild cardWinona Ryderas an enigmatic character named Annalee Call who comes on board the stationwith a team of smugglers and an agenda of her own Its possible that Rydergets worse the harder she tries to act Her scenes with Weaver are sad Shedoesnt have the older actresss histrionic resources plastic physique orenergy And shes playing a role that would likely confound the most able mindsof her generation            Ryder and Weaver haveexchanges as stilted as anything in Plan  From OuterSpace surprisingly since Whedon who wrote Buffy the VampireSlayer  Toy Story  and did the uncredited rewrite of Speed has a pretty good ear One character actually snarls I am not a man withwhom to fuck But even with her stinko lines Weaver has never been asflabbergastingly gorgeous and charismatic Shes tall and lean and meteorhardand you can almost believe theres really acid in her blood and that no alienin its right mind would mess with her Her skin has an unearthly glow whichmight be the work of the brilliant cinematographer Darius Khondji ofSeven  orWeaver being Weavermight just be coming from within
