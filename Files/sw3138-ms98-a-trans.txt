              okay i guess were going to discuss food and cooking   alright   do you enjoy cooking   sometimes not all the time     im kind of that way too when i have i i enjoy cooking when i have time   right   i dont enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday   yeah that thats about the same boat im in too   it gets kind of boring   yeah   how big is the family you cook for   uh five   uhhuh we have four so and two of them are teenage boys so   oh yeah well ill be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys too so   are they   and they get pretty particular sometimes in what they want to have   yeah yeah we have that problem too but also now its just the amount that they eat its just absolutely incredible   uh oh yeah well see i my my oldest is nine and he already he already does that   yeah does he  well   and i told him hes going to have to get a parttime job by the time he reaches teenage years so he can eat   yeah  thats true uh do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal   um   favorite recipes that youve come across or   my husband and i our favorite meal is um and we do it like for special stuff celebrations and we have like steak and he does the steak and then uh   uhhuh out on the grill uhhuh   uhhuh and he marinates it in his special stuff that he does and its real good and uh i do sauteed mushrooms so and asparagus and thats our favorite   oh uhhuh   ooh yeah ooh thats sound good i love that   dinner   my husband really likes seafood   yeah so do we   um and uh i think that no matter what i do i dont serve enough of it really to uh to suit him i didnt grow up eating that much seafood and um so i dont know its just kind of not natural to me but i like it and uh i dont know one of his favorite things is uh   yeah   well its called seafood stew and its really its really like a soup soup that that you serve over rice   uhhuh   and uh it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it and   its not the one with all the shells and stuff in it is it   no no thats kind of Louisiana i think if you do that yeah  i dont either   i dont know what that i dont see how you eat that but   but uh no this is just really it is really good and and one thing thats good is it makes the a large amount and so i freeze usually we eat one and i freeze two containers of it then thats just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice   oh   but neither of my kids will eat it you know so then they eat a pizza or   yeah so it yeah it defeats the purpose     yeah it really does one thing ive run across recently though a friend gave me a recipe that i really like for chicken enchiladas have you made them   oh yeah yeah my husband makes those im not i dont eat enchiladas i i dont like enchiladas i dont like the texture i dont know i guess its the texture or something i dont like the taste of enchiladas but everyone else in my family does   does he ooh uhhuh yeah well are these are done with a flour tortilla is that what he uses yeah   yeah i dont know i its i dont know what i dont know i i dont know what it is about the enchiladas i just and im the only one including my Mom and Dad and my brother im the only one that doesnt eat it but my kids love it you know   isnt that something yeah i was going to say my kids both eat it i guess thats one thing that i particularly like um but i think its good for you know for for company too and ive made it a few times um and you can make a lot at one time   uhhuh   when i needed to make something to uh to give somebody you know like you know to take over to somebodys house or something else   yeah yeah ive got a chicken casserole thats like that that that ive   it its nice when it makes a lot because you can feed your own family and then uhhuh   yeah because i when i make this chicken casserole i it it makes a real big casserole and then another one that i freeze   uhhuh   so or i give it to my Mom and Dad if i know were not going to eat   what what does it have in it   its just you can use chicken or turkey because my Mom started making it like right after Thanksgiving and using the leftover turkey   uhhuh sure uhhuh   and its rice and i i i when i do recipes i just throw stuff in i dont im not real good about measuring because i just i do it to taste   yeah uhhuh sure sometimes those are the best ones   and well yeah but it its like its just chicken it its as much as you want you know torn up and and rice and cream of chicken soup and some mayonnaise and lemon juice   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and celery and thats it and some hard boiled eggs   yeah ooh that sounds good   and thats it you just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to you know heat it through and you sprinkle uh that those um toasted onion rings   uhhuh oh yeah those are good arent they uhhuh   on top of it for the crunchy and thats it you know and it it it goes and its filling because of the rice   um that sounds good right   so   you cook the rice before you put it in yeah   uhhuh yeah   i bet the mayonnaise in there makes it really kind of gives it a tang that would be good   yeah it gives it a an extra yeah little tang   i guess i would now use the the new mayonnaise free   yeah that cholesterol fat free   yeah thats really wonderful that theyre coming out with so many   uhhuh   new things like that because like i told my husband this summer i love to eat you know chicken salad and tuna salad and stuff like that and and you know basically it certainly a low low calorie you know good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing   uhhuh i know   you know and now its its its okay and you can even i used to just put a tiny bit in well now im just putting more and more in   i dont like tuna salad unless its got lots of mayonnaise in it   yeah and its only it used to be like a hundred hundred calories per tablespoon and now its like twelve oh i just think thats the best thing to have happened im just so excited about that   yeah i know   anyway   yeah we did the lowcal stuff well with my kids i dont they get enough sugar and stuff anyway mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway and they dont need any added help   yeah yes right   so when were here at home you know with sweets and stuff they they dont we dont really do that much i do a lot of fruits   uhhuh   instead of the cakes and the candies and you know stuff like that and and drink wise they have KoolAid milk or water normally now when they go to their grandmothers house   uhhuh uhhuh yeah uhhuh     which is every weekend its a its a different its a different story all around   thats when they as our family would say a pig out huh   uhhuh thats exactly what it is   thats good oh one of my boys that thats twelve um  is has high cholesterol   oh really   have you ever found out about your kids   no not yet   and my other one does not so oh year or so ago he found out and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down and did he was able to get it down   huh   its i think its mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high things in cholesterol hes never eaten any eggs hes never had anything but skim milk and you know ive never bought butter  and things like that but um   yeah huh   oh he just left for the doctor again and its its kind of back up um so he needs to be careful again so weve really been talking about the foods you know for him to to be sure to eat yeah and uh   yeah the lower cholesterol foods and stuff   so hes eating an apple a day for the last two days       so all that kind of stuff does really help well i think weve probably talked long enough and
