                    Introduction        Since the early s spiral computed tomography CT        scanners have permitted assessment of the entire pulmonary        parenchyma in a very short period of time     In        patients with acute lung injury ALI injection of contrast        material is considered useful for differentiating        consolidated lung parenchyma from pleural effusion and for        diagnosing lung abscess It is also required for diagnosis        of pulmonary embolism As a consequence injection of        contrast material is routinely performed in critically ill        patients undergoing a thoracic CT scan           In the presence of alterations in the bloodbrain        barrier injection of contrast material increases brain        oedema      This is due to the direct toxic        effects of the contrast material on nerve cells          which result from its osmotic effect after intracellular        penetration Similarly in ALI breakdown of the        constituents of the alveolarcapillary barrier pulmonary        epithelium or capillary endothelium causes an increase in        lung permeability which is accompanied by interstitial and        alveolar accumulation of water and proteins          Alteration in the alveolarcapillary barrier could also        promote leakage of contrast material into the interstitial        and alveolar spaces with a consequent increase in        extravascular lung water Using CT the latter may be        measured as an increase in lung tissue However        administration of contrast material creates a density        artifact that may lead to an overestimation of lung tissue        The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of        intravenous injection of contrast material on CT        measurement of volumes of gas and lung tissue in patients        with ALI and to test the hypothesis that administration of        contrast material increases extravascular lung water In        addition in order to estimate the range of error in        determining lung tissue that results from administration of        contrast material a lung phantom was filled with known        volumes of water containing increasing concentrations of        contrast material and was scanned to compare the calculated        increases in volume of water with the actual instilled        volume                    Materials and method                  Patients          Fourteen patients hospitalized in the Surgical          Intensive Care Unit of La PitiSalptrire for ALI were          prospectively studied   Inclusion criteria were as          follows a ratio of arterial oxygen tension to fractional          inspired oxygen of less than  mmHg at zero          endexpiratory pressure bilateral hyperdensities on a          bedside chest radiogram and pulmonary capillary wedge          pressure below  mmHg andor left ventricular ejection          fraction greater than  as estimated by          transoesophageal echocardiography Informed consent was          obtained from the patients next of kin In each patient          a thoracic CT scan with injection of contrast material          was indicated clinically for diagnosing lung abscess          pulmonary embolism or pleural effusion                          Spiral thoracic computed tomography scan technical          characteristics          Each patient was transported to the Department of          Radiology Thoracic Division by two experienced          physicians Patients were sedated and paralyzed with a          continuous intravenous infusion of  gkg per hour          fentanyl  mgkg per hour midazolam and  mgkg per          hour vecuronium Mechanical ventilation was provided          using an Osiris ventilator Taema Antony France which          was specifically designed for delivering  oxygen          during transportation of critically ill patients          Electrocardiography pulse oxymetry and systemic arterial          pressure were monitored continuously using a Propaq           EL monitor Protocol System North Chicago IL USA          Spiral lung scanning was performed at endexpiration          from the apex to the diaphragm using a Tomoscan SR           Philips Eindhoven The Netherlands Disconnection from          the ventilator and  s apnoea were necessary to obtain          the CT sections which resulted in a transient          desaturation in most patients the lowest oxygen          saturation measured being  All images were observed          and photographed at a window width of  Hounsfield          units HU and a level of  HU The exposures were          taken at  kV and  mA The value of the pitch was           In the present study each voxel had a volume of  mm           As previously described      we evaluated          contiguous axial CT sections  mm thick which were          reconstructed from the volumetric data On each CT          section right and left lung parenchyma were delineated          using the roller ball of the computer The          reproducibility of manual delineation was excellent with          determinations of the overall lung volume by three          different operators showing a maximal difference of           ml The respective volumes of gas and lung tissue and          the distribution of lung aeration were compared before          and after injection of contrast material using the          Lungview Institut National des Tlcommunications          Evry France as was previously described                        Two groups of patients were studied in group             n   CT sections were acquired          before and  s after injection of contrast material and          in group             n   the CT sections were          obtained before and  min after injection of contrast          material In both groups a volume of  ml of contrast          material iobitridol Xenetix  Guerbet Roissy          France was automatically injected into the superior vena          cava at a constant flow of  mls In one patient CT          sections acquired  s after the injection of contrast          material were repeated  min later                          Computed tomography measurement of lung volumes and          blood density                      Apparent lung volumes of gas and tissue            CT scans obtained before and after injection of            contrast material were analyzed using specially            designed software Lungview  which is based on the            tight correlations that exist between radiological and            physical densities              Before and after injection of contrast material the            analysis was performed according to the following            principles The CT number characterizing each            individual voxel is expressed in HU and is defined as            the attenuation coefficient of the radiogram by the            material being studied minus the attenuation            coefficient of water divided by the attenuation            coefficient of water By convention the CT number of            water is  HU The CT number is scaled by a factor             the CT number of gas being  HU A lung area            characterized by a mean CT number of  HU is            considered to be composed of  gas and  tissue A            lung area characterized by a mean CT number of  HU            is considered to be composed of  gas and  tissue            Using this analysis it was possible to compute the            volume of gas and tissue present in the lungs            In the first step the distribution of CT numbers            was measured on each CT section for  compartments            between  HU and  HU examining an interval of             HU per compartment For each compartment of a            known number of voxels the total volume and the volume            of gas and lung tissue were computed using the            following equations in which CT is the mean CT            number of the compartment analyzed            Volume of the voxel  size of the pixel  section            thickness             Total volume  number of voxels  volume of the            voxel             Apparent volume of gas  CT  total volume            if the compartment considered has a CT number below             volume of gas   if the compartment considered has a            CT number above              Apparent volume of tissue    CT  total            volume if the compartment considered has a CT number            below              or volume of tissue  number of voxels  volume of            the voxel if the compartment considered has a CT            number above              In a second step the volumes of gas and lung tissue            of each region of interest were calculated by adding            the values of all of the compartments present within            the region of interest considered In a third step the            volumes of gas and lung tissue of both lungs were            calculated by adding the volumes of all lung regions            right lung  left lung The total lung volume at            endexpiration was defined as the sum of gas and tissue            volumes The overall volume of gas present at            endexpiration in both lungs was defined as functional            residual capacity            The distribution of lung tissue along the            cephalocaudal axis was determined in patients by taking            into consideration all  mm thick CT sections between            the apex and the lung base The distribution of gas and            lung tissue along the anteroposterior axis was            determined on five contiguous  mm thick CT sections            located around the tracheal carina one located at the            carina level and two above and two below the carina            level by taking into consideration  contiguous            compartments of similar height between the sternum and            the vertebrae                                  Maximal artifactual increase in lung            tissue            In each patient blood density was measured in the            pulmonary artery before and after injection of contrast            material in order to determine the concentration of            contrast material present in the pulmonary circulation             s and  min after injection            The maximal artifactual increase in lung tissue was            calculated as follows First it was hypothesized that            the  ml contrast material had penetrated into the            alveolarinterstitial compartment and had created a            gascontrast material interface It was assumed that            the alveolarinterstitial contrast material            concentration was equal to the concentration measured            within pulmonary arteries a positive concentration            gradient between extravascular and vasular spaces being            very unlikely The new CT number of the lung parenchyma            CT             new  was then calculated as            follows                        Where CT             control  mean CT number of the lung            parenchyma before injection volume             tot control  total lung volume            before injection and CT             blood inj  CT number of the            pulmonary artery following injection The apparent            volume of lung tissue following injection V             tissue  would have been calculated            as follows            V             tissue     CT             new   volume             tot inj             Where volume             tot inj  total lung volume            following injection If the  ml contrast material had            been replaced by  ml plasma then the new CT number            CT               and the calculated volume of            lung tissue V             tissue  would have been                        V             tissue     CT                volume             tot inj             Where CT             blood control  CT number of the            pulmonary artery before injection The maximal            artifactual increase in lung tissue following the            injection of contrast material was then calculated as V                        tissue   V             tissue  and the minimal actual            increase in lung tissue as the apparent increase in            lung tissue minus the maximal artifactual increase in            lung tissue                                    Preparation of the human lung phantom          The error resulting from the presence of contrast          material in the determination of gas and lung tissue          volumes was assessed on a lung phantom that was prepared          according to a technique proposed by Markarian and Dailey          in     This simple and easily implemented          method is aimed at producing a lung specimen that can be          stored for over  years without damage   and is          suitable for histopathology radiography and CT          examinations          In  a postmortem left pneumonectomy was performed          in a yearold man who died from acute respiratory          distress syndrome complicating postoperative          bronchopneumonia  days after surgical resection of a          thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm The pneumonectomy was          performed according to the French legislation law no           December   followed by the statutory          order no  of March   and the implementation          order of April   and after obtaining informed          consent from the patients relatives A thoracotomy was          performed in the fifth left intercostal space at the          bedside under surgical conditions within  min after          death After cessation of mechanical ventilation both          lungs were then removed from the thorax with the trachea          being sectioned immediately beneath the larynx After          dissection carefully avoiding lung laceration both          lungs were separated by a tracheal section at the carina          level leaving a long portion of the left main stem          bronchus the pulmonary vessels were tied with strings          and the left main stem bronchus was cannulated with an          endotracheal tube no  The left lung was then inflated          via the endotracheal tube by a fixative composed of          polyethylene glycol   ethyl alcohol            formaldehyde   and water  The fixative was          instilled by gravity at a pressure of  cmH            O until the lung surface was firmly          distended and small amounts of fixative were weeping          through the pleural surface The endotracheal tube was          clamped in order to prevent loss of fluid and the lung          specimen was floated in a container filled with the same          fixative for  days          The lung was then suspended from a ring stand over a          drip basin and the endotracheal tube was connected to a          source of air equipped with a continuous positive airway          pressure system set at a pressure of  cmH            O The air pressure causing the          fixative to weep from the pleural surface was maintained          over  days and a dry left lung with spongy texture was          obtained The lung was stored in a hermetically sealed          bag between  and  without detectable          deterioration                          Effects of contrast material on computed tomography          determination of lung volumes          The effect of contrast material on CT determination of          gas and lung tissue volumes was assessed according to a          technique recently described            In a first step the contrast material was diluted          with water to obtain solutions of increasing          concentrations       and  The          mean CT attenuation corresponding to each concentration          of contrast material was measured by scanning one          reservoir filled with water and six reservoirs filled          with the solutions of increasing concentrations The CT          attenuation of pure contrast material was  HU As          shown in Fig  CT attenuation increased linearly with          the concentration of contrast material in the          solution          In a second step assessment of the artifactual          changes in gas and tissue volume in the presence of          contrast material was performed on the lung phantom The          volumes of the different aliquots instilled in the          phantom were compared with the volumes computed using          Lungview on the corresponding CT scans Equation  above          which does not take into consideration the presence of          contrast material was used for this calculation Eight          CT scans of the human lung phantom were performed          following successive bronchial instillations of water or          solution containing  iobitridol The phantom was first          filled with three aliquots of water   and  ml          administered into the left mainstem bronchus After each          aliquot the phantom was weighed using an electronic          scale Teraillon BE  Paris France The phantom was          then dried with a hair drier until its weight returned to          the initial dry weight One week later the phantom was          filled with three aliquots of a solution containing  of          iobitridol and weighed after each aliquot          The volume of each aliquot of water was equivalent to          its weight physical density   mgml The volume of          each aliquot W           aliq  containing  contrast material          was lower than its weight physical density   gml          As a consequence the volume of the aliquot V           aliq  was calculated as V           aliq   W           aliq  The volume of each aliquot          measured from its weight was then compared with the          volume of the aliquot calculated using Lungview                           Statistical analysis          Results are expressed as mean  SD Lung volumes          before and after injection of contrast material were          compared using a Wilcoxon test The measured and Lungview          derived volumes of aliquots were compared by linear          regression analysis and using the BlandAltman method            Statistical analysis was performed using Statview           SAS Institute Inc Cary NC USA and           P   was considered          statistically significant                            Results                  Patients          The clinical and respiratory characteristics of the           patients are summarized in Table  No statistically          significant differences were found between the two          groups Patients were admitted for ALI complicating major          vascular surgery            n   oesophageal surgery

arteries          before and after injection of contrast material The          pulmonary arterial concentration of contrast material          ranged between  and  at  s after the injection          and between  and  at  min after the injection          Figs shows  representative CT sections acquired in one          patient at baseline  s and  min following injection          of contrast material Pulmonary vessels were opacified by          contrast material only on the CT sections taken  s          after injection whereas lung parenchyma was opacified on          CT sections taken  s and  min after injection The          corresponding apparent volumes of lung tissue were           ml baseline  ml  s and  ml  min          As shown in Table  injection of contrast material          increased the apparent volume of lung tissue by             ml in group             P   and    ml in group                      P   whereas the apparent          volume of gas decreased by    ml in group             P   and    ml in group                      P   Total lung volume          remained unchanged in both groups The changes in          apparent lung tissue volumes between the two groups did          not reach statistical significance            P            As shown in Fig  the individual increase in lung          tissue volume was variable from one patient to another          ranging from  to  and with mean changes of    in          group  and    in group  Thirty seconds after the          injection the maximal artifactual increase in lung          tissue represented    of the apparent increase in          lung tissue extremes  and  Fifteen minutes after          the injection the maximal artifactual increase in lung          tissue represented    of the apparent increase in          lung tissue extremes  and                           Effects of contrast material on computed tomography          lung volume determination          As shown in Fig  a close correlation was found          between the measured volumes of aliquots and the volumes          of aliquots calculated using Lungview  The mean bias          and precision were  and  ml when the fixed lung          model was instilled with water and  and  ml when          a solution containing  of contrast material was          instilled respectively The presence of contrast          material in the aliquots was associated with an           overestimation of the liquid volume by Lungview                             Discussion        The present study shows an increase in the volume of        lung tissue at  s and at  min after injection of        contrast material in patients with ALI This finding        probably results from a true increase in extravascular lung        water and from an artifactual increase in lung density        caused by the intrapulmonary diffusion of contrast        material The former effect which is not observed when the        lungs are healthy   probably depends on alteration in        the alveolarcapillary barrier that promotes extravascular        leakage of contrast material        The accuracy of Lungview for measuring lung tissue        volume was recently assessed by instilling known volumes of        water and albumin into a fixed spongy textured human lung        phantom   In the present study using the same model        we found that the administration of solutions containing         of contrast material resulted in an  artifactual        overestimation of lung tissue volume A  concentration        was chosen to mimic clinical conditions as shown in Fig         pulmonary vessels and lung parenchyma were opacified         s after injection of contrast material and CT attenuations        measured in pulmonary arteries corresponded to low        concentrations of contrast material ranging between         and  In six patients the apparent increase in lung        tissue was either below or slightly greater than  of the        preinjection lung tissue volume and could therefore be        artifactual However the concentration of contrast        material was less than  in all patients and we        calculated the maximal artifactual increase in lung tissue        that would have resulted from a total leakage of the        contrast material into the lung parenchyma As shown in        Table and Fig  after eliminating the maximal        artifactual increase in lung tissue a true increase in the        volume of lung tissue was observed in each individual It        must be pointed out that the assumption that  of the        contrast material had penetrated into the lung parenchyma         s after the injection is unlikely to be valid As a        consequence the actual increase in lung tissue was in fact        much greater depending on the amount of contrast material        that penetrated into the lungs In healthy volunteers        injection of contrast material did not produce any        detectable modification in the lung tissue volume        calculated using Lungview  probably because the contrast        material remained strictly intravascular in the presence of        an intact alveolarcapillary barrier and was rapidly        eliminated in the urine          Fifteen minutes after injection pulmonary vessels were        no longer opacified and CT attenuations measured in        pulmonary arteries corresponded to concentrations of        contrast material of  or less In the patients with an        apparent increase in lung tissue of greater than  of the        preinjection lung tissue volume the artifact created by        the presence of contrast material within the lung        parenchyma contributed far less than  In other words a        significant and clinically relevant increase in lung tissue        was observed  min after injection of contrast material in        four patients This increase in lung tissue volume is        probably due to an increase in extravascular lung        water        The injured lung is characterized by an excessive amount        of extravascular lung water that accumulates in        interstitial and alveolar compartments and by an        infiltration of lung structures by inflammatory cells        Excessive oedema and lung inflammation are measured as        tissue in excess by the CT method   In patients        ventilated for ALI variations in lung tissue volumes and        aeration have been observed following changes of position        or administration of positive endexpiratory pressure             In patients with chronic renal failure        haemodialysisinduced decrease in intravascular and        extravascular water is associated with a decrease in lung        CT attenuation   In the present study injection of        contrast material shifted the volumic distribution of CT        attenuation toward higher values suggesting an increase in        extravascular lung water A number of elements support a        true increase in the volume of extravascular lung water        rather than a simple density artifact resulting from the        presence of contrast material in the vascular space First        the increase in volume of lung tissue that was observed         s after injection of contrast material persisted  min        later although the concentrations of contrast material        decreased below  thereby creating a negligible density        artifact that is unable to account for the persisting        increase in lung tissue Second the mean increase in the        volume of lung tissue was fold greater than the expected        increase in pulmonary blood volume resulting from injection        of  ml contrast material Third the majority of patients        had an ALI characterized by a lobar CT attenuation pattern        with a large predominance of nonaerated lung tissue        Accordingly the increase in lung tissue was computed for a        good part as the additional number of voxels with a CT        attenuation greater than  Consequently the increase in        CT attenuation resulting from the intraparenchymal        diffusion of contrast material could not be the cause of a        major artifactual increase in lung tissue in nonaerated        lung regions Indeed counting a voxel with a CT        attenuation equal to  or  HU has the same significance        as a lung area with a mean CT attenuation close to         The amplitude of the increase in lung tissue was        variable from one patient to another depending on the        relative importance of the artifactual increase in lung        density and the true increase in extravascular lung water        In fact our findings partly invalidate a statement that we        made in a previous study   that the injection of        contrast material does not influence the distribution of CT        numbers in ALI this statement is true in healthy        volunteers but it does not apply to patients with ALI        Although we did not assess the clinical relevance of the        measured increase in lung tissue it appears prudent to        restrict the indication of CT scans with contrast to        specific indications such as diagnosis of pulmonary        embolism Based on the potential of contrast material to        worsen the respiratory condition of patients with ALI its        administration to assist in differentiating between lung        consolidation and pleural effusion does not appear        justified                    Key messages         In patients with ALI administration of contrast        material induces an apparent increase in lung tissue         This apparent increase in lung tissue results from a        true increase in extravascular lung water and from an        artifactual increase in lung density resulting from leakage        of contrast material into the lung parenchyma         The increase in extravascular lung water persists         min after injection         Because injection of contrast material may worsen lung        injury it appears prudent to limit this procedure to        specific indications in patients with ALI undergoing a        thoracic CT scan                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        ALI  acute lung injury CT  computed tomography HU         Hounsfield units
