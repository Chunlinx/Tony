                                 Did Gore Hatch Horton            Conservative commentators have taken to repeating the mantra that Al Goreintroduced Willie Horton the inflammatory racial symbol who enlivened the presidential race to political debate in America On Oct  William Kristoleditor and publisher of the Weekly Standard  said on ABCs This Week                                              Gores a mean tough political fighter Gore is the one who introducedWillie Horton to American politics in the  primary against MikeDukakis                                       Kristol repeated this almost verbatim in a Memo to Bill Bradley that appeared in the issue ofNewsweek that hit newsstands the following day                                             Big Al can be a tough mean player After all hes the guy whointroduced Willie Horton to the American public in his primary campaign againstMichael Dukakis                                       Four days after that Paul Gigot wrote in his Oct  Wall StreetJournal column                                             Recall that the candidate who first raised the prison furlough WillieHorton issue against Mike Dukakis in  wasnt George Bush It was AlGore                         Horton you may recall is a black man who while doing prison time inMassachusetts for murder escaped from a weekend furlough and committed aparticularly brutal assault and rape Dukakis hadnt started the state programthat allowed prisoners like Horton who were serving life sentences withoutparole to take furloughsthat would have been Dukakis Republican predecessoras governor of Massachusetts Francis Sargent But Dukakis even after hearingwhat Horton did on his furlough was resistant to ending the programwhich the state legislature finally did after much crusading by a localnewspaper Hortons story was subsequently offered up by Vice President GeorgeBushs campaign as evidence of Dukakis softness on crime andlessdirectlyof the Democratic partys excessive fondness for black people Itwas an ugly election Introducing Willie Horton to American politicaldiscourse would not seem to be something to be proud of Is it true that Goredid so And if it is true was Gores  campaign guilty of injecting crypticracist messages into the debate The answers to these questions arerespectively yes and no            Gore did ask Dukakis in a debate right before the  New York primaryabout weekend passes for convicted criminals Here is how Sidney Blumenthalnow a Clinton White House aide but then a reporter for the WashingtonPost  wrote it up a few months later                                             An uncomfortable Dukakis after dispassionately reciting statisticsconceded that the Massachusetts furlough program for murderers sentenced tolife imprisonment had been canceled                                  The issue did not take for Gore but the exchange attracted the interestof Jim Pinkerton the research director for the then flailing Bush campaignThats the first time I paid attention said Pinkerton I thought to myselfThis is incredible It totally fell into our lap                                       In reviewing this history its important to make some crucial distinctionsGore never mentioned that Horton was black indeed he never mentioned Hortonby name He merely drew attention correctly to the damaging fact that Dukakishad tolerated a furlough program for especially violent criminals in his stateeven after a horrific incident strongly suggested this was a bad policy Itsconceivable of course that Gore was warming up for more explicit and raciallytinged use of Hortons story later in the primary fight But that would havebeen uncharacteristic of him In any event Gore dropped out of the raceshortly after the debate            Now recall what the Republicans did with Hortons story An independentexpenditure group aired an ad for Bush showing a picture of Horton ARepublican fundraising letter in Maryland showed pictures of Dukakis andHorton alongside the following text Is this your profamily team for Horton told Playboy magazine in  that a woman who identified herselfas working for an organization affiliated with the Bush campaign phoned himand wrote letters to him up in prison trying to get him to endorse Dukakis Theofficial Bush campaign of course kept its distance from such efforts andclaimed to use Horton only in raceneutral ways But there is plenty ofevidence that it was heartily appreciative of the racial subtext In his bookabout the  campaign Pledging Allegiance  Blumenthal quotes ananonymous member of the Bush campaign team as saying Willie Horton has starquality Willies going to be politically furloughed to terrorize again Its awonderful mix of liberalism and a big black rapist Although Bushs campaignmanager Lee Atwater always insisted publicly that for the Bush campaignHorton was never a racial symbol Atwater slipped in a speech he gave tosouthern Republicans right before that years Democratic convention                                             There is a story about a fellow named Willie Horton who for all I knowmay end up to be Dukakis running mate Dukakis is making Hamlet look like therock of Gibraltar in the way hes acted on this This was a reference toDukakis search for a vicepresidential candidate The guy was on TV abouta month ago and he said youll never see me standing in the driveway of myhouse talking to these candidates And guess what on Monday I saw in thedriveway of his house Jesse Jackson So anyway maybe hell put this WillieHorton guy on the ticket after all is said and done                                       As was noted at the time by Thomas Edsall of the Washington Post andothers Atwater was pretty clearly equating Jesse Jackson with Willie Hortonbecause both happened to be black Gore never did that He never did anythingclose to that
