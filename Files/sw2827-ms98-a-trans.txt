                okay um do you like to cook   well i love to cook as a matter of fact im making dinner right now   oh really what are you making     um i um im making some uh i have a little turkey left from a passover which which which was in April   uhhuh   and i had frozen it and im defrosting that and making some defrosting some gravy and making corn and this wheat pilaf stuff that you can buy at a store which is like uh rice pilaf but we with with with wheat kernel that   uhhuh and do you cook i mean are you single do you cook every night for yourself   no um im married and actually the my wife is a vegetarian   uhhuh   so this isnt for her this is for our friends that came over and helped helped me do some stuff so stuff so he and i and and shes having i i do cook um virtually i cook most of the time because i   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh well like if you were having a dinner party what would you cook a variety of things i mean you know vegetarian and nonvegetarian   yeah we we consistently if we cook if if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier   uhhuh   so well make something you know uh some sort of pasta or something you know homemade pasta or lasagna or something   uhhuh yeah thats something thats you know really easy in fact im having a dinner party next Saturday and that is what im having is pasta   oh good idea what   well for for Christmas i got a um pasta machine and all all my friends are really anxious you know to have the homemade noodles so um   um electric or uh   no its the hand kind old fashion kind   best kind that that that thats we we bought one in Italy thats the best kind to have   uhhuh yeah yeah i like you know kind of still having in put that not everythings being done for me you know   uhhuh thats real good   but um yeah so thats what im going to be cooking you know i thought i would have like an antipasta um salad first and um then just something for desert you know bread and wine and cheese stuff like that   um that would be great have you made pasta before   uhhuh   um so you know so you know that its a a lot of fun actually   yeah yeah yeah a lot of people think though that ive talked to about it think that its you know a lot of hard work and i said heck its kind of easy   i it actually is if if if you have a food processor i dont know if you have a food processor or not actually it it turns out that if if if if you really want to be nice and easy about it you can make the dough in the food processor really simply   yeah i do uhhuh   and then um and with that it it becomes really easy to make colorful pasta by throwing in some spinach or some tomato or something and mixing it up it it it its just a snap from there and then you get to roll it out yourself   right right uhhuh uhhuh   i made yucky i making yucky every now and then as well   uhhuh   its also people think its real hard it just time consuming to get all of the little things right otherwise its real simple its good stuff   uhhuh uhhuh   what other kinds of uh dinner parties  do you serve   um well i dont entertain that often uh when i do though i i have some friends that i always  like to experiment on but you know um i see a recipe and think oh wow id really like to try this cause im single and i live by myself     uhhuh   so its not necessarily something that i would cook just for myself   right you didnt want to cook   so ill say okay you guys are experimental i want say how this is going to turn out  but  here we go and usually im im pretty good about it   thats great   um i have this really good recipe for this um pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing and um you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything and my girlfriend and her husband loved it in fact she passed it on to her parent and   huh     so its like it really made the rounds and i was quite impressed with myself if i should say so   well that yeah thats the way these things sort of make it is you make it for one person as an experiment and   uhhuh   i usually find it when i make up for the first time i usually doctor it just a little bit you know my own way here and there and it works real well   uhhuh uhhuh well im the kind of cook that i dont normally measure things i just kind of throw them in and you know i dont to the point of you know measuring down to the exact amount that they say   that means youre a real cook   oh is that what it means   if youve ever watched the ones on television like uh Jeff Schmidt the super gourmet he he just throws takes stuff he says yeah about an ounce of this  or something   uhhuh     its real good yeah we have a   uhhuh   we do uh uh middle eastern dinner quite a bit actually or uh we have people other that have never experienced it before and havent had much middle eastern food   uhhuh no i havent   we make uh because were my wife is Syrian and um her families always have this food she grew up in and ive made some of it before as well so we make uh four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   we put them out for people and and thats always a real big kick for people who want you know whove never tried it before   uhhuh   thats thats thats thats a fun idea i mean if you ever uh want something different to try   uhhuh   i would try that   um yeah ive been wanting to take an um oriental cooking class and i just havent gotten around to it yet   oh do you have a wok though yeah those   yeah yeah i stir fry things on occasion but id like to know more about you know more elaborate things i guess   i think its Gods gift to cooking       because its just quick its easy um and the food just comes out you know if you do it right i think it comes out   uhhuh uhhuh   the food comes out very tasty not very mushy you know and and it doesnt taste like a million calories of oil so   umhum uhhuh   we live live in our wok   uhhuh really   yeah we we we like to eat even when we eat out and stuff we eat a lot of Chinese food or Japanese food or you know Korean or something or Vietnamese or something   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and that seems to so wok food seems to be our thing   uhhuh   so anything else you cook   um i just kind of you know cook here cook there i dont have any one specialty i mean im always willing to try anything usually   well thats good thats always the way to do it i think its the   and i i especially like baking and making deserts ive taken a cake decorating class and   oh the Wilson course   no no actually it was a private course through like a company   i like it thats great i havent the the the thing i really want to do i keep seeing the signs for the the Wilson class   it is its its neat but it takes a long time you know i mean like im elected to always bring cakes into work       like for peoples birthdays and that and its like you know you bake the cakes and then i guess just because i dont have the expertise to just hurry up and do it like you know some a professional would i try to i go real slow and you know its a little time consuming but its really worth your effort once you see how you do   right uhhuh yeah oh yeah we have um my brother can do it hes hes uh got a degree in business management so he learned to uh how to do this really well   uhhuh uhhuh   can you hold on one second thank you   sure     thank you sorry about that   thats okay   some one kept beeping in our calling waiting over and over again so   uhhuh uhhuh   yeah he he does does that a lot so you know he cooks a lot   so uhhuh   but you know he bakes a lot whenever he when when my wife and i got married the night before we had a party or two nights before and he baked us he made a real big cake himself   uhhuh uhhuh   did it up and we have a friend who can do for New Years our friend made a baby cake like a baby New York   oh my uhhuh   it was amazing   uhhuh   i never have cant do anything with cakes so       i get the mold i put i put it on you know the frosting always melts and its its just horrible     well you learn helpful hints in the classes at least   yeah im   you know the instructor told us certain things about well dont follow whats really necessarily on the box you know if youre making just a cake from a box you know do this cause you know make it a variety   oh that that you mean about the mix itself well that helps   you know some different hints yeah some different hints you know and the different things the different kinds of frostings you can make you know and i have a book an it and you know all of the different you know decorating tips an things like that   yeah   so   well most frostings are sort of butter cream to arent they   yeah yeah   those are those kill me its like its like im eating sugar but theyre good sugar   well yeah   i suspect thats part of the problem but you know   yeah so thats about it   yeah i guess so it was it was a pleasure chatting with you yes well have a good time
