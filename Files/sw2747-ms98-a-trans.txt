        okay Jim um what are they doing down in your uh neck of the woods for recycling   we have recently the city of Plano has started a a situation its pretty much volunteer as far as separating oh paper and bottles and you know cans and that sort of thing   yeah   and uh its not exactly curbside yet theyve got these little igloo like things sitting up in various parts of town where you can take that stuff in if you want to the biggest thing that theyve done is uh for forever we had been on the plastic trash bag business where everything was just uh put in uh plastic bags then set out in the alley but uh they came through with these big green uh plastic dumpster kind of things uh where you put everything except lawn trash and then they  they we got these uh paper sacks to put uh lawn debris and stuff in supposedly uh you know it can all be mulched at once the paper sack and everything only problem is you cant get anything in the paper sack   oh thats theyre theyre too small   yeah theyre too small on the top and theyre theyre smaller than most grass catchers and that sort of thing so they just started this uh oh maybe a month or two ago and uh they uh the local folks you know theyre just starting to use them now that the grass is starting to you know be cut and everything were getting a lot of complaints about them but   yeah   uh you know i i realize the whole the whole recycling trash thing is a is such a problem because the landfill and all that uh   yeah thats true right um   i dont know what are they theyre probably doing more than that up there im i guess you all started this sort of thing long time before we did   yeah well up  Massachusetts i i live in Rhode Island   umhum   and you know i travel back and forth which isnt too far its only i only live about uh about eight miles from the plant   oh   so i live right up in the uh in the northeast corner of Rhode Island and and the plant is is in uh is in the like the south uh southwest section of Massachusetts it comes down like kind of a neck so   hum yeah   i dont have for to travel but i live in a rural community and last year we started recycling they made it mandatory in in our town   umhum   and they gave you uh uh little blue containers that you put all your your uh your bottles and cans and like the plastic milk jugs   yeah   you put those in there and they recycle those  and then you put your newspapers in a separate or either you put them in a a paper bag or or you tie them up with string you put those in a separate bundle and they have a special truck that comes around and they pick them up curbside   um umhum   and then the rest of it is just you know goes to the landfill i guess or whatever they whatever they incinerate it maybe   yeah we  uh were coming to that here you know in the metroplex is getting big enough that um itll happen i i grew up in a uh kind of a a rural area of of west Texas and New Mexico where that just wasnt a problem matter of fact till recently we burned trash you know we had the big barrels out in in the alley   oh yeah yeah   and when its filled up you just put a match to it and burned it well course thats thats almost unheard of anymore   and thats  right thats what we used to do too years ago we used to do the same thing   yeah yeah yeah we used to burn leaves and burn grass you know and all that as far as what to uh to do to encourage recycling i guess a lot of states i have noticed on uh on Coke bottles and and whatnot we went ive got some relatives in Iowa and uh theres a big thing up there what is it nickel for every bottle or some such thing and you know people   yep yeah we do the same yeah   people actively go out and and uh seek them you know i guess thats one way of doing it you know is to make it worthwhile   yeah all the states around us Connecticut uh Massachusetts New Hampshire i think Vermont and Maine do it Rhode Islands the only state that doesnt put a nickel deposit on the bottles   um   but every other state does so you dont you dont see any trash along the sides of the roads people that throw bottles away theres other people that come along with plastic bags and they pick them up and and i guess they can make of a you know its like working a parttime job   umhum yeah   uh its all free just takes time and if youre retired and have nothing to do um   well course theres uh people will go after aluminum cans and stuff down here because its just uh theres not a per can value on them but there is a   oh just on the metal content   just in the metal recycling itself ive   yeah   i im not sure what its what a can is worth now its couple cents you know youve got to get quite a few of them to really make it worthwhile but   yeah to make it worth it yeah   it turns out that uh on a  a Sunday morning after a Dallas Saturday night theres enough aluminum cans and stuff along the road to make it worthwhile yeah     yeah uh my wife and i both graduated from the University of Rhode Island their uh master gardener program   umhum umhum   i guess every state has has uh uh  a land grant college uh would used to be Brown University now its uh University of Rhode Island   umhum   and what we learned down there is that uh fifty percent when you when you mow your lawn fifty percent of all the nutrients are in that top section of the grass and most people kind of rake it up or they catch it in the grass catcher and they throw it away   umhum   if you if you mow properly and just let it lay in there you refertilize your own soil besides building up a base   yeah   so thats what  weve been doing that for the last couple of years and you dont have to worry about uh fertilizing which causes a lot of thatch and all that kind of stuff so theres more and more people too are aware of that up here   yeah   and theyre not going out for chemicals theyre not going out for a lot of fertilizers and stuff so theyre letting it you know uh   our soil situation down here in this particular area were in a real hard black gooey gummy awful black clay situation   oh so   and uh   summertimes it cracks when it heats when it gets   oh yeah you could lose a small dog in the cracks  sometimes   oh yeah   uh so i   i was watching uh  i was watching the news this morning uh national news and they were talking about uh i guess they got a a recycling dump for tires that caught on fire   umhum   but they were saying that uh California  they recycle their their all the tires and make like a a some kind of a rubberized compound and they incorporate that with uh with uh tar and they use it on their roads and they say the roads last a lot longer   umhum yeah there was a thing in the local news here yesterday theres a little town down south of Fort Worth called Mansfield and theres some tire recycling outfit wants a permit down there they say out of every tire you can get a gallon what amounts to a ga llon of diesel fuel and like you say several pounds of this uh carbon black and uh material for for making roads and anymore theres a couple pounds of stainless steel in most of the uh the tires yeah because the steel belted tires and uh   oh for the steel belted thats right i didnt think about yeah   its a totally gas fired operation they say theres no exhaust whatsoever you know most people think of tire yeah tho se burning tire uh see there was what was it Massachusetts i remember here a couple of years ago reading about one that had been on fire for  long period of time you know it just smolders and the black smoke pours out of it   yeah yeah there could be the one up here some place im not really sure um   yeah over in Fort Worth they had one catch fire here a couple of years ago and they had an awful time putting it out but our big problem down here course is uh tires laying around down on the ground and stuff uh collect water and then of course that becomes mosquito breeding area and uh   yeah oh thats right too yeah i didnt think of yeah   that can be a real   yeah Connecticut was uh is in the process of building  a a plant to burn tires to generate electricity   um yeah   so i guess thats kind of of a a recycling process   yeah   the uh  all the all the communities in Rhode Island eventually are going to go on this like the recycling that we have now it depends on on each individual municipality uh we went on it quite early because of the town fathers said yeah you know we think its a good idea but the state i think by nineteen ninety three every every town in the state has to go on this recycling program so its like a forced   umhum yeah   um which is good i think   yeah what happens to us anyways as you can imagine in Texas youve got urban areas that are probably as compact or as you know densely populated as just about any place in the country but then   yeah well you guys got   then you run into uh areas you know theyve weve got a statistic down here that they like to use you know you can take the population of the world and pack it in the state of Texas about the density of Houston and then youd have the rest of the world to grow crops in because there wouldnt be any people in it   yeah Houstons probably as big as this whole state of Rhode Island   uh yeah uh the panhandle the the theres well theres several counties in west Texas         and New Mexico too for that matter that are bigger than Rhode Island but uh   yeah   we had a our  our government rep im in DSEG here
