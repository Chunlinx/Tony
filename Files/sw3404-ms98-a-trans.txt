Plano Texas   oh okay thats nice and easy um lets see would you like to to start or would you okay   yes sure thatd be just fine we might as well go ahead   okay um did you want me to start oh im sorry oh i have to start okay well um my oh i did i did push one shall i push it again you think no okay  um my um   yeah you have to you have to push the button uhhuh push one did you yet push the button oh okay okay no no thats thats it   i love to cross stitch and my husband and my son who is now eleven watch so much sports on TV that lately i have been   uhhuh   just in a cross stitch frenzy because i cannot stand being in the same room with the TV on with all the sports so so much that i have to sit i can sit there as long as im cross stitching and   uhhuh   while im doing that so that thats one of my my favorite hobbies that i that i like to what what about you   well i do cross stitch also   okay   in fact i was just sitting here getting ready to start some things so um ive done it for a number of years and uh so that is one of my favorite things to do also i find it very relaxing and and so like if i um   oh i do too i   you know if i havent done it for a while i like to have a i just like to have a project going um because i think it its its just a real good thing to have   yes it is i i enjoy it too and i have found a wonderful framer on Fifteenth Street down in Old Plano um about two doors down from uh Nooks and Crannies   uhhuh   um who who does hes really an artist and he does a wonderful wonderful job with i just give him my things and he triple mats everything and he has really nice frames   uhhuh   and i think when you its very satisfying after you do something like that to have it framed and hang it up um it its always thats kind of the fun part   now do you think hes reasonable in terms of prices   very reasonable i have brought something to Michaels and i was very disappointed in it and it was just a small little picture for my daughters room in fact there were two little cross stitches i did for her room and um   uhhuh   apparently two people framed them differently they two people took instead of one person doing doing the framing two people did it because the mats were just different sizes and to put them next to each other it just didnt look right and um   right uh umhum uhhuh   he is so reasonable that um and he has all these unusual frames that he uses his name is um i guess i can just tell you his name its Matt Inc   sure   and its um i think the address is ten eleven and a half on Fifteenth because its a skinny little door next to i think Bows and   so is it is it so     its upstairs and this little skinny door its right on Fifteenth Street right down right down by the railroad tracks his name is Dan   well im glad to know that okay so its closer to the railroad tracks then from Nooks and Crannies okay   yes closer to the right down down from Nooks and Crannies and its Matte M A T T E Inc I N C period   okay okay   and um he does such a beautiful job ill take something in i do simple cross stitches mostly samplers and a few that are a little bit more complicated but i dont really um with three kids running around its its hard for me to get something too intricate   uhhuh   so i like something thats kind of quick and and i love i like doing the samplers i have a whole wall of them and hell just take this sampler which is just you know mediocre not so great and when he puts the colors he picks out little bits of   uhhuh   little bits of um colors that hell pick from your from your work and and matte it with that little color and it just it just makes this wonderful piece of art um   um uhhuh   so um im real real happy with them and they have some really nice books down there have you seen the books in the small shops in um   oh yes uhhuh uhhuh   on Fifteenth Street you know im fairly fairly new to the area so im always glad to find a nice little shop that has different books but uh   i basically i basically  buy most of my things there in Nooks and Crannies at that at that store um there used to be a wonderful store on Fifteenth but it closed and she had fabulous things but   do you uhhuh   oh   its been closed a couple of years so really in my now i didnt i in fact i was just there yesterday but i didnt go across the street i saw that theres a place across the street i didnt go in to that place but i generally buy most of my things in Nooks and Crannies uhhuh   uhhuh do you um now i really usually dont get the real expensive linens to work on which uh maybe thats what you do its probably really really beautiful to do that but i i just get the regular piece of cloth you know and do it on that but um   yeah yeah well it depends on what im doing i tend to um see i make up most of my own things and and so um   oh okay   in fact i make up almost everything i do now i used to do uh you know kits and all or id use books but i i tend not to do that much anymore um   uhhuh uhhuh   so it depends on what im doing as to what i use i recently did one on linen and thats the first time   uhhuh
