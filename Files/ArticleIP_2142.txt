                                 House Calls            You never know you belong toa demographic until you start to spend money Last year I finally had enough tobuy a new car and bought a Jetta which seemed terribly original Then I drovearound Seattle and saw streets filled with ish former rebel girls in their black Jettas            When myhusband Bruce and I decided to buy a house we found that we were part ofanother socioeconomic group Well we fit the socio part but were sadly lackingin the economic Microsoft Adobe Starwave and other Seattlearea companiesemploy a bunch of mids people just like usonly richand theyve bid upthe realestate market We all want to live in the same unpretentiousneighborhoods and we all love Craftsman bungalows Ten years ago perfects cottages lay scattered unappreciated throughout Seattle like so manywindfallen apples Not anymore The average price of a home here has increased a month over the last decade From the first quarter of  to thefirst quarter of  the average sale price of houses and condominiums in thecounty rose from  to             My husband and I both writers and editors at SeattleWeekly  could probably get better paying jobs at Microsoft or Starwave Butwe havent for highminded reasonsor so we told ourselves We wont work fora big corporationnever mind that the Weekly was recently sold to a petfood companyand believe that print is intrinsically superior to online Thetruth is we dont want to waste time commuting across Lake Washington to theEastside home to Microsoft and Starwave As we house shopped we realized wewere being punished for our sanctimonious attitudes and for enjoying our easybus ride to work            To competeagainst the young millionaires we enrolled in a housebuying class wherealmost everyone looked like us to  years old white groovy enough Irecognized one woman from dance class We were dressed identically in stripedTshirts leather jackets and floppily tiedup hair She glared at me as iffrom a mirror already seeing me as her rival for a charmfilled fixer withpeekaboo views The class leader a loan officer named Vince spent threesessions explaining how none of us would ever ever own a home Not one wewanted And certainly not one in a neighborhood where wed feel safe A viewForget it Three bedrooms Out of the question Crack houses for all of youVince it turned out lived in Tacoma and commuted the hour to Seattle everyday There were deals he rhapsodized in Tacoma Bruce dutifully took notes onadjustable rate mortgages vs traditional mortgages while I daydreamed aboutour new life working at the Tacoma News Tribune  Finally a realestateagent dropped in to reiterate the impossibility of anyone in the room everbecoming a homeowner and we had graduated            Through a coworkers recommendation weacquired a hippie realtor named Lynn who could read the energy of a houseOh I know if theres been abuse in a house But she dropped her woowooways when it came time to bargain Lynn found us rather wonderful because wewere so terrified of the market that we bid on every house that was not fallingdown A house with a roof we would gasp feeling terribly lucky to have foundone We signed the papers on a very cute  house just big enough for our bedand dishes Then David the loquacious inspector told us in his nonjudgmentalway that the house was fine as long as we didnt mind a foundation you couldput your foot through We bailed on the deal            Openhouses were crowded with Microsofties usually younger than we cashiers checks dangling out of their back pockets We bid like addictedgamblers placing opening bids  over the asking price with a clause toincrease our price another  if necessary Our friend Kathy refused tobid up and shed been shopping for over a year Her lowest point came when sheconsidered buying a house that you entered through the bathroom Every night wereturned depressed to our rental house on Sycamore Street in the Phinney Ridgeneighborhood I had lived there four years and loved the funny hillside streetwith its old houses populated by fanatical gardeners and Harley enthusiastsThe neighborhood was Microtargeted so there was no hope of buying thereMeanwhile a family of squirrels had moved into our crawlspace and the housereeked of vermin poo furthering our desperation to find a home            In the s columnist Alice Kahn wrote If youre awomanand these days who isnt Today shed have to write If youre aTibetan Buddhistand these days who isnt Our agent miraculously found ahouse for us on Sycamore The owner was Cyrus a scholar of Tibetan BuddhismWe loved his house To encourage him to vote a straight BruceandClaireticket I turned on all my charm Im lucky I didnt sprain something I alsotried to appear serenehoping to convey a Buddhist quality Cyrus just lookedbefuddled behind his National Healthstyle wireframe glasses The scent ofincense clung to him            Before Iflew to Austin Texas to cover a film festival at Lynns request we puttogether a little promo package to present at the biddingshe makes all herclients do this The goal was to convey how good wed be at inhabiting Cyrushouse We included a wedding photo that makes us look carefree and golden andrelaxed if you squint The picture captures Bruce in a rare moment when hiseyebrows arent beetled together a photographic achievement commensurate withgetting a snapshot of Nessie I look somehow blonder than in real life We alsoincluded Bruces recent book about Mount Rainier a copy of the Weeklywith my byline on the cover a sniveling love letter to Cyrus in which wehighlighted my travels in Southeast Asia the Buddhism thing and a mentionthat my brother played guitar in the Presidents of the United States ofAmerica Why not whore the whole family Bruce wrote the letter so I couldcast it back in his face later if we didnt get the house Lynn cooed over ourpackage It seemed she had never before seen a letter to a seller thatcontained complete sentences            On the plane to Austin I sat next to aconservativelooking ish woman who turned out to be a Buddhist proselytizerClosing her copy of The Mists of Avalon  she explained that my only hopeof getting the house was chanting She phonetically wrote down the familiarchant NAM YOHO REN GAY KYO and said that by chanting it every day Id manifestmy wishes in the fourth dimension Chanting she said had given Tina Turnerthe strength to divorce Ike            That night in the GovAustin Room these days BandB rooms are named not numbered I opened mybook to read and out fluttered the chant What the hell If anyone wouldrespond to Buddhist chanting Cyrus would Hed probably pick it up in hisfillings I began to chant The morning after my third night of chanting thephone rang under its chintz cozy It was Bruce Cyrus loved us He felt a bondwith us as fellow writers Thank God we werent editing encyclopedias atMicrosoft Ignoring the software millionaires and the other suckup artistshe had agreed to sell us his houseat  over the list price
