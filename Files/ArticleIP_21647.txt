point about gratuitous meritocracy did not seem up to his usual levelof argument Of course we evaluate unscientifically the meritthe relativemeritof novels paintings Dylan songs New Yorker editors etc Couldthere be art without such evaluations This is a philosophical not aneconomic questionand a serious one Top  lists and Oscars are simply arather formal inevitably somewhat pedestrian method of evaluation Our listcertainly has a target or two on it for everyone including us list makersStill I thought the whole thing was worth doing because journalism is rarelycompared across decades because such comparisons make for enlighteningdiscussions like the one you all too briefly embarked upon because ourmemory for good journalism tends to be awfully short because most of the workon our list

asserted that Liz Phair istrying to maintain an indie sensibility while flirting with mainstreamcommercial music This seems to be a timehonored argument leveled at womenfrom all walks of life It seems that if a woman shows any duality in heropinions andor her career endeavors she is either confused about what shewants and therefore weak or she shouldnt be venturing out into the big badworld of rock n roll Ooh too scary            I find the whole issue ofWomen in Rock a bit offputting as well There shouldnt be a delineationbetween where one creative process ends and another begins It is a universallanguage or should be in an ideal world I am constantly amazed at the numberof people yeah theyve been men who have told me that my musical careerwould be bolstered if I would just be willing

gain weight use upfood and get less sleep The momentary pleasure isnt remotely worth thedrawbacks            So why do it Because ofan irrational urge to eat doubtless a holdover from some ancient

from the  item in Chatterbox Juanita Broaddricks story arrivedin the press after Bill Clinton had established a pattern of behavior towardwomen and of soontobeinoperative denials But prior to the Waltersaccusation in the Kitty Kelley book no one had ever accused Ronald Reagan ofanything remotely approaching the sort of behavior alleged There was nopattern to match the behavior and therefore the press did not pursue it ordemand a forceful denial To add further injury to the premise that theBroaddrick and Walters accusations are remarkably alike the Broaddrickstory was exhaustively researched by NBC News Washington bureau and itsreporter Lisa Myers whose reputation for honest nonscandal reporting isunquestioned The Walters accusation was reported by Kitty Kelley whosereputation
