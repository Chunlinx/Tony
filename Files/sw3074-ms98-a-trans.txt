                yes um  i i think that Plano has really done a fantastic job i mean at least their plans have are good um how however i was maybe you saw in the paper this morning that um theyve had some problems with the recycling on plastic uhhuh i thought that was most interesting that       with the plastic well i just i thought it was sad that they it  started out as a good program   yeah   but then people started dumping trash and the wrong objects in there and i and that concerned me that people were using it as a way to get rid of things they just didnt want to set at the curb or take to the dump and and uh   yes yeah thats right yeah i guess thats going to happen   i its too bad that people have to ruin a good part thing   yeah a really good effort thats right yeah   but uh   well i was thinking about the other day um when i when Dick and i were oh many many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in Missouri um i went oh i was probably this was probably see it  been like nineteen sixty seven or sixty eight um we i went to a meeting and uh one of the the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling and um she was from Saint Louis and she had this fantastic um family effort in in recycling   hum   and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics and her aluminum and i thought wow i mean how one person is doing that you know but my my thought was   oh   its a shame i mean its wonderful that shes doing it and it but wouldnt it be much much nicer if we all did it because her effort would have really um really uh been a good example for all of us and yet you know and we were just sort of talking about it at the time and here we are you know now were doing it on a city wide basis in in communities so its wonderful that weve come that far i think but   doing it what did she do with if if she was she like a group that was doing it or was she doing it on her own and what did she do with the   um i think she was i was trying to remember it seems to me that she was doing it on her own and living in Saint Louis there were places where she could actually take her uh things herself   uhhuh uhhuh   uh and so it wasnt you know something that was being picked up or um and i think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would but i remember her saying yes i have a trash can for this and a trash can for that and a trash can for the other thing and  i thought wow thats that is wonderful that somebody is doing that does that yeah   you you have to really want to do it though this is even even what you recycle because we we do the the plastics and the and the aluminum and the glass and the paper   uhhuh right yes   and um and of course then you know you try to buy right too but um   sure you do uhhuh   a lot of our neighbors say well what you have to rinse out this and you have to make sure its that and you have to its uh we we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans   yeah uhhuh isnt that amazing   and i thought what are you complaining about   well you know   when youre only going to get picked up once a month you know or once a week and   yes people i dont know they find fault in everything rather than say this is a good effort yeah i dont know its its i understand i know what youre saying kind of people like that and   rather than work with it yeah well its for everybodys benefit i mean its its not so maybe we dont realize it in our lifetime but we you have to think grandchildren and great grandchildren and   well sure it is yep yeah its on down the line   what kind of quality of life are you leaving them and and the and i have a real concern about that uh   right yes yeah i agree when   weve never had much trash because while while i was raised in a big family and and Genes family wasnt big but they werent rich   uhhuh yeah   and they had to to recycle and and you know the food well they didnt they just used things they didnt throw things away before they were used up and   sure yeah right yeah well i know um i guess i got a good example from my mother because she was always very very conscientious about recycling things and she is to this day and you know i mean shell even um if she   uhhuh   for instance she she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for you know when she made cookies it would go on that or if she needed to wrap something for needed uh sandwich paper or something shed use that     yeah right   she just she recycles everything and i have done the same thing i recycle like zip lock bags and things like that my kids get the biggest kick out of that although   right   they do the same thing  i mean they i think they give me a hard time but i think they know that thats its the right way   right theyve picked up the habit well they do and when they actually get out away from the home and have to do their own buying of things   uhhuh yes and they appreciate how much it costs to do that   then and then they say well hey you know mom used to do this and dad used to do that and pretty soon theyre theyre figuring out thats not such a bad way to go but   yeah thats right thats true yeah well i dont know you know i i wonder how how you instill in people the necessity for doing just a little bit extra to to make this whole thing work i mean the extra like washing out bottles and jars or the extra of actually uh making sure that uh you take stuff over to you know some people are complaining now are complaining because the stuff isnt picked up at the curbside you know and i think golly Moses you just       do your part you know people are not you you you cant be waited on all your life and expect things to always have work out out   right well see this this is what concerns me you over in Europe they dont have the kind of waste we do here   no thats right   you youve got to be in a country even in in Mexico you dont see things thrown away like we do here   uhhuh right yeah yeah   i mean what we throw away is is a ransom a kings ransom to most people and i and even to people in our country who scavenge for food and   yes uhhuh yeah yeah yeah   and and i i think you have to get into a period of need before  you cant tell a person that lives in a hundred two hundred three hundred thousand dollar house   uhhuh   that have all that they need and all that they could want that theyve got to be careful this is uh i this is why i thought Jimmy Carter was never very popular very positive  you know   uhhuh uhhuh no uh   people didnt like him   uhhuh   because he tried to say turn off the lights  conserve this do that and and uh the people i nob ody wanted to hear it   yeah yeah right do those little things yeah that make a lot of difference uhhuh yeah yeah its i you know and i think youre right though i think that it has to really hit home before the message sometimes or you have to grow up with it being important important in your life um oh oh um before the message really takes hold sometimes and   its its uh uhhuh uhhuh   um i dont know its uh  its just really interesting to me how now more aware of things i am than i even myself than i used to be a few years ago i mean like i id go to the um to the UTD um cafeteria for lunch sometimes   right uhhuh   and they use styrofoam plates when they wouldnt need to use styrofoam plates   um right   you know and i think to myself thats thats crazy i wonder if you know maybe i need to bring that to someones attention you know and and   uhhuh uhhuh   uh im seeing more and more of that and and i think its uh just McDonalds effort to reduce the number of of styrofoam uh boxes that they use for hamburgers and stuff i think is a good good example you know that even industry is willing to do it   right huh i i think the big question too were looking at is would you be willing to pay more for a product so it can be recycled   yeah well i think that may thats kind of what its coming to im sure   it um thats thats right and and uh   yeah   do we have to wait until all the landfills are full   oh yeah   and there is nowhere else to put our garbage or and i dont with the mind set   thats right yeah   of the American public i think what they will do is start paying Mexico to take our trash   uhhuh wow that doesnt wouldnt surprise me uhhuh   that isnt that isnt harmful or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean   yeah yeah uh   thats the way we solve problems and its sad   i know it and unfortunately
