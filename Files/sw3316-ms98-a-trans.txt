        feel about this     well ive ive seen all kinds of carnage and im very much in favor of laws to restrict the access to guns   i am too   um i you know i cannot understand the the argument on the other side   yeah i i hear the argument of um you dont have anything to protect yourself with and and all this that i just i dont know i dont know theres a guy at work you know thats trying to get a gun for his wife because she works in a divorce type position and shes scared that somebody might turn on her sometime and   umhum   im like why do people need guns in their desk at work i just dont understand that   i dont understand either now there probably there probably are cases of  certain occupations certain actually certain individuals in certain occupations who would   but right   umhum   for whom that may be legitimate uh   right   but there whole countries where guns are banned uh i think in the United Kingdom and then in Japan   umhum   where the homicide rates are far far lower than the United States i dont see how it possibly   umhum   makes sense for us to have all these guns lying about   oh i dont either and you can go to a store and pick out which one you want and just you know its its weird to have something like that you know ive never been a hunter or been around anything like that that um there have been guns in the house or anything like that and to see those kids having you know like you see on the news these kids like are you in Dallas or   umhum no im in Washington   in Washington okay well we just had an accident accident here that um a fifteen year old got into a fight uh you know like you always do in school high school you know you always had little fights with kids   yeah umhum yeah   well he had a fight with a kid and his older brother whos eighteen came to the school and shot the kid   yes   and killed him and im like what in the world are these kids and then they confiscated twenty three guns from that high school out of lockers and its like i just cant understand why these kids have guns   thats amazing thats amazing yeah   its just awful   yeah yeah well it happens a lot around here too um in fact maybe even worse in terms of frequency   to see something like that does it uhhuh   uh drive by shootings in high schools are you know   yeah we had quite a few drive by shootings recently with buses of um you know that public transportation buses and like i think two people were killed during that when they were having just kids were driving by and shooting out the windows   yes yeah yeah   and uh and then we had that killing you know in Killeen i dont know if you heard about that   yes i uh everybody heard about that   yeah i think so and that happened and that was something else and   yeah   so   so im im i think on the scale at the one end you know   yeah   uh   id id be close to the eight nine and ten area   wait wait i thought i i eight nine ten was no restrictions   oh i thought ten was the best oh im sorry   whatever whatever were down at the same end whatever end that is   heavy duty restrictions  thats i feel in favor for because you just cant be handing these things out to anybody   yeah   and and youre getting them sold to people and then theyre getting into the wrong hands   yeah would you somehow get them away from those who already have them   whats that   would you somehow disarm those who are already armed   um yes   how would you do that   um  do you you know do they dont they have records of the people who own the um guns that were bought isnt there   in many cases not uh because many cases theyre   yeah i know it   theyre stolen um   right underground type   i i have no idea what the statistics are on that but um   underground type uh selling of guns   yeah   yeah i dont know how you know its gonna its gonna have to happen sometime but it right now there hasnt been a way   yeah yeah i dont i dont know this for a absolute fact but i have the suspicion that the gun industry that manufactures   umhum   these things and also those who dealers who sell them are a major force behind the NRA and all these campaigns that that stir people up and try to get them to uh   umhum to uh not ban them   yeah to to to right to oppose them   right   it  because they have an economic reason over and above whatever their their private preferences are   oh sure umhum yeah it its a tough thing   until the thing has to be won on an economic ground too   right   so there has to be some way to compensate those who lose and um   so that they dont keep you know saying dont ban so um   yeah right   yeah its its tough i dont know what theyre gonna do and you know i theres got to be a way to get them out of the hands of and plus for them to when they do have them to you know they keep them in these areas where their kids can get to them and and hurt so you know and theyre young enough they dont even know what theyre playing with theyre playing with something they saw on TV   if umhum   and uh you know its its not safe at all for um the kids in the home even because they dont keep them under lock and key anyway they keep them in their top drawer or   right   and then they say well if we unload them then how are we gonna have time to load them
