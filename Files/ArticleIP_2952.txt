                                 Living With BRBob Woodward            It doesnt get much betterthan this unfortunately                           By JonathanAlter                                        words postedTuesday July  to be composted Tuesday July                         This is the ninth book byBob Woodward and whenever I read a new one I always have the same tworeactions The first reaction is that it is not really a book It doesnt havea theme or an argument or even a coherent story line Books are supposed tohave spines Theyre supposed to have context Woodward doesnt know fromcontext though in recent books he has made feeble efforts to stipulate someHis narrative is more like a series of scenes from a pulpy novel only theyarent fictionat least most of the time            Which leads to a secondreaction The reporting if one defines reporting in its smallestbore senseis sometimes breathtaking Every time I begin to feel a bit guilty about mypart in the Woodward hype machine  Newsweek almost always excerpts hisbooks often on the cover I reflect on my paltry powers to find out whathappened at an unimportant Oval Office meeting much less a solarium seanceThe theory that Judge Sirica not Woodward and Bernstein brought down RichardNixon isnt right Woodward is sui generis when it comes to getting people totell him stuff that is only supposed to come out under truth serum            This time I have a thirdreaction For years Ive believed in the Perfectibility of Bob Given hisCalvinist work habits I held out hope that his devotion to selfimprovementwould eventually take him to a new level make that a first level of realpolitical analysis In the same way that he knows to unearth the outtakes ofthe Clinton film bio The Man From Hope to mine it for details aboutthe Clintons relationship I thought surely he would start to read Americanhistory seriously so as to be able to mine it for historical perspective Ifhe had he would have learned for instance that Jean Houston Hillarysfriend who gave Woodward his holyshit headlines was in a rich tradition ofspiritualists dating back through at least six first ladies to Mary ToddLincoln Certainly her efforts to get Abe to talk with Benjamin Franklin andGeorge Washington would have been considered anecdoterich But now Ivegiven up on searching for sweep and subtext and Ive decided to accept Woodwardon his own mechanical terms By that standard he does fine About half thetime Woodward is a mindless Sir Edmund Hillary He climbs for the detailbecause it is there gettable by him even if it tells us nothing But theother  percent of the scooplets are fresh or at least flavorful If theydont always reveal the character of the subject of the anecdotes they areinvariably telling about the character of the source and about the eternalquestion of why people say things they shouldnt Click here for one possibleanswer            Woodwards book may not beonline but its on the frontier of publishing No need to worry aboutacidfree pages for this one The book published a mere month after it wascompleted a remarkably short lead time for a hardcover was not written tolast much beyond the length of the ballyhoo book tour By next year no onewill want to read a book about the  campaign that ends in May Its theblockbuster syndrome taken to its natural conclusion            Who talked for TheChoice  The Clintons didnt One imagines their dilemma They knew that nottalking meant that they would take more of a beating But their cooperationwould have given the green light to every Craig Livingstone in theadministration to drop a dime on them Having already been Woodwardized oncefor The Agenda  they passed The only good news for the Clintons is thatWoodward chose not to write about Whitewater at least not yet            Al Gore talked some Amongthe juiciest parts of the book are the accounts partly from him of theacrimonious budget meetings in the White House You have a chickenshitoperation here Mr President Woodward quotes Newt Gingrich as sayingYouve been calling me an extremist he roared at Gore            At least we didnt accuseyou of drowning those little children in South Carolina Gore shot back inreference to Gingrichs comments blaming liberals for the Susan Smith caseLater Clinton and House Majority Leader Richard Armey pointfingersliterallyat each other and the Republicans go nuts over what theyconsider to be an unflattering picture the White House released to Time All in all everyone in the budget talks looks petty and political except forDole            Dole gave  hours offormal interviews and lots more time informally in part because as his presssecretary Nelson Warfield told me last week he likes Woodward personally Doleloved Nixon Nixon hated Woodward Dole trusts Woodward Go figure Anyway itpaid off for him He comes across up close as the same solid guy Richard BenCramer found in his classic What It Takes  the best campaign book ofthe decade The Dole camp loves The Choice  though to my mind the bookmakes him look as indecisive as Clinton and too uncommunicative to be a goodpresident            For instance it turns outthat Elizabeth Dole had to make an office appointment with her husband todiscuss whether he should run or not and that she wasnt informed that Dolewas resigning from the Senate until after he had told author Mark Helprin asupporter he barely knew In her  years with him she had never once heardDole say Heres what were doing He never would come right out and say itWoodward writes Dole had an inability to reach out fully or lay outcompletely what was on his mind He held things so close He didntsystematically vet things with her or even regularly delegate to her            The other candidatescooperated but Woodward and his editor at Simon  Schuster Alice Mayhewwho had originally planned a book about the primaries mostly left the PhilGramm and Lamar Alexander stories on the cuttingroom floor Woodward doesrecount the decisionmaking process of those Republicans who decided not torun In every case family members who in an earlier age would have beenenthusiastic urged them to stay out            Woodwards is the bestlook were likely to get at Colin Powells psyche The retired general talks toalmost no journalist other than Woodward who helped make him a hero in TheCommanders  Besides his wife it turns out the key figure in Powellsdecision not to run was his laconic aidedecamp Bill Smullen He laid out allthe reasons Powell gave later for why running would have been the wrong movepersonally            Powell obviously is Dolesfirst choice for vice president but Woodward uses reporting to make a goodcase that if its not Powell it may well be James Baker or Richard Cheney orformer Illinois congressman Donald Rumsfeld instead of one of theoftmentioned Midwestern governors Such details might not mean anything in thelong run but theyre delicious in a campaign season The conventional wisdomamong the wise guys of the press has been that there are now so many reportersaroundand so many leakersthat campaign scoops are a thing of the past Thenew grail is the conceptual scoopthe fresh frame that some smart analystcan put on events not the events themselves But now comes along Bob Woodwardto prove that a little shoe leather still works He fails to make us understandwhat the  campaign means for the country But he does pull back the curtainmore just when we thought it had disintegrated Who can resist a peek
