                                 Freezer Burns            I demand hazard pay In thecourse of researching and writing this article I suffered crippling bouts ofgas and added  pounds of blubber around my middle I incurred the derision ofmy colleagues by using the microwave in the communal kitchen area to nuke aSalisbury steak that made the entire floor stink like a middleschoolcafeteria The stacks of empty Swanson Hungry Man and Healthy Choice boxes onmy desk still get funny looks I have poisoned myself in so many ways But Iate  of those dinners just for you dear reader so that you can navigate thefrozen dinner aisle in your local supermarket with flair and ease            Microwave ovens havetheir limitations Remember that they work by agitating and thus heating thewater and fat molecules in food which means that whatever you cook is prettymuch steamed This is great for heating up leftovers and coffee not so greatfor baking a cake Saucy foods work bready foods dont But one great thingmicrowaves have done is give a new life to an American classic What could bebetter than a full dinner including dessert that goes from freezer to tablein seven minutes with no dishes to wash            The scores of offerings at your average supermarket dividedown to about four basic categories traditional healthy budget andvegetarian I used the same standards in judging all of them taste nutritionpresentation and ease of preparation Heres a list of best and worst bycategory                           Traditional  Generally high in fat and calories these dinnersare the descendants of the TV dinners of old The main brands are StouffersSwanson and Marie Callenders Marie Callenders is the gold standard hereMarie offers a full plate of food weighing a whole pound and there areseparate sauce packets that you heat and add to the dinner when you serve itThe results are great The Breaded Chicken Parmigiana for example comes outdry and unsoaked by the marinara sauce But they have their drawbacks Firstthe fat content puts them into Big Mac territory generally about  gramsWorse they require a lot of work You puncture the sauce pouch toss thedinner in pull it out peel back parts of the film cover toss the sauce pouchin fire up the oven again take it out again pour on the sauce  It alladds up to a good  minutes of work from freezer to table You might as wellcook            The prize for best traditional dinner goes to SwansonsBoneless White Meat Fried Chicken Dinner With  calories and  grams of fat calories from fat this dinner almost meets the American HeartAssociation nutrition guidelines which recommend no more than  percent ofyour calorie intake be derived from fat It couldnt be simpler to prepare andis surprisingly tasty The chickens not exactly crispy but it is remarkablyunrubbery The most common flaw of microwaved food is a gaginducing springytexture The meat has a grain to it so you know its not compressed and themeals three side dishes are microwavefriendly corn green beans and mashedpotatoes The veggies are flavorful with a bit of crunch to them and themashed potatoes are buttery and smooth Best of all the dessert is a darn goodbrownie crispy on top cakey on the bottom the way theyre supposed to beAnd the compartmented cardboard dish is an elegant homage to the classic TVdinners punched metal tray making for a heady mix of convenience andformalism A clear winner            But Swanson also takeshome the prize for worst traditional dinner The Boneless Pork Rib Shaped Pattyis a shoddy imitation of McDonalds much beloved McRib The ribshaped patty isstudded with visible chunks of fat reflecting the  grams listed on thelabel and it sits in a pool of orange grease The label calls it barbecuesauce The beans too sweet and without a hint of tanginess were alsodisappointing The dessert was billed as apple crumb but it looked likebeige JellO and was sticky and bland The dinner had  milligrams ofsodium percent of your recommended daily intakeand  calories  ofthem from fat All in all a heart attack on a cardboard plate            H ealthy  The meals that bill themselves as healthyvaried widely in nutritional content

Interestingly each brand is awful in its own way TheBanquet HoneyRoasted Turkey Meal offered literally a single slice ofcoldcutstyle turkeyabout oneeighth of an inch thickon a sparse bed ofhopelessly damp and chewy stuffing The gravy formed strings as I lifted thefork to my mouth But at least it came on a nice paper plate            The worst is the BudgetGourmet It is the cuisine equivalent of the landlord banging at your door Youeat the Chicken With Fettuccini Cream Sauce straight out of the rippedopenbox The portion is tiny the chicken is in rubbery cubes so uniform theybarely look like food and the noodles are all clumped together on one sideYou have to pull them apart with a fork            V egetarian  For overall brand consistency Amys isa solid choice and as a bonus most of the

supermarket Green Gurus Vegetable Gaeng Daeng With Jasmine Riceenchanted my palate The rice was light and cooked to perfection and thevegetables were nicely steamed in a complex sauce that blended the subtleflavors of curry coconut milk and basil There was enough hot pepper to beinteresting but not so much that this tenderfoot was scared off Themushrooms Chinese broccoli bamboo shoots and baby corn all retained goodtextures and the tofu chunks seemed like a stroke of genius At its best tofuis supposed to be springy and this dish proved how ideally suited it isto the microwaves wily ways This dinner was better than many Ive had inactual Thai restaurants            The worst vegetariandinner Well theres only one way to describe Hains Vegetarian Pepper SteakHainous The rice was undercooked and the sauce was a viscous grainy gel Andthe whole concept of it seemed misguided What vegetarian wants to eatsomething labeled as steak even if it is molded soy protein The steak waslike the worst hamburger youve ever eaten sticky tasteless and just plainoff            TV dinners carry a terrible stigma They conjure up aflipflopclad matron in a housedress cigarette dangling from her

dinners are frozen they mayretain more nutrients than those youd buy fresh The oxidation ofnutrients is much greater in fresh foods than in foods that are frozen quicklyafter harvest Your fresh
