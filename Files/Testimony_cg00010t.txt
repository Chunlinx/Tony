United States General Accounting OfficeTestimonyGAOBefore the Subcommittee on Government Management Informationand Technology Committee on Government Reform House ofRepresentativesGAOTOCGEvolution of GAOMr Chairman Congressman Turner and Members of theSubcommitteeI am pleased to appear before you today to discuss the work ofthe General Accounting Office GAO We welcome this opportunity tohighlight the important role that GAO plays to support the Congressfor the benefit of the American peopleIn my testimony today I will discuss the many national andinternational concerns that confront our nation and the Congressthe ways in which GAO can support the Congress now and in thefuture and GAOs performance in accomplishing its mission WhileGAO has evolved over the years its current mission isstraightforward GAO exists to support the Congress in meeting itsconstitutional responsibilities and to help improve the performanceand accountability of the federal government for the benefit of theAmerican peopleGAO was created in  as a result of the Budget and AccountingAct a law designed to improve government financial controls andmanagement in the aftermath of World War I Wartime spending hadincreased the national debt escalated costs for many governmentpurchases and created substantial disarray in the financialoperations of the War Department and other agencies The Congressalso recognized a need for better financial information andcontrols over costs As a result the new law required thePresident to prepare an annual budget and it transferred from theDepartment of the Treasury to GAO the governments auditingaccounting and claims functionsDuring the s and s GAO focused on preaudit payment workand whether government spending had been handled legally The bulkof GAOs work centered on the auditing of agency vouchers GAOclerks checked vouchers and settled the accounts of executivebranch disbursing officers Departments and agencies sent theirvouchers to GAO which checked the legality propriety andaccuracy of expendituresGAOs workload increased in the s as federal money pouredinto New Deal recovery and relief efforts to combat the GreatDepression during President Franklin D Roosevelts administrationGAO which started out with about  employees had a workforcethat numbered nearly  by  Although Washington remainedthe center of GAOs activities the agencys auditors first begandoing fieldwork in the mids For one early fieldworkassignment GAO looked at the operation of government agricultureprograms in Kentucky and several southern statesWith the US entry into World War II GAO faced enormouschallenges The agency continued to do the same type of work it haddone before the war but with vastly increased volume Defenseproduction soared after  as the nations factories geared up tomeet the demands of war Government offices expanded churning outmountains of expenditure forms for GAO to examine GAO revieweddefense contracts and audited the accounts of Army and Navydisbursing officers The war effort created a blizzard oftransportation vouchers for GAO to review as the government usedthe nations rails and roads to carry freight and troops GAO hiredadditional audit clerks and freight examiners nearly tripling thesize of the agency to nearly  by  The paperwork was sointense that GAO faced a backlog of  million unaudited vouchersin  and had to spend several years catching up on workOverall GAO handled a staggering backlog of paperwork as a resultof the war in  GAO reconciled  million checks and audited accountable officers accounts  million transportationvouchers  million contracts and  million postal moneyordersGAOs wartime experiences spelled the end of the vouchercheckingera The increase in paperwork showed how difficult it was for asingle agency to keep up with examining every governmentdisbursement The war also highlighted a number of accountabilityissues In the s then Comptroller General Warren repeatedlypointed to the lack of accountability of government corporationsand problems with contract fraud Warren applauded the passage in of the Government Corporation Control Act which authorizedthe auditing of wholly owned government corporations and mixedownership corporations Responding to the requirements of the actWarren created a Corporation Audits Division in  He beganhiring accountants to perform annual audits of governmentcorporationsWith passage of the Budget and Accounting Procedures Act of GAO as a whole shifted to comprehensive auditing ofgovernment agencies Instead of concentrating on individual fiscaltransactions GAO began reviewing financial management and internalcontrols at government agencies Responsibility for checkingvouchers shifted to the various executive agencies as GAO focusedon prescribing accounting principles performing audits on agencysites and checking financial controls and proceduresThe move to comprehensive auditing represented a major turningpoint for GAO At the same time GAO returned to its prewar sizeThe agency reduced the number of voucher clerks in its employ andbegan hiring accountants Indeed the modern GAO began to emerge inthe s and sGAO responded to its new mission by recruiting and training abroader array of staff and working to set standards thatprofessionalized the workforce To keep a watchful eye on spendingat home and abroad GAO formally established a network of fieldoffices throughout the United States in the early s and openeda European office in  The scope of GAOs work expanded againduring the s as President Johnson initiated the Great SocietysWar on Poverty The number of federal grantsinaid rose sharply andthe rapid growth in federally assisted programs placed enormousadministrative control burdens on government at all levelsLet me note at this point that all the Comptrollers General madesubstantial contributions to GAO and I am particularly pleased tobe here with my immediate predecessors Elmer Staats and CharlesBowsher both made enormous contributions to the agency First cameComptroller General Staats who took office in  and was adriving force behind GAOs emphasis on program evaluation andmaking the agencys work more useful to the CongressThe growth in congressionally based work combined with theexpansion of government programs was responsible for a significantchange in the makeup of GAOs employees GAOs staff mostlyaccountants began to change to fit these new assignments In thes GAO started recruiting social scientists computerprofessionals and experts in such fields as health care sciencepublic policy and information management In  most of theagencys auditors and management analysts were reclassified asevaluators to reflect GAOs varied work During Staats tenure GAOrelied on new technological tools as well as employees with diverseacademic degrees In the s and s the agency madeincreasing use of computers in its audit and administrativeoperationsStaats was also a leader in recognizing the importance ofinternational interaction in the accountability field He mademajor contributions to the development of the InternationalOrganization of Supreme Audit Institutions INTOSAI whichincludes  countries and he also created an internationalfellows program at GAO to provide support training and guidanceto a cadre of key individuals from accountability organizationsworldwide Eightynine countries have participated in theInternational Auditor Fellowship Program and  individuals havegraduated from the program since  Indeed  former fellowshave since become theAuditors General in their countries and many more have servedas Deputies or in other highlevel postsComptroller General Bowsher also made major contributions to GAOand to the improvement of financial management and governmentoperations Bowsher continued the emphasis on personnelimprovement strengthening the recruitment of people with diverseprofessional backgrounds and providing them with improved tools andwork incentives He expanded GAOs training curriculum andstrengthened the Training InstituteBowsher also helped to lead the governments growing emphasis onmanagement reform and performance and accountability issues Duringhis tenure Bowsher paid close attention to budget issues warnedabout the dangers of the increasing deficit and worked to improvefederal financial management In part due to GAOs work andleadership the Congress passed a series of laws designed toimprove the management and performance of governmentincludingthe Chief Financial Officers Actwhich created CFOs inall major agenciesthe Government Performance and Results Actwhich createda requirement for measuring and reporting on agenciesperformancethe Paperwork Reduction Act of which streamlinedgovernment paperwork and reporting requirementsthe Government Management Reform Actwhich requires thegovernment to prepare an annual consolidated financial statementaudited by GAOthe Federal Acquisition Streamlining Actwhich is helpingto make government acquisition more efficient and effectiveandtheSingleAudit ActDuring Bowshers tenure GAO first began doing generalmanagement reviews which looked at broad organizational andmanagement issues at government agencies GAO also initiated aseries of highrisk reports now issued every  years to provideinformation on federal activities susceptible to waste fraudabuse and mismanagementWhen I became Comptroller General in November  I committedGAO to helping the Congress address issues that will define thest centuryGAOs AccomplishmentsToday GAO conducts a wide range of financial and performanceaudits and program evaluations and reviews the business and missionof government GAOs work covers everything from the challenges ofan aging population and the demands of the information age toemerging national security threats and the complexities ofglobalization GAO is also committed to management reformtohelping government agencies become organizations that areresultsoriented and accountable to the publicUltimately we may find that GAO needs a new namethe wordsgeneral accounting office do not really capture our more complexrole anymore It might be more appropriate to consider somethingcloser to government accountability office It more clearlyconveys our role and the expectations of our clients in theCongress the press and the public It might also help us in ourrecruiting efforts in the increasingly competitive marketplaceGAOs core values of accountability integrity and reliabilityreflect its dedication to good government and professionalstandards Accountability describes the nature of GAOs work inhelping Congress oversee federal programs and operations to ensureeffective and efficient government for the American people Theagencys work reflects integrity because it is professionalobjective factbased nonpartisan nonideological fair andbalanced GAO strives also for reliability by providing highqualityinformation that is timely accurate useful clear andcandidGAO relies on a workforce of highly trained professionals whohold degrees in many academic disciplines such as accounting lawengineering public and business administration economics and thesocial and physical sciences I am extremely proud of GAOsworkforce of its dedication and excellence and of its service tothe betterment of government and the country One of my principalgoals for GAO is that we not only work to improve government butthat we also work to improve ourselves I look for GAO to become amodel organization in the federal government and I am convincedthat because of our employees we will achieve that goalMr Chairman I am also proud of GAOs accomplishments insupporting the Congress and helping improve the performance andaccountability of government for the benefit of the AmericanpeopleDuring fiscal year  GAO made substantial contributions tohelp the Congress and the executive branch agencies improvegovernment programs and services It provided more than  billionin direct financialPage  GAOTOCGbenefits recommended over  actions that have led toimprovements in government operations and provided  testimoniesrequested by congressional committees While many of GAOscontributions cannot be quantified in dollar terms those that canbe quantified show that GAO returned over  for every appropriated to the agency in fiscal year Figure  Financial BenefitsGAO succeeds in its mission when its findings andrecommendations lead to improvements wherever federal dollars arespent The following examples illustrate some of the financialbenefits that GAO has helped the Congress and the executive branchachieveTo help the government better realize the value of itsassets GAO suggested ways the Congress and the Department ofEnergy DOE could increase the profitability of oil sold from thefederally owned Naval Petroleum Reserve at Elk Hills CaliforniaGAO testified before the Congress that the government would see agreater return from the sale of Elk Hills than from retainingownership GAOs suggestions for changes to the sale process wereadopted by DOE resulting in proceeds of over  billion abovethe original sale priceGAO has helped agencies to achieve greater savings frommore efficient operations The Congress recently enactedlegislation based in part on GAOs recommendations to strengthenMedicares safeguards against fraud and abuse These improvementssaved the Medicare program approximately  billion over fiscalyears  and  Similarly GAO recommendations included inMedicare program legislation will produce a gradual reductionthrough fiscal year  in the overly generous adjustmentfactor designed to compensate teaching hospitals for higherMedicare costs This legislative change is estimated to produce billion in savings for the program in fiscal years  andGAO has made recommendations to streamline the tax systemand help support the Congress in its longterm fiscal decisionsBased on GAOs evaluations for instance the Congress changed thetax laws pertaining to the Earned Income Tax Credit Specificallythe government avoided an estimated  billion in payments forthe year period ending in fiscal year  through changes to thewealth capital gains and passive income tests for the EarnedIncome Tax Credit eligibility criteria Similarly as part of theSmall Business Job Protection Act the Congress phased out taxcredits to corporations for certain income earned in Puerto Ricoand US possessions GAOs work on this issue contributed to anestimated  billion in financial benefits for fiscal years through GAO also helped the Congress and agencies identify andreduce unnecessary spending As part of its ongoing work in housingissues GAO has provided assistance to improve the accuracy of theDepartment of Housing and Urban Developments HUD budget andresource estimates GAO reported that HUDs method for estimatingfunding for its Section  housing assistance resulted in requeststhat exceeded the agencys needs The Congress directed HUD tosubmit revised estimates after which HUDs fiscal year  budgetwas reduced by about  billion in light of the streamlinedprojections As a result the Congress also rescinded  billionfrom HUDs fiscal year  supplemental request GAOsrecommendations helped HUD avoid additional costs of about billion in fiscal year  Based in part on these examples GAOaudits and recommendations helped the Department save an estimated billion in fiscal years  and Similarly as part of its assistance to the Congress inreviewing the fiscal year  Department of Defense DOD budgetrequest for military personnel GAO identified areas where thebudget could be reduced These included excess manpower costs dueto over estimated military personnel levels unnecessary advancepay and funds not needed due to gains from changes in foreigncurrency exchange rates As a result ofPublic Health and SafetyGAOs work the Congress reduced the fiscal year  militarypersonnel budget for active and reserve forces by about million without compromising overall readinessIn addition to the financial benefits resulting from GAOs workthe agencys efforts also contribute to numerous qualitativeimprovements in government operations and services During fiscalyear  GAO contributed to  such benefits achieved by thegovernment a percent increase over fiscal year  Benefitsresulting from GAOs recommendations included better public safetyand consumer protection more efficient and effective governmentoperations and services help in ensuring Year  readiness andimprovements to computer securityFigure  Improved Government Operations Resulting From GAORecommendationsSome examples of GAOs contributions to improved governmentoperations follow GAO has assisted the Congress and the agencies in efforts toimprove public health For example since  GAO has issued aseries of reports on Medicaid highlighting widespread inadequatehealth care quality in some of the nations nursing homes As partof its evaluation GAO made a series of recommendations to theHealth Care Financing Administration HCFA for improvements to itsnursing home survey process and for stronger enforcement ininstances when nursing homes repeatedly violate regulations and donot correct deficiencies As a result HCFA developed aMore Efficient Governmentset of initiatives designed to improve patient care andeliminate deficiencies Based on GAOs work HCFA now requiresstates to investigate serious complaints alleging harm to residentswithin  days has proposed an expansion of its enforcementprograms by subjecting homes with repeated serious deficiencies toimmediate sanctions and has revised the protocols that statesurveyors use to inspect nursing homes to better focus thereviewsGAOs reports have also convinced some states to improve theiroversight of nursing homes In response to GAOs finding thatserious complaints of poor nursing home care frequently are notinvestigated for months Marylands legislature approved fundingfor a  percent increase in its surveyor staff and the stateagency revamped its processes to emphasize a faster review ofserious complaintsGAO has also made significant contributions to improvingcriminal justice For instance GAO has reported on the prevalenceand costs of identity fraud involving the illegal use of anotherpersons identifying information such as name date of birth orSocial Security number to commit financial crimes Illegalactivities range from the unauthorized use of a credit card to acomprehensive takeover of financial accounts Largely in responseto GAOs work the Congress enacted legislation that criminalizedthe theft and misuse of personal identifying information andprovided legal recognition for the victims of fraudTransportation safety is another important area in whichGAO has helped to improve government operations and the publicsquality of life In one instance GAO reported that the FederalRailroad Administration FRA had few regulations involvingpassenger car safety for Amtrak or commuter rail operations As aresult inspectors provided little oversight of passenger carsafety GAO recommended that the agency establish appropriatecriteria for the condition of safety control components onpassenger cars Addressing GAOs recommendation FRA establishedcomprehensive structural safety standards for passenger equipmentand created more stringent safety standards for highspeed passengerrail serviceMany of the governments large entitlement programs aresusceptible to fraud waste and mismanagement One example ofGAOs contribution to improving government performance andpreventing fraud and waste is in the Supplemental Security IncomeSSI programthe nations largest cash assistance program for thepoor GAO reported that the programs financial integrity wasineffective because the program has overpaidPage  GAOTOCGbeneficiaries by more than  billion The magnitude ofoverpayments and the Social Security Administrations SSAinability to recover outstanding SSI debt led to the programsinclusion on GAOs highrisk list Based on GAOs work SSA isexpanding its use of online data to better verify financialinformation about recipients and prevent future overpayments SSAis also seeking statutory authority for additional tools to recovercurrent overpayments GAO has played an important role in helping the Congress andthe agencies improve the governments computer security and makemore effective use of technology in the delivery of federalservices The Congress has been extremely concerned about thegovernments ability to prevent intruders from accessinggovernments extensive computer and information systems As aresult over the past several years GAO has issued more than reports on data and systems security including hundreds ofrecommendations for correcting both individual weaknesses and thesystemic causes of security problems GAOs work has led toimprovements in many agencies including the development ofentitywide security management practices It has also led tocomputer security and other information technologyrelatedlegislationIn addition to its reviews of individual agencies GAO hasdeveloped techniques and practices that can be applied across thegovernment This work has made significant contributions toagencies abilities to develop and implement sound securitypolicies The information security management practices identifiedin GAOs executive guides have been incorporated into policyguidance at many federal agencies Additionally GAOsFederalInformationSystemControlsAuditManualis now used by mostmajor federal audit entities to evaluate computerrelatedcontrolsIn discussing GAOs contributions and accomplishments it isimportant that we engage in a select amount of research anddevelopment work to ensure that GAO can meet the institutionalneeds of the Congress over the long term This investment has mademajor contributions to the performance stability andaccountability of the government and the protection of tax dollarsAs I will discuss later in this testimony GAOs flexibility toengage in this important component of our work has beenincreasingly constrained by other demands on our resourcesAmong the most important work that GAO has done are reviewsrelated to the Year  YK computing challenge GAOs work onYK began through its research and development program but thevital importance of this issue has manifested itself in manycongressional requests for work that the agency received in fiscalyears  and  In early  GAO designated YK as ahighrisk area to highlight the governments exposure Throughout  and  GAO worked closely with the Congress on YKissuesincluding this subcommittee The Senate created the SpecialCommittee on Year  Technology Problem and the House called onthis Subcommittee and the Subcommittee on Technology of theCommittee on Science to lead its YK monitoring With leadershipfrom you Mr Chairman and your colleagues congressionalcommittees examined the implications of YK on various governmentoperations and in key economic sectorsGAO produced a set of four guides to help organizations confrontthe problem GAO also issued over  reports detailing specificfindings and made over  recommendations to agencies and to thePresidents Council on Year  Conversion for improving thegovernments readiness For example GAO recommended that thePresidents Council on Year  Conversion require agencies todevelop contingency plans for all critical core business processesAccordingly the Office of Management and Budget clarified itscontingency plan instructions and along with the Chief InformationOfficers Council adopted GAOs business continuity and contingencyplanning guide for federal use thus reducing the risks ofdisruption to major programs and servicesFinally let me note that GAO is proud of its record inproviding timely service to the Congress As figure  indicatesGAO has consistently improved its ability to promptly meetcongressional requests In  GAO provided the Congress percent of its products on timeComplex Issues and Governance ChallengesFigure  Product TimelinessPercent       FISCAL YEARSMr Chairman as I am sure you appreciate the issuesconfronting the Congress and the American people have grown morecomplex in recent years The pace of change has accelerated forgovernment and for the country as a whole The increasingchallenges facing the country over the long term have had alonglasting impact on the nature of GAO as an organization and onhow it supports the Congress Where in the early years of GAOsexistence changes to its roles and responsibilities and to thedemands placed on it occurred more slowly there is no questionthat the environmental changes affecting its mission in recentyears have been more persistent and have occurred more rapidly Infact the timeline of major events in GAOs existence see figure reveals the increasing development complexity and influence ofdifficult public policy issues related to government activity andour accountability missionFigure  GAO History  to the PresentMajorRenewed

issues facing the Congressthe legislature is availing itself of GAOs services and support onan unprecedented and accelerating basis While  percent of GAOswork was done as a result of congressional requests in  it was percent in  Overall congressional requests for GAO workhave increased from  percent in  at the start of the Staatsera to  percent at the beginning of my term Part of the reasonfor the Congresss increased reliance on GAO in recent years is theresult of our ability to add unique value to the products andservice we provide With the advent of agency inspectors generaland other similar organizations GAO is no longer the only federalentity charged with improving the accountability of governmentNevertheless GAO is the only agency that can consistently providethe Congress and the executive branch with analysis options andrecommendations that are long range broad in coverage andintegrated in the development and presentation of criticalinformation GAOs efforts are multilateral and cognizant of theinternational implications of issues ranging from security to theenvironment And they also reflect the nuances of Americanfederalism ensuring that implications of service delivery anddevolution on state and local governments and on the private andnonprofit sectors are factored into all of its work In the endthere is no question that effective stewardship must consider howincreasingly diverse approaches to public sector responsibilitiesare leading to diffuse accountabilityI am convinced that GAO is now entering another significant erathat will take its place on the timeline of the agencys historickey events GAO has worked hard to make the transition from anaccounting and preaudit environment to become a diversifiedmultidisciplinary accountability and professional servicesorganization As I have discussed my predecessors did a tremendousamount to ensure that GAO had the capacity and capabilities toserve the Congress and prepare for the future during their tenureAnd Iatthe startofthe st century have begun to do the samethingClearly much has already changed as GAO has grappled with thiscritical transition As the following graphs show GAO has over theyears seen considerable changes in its staffing and budgetallocationslevels that unfortunately did not generally reflectits workload and the growing demands placed on it by the CongressReductions in its resource levels combined with increases andshifts in its workload have in recent years prompted GAO to takestrong measures to more efficiently accomplish its mission Forexample GAO has taken significant steps to consolidate its fieldoffice structure GAO has been able to close field offices both inthe United States and overseasmuch of it through attritionandachieve gains in productivity and collaborative work environmentsAt the same time GAOs flexibility has been reduced by extensivechanges to the mix of its productsas mentioned virtually all ofits work is done at the request of the Congress and an increasingamount of that stems from mandatesThe following charts highlights the changes I am discussingFigure  GAO Staff LevelsNumber of FTE staff   Fiscal YearFigure  History of Field Office StructureNumber of Offices      Figure  Work Conducted for the CongressIn a nutshell GAO currently stands at an important crossroadsin its history and in its ability to provide the unique support theCongress and the American people expect from it Many of theactivities GAO has undertaken are designed to ensure that theagency is properly positioned to fully support the Congress as itfaces the futureSince I became Comptroller General one of the most importantactivities in which GAO has been engaged is the development of itsfirst strategic plan for the st century This document is ablueprint for how GAO will support the Congress as it continues toface complex issues and challenges Building on global changes thatare impacting society on a variety of levels GAOs strategic plandevelops a comprehensive and focused structure of longterm goalsand objectives to support the Congress in its legislativeoversight and investigative roles GAO worked closely withlegislative and committee leadership individual members and staffin the development of this strategic plan Thus this plan not onlyincorporates congressional views about what it believes to beimportant and emerging issues it also establishes a framework forseeing fundamental constitutional responsibilities in the contextof current challenges and emerging changes in the coming yearsGAO has developed a set of strategic goals and objectives thatwill help to support the Congress in its decisionmaking and improvethe performance and accountability of the executive branch GAOsplan presents four strategic goals that will help the Congressperform its constitutional responsibilities and ensure GAOsability to continue providing effective quality support to itsclientsThe due diligence that GAO has expended to develop its strategicplan in concert with the Congress has identified a number ofcomplex issues that are not easily solved These issues arereflected in the goals and objectives of the plan and will serve asthe guide for GAOs work priorities in the coming years Many ofthese issues will take years to resolve satisfactorily but byfocusing on these issues now the Congress will be much betterpositioned to meet its responsibilities for governing as it beginsto confront these current and emerging challengesThere is no question that the cold war has ended and we won Inaddition after nearly  years of budget deficits the combinationof hard choices and remarkable economic growth has led to budgetsurpluses As a result we transition into this new century withdifferent security concerns and an improved financial positionrelatively free of the deficit constraints of the recent past Inorder to prepare effectively for the future however we must fullyexplore the major dynamic that will shape the United States and itsplace in the world and adequately prepare the federal government tomeet the challenges that lie ahead This subcommittee is uniquelypositioned to consider these broadbased and crosscutting challengesand what needs to be done to address themThree of GAOs strategic plan goals focus on how GAO can helpsupport the Congress in dealing with many complex issues and thechallenges of government These goals the strategic objectivesand the major thematic issues that influence them are asfollowsProvide Timely Quality GAOs first strategic goal focuses onseveral of the aspirations of the American people defined by theFounders toestablishjusticeinsureService to the Congressdomestictranquilitypromotethegeneralwelfareandsecurethe andthe Federal blessingoflibertytoourselvesandourposterityThecountrys aging Government to Address and increasingly diversepopulation rapid technological change and Current and EmergingAmericans desire

for a smallergenerationBeing and FinancialSecurity of the American of workers to finance competing claimson the nations futurePeople To support the Congress in its decisionmaking in thisarea GAO will focus significant resources on the followingimportant strategic objectivesresearching possible options to meet the health careneeds of an aging and diverse populationexamining ways to ensure a secure retirement for olderAmericansreviewing the social safety net for Americans inneedsupporting efforts to provide for an educated citizenryand a productive workforcehelping the Congress strengthen a system of justice thatis effective in controlling crime illegal drug use and illegalimmigrationproviding analysis and other support concerning theeffectiveness of investments in communities and economicdevelopmentresearching ways to increase responsible stewardship ofnatural resources and the environment andhelping the Congress maintain a safe and efficientnational physical infrastructureOne of the important issues that reflect this goal and itsobjectives is Demographics The profound changes forecast in theage and composition of our population will have enormousconsequences for the retirement and health care entitlementprograms as well as programs supporting the workforceThe population is growing older By  about one fifth of theUS population is projected to be over age  compared with about percent in  Also by  Medicare beneficiaries whoinclude the disabled as well as the elderly are expected toaccount for  percent of the population The result will be thatfewer workers will be paying into Social Security for every personreceiving benefits As shown in figure  in  almost  personswere paying into Social Security for every person receivingbenefits Today the ratio is down to  to  and by  it isprojected to be about  to Figure  Social Security Workers per Beneficiary           Note Projections based on intermediate assumptions of The Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal OldAge andSurvivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust FundsSource Office of the Actuary Social SecurityAdministrationThese trends will have enormous financial repercussions for thesolvency and sustainability of federal entitlement programs TheMedicare Hospital Trust Fund has operated in the red since  andis projected to face insolvency in  Social Securityexpenditures are expected to exceed payroll tax revenues beginningin  with trust funds being depleted by But crafting a solution to financing these entitlement programsinvolves more than the traditional approach of closing the gapbetween projected expenditures and revenues over a fixed timeperiod such as  years Rather any financing solution needs toachieve sustainablesolvency that balances projected expendituresand revenues without requiring us to frequently revisit thefinancing of these programsFigure  Medicares Hospital Insurance Trust Fund FacesInsolvency in Billio ns o f     d olla rs

of the workforce have grownsignificantly This trend along with the increased use of parttimeand other flexible work arrangements has implications for federalpolicies and programs related to education training childcareimmigration and retirement and other areas Although theincreased presence of women and minorities caused substantialgrowth in the US labor force in recent decades this trend seemsto be changing Projections for the future are that the annualgrowth in the labor force will be only about  percent in the shortterm and that this growth rate may even decline over the long termThese trends further exacerbate the current tight labor market forspecialized skills and key sections of the economy suggesting theneed for more policies designed to encourage people to retreatgradually from work rather than plunge into retirementAnother major concern is Quality of life It has improved formany but not for all Americans At the same time prosperity isplacing greater stresses on the quality of lifeThe long period of strong economic performance has beenaccompanied by economic prosperity People are typically livinglonger with average life expectancy rising to age  over the past years while unemployment has fallen to low levels and violentcrimes have dropped by  percent since  The quality of thephysical environment has also improved as levels of major air andwater pollutants have dropped since However many challenges remain For example the disparitiesbetween the net worth of those without a high school education andthose with more education increased between  and  Whileunemployment has reached record or nearrecord lows forAfricanAmericans and Hispanics unemployment rates for these twogroups still stand at nearly twice the rate for whites and morethan  million Americans lack health insurance Given the largefederal role in health care delivery and financing there is a needto weigh the needs of Americans against their wants and the overallaffordability of health care considered by policymakersAt the same time prosperity is placing greater stresses onquality of life Greater economic activity for example increasesair and highway traffic and heightens concerns about congestionsafety and environmental quality The shift to a moretechnologically based economy raises long term concerns abouteducation while population growth and geographic shifts such asurban sprawl place greater strains on transportation and otherinfrastructure Over the coming years these demands for newinvestment will increasingly come into competition with othernational

andreviewing ways to recognize and respond to the impact ofglobal market forces on US economic and securityinterestsSeveral of the important themes influencing this goal and itsobjectives include globalization and national securityGlobalization or the interdependence of enterprises economiesand governments presents new opportunities for US producers andconsumers but also new challenges for the countryWith rapid advances in technology and the ease with whichpeople enterprises and goods can cross borders the economies andactivities of nations have become increasingly interdependent From through  world exports increased from about  percent toabout  percent of world GDP gross domestic productMultinational enterprises are an important part of the trendtowards globalization In   percent

trading system and has benefited greatly However open tradehas increased the complexities of maintaining the US economyInterdependence of theUS and foreign economies is illustrated by foreign investmentin USbusiness which has increased to over  billion in  anamount nearly three times that invested the year beforeAs the US economy becomes increasingly linked with the globaleconomy international trade is growing in importance as a foreignpolicy issue At the same time significant national securityissues also need to be considered The effectiveness of regionaland global trade arrangements in achieving their desired outcomesis being questioned at home and abroad Critics have expressedconcern that the United States has not been sufficiently aggressivein monitoring and enforcing over  international trade agreementsthat cover hundreds of billions of dollars in trade and affectmillions of US jobs and that some decisions by the World TradeOrganization could compromise US sovereigntyRecent financial crises in developing nations highlight theimplications of the interdependence of economies and financialsystems For example the emergence of financial difficulties inThailand in  was followed by financial crises in Indonesia andKorea and eventually Russia and Brazil Fear that these crisescould severely affect US economic and security interests have focused attention on the interdependence of US and globaleconomies and  raised questions about what can be done toprevent or contain the spread of such crises The InternationalMonetary Fund is a key organization that the United Statescooperates with to maintain global economic stability Prompted byfinancial crises and government corruption in some countriesquestions have been raised regarding their effectiveness and rolesin maintaining the health of the global finance and trade systemsand resolving countries financial crisesEconomic and financial interdependence are not the only globaltrends with implications for this country Increased globalizationof information technology has resulted in significant new securityand privacy threats to our nations information network Similarlythe spread of diseases around the world like AIDS and the globalnature of environmental problems affect us and also call for acoordinated international response Thus in the future federalresponses to problems will increasingly have to considerinternational as well as national dimensionsThe nations security concerns reflect new diverse and diffusethreats of national economic and personal dimensions Lessrestricted trade expanding democracy and capitalism and rapidlydeveloping technology have broadened security concerns and changedthe way the United States prepares for conflict In addition tomore conventional military threats the United States isconfronting threats from terrorism the proliferation of weapons ofmass destruction information warfare the international drugtrade and other more diffuse sources which are harder toidentify respond to and contain Figure  shows the countriesthat possess weapons of mass destruction posing national securityconcerns to the United StatesSources DOD and State DepartmentThe bombings in New York City in  and in Oklahoma City in have elevated concerns about the spread of terrorism to theUnited States More than  federal agencies offices and bureausspend over  billion a year to combat terrorismThe structure of US armed forces has been reviewed a number oftimes since the end of the Cold War resulting in substantialreductions The Congress has expressed concern that the forces thatremain may not be sufficient to implement the national militarystrategy and may not be sufficiently prepared to respond to thethreats of the st century In February  the Presidentproposed that DOD begin the first sustained increase in defensespending in  years calling for additional resources totaling billion over the next  years In particular defending theUnited States against an intercontinental ballistic missile attackfrom a rogue nation and protecting US and allied deployed forcesfrom theater missile attacks is receiving considerable

for more economical efficient andeffective government countries around the world are undertakingmajor reform initiatives to improve government performance andaccountability These reform efforts being undertaken in majordemocracies are taking a generally consistent direction requiringgovernment organizations to focus more on results and less onprocessIn the United States American citizens are increasinglydemanding improved government services and better stewardship ofpublic resources In an effort to meet these demands the federalgovernment is adopting the principles of performancebasedmanagement As mentioned earlier legislation enacted in the shas provided a statutory framework that includes the GovernmentPerformance and Results Act of  the Chief Financial OfficersCFO Act of  and related financial management legislation andinformation technology reform legislation including theClingerCohen Act of  and the Paperwork Reduction Act ofThe impetus for government reform came in part as a reaction topoor performance continuing disclosures of waste and chronicbudget deficits However the fact that the federal budget hasturned the corner from deficit to surplus does not reduce theimportance of effective and efficient governmentnor does it reducethe importance of fiscal discipline After a decade of focusing ondeficit reduction we know there are pentup demands for using theprojected budget surpluses The challenge for policymakers will beto meet public expectations of government while maintaining thefinancial discipline necessary to avoid a return to deficitsAgain there is also the obligation for Americans to distinguishbetween needs wants and affordabilityThe effective implementation of the statutory framework toimprove the performance management and accountability of thefederal government although important is not an end in itselfRather the implementation of the framework is the means to anendimproved federal performance through enhanced executive branchand congressional decisionmaking and oversight Performanceimprovements occur only when congressional and executive branchdecisionmakers use information resulting from these reforms to helpinform decisions and improve the performance and accountability ofthe federal governmentThe governments human capital management has emerged as themissing link in the statutory and management framework that theCongress and the executive branch have established to provide for aresultsoriented federal governmentFederal employees should be viewed not as costs to be cut butas assets to be valued Only when the right employees are on boardand provided the training technology structure incentives andaccountability to work effectively is organizational successpossible Modern human capital management principles recognize thatemployees are a critical asset for success and that anorganizations human capital policies and practices must bedesigned implemented and assessed by the standard of how wellthey support the organizations mission and goalsAs with the private sector there have beenand will bemanychanges in the demographics of the federal workforce the educationand skills required of its workers and basic employment structuresand work arrangements used to accomplish jobs The federalworkforce is aging the baby boomers with their valuable skillsand experience are drawing near to retirement new employeesjoining the federal workforce today have different employmentoptions and different career expectations than the generation thatpreceded them In response to an increasingly competitive jobmarket federal agencies will need the tools and flexibility toattract hire retain and reward topflight talent More and morethe work that federal agencies do requires a knowledgebasedworkforce that is sophisticated in new technologies flexible andopen to continuous learning Agencies employment structures andworking arrangements will also be changing and the workplace willneed to accommodate greater flexibility and uncertaintyThe implications of the downsizing of federal workforce over thepast decade are also significant From fiscal year  throughfiscal year  the number of nonpostal civilian federalemployees fell from about  million to about  millionMoreover new permanent hires fell from about  in fiscalyear  to a low of about  in  before beginning a slowrise to about  in fiscal year In cutting back on hiring of new staff in order to reduce thenumber of employees agencies also reduced the influx of new peoplewith the new competencies needed to sustain excellence Also ourreviews have found for example that a lack of adequate strategicand workforce planning during the initial rounds of downsizing bysome agencies affected their ability to achieve organizationalmissions We intend to do more work on the implications ofdownsizing and of the governments human capital approachgenerally Nevertheless our view today is that the widespread lackof attention to strategic human capital management may be creatinga fundamental weakness in federal management possibly even puttingat risk the federal governments ability to efficientlyeconomically and effectively deliver products and service to thetaxpayers in the futureInformation Technology if leveraged properly can be aneffective tool for highquality costeffective government servicesInformation technology effectively integrated into strategic plansand performance management practices can lead to increased customersatisfaction government productivity gains and significant costreductions

nationaldefense revenue collections and social benefits The globalexpansion of information technology has resulted in significant newinformation security and privacy threats to our informationnetworks and technology infrastructureSuch risks are of particular concern at the federal levelRecent audit reports issued by us and by agency inspectors generalshow that most of the largest federal agencies have significantcomputer security weaknesses These weaknesses place criticalfederal operations such as national defense tax collection lawenforcement air traffic control and benefit payments atsignificant risk of disruption as well as fraud and inappropriatedisclosures In February  and again in January  ourreports to the Congress designated information security as agovernmentwide highrisk areaAt the same time the government does not always effectivelyplan procure and implement major technology investments Foryears federal agencies have struggled with delivering promisedsystem capabilities on time and within budget IRS spent more than billion in the late s and early s on systemsmodernization without producing commensurate value Accordinglyour work over the last decade has focused on strengthening federalagency management of IT investment We continue to ask whetheragencies are spending their technology dollars on the right thingsie investments that return business value in excess of costsand whether they are investing in technology the right way ieemploying management and engineering practices that are disciplinedand effective In particular we developed guidance based onbest practices in the public and private sectors We have also madehundreds of recommendations to improve management of largescale ITinvestments in many major departments and

supporting the Congress directly through helping thelegislature respond to emerging issues and government challengesGAO also supports the Congress by maximizing its own value andseeking to be a model agency in the federal government Tosuccessfully carry out its responsibilities to the Congress and theAmerican people GAO first and foremost must be perceived ascredible and must lead by example In conjunction with the agencysmission and core values GAO must among other things beprofessional objective factbased nonpartisan nonideologicalfair and balanced in all of its audit investigation andevaluation work The internal focus of the fourth goal provides aframework for enhancing GAOs effectiveness and helping to improveperformance and accountability throughout the agencyTo ensure its ability to support the Congress in itsdecisionmaking GAO will focus significant resources on thefollowing important strategic objectivesimplementing a model strategic and annual planning andreporting processaligning human capital policies and practices to supportthe agencys missioncultivating and fostering effective congressional andagency relationsdeveloping efficient and responsive business processesandbuilding an integrated and reliable informationtechnology infrastructureAs mentioned throughout this testimony GAO is utilizing itsstrategic plan to help the Congress the executive branch anditself confront the many current and emerging complex issues facingthe American people The plan provides an opportunity toconstructively manage a difficult process of change and uncertaintyregarding critical national and international issues now and inthe futureGAO is also utilizing the strategic plan tomanage our own transition The plan not only represents a road mapof how GAO will support the Congress in handling issues faced bythe country but it also charts the approach we will use to guideour efforts to strengthen that support and to ensure that GAO hasthe capacity to serve the Congress effectively in the stcenturyLikewise to accomplish the objectives for GAOs internalimprovements will take the dedication and persistence of all of ourtalented employeesAs you know Mr Chairman I am personally committed to thesuccessful implementation of GPRA I have seen in my public andprivate sector careers how GPRAs purposes of improved performanceand accountability can be achieved through the disciplinedapplication of the goalsetting planning performance measurementand reporting requirements of the act Thats why GAOs strategicplan and associated annual performance plan are consistent with therequirements and best practices of GPRA We seek through ourstrategic and annual planning process to lead by example bybeing a model for implementation of GPRA We are not required tocomply with GPRA but we believe that its requirements make goodbusiness senseAs another example of our decision to voluntarily comply withcongressionally created management reforms and to lead byexample GAO issued in March its firstever accountability reportThis report discussed how GAOs work benefited the Congress and theAmerican people The AccountabilityReportis different from GAOsprevious years annual reports It reviewed GAOs accomplishmentsin meeting its mission consistent with applicable professionalstandards and our core values of accountability integrity andreliability The report also included our financial statements andan unqualified opinion from the agencys independent auditorRealignment In order to better support the Congress andmaximize the value of our strategic plan in April I announced arealignment of GAO This realignment the first in more than years will be implemented beginning in October  although theplanning and transition activities have already begun As Ivediscussed in my testimony the increasing complexity of issues andthe accelerating change in governmentmajor factors in GAOsstrategic planhelped us realize that this realignment wasnecessary to better position GAO for serving the future needs ofthe Congress Our goal is to better serve our client by making GAOmore responsive more flexible  and more focused on our clientGAO must become more capable of handling multiple responsibilitiesin a rapidly changing environmentall while adhering to our corevalues and applicable professional standards We recognize that thegovernment of tomorrow must be leaner that it must eliminatebureaucracy and multiple management layers that agencies mustrespect future fiscal and budgetary realities and that they mustbe performancedriven and resultsoriented organizations GAOsrealignment is part of our effort to lead the federal government byexamplewe are certain that this realignment will eliminatemanagement layers reduce silos and improve coordinationproductivity and teambuilding throughout the organizationThe realignment will ensure a continued ability to providetimely quality work will build on efforts to provide broadoversight support will enhance client communications and feedbackand will maintain a highlevel of return on investment Therealignment also gives us a great opportunity to comprehensivelyfocus on how to make our processes work better to serve our staffand our clients and how we can broaden and retool our products tomake them as useful as possible to the Congress in the years aheadMoreover the realignment will help us to enhance our longtermcapacity by improving recruitment and retention building asuccession plan focusing on emerging issues and leveragingtechnology opportunities for improvements to clients processesand employeesThe realignment reduces the number of issue areas from  to It eliminates the traditional GAO divisions and strengthensteambased matrix management We are creating a riskbased managementapproach that will reduce the number and sequential nature of ourproduct reviews We will increase empowerment and accountability atthe senior executive level We also will leverage new teams tofocus on external issues important to our many stakeholders and onmethodological issues and strategic studies And we will createemployee pools of generalists to increase our flexibility andenhance developmentAt the same time we have taken a number of other importantsteps to improveGAO to betterserve theCongress Wevecreatedamoreeffective Engagement Acceptance and Review Meeting process tohelp senior management direct and oversee work assignments Wevedeveloped an employee feedback system and facilitated an activeemployee suggestion program that has achieved bottomline benefitsand we have established a Comptroller General Employee AdvisoryCouncil with which I will meet every quarter to discuss currentand emerging issues of mutual interest and concern And as Imentioned earlier we are continuing to consolidate and reduce ourfield offices to streamline our operations reduce silos andimprove productivity Earlier this year I announced that we wouldbe reducing our field offices from  to  effective NovemberHuman Capital As part of the realignment efforts GAO needs toinvest more heavily in its people Targeted investments need to bemade in ourGAOs

andrecognize exceptional performance and improve performance at alllevels We have a goal of implementing a new performance appraisalsystem for our evaluators beginning in fiscal year  but nolater than fiscal year Efforts also are underway to develop a skills and knowledgeinventory system that will be used to identify skill gaps andtraining and succession planning needs both at an institutionaland individual level and to staff assignments more effectively Wewill continue to correct skill gaps and increase staff productivityand effectiveness through training To maximize this investment weare reviewing and updating our training curriculum to address theorganizational behavioral and technical needs of our staffGAOs overall human capital situation also is of growingconcern GAO faces many of the same difficult personnel issues theexecutive branch is now confronting Our current human capitalprofile has succession planning structural and skills imbalanceproblems that we need to address if we are to maintain and buildour capacity to support the Congress and achieve the goals of ourstrategic plan in the st century For example nearly  percentof our evaluator and related staff will be eligible to retire bythe end of fiscal year  In addition about  percent of oursenior executives and  percent of our management evaluators willbecome eligible to retire by that time Other critical positionssuch as attorneys criminal investigators and mission support arealso vulnerablePercent of Current Staff Band ID Band IF Band II Band III SES All StaffStaff LevelNote Current staff onboard at end of fiscal year Another human capital issue is more structural in terms ofstaffing As illustrated in the following graphics we are sparseat the entrylevela result of the year hiring freeze we began inand rather bulky in the middle We have been more fortunatethan many agencies in that our attrition rate is extremely low Webelieve this low rate reflects the quality and dedication of ouremployees as well as the strength of our recent human capitalmanagement improvements Cultural transitions of majororganizations are never easy to accomplish and I would certainlynot claim that it will be easy for GAO Still through acombination of employee communications and outreach efforts mostof our staff recognize that change is not only good for GAO at thistime it is imperative for the futureFigure  GAOs New HiresNumber of New Hires         Fiscal YearsGAOs significant human capital imbalances and risks stem fromdramatic budgetary cuts downsizing hiring freezes and otherrelated actions from

have had aconsiderable impact on GAOs human capital structure Figure shows GAOs human capital profile as of fiscal years  andFigure  GAOs Human Capital ProfileNumber of authorized staff  Mission Percent SESBAND IIIBAND IIBAND I OTHER Mission SupportFY  FY GAO has turned to contracted resources to achieve its missionand missionsupport requirements Contract funding in inflationadjusted dollars has increased from  million in  to million in Clearly GAO needs assistance to meet its looming human capitalchallenges The agency has made considerable progress inconfronting its problems but more needs to be done In order toeffect the realignment strengthen our human capital profile andposition GAO to fulfill its strategic plan and support the futureneeds of the Congress GAO has requested legislation from theCongress togive GAO the flexibility to appoint scientifictechnical or professional staff to seniorlevel positions with thesame pay rights and other attributes as members of the SeniorExecutive Serviceauthorize voluntary early retirement for selectedindividual employees for the purpose of realigning the agencysworkforceauthorize separation payments for realignment purposesandauthorize the Comptroller General to release officers andemployees in RIFs which are carried out for purposes of downsizingrealignment or correcting skills imbalancesThis legislation would be a supplement to administrative actionsthat we have taken and will be taking in the near future and it isbased on a sound business case focused on enabling us to bettersupport Congress in the future The legislation would be used torealign GAO not to downsize it and would only be for GAOthelegislation would have no effect on the executive branch agenciesIt also would provide relief from applying certain reductioninforceRIF provisions that could result in an even more unbalancedworkforce than exists today and a consequent detrimental impact onour ability to serve the Congress RIFs would be used only as alast resort I want to stress that our proposal would maintain thestatutory preference for veterans and that we have no intention ofdeemphasizing our attempts to attain and maintain a highquality anddiverse workforce Also to provide us greater ability to attractand retain technical talent the legislation would provideauthority comparable to that of the executive branch to compensateselected scientific and technical staff at seniorexecutive paylevels We would use such authority if granted sparingly toaddress specific targeted needs such as information technologyspecialists and actuariesClient Focus The Congress continues to turn to GAO forassistance on significant issues facing the nationin fact we facerecord demands for our services As illustrated in the followinggraphic congressional requests and mandates for GAO services haveincreased in recent years From a longterm historical viewpointrequests for GAOs services have never been higher and weanticipate that this historic growth will continue as the Congressgrapples with increasingly complex and contentious issues requiringgreater contextual sophistication GAO perhaps more than any otherorganization is positioned through its broadbased skillsknowledge and expertise to support the Congress in meetingresponsibilities that will only become more difficult as the stcentury evolves Figure  shows congressional requests as apercentage of GAOs work from fiscal year  through fiscal yearPercentage             Fiscal YearMandatesCommitteeMemberDuring fiscal year  we were called upon

theInternational Monetary Fund DODs anthrax vaccination program andMedicare reformGAO has recently strengthened its client outreach program toassist both GAO and the Congress in understanding how best to meetcongressional needs We plan to meet regularly with the Senate andHouse leadership all Committee Chairs and Ranking MinorityMembers and members of our appropriations and oversight committeesto obtain feedback on our performance and to help guide work plansin the context of the strategic plan Our realignment is a criticalcomponent in improving our communications and outreach with theCongress and ensuring that we continue to maintain and foster waysto help the Congress meet its responsibilitiesGAO has expanded its electronic link to Congress and we are nowproviding a list of active assignments We plan to provide otherproducts and information through this link in the future Throughconsultation with key congressional leaders members and staff wealso have developed a set of clearly defined well documented andtransparent protocols intended to be consistently applied insetting priorities allocating resources recognizing existingcommitments and serving the Congress These protocols will helpGAO to better serve the Congress and improve customer satisfactionto close expectation gaps between the Congress and GAO whereverthey exist to ensure equitable treatment of all requestersconsistent with the protocols and to maintain and strengthen GAOsperformance and accountability We began implementing theseprotocols in January of this year and will test them until August We will finalize them by October GAO is also interested in fostering constructive engagement withexecutive branch stakeholders and enhancing the partnership betweenthe Congress and GAO by strengthening oversight in order to improvethe performance and accountability of government For instance itis important to work closely with agencieswhile maintaining ourindependenceand to utilize our skills knowledge and experiencein working cooperatively to improve government operations Forexample we have successfully worked with a variety of agencies onYK and with IRS to face management problems and improve governmentoperations I am convinced there are additional opportunities fordeveloping constructive engagements while maintaining the integrityof our principal mission as an accountability organizationMoreover the pervasive changes confronting the Congress and thenation present an opportunity for the Congress to reconsider theapproach it takes to oversight responsibilities Persistentattention new models of performance and different oversightstructures and processes may be necessary to achieve thisobjectiveGAO is uniquely positioned to help the Congress examine whatgovernment does and how government does businessby attacking knownareas of fraud waste abuse and mismanagement reassessing howgovernment provides services improving the performance andaccountability of government agencies and preparing for thegovernments longterm challenges GAO can provide support to theCongress for holding oversight hearings on major agencies andprograms on an annual basis Based on its insight and knowledge ofgovernment accountability GAO can provide effectively packagedinformation about agencies and programs from a variety of audit andprogram sources to support the oversight work of congressionalcommittees including the information resulting from the managementreforms in the s GAO resources can also be leveraged throughthe strategic plan support of task forces and other congressionaloversight approaches increased communication with committees andthe selective use of detaileesInformation Technology GAO also seeks to lead the government inthe strategic management and security of effective technologyutilization Over the years we have made important strides inandrealized efficiencies byintroducing technology into theorganization Most recently we have successfully managed the YKtransition However we need to maintain and enhance our ability totake greater advantage of modern technology and achieve anintegrated infrastructure that supports our client servicestrategic planning human capital and business process goals andobjectives To this end we aredeveloping a longterm comprehensive plan for anintegrated information technology approachdeveloping and implementing a shortterm costeffectiveapproach to quickly begin to satisfy GAOs informationneedsestablishing performance and cost metrics addressing thequality and value of information technology servicesensuring the availability of required informationtechnology skillsreplacing obsolete hardware and software agencywide tohelp ensure the efficiency and effectiveness in our operations andenhance our productivity andstabilizing and improving the responsiveness of ournetworkIt is clear that additional investments will be necessary in thecoming years to increase our enabling technology and knowledgemanagement efforts to meet the challenges of the future andeffectively support CongressGAO Initiatives and ChallengesMr Chairman for GAO to continue maintaining the strength ofits mission we are committed to find new ways to streamline ouroperations while building on our responsiveness and flexibility Iam convinced that the Strategic Plan we have articulated with thesupport of the Congress will provide a strong framework forimproving government and meeting the nations challenges in theyears aheadFor GAO to achieve its mission and effectively support Congressin the future it will be important for us to have the support ofthe Congress As I have mentioned demand for our work isessentially at an all time high especially with regard to mandatesand requests from Congress This change in the composition of ourwork has left GAO less flexibility to pursue RD workacomponent of our services to Congress that we believe is vital toensuring that we can help Congress recognize important and emergingissues before they reach a crisis stage Clearly that was the casewith our work in the YK area and I have no doubt that there aresimilar issues out there that we must be sure to identify andexamine before they become major problems But this becomes harderand harder for GAO to do as the demands for our workincreaserequests and mandates already represent  percent of ourtotal workloadIt is also extremely important that we maintain and strengthenour capacity to effectively serve the Congress and meet the growingdemand level in the future This will require a more stablebudgetary and personnel environment than has been the casehistorically Figure  clearly reflects a resource environmentthat has changed dramatically in the last decadeFigure  GAO Appropriations and FullTime Equivalent StaffLevelsNumber of FTE staff Appropriations  Dollars inthousands           Fiscal YearTotal FTEs authorized levels for  and   In an era of shrinking government capacity but expandingdemands vigorous congressional oversight and growing requestsrequires a strong GAO It will certainly require a more stable GAOin which budget and personnel levels remain consistent from year toyear and reflect a work plan built from the strategic plan Astable funding level not only supports GAOs strong return oninvestment of  for every  spent it creates the environmentnecessary to recruit retain compensate train and motivate astrong and capable workforce It is increasingly clear that thecontinued decline in the staff levels of the Congress will alsonecessitate that GAO retain sufficient resources to ensureeffective partnering with the Congress as well as an institutionalmemory about government programs and operationsWithout the broadbased assistance and experience of GAO tosupport the Congress the Congress would clearly lose opportunitiesfor obtaining an array of options undertaking informeddecisionmaking and fully pursuing oversightall important elementsof the Congress constitutional responsibilities Without stablefunding and personnel levels it will be extremely difficult forGAO engage in the types of partnering so critical to the futureoversight work needed to strengthen governments performance andaccountability GAO would also have difficulty in taking on some ofthe expanded roles that Congress has asked of the agency in recentyears such as assisting on task forces and commissions without anycommensurate adjustment for resources As Ive discussed in thistestimony without some immediate stability GAO faces many of thesame problems as other federal agencies in being able toeffectively deliver services now and in the future Right nowconsiderable differences still exist with respect to ourappropriations levels in the House and the Senatestable fundingfor GAO next year is still not assuredGAO needs funding to support the realignment so critical to ourgrowing mission GAO has requested funding to improve compensationcomparability with the executive branch strengthen performancereward and recognition programs reengineer our performanceappraisal system and increase our staff productivity throughtraining and development as well as new information technologyresourcesAt the same time flexibility may be just as important asresources The human capital legislation is one example Anotherexample is the mandates issue Its is becoming difficult to doRD work like YK as I mentioned earlier Without GAOsability to pursue research and development issues many otherconsequential issues could go unrecognized and ultimately createfundamental and serious problems for the Congress and the Americanpeople We must have a reasonable amount of flexibility to addressemerging challenges before they reach crisis proportions Thus Iwould urge the Congress to not lose sight of the important balancebetween mandates requests and research and development in the mixof GAOs work supporting the CongressIn addition to the legislative support Ive already discussedGAO will be assessing whether it may need additional authority fromthe Congress to obtain certain types of records for conducting ourwork As the budgets functions and points of service of manygovernment programs devolve to state and local government privateentities and nonprofit organizations and other third parties itmay become harder for GAO to obtain the records it needs tocomplete audits and evaluations For GAO to effectively do its joband obtain all the facts we must have unfettered access to recordsno matter where the federal dollar goes and services aredeliveredAs Ive stressed we are making major changes in how GAO willface the future both to support Congress and to lead thegovernment in strategic planning human capital managementinformation technology and other areas That is why GAOs humancapital legislation is so important The legislation is absolutelycritical to an evolving GAO that is realigning toward a stcentury Strategic Plan and more modern human capital approaches tomeet its missionMoreover it will important for Congress to consider issues thatwill help GAO to recruit retain and motivate an effectiveworkforce Clearly it is important for GAO to continue to attractbright able staff which is increasingly difficult given theexcellent economy and private sector competition For GAOand formost of the federal governmentto compete with the private sectorwe must be able to have a more flexible compensation system thatcan bring people into government employment at attractive paylevels This makes it incumbent on the government to createincentives to recruit new employees and retain older employeesCongress should consider establishing incentives such as debtrelief for school loans for new hires an ability for staff that iseligible to retire to retreat slowly into retirement through parttime work while obtaining a portion of their pension and aprovision that allows federal employees like private sectoremployeesto keep frequent flier miles Many commercial firms inrecognition of the physical impact and disruption of family lifethat results from frequent travel allow their employees to keepfrequent flyer awards The federal government has always consideredfrequent flyer awards to be property of the government and soughtto reduce travel costs by requiring their use only for officialtravel Six years ago the Congress enacted this requirement intolaw and required the General Services Administration to promotethe use of frequent flyer programs It is time to examine whetherthe financial benefits of trying to make use of frequent flyerbenefits would be outweighed by the recruiting and retentionbenefits of allowing personal use of those benefitsFinally one area I believe the Congress needs to begin thinkingabout is the process for appointment of the Deputy ComptrollerGeneral The current process was established in  The governingstatute provides that a committee consisting of the ComptrollerGeneral the Speaker of the House and President Pro Tempore of theSenate the Majority and Minority leaders and the Chairmen andRanking Minority Members of the Senate Governmental Affairs andHouse Government Reform Committees recommend an individual to thePresident for appointment This process has never worked and it istoo complicated There has been no Deputy Comptroller General sinceBob Keller passed away over two decades ago There are a number ofpossible alternatives to the current process that would avoidconflicts between the Congress and the administration For exampleI could appoint a deputy with the approval of at least threemembers of a panel consisting of the Chairmen and Ranking MinorityMembers of our oversight committees The Director of theCongressional Budget Office appoints his deputy whose term is tiedto the Directors just as the Deputy Comptroller Generals term istied to the Comptroller Generals Let me also note that Gene LDodaro GAOs Chief Operating Officer would make a terrific DeputyComptroller GeneralMr Chairman this concludes my prepared statement I would bepleased to respond to any questions that you or the
