                                 The Lockheed Redemption            In the Yale UniversityLibrary  books are cataloged under the heading Lockheed Of those  nineare crossreferenced under bribery corruption or militaryindustrialcomplex Other appropriate subheadings might include cost overrunsbailout and crash and burn            For acompany whose history from one angle looks to be an almost uninterruptedrecord of malfeasance and incompetence Lockheed has done rather well foritself In fact Lockheed Martinas the company has been known since its merger with Martin Mariettais the worlds largest defense contractor with employees and annual revenues of  billion If its proposedacquisition of Northrop Grumman is approved by the Justice Department it willbe a  billion corporation by the end of  Given that one might seeLockheed as an exemplary case of corporate rebirth On the other hand onemight see it as evidence that in the defense industry as in Hollywood itseasier to fail upward than to disappear            Of course defense is an industry like no other Barriersto entry in terms of technology and physical plant are prohibitive which keepsdomestic competitors out of the business At the same time nationalsecurityconcerns keep potential foreign competitors at bay The Pentagons interest inkeeping its weapons supply free from interruptions meanwhile means that nomajor player can be allowed to go under Defense contractors are able to reaptremendous profits while rarely confronting the risks for which those profitsare supposed to be the reward The fact that a small number of contracts candetermine a companys profit outlook for a decade places a premium onlowballing bids which leads almost inevitably to cost overruns andinfluencecurrying The result is a system with all the vices of bothregulation and competition and few of the virtues of either            Seen inthis light perhaps Lockheeds record is not quite so dismal Sure Lockheedwas the company that charged the Pentagon  for a toilet seat But withGrumman charging  for an ashtray how else was Lockheed to keep up Andyes the Defense Department did pay for CA transport planes from Lockheed onwhich thousands of parts had not been installed But Northrop bought parts fromRadio Shack and put them on MX missileguidance systems without propertesting            That Lockheed has been consistently able toconvince otherswell OK to convince the US governmentto forget about itsrecord testifies to the power of the human imagination It might also testifyto the power of Lockheeds millions of dollars in campaign contributions or tothe effect of revolvingdoor employment in the defense industry Lockheed hasmade historical amnesia into an art form A short bout of traumatic rememberingseems in order            Ironically the companys roots are as deep as any in the aerospace and defenseindustries Founded by auto mechanic Allan Loughhead and his brother Malcolm inwith tellingly enough designer Jack Northrop who went on to foundNorthrop Aircraftthe company struggled until it produced the Vega the planethat Amelia Earhart flew across the Atlantic The Vega together with a seriesof other sparkling designs earned Lockheed a place in the highend market Butthe company did not capitalize on its advantages until the mids when newmanagement moved strongly into the passengerplane market and started competingfor military contracts as well including a failed attempt to sell bombers toGermany in  and a successful sale to Great Britain in             Lockheeds reputation was really made during World War IIwhen the company built both the C Constellation transport which became thestandard for civil airlines in the immediate postwar period and moreimpressively the P Lightning fighter Both planes did what they weresupposed to do and cost what they were supposed to cost Its not clearwhether thats been true of any Lockheed plane since In  for instanceLockheed introduced the Electra turboprop commercial airliner Within a yearthree Electras crashed and within two years production was halted At thesame time the company thanks to wellplaced payments to consultants soldits F Starfighter jetrejected by the Air Forceto both Japan and WestGermany Eventually  of the jets sold to West Germany crashed killing pilots while  of the Japanese jets were lost            For thenext three decades Lockheed found itself building planes no one really neededfor more than they wanted to spend The company tried to sell antisubmarinereconnaissance planes to the Dutch It sold giant longdistance transportplanes to the Indonesians the Filipinos the Brazilians and the Italians Andit sold fighters all over the world It made these sales of course primarilyby bribing foreign officials But that wasnt actually illegal in the UnitedStates until  You might call it a creative and aggressive form ofmarketing In the s the chairman of Northrop which was also bribing itsway across the globe termed this the Lockheed model            At home meanwhile Lockheed was busy runningup  billion in cost overruns on the CA Galaxy the first real procurementscandal in defenseindustry history The company was also building the Tristarpassenger jet plagued from the beginning by equipment problems Lockheedbribed the Japanese prime minister to buy the Tristar for All Nippon AirlinesWhat made these problems truly noteworthy though was that Lockheed onlysurvived them thanks to a  million government bailout The market hadspoken but Lockheed was able to convince the taxpayers to offer up a differentanswer            Once itsurvived the bailout the company was unable to avoid rebounding The Reagandefense budgets helped as did an aggressive marketing plan abroad and mostimportantly the merger with Martin Marietta and the acquisition of GeneralDynamics F fighter division Lockheed helped build the Hubble Telescopenosurprise really given how it performed initiallyand the space shuttle Itscurrently building the FA Stealth fighter and the thoroughly unnecessaryF for the Air Force and is bidding against Boeing for the contract to buildthe Joint Strike fighter the last great contracting plum of the century            Perhaps then corporate rebirth is a fitting tag lineBut whats interesting is how similar Lockheeds tactics remain to those itdeployed when it was running what was called the grease machine In  forinstance the company tried to get the federal government to pay for the costsof its merger with Martin Marietta That same year it was investigated by thegovernment on bribery charges related to F sales and fined  million forbribing an Egyptian minister to help arrange a  million sale of threetransport planes Theres always it seems another corner to cut Thedifference now is that the company has finally figured out how to make its moreunorthodox tactics pay off on the bottom line The startling fact is that oncethe merger with Northrop is done Lockheed will have only one real competitorleft The past is gone The futures bright Only universal peace can messthings up now
