                    Background        One approach for identifying novel genes associated with        physiological pathways is to identify genes whose        expression changes with differences in experimental        treatment or phenotype This approach has been implemented        using several different techniques including the use of        cDNA microarrays to quantitate and evaluate the expression        of thousands of genes simultaneously     Various types        of microarrays have been utilized to study a wide range of        biological models for example       To date        examples of experiments using microarrays to evaluate        changes in gene expression in mammalian species other than        humans and rodent species are lacking primarily due to the        limited availability of arrays Although resources are        being developed that will facilitate production of        microarrays for livestock species      the resulting        microarrays may not meet the needs of all researchers One        alternative to developing speciesspecific microarrays may        be to utilize commercially available human or rodent        microarrays in crossspecies hybridisations This approach        would allow microarrays that are currently commercially        available to be utilized to study additional mammalian        species A variety of human microarray systems are        commercially available and represent well over  gene        and EST sequences In addition crossspecies hybridisation        would allow a common set of genes to be evaluated in        experimental models developed from multiple species        further utilizing the power of comparative genomics        Important criteria for evaluating any microarray system        include the reproducibility of the data generated the        specificity of detection of the targeted gene and the        validity of the results that identify differences in gene        expression The experiments described herein are a first        step toward the systematic validation of crossspecies        microarray analysis with a focus on the reproducibility of        the data generated The methods described to analyze        reproducibility in these experiments may be used to        evaluate the reproducibility of any microarray platform        Secondary objectives of these experiments were to compare        gene expression profiles from crossspecies and        samespecies hybridisations and to evaluate the        variability among nylon micorarrays from a commercial        source                    Results        An overview of the experimental design is presented in        Table  and an example of a microarray image generated by        hybridisation of pig skeletal muscle RNA to a human cDNA        nylon microarray is shown in Figure  The complete dataset        is provided as an additional file see Additional file         dataxls Table presents summary statistics for the raw        data from each hybridisation Our primary objective was to        investigate the reproducibility of replicated crossspecies        hybridisations The distributions of all data were        significantly different from normal because of a large        number of genes with low hybridisation signals and few        genes with high signals Approximately  of genes from        pig and human hybridisations were considered undetectable        Because of this two correlation coefficients and a Kappa        statistic     each with different assumptions regarding        the distribution of the data set were calculated Table         Average values of the Pearson and Spearman correlation        coefficients for the mean normalized data ranged from         to  for both human and pig data Weighted Kappa values        ranged from  to  for pig data and were  for        human data These statistics indicate reproducibility was        high for both pig and human hybridisations High        reproducibility is also evident when comparing the        distribution of data from one replicate to another Figure        ABCD        Description of Additional Files        The complete dataset is

genes        Click here for file        Reproducibility of the data was further evaluated by        considering standard deviations for individual genes and        identifying genes with the highest variability across        replicates Figure shows the distribution of standard        deviations versus average expression over three replicate        hybridisations for human and pig   and  g        hybridisations Highly variable genes were defined as those        with a standard deviation greater than twice the standard        deviation of the population of standard deviations from the        human data or greater than  A total of  variable        genes were found in the human data and   and         variable genes were identified from hybridisations using          or  g pig RNA respectively When the variable genes        identified from human and from pig  g of RNA data were        compared  genes were common to both We consider these        genes to be highly variable An additional  were        variable in pig but not human while an additional  were        variable in human but not pig Variable genes were found        among genes of all expression levels for both pig and human        data Figure         Our second objective was to compare results obtained        from the hybridisation of human and pig skeletal muscle RNA        to human cDNA microarrays A comparison of the gene        expression profiles from the two species based on the        average of three replicate hybridisations for each is        presented in Figure  Concordance among replicates was        assessed using pairwise Pearson and Spearman correlation        coefficients and the Kappa statistic Each of these        statistics suggests high concordance between results        obtained from human and pig Table  Results of using        different cutpoints to categorize data generated similar        Kappa statistics ranging from  to  data not        shown In the examination of the discordance between human        and pig results Bowkers test for symmetry using        categorized data was statistically significant p          indicating that in general stronger hybridisation        signals were detected from human than from pig Examination        of the standard deviations showed no obvious differences        among human and pig   or  g RNA Figure  However        data from the pig using  g of RNA has several large        standard deviations possibly indicating that this        concentration causes more variable results        To determine if washing and rehybridizing to the same        filter had a significant effect on hybridisation signals        standard deviations were calculated for the third fourth        and fifth use of the filters These distributions are        presented in Figure A No trend toward increasing or        decreasing expression among the third fourth and fifth use        of the filters was observed However the average        hybridisation signals detected from the second replicate on        filter  and the third replicate on filter  were        significantly lower and higher respectively than the        other seven replicates Although these results may indicate        an effect of washing and reuse of the filters they may        also represent variability in reactions to produce labeled        probe Thus no evidence was found that would suggest        washing and reusing filters up to five times systematically        increases variability of hybridisation results        Additionally variation in hybridisation signals due to        the use of different filters was evaluated Figure B No        evidence for significant filter effects was found        indicating that on average similar results would be        obtained from different filters To investigate variability        across filters more closely standard deviations of within        and across filter average hybridisation signals were        calculated This analysis identified a small number of        genes that appear to be highly variable across filters        Thus even though the average filter effect across all        genes is small a small number of genes may produce very        different hybridisation signals because of filter        differences                    Discussion        Overall crossspecies hybridisations pig to human        generated reproducible results that were consistent with        results generated by samespecies hybridisations human to        human from the same tissue Although data from replicate        hybridisations were highly reproducible on average a small        number approximately  of genes were identified that        produced highly variable results across both human and pig        replicates This observation is significant because it        highlights the need for replication in microarray        experimentation The importance of replication in        microarray gene expression studies has been addressed by        Lee     These authors concluded that more reliable        analyses of gene expression data are obtained by pooling        data from multiple replicates and recommended that at        least three replicate hybridisations be completed for each        experimental treatment In addition as we have described        specific genes that generate highly variable data may be        singled out from all genes evaluated on a microarray by        identifying genes with the greatest standard deviation        across replicates Once these highly variable genes are        identified they may be considered separately in analyses        to identify differential gene expression among experimental        treatments In this way results for highly reproducible        genes will not be compromised by a small number of highly        variable genes and differential gene expression observed        for highly variable genes may be considered with        appropriate caution        In order to determine if low sequence similarity        contributed to increased variation in the pig data we        compared human sequences on the microarray to pig EST        sequences Because similarities between the human and pig        sequences may not be found due to different regions of the        genes being represented by EST sequences we obtained the        tentative human consensus THC sequence from the TIGR Gene        Index httptigrblasttigrorgtgithat represented the        human sequence on the microarray The THC sequence was used        in a BLAST search to identify similar pig EST sequences A        subset of  genes that were consistently expressed at        high levels in both pig and human were used as controls to        determine the sequence similarity of genes that generated        strong and reproducible signals Of these  genes          were similar to pig EST sequences over at least         bp Taken together sequences of the  genes were         identical between pig and human over  bp of sequence        This identity is consistent with estimates of overall        similarity between pig and human genomes The lack of        identification of a corresponding pig sequence could        indicate that sequence similarity for that gene was low or        that EST sequence for that pig gene has not yet been        generated Of  genes that were variable in both pig and        human data  had hits to pig EST with overall identity of         across  bp Two genes AA and AA that        were variable in pig but not human data had significant        hits to pig EST with  identity over  bp        Additionally specific examples of pig EST with with        greater than  identity to the human sequence were found        within each group of genes investigated pig EST accession        numbers BI BI and BG represent        nonvariable variable in both and variable in pig        respectively Based on this analysis there is not a clear        correlation between sequence similarity and variability        However it is difficult to interpret cases where no pig        EST is identified A more thorough investigation of the        relationship between sequence similarity and variability of        the microarray data will depend on more complete sequence        information from the pig        Our results also demonstrate minimal variation across        microarrays as well as minimal effect of stripping and        reusing the GF nylon microarray ResGen However it        should be recognized that microarrays from only a single        source were evaluated Similar experiments would be needed        before the results pertaining to variation across arrays        and across multiple array uses could be extended to        microarrays produced by other manufacturers or inhouse        facilities        These experiments represent a first step toward        systematic validation of crossspecies microarray        hybridisation However it should be recognized that other        factors such as specificity of the arrays to detect the        targeted gene validity of results identifying differential        gene expression and multiple sources of variation should        be considered for any microarray platform The issue of        crosshybridisation of related genes on cDNA microarrays        was addressed by Miller     These authors used        highstringency conditions and found that minimal        crosshybridisation occurred among genes with up to         sequence identity Although this work demonstrates that        microarray hybridisation can be very specific the high        stringencies would likely prevent crossspecies        hybridisation A balance that allows crossspecies        hybridisation while minimizing crosshybridisation of        related genes will be needed in order to obtain optimal        results from crossspecies microarray experiments A        limited number of studies have validated differences in        gene expression found by crossspecies microarray        experiments       Huang    successfully        validated differential expression of  genes identified by        crossspecies mouse on human microarray hybridisation        using reduced stringency Clearly validation of results        will be even more critical in crossspecies microarray        experiments because of questions surrounding        crosshybridisation of related genes under conditions of        reduced stringency A final consideration for microarray        experimentation is the potential for multiple sources of        variation In our experiment all hybridisations were done        using single pig or human RNA samples Thus variation        among replicates represents technical variation including        variation in labeling of cDNA and minor variations in        hybridisation and washing conditions Experiments to        investigate differential gene expression will also include        biological variation among subjects receiving the same        treatment see     and experimental variation caused        by the treatments of interest In our experiment we chose        to only consider technical variation because our primary        objective was to evaluate the reproducibility of the data        with as little confounding variation as possible        In summary our results demonstrate that crossspecies        microarray data are reproducible Although other factors        need to be investigated to validate the use of        crossspecies microarray experimentation our results        indicate reproducibility of the data should not be a        limitation in crossspecies microarray experiments                    Conclusions        Gene expression data generated across replicate        hybridisations was highly reproducible for the majority of        genes on the microarrays However the identification of a        small number of genes with variable results emphasizes the        need for replication in microarray experiments A minimum        of three replicates of each experimental treatment would        facilitate the identification of these highly variable        genes Variability among replicate hybridisations was        similar for human and pig indicating crossspecies        hybridisation results are expected to be as reliable as        samespecies hybridisations Similar expression profiles        were generated from hybridisations of human and pig        skeletal muscle RNA with human cDNA microarrays Together        these results support the use of commercially available        human microarrays for crossspecies analysis of gene        expression in the pig                    Methods                  Microarray hybridisations          Pig skeletal muscle RNA was obtained from a          longissimus dorsi muscle sample All pig RNA was          generated from a single extraction using Trizol reagent          Life Technologies according to manufacturers          instructions A single sample of human skeletal muscle          RNA was purchased Clontech Total RNA was reverse          transcribed and labelled with PdCTP in a  l          reaction Initially   or  ug of RNA was combined          with  ug of oligo dT ResGen and denatured at C for           minutes The final reaction included X First Strand          Buffer Life Technologies  mM DTT Life Technologies           mM dATP dGTP and dTTP  l Superscript II Reverse          Transcriptase Life Technologies and  l of PdCTP          ICN specific activity  Cimmol The reaction          incubated at C for  minutes and the labelled probe          was purified using a BioSpin  Chromatography Column          BioRad          The GF  Human GeneFilters ResGen nylon          microarrays containing approximately  human genes of          known function were used Microarrays were prehybridized          for  hours at C with  ml of MicroHyb hybridisation          solution ResGen plus  g denatured Cot DNA ResGen          and  g of poly dA The purified and denatured probe was          added the hybridisation solution and hybridisation was          carried out  to  hours at C Microarrays were          washed twice in X SSC  SDS at C for  minutes          followed by a final wash in X SSC  SDS at C for           minutes The stringency of the washes were reduced          from the recommended  and C washes to preserve          crossspecies hybridisation signals Data were collected          using a Cyclone Storage Phosphor System Packard          Instruments and quantified using Pathways  software          ResGen Data were exported from Pathways  into SAS             for statistical analyses All microarrays were          stripped by pouring boiling  SDS over them and          agitating for one hour Microarrays were reused for a          total of  hybridisations as recommended by the          manufacturer                          Experimental design          A total of six microarrays were used and          hybridisations were performed on three consecutive days          Data from days   and  were the third fourth and          fifth use respectively of each microarray Filters            and  were hybridized with cDNA reverse transcribed from           and  g of pig and  g of human total RNA and          filters   and  were hybridized with cDNA reverse          transcribed from  g of pig total RNA see Table           Comparisons of  g pig RNA with human or  or  g pig          RNA Tables through used data generated from the third          fourth and fifth uses of filters   and           respectively                          Statistical methods          Data were normalized by dividing individual intensity          levels by the median intensity for the membrane and          taking the log Pairwise Pearson and Spearman correlation          coefficients were calculated and averaged over the           possible pairs in crossspecies comparisons and three          possible pairs in the within species comparisons          Normalization to the median was used because there were a          large number of genes with low signals as well as some          outliers Analyses were performed on a mean normalized          dataset and results were similar We further considered a          transformation to an ordinal scale Each gene was          categorized into one of four levels undetectable  low           medium  or high  We chose these          cutpoints to separate the high signals and undetectable          signals from the midrange signals As these categories          were defined arbitrarily additional cutpoints were          examined This ordinal transformation was performed in          order to calculate the kappa statistic The kappa          statistic is a chance corrected measure of agreement          that is the calculation of the statistic takes into          account the marginal distributions The kappa will have          lower values than other correlation coefficients when the          marginal distributions are unequal and thus may          represent a more realistic assessment of the underlying          agreement     Bowkers test for symmetry    was          used to test the hypothesis that detectable expression          from pig and human did not differ systematically          The variability of each gene was studied by computing          the standard deviation of three replicate hybridisation          signals for each gene The distribution of these standard          deviations mean standard deviation and range of the           standard deviations was then examined Variability          across filters was also evaluated by computing the          average hybridisation signal for each gene across three          replicates and then calculating the standard error of          the means from each filter                            Authors
