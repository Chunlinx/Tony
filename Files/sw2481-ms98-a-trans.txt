        well   um yes   let me see let me see uh interesting subject i was i was a law student for a year and a half so ive got uh slight bit of expertise in that area not much   well explain this to me   i okay   why do we have sometimes a petit jury isnt it   umhum   and a grand jury   uh okay it depends on the kind of action it is and also depends on the state um you dont have to have a jury of twelve and thats true in just about all states um it just depends on which ever state statue governs on the uh selection of juries now the the term petit usually applies applies to grand juries you have a uh a grand jury and a petit grand jury um sometimes in some states they also call a uh less than twelve member jury a petit jury uh did that sufficiently confuse you   all right now when do we have them just in criminal big criminal cases   um uh when when do you have what a jury   when you have both like i was called for a murder trial a few weeks ago   umhum   and they had had already had one trial and determined that there was enough evidence to go on and have the second one   um okay   so is it just murder or what where you have both   uh okay i i still i still dont get it both what   both juries   uh at the same time   no they didnt have they had had one   oh okay yeah   and decided that there was enough evidence and then   okay uh well well what they do is on a criminal indictment first they go to the grand jury okay the grand jury will either indite or not once a person is indicted then they generally have an evidentiary hearing um and its strange strange that there would have been a jury there because evidentiary hearings are usually are just before the judge now its possible they had another trial in which now i i i dont know enough about it to to really to really say uh uh   say   how long did the other trial go do you know   huhuh i dont know and like you said maybe it was just with the judge i dont know   yeah yeah yeah uh the thing is in almost almost every case when theres a question about uh the evidence against the the person theres theres whats called an evidentiary hearing and the both sides get up there and the judge decides whether or not the evidence is good   yeah   and if the evidence is good then they go ahead and go to trial so you were probably probably being tapped for the jury for the trial   yeah well ill tell you something i think ought to be changed   whats that   well they sent out eight hundred summons   umhum   and about four hundred people showed up right all the others had gotten out of it   umhum umhum   then the judge went on for several hours explaining to us how the law goes   umhum   and some of the particulars of the case and then all these people got to stand up if they wanted to get out of it well that was about half of us right stood up and tried to get out   umhum   well i mean that took like an hour and a half at least for him to listen to everybody   umhum     and then he he didnt let hardly let anybody off you know it was just like we wasted a prayer i didnt go up there because i knew i didnt have a leg to stand on   umhum yeah       well its its hard to get out of jury duty i mean its uh its an obligation on on each citizen and short of uh any of the special circumstances then they generally wont let you out   yeah ive been getting out of it the last few years because i was going to school   umhum   you know you can plead that and i had small children but then i found out that youre not supposed to plead that unless youre the care taker you know and im not because i have to go to work and then they were going to day care so i shouldnt have been doing that   right uh       yeah   but anyway   well as long as they didnt question you too closely i mean the thing is uh the easiest way to get out of one of these things is uh uh uh theyll ask you questions like do you know the defendant have you heard anything about the case do you have any uh specially if its a murder case they may be asking for uh for a capital uh a capitals capital punishment   punishment umhum   uh you can always say that you object to that and theyll let you off there   well i certainly i believed in it in some situations you know cases but i would feel that it would be very hard for me to impose it on somebody   yeah uh that   i think   yeah thats that wont get you off         that you you have to be you have to be dead set against it   okay um   the fact that youre willing the fact that you believe in it doesnt uh doesnt matter of course theyre going to ask you can do you think you could impose it in this case   umhum   and you know i that that to me thats always been a stupid question i i mean i dont know i havent heard the evidence yet   umhum   i mean if if if he did something really really gross then yeah   well this guy that was sitting in in front of me said that he was a private investigator and he had been tailing the woman that was murdered and as far as he was concerned that this guy was guiltier than hell now listen to what he supposedly did he supposedly stuffed paper toweling up this womens nostrils and down her throat and strangled her   ugh   now how this happened was this rich little socialite in Plano down here in Texas decided that she was going to bump off her husbands girlfriend because he didnt want to divorce her   oh God   and she wanted to get a stab at more money right by knocking him off   yeah right   so she hired four guys to do it and this guy actually did it   oh God   now she uh in the mean time took off with one of her lawyers who was also under indictment for attempting drug among them      they ought to make this into a TV show   yeah among them cocaine right so they split anyway they got the lawyer and hes now going to side with the cate with the state so that hell get a lesser sentence     yeah hes going to turn states evidence   yeah   God   pretty interesting huh   now that that would have been fun to sit in on     well now theyre going to call people up after theyve gone through this five page thing that we had to fill out   umhum     and decide to call in people two to three at a time   umhum   theyre going to do this lets see all through April and May and the trials not supposed to start until June well thats the beginning of my vacation   um that   i dont want to be picked   nothing like taking your vacation what you ought to do is reschedule your vacation real quick   i cant im a teacher  its then or never   oh yeah um gosh   anyway   what a way to spend your your vacation   im not going to be summoned i mean out of four hundred im not going to be one of the twelve especially see i put that down that that guy had told me that but then ive heard that wont make a difference either   yeah that thats well it may because it its something that could have influenced your your your uh uh your uh your bias   yeah   so well theres a good chance if they if they ask you about it you know i would i wouldnt just come out and say i think the guys guilty but i i would say that ive heard enough about this that i i really have a preconceived notion of of what the guy did   uhhuh   and i think that you know in in other words if you if you can just show that youre not going to be that you cant be uh unbiased thats going to be enough   well what do you think can we change the system   well theres been all kinds of talk about it but quite honestly i dont think theres anything else that we could put in place that would work as well i mean i i realize its cumbersome and uh uh its time consuming and at times even ridiculous but it the that nobodys come up with any better solution   but something ought to be done because if you have money you get a good lawyer and you get off   well that that is thats a thats one of those things i thinks sort sort of a preconceived notion on the part of the public they you can have a whole bunch of money and you can have the best lawyers but you you know if youve got if youve got a reasonable jury who will look at the evidence i mean you see thats what it all comes down to its the jury uh if they are i mean theres no doubt that you you can pick a jury okay in some in some respects you can get the kind of jury you want but short of that i mean if people are reasonable and theyll look at the evidence and decide on that basis then then you know supposedly money doesnt count but on the other hand what can you do about it i mean what what solution is there   but if youve got a good lawyer hes going to be able to get more persuasive evidence than a poor lawyer would to present and a lawyer thats you know chosen by the state that really doesnt even want to do it   uh oh you mean a court appointed lawyer   uhhuh   yeah theres theres little doubt that i mean obviously a court appointed lawyer doesnt have the time or the resources to do as much but on the other hand i mean again what what can be done about it you know its its one of those i i think unsolvable sort of things i mean we we make the motions of
