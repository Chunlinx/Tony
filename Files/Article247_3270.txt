                                 Blame Blockbuster Not the MPAA            Earlier this week members of the Los Angeles Film Critics Associationcondemned the Motion Picture Academy of America for refusing to grant StanleyKubricks Eyes Wide Shut an R rating without a bunch of ludicrousdigital alterations during a ritualized orgy Yippee another occasion forbashing the ratings board I saw the picture before the fig leaves were appliedand the sequence in question was no more erotic than dental surgerybut thatsneither here nor there            My point is that the film critics are blaming the wrong party The villainsin this scenario are not the anonymous fuddyduddies who sit on the ratingsboard but the sanctimonious hypocrites who preside over some of the countryslargest video and media chains These are the people who treat any film ratedNC as leprous NC was originally meant to eliminate the pornrelatedstigma that came with the earlier X rating But the very same chains thatrefused to carry ads for X films refuse to carry ads for NC films With afilm held hostage by Blockbuster et al any studio with say  million to million on the line feels compelled to hack at their movie and playfootsie with the MPAA until they get their R            Take Blockbuster which prides itself on being a family video store Astroll through the aisles will take you past displays of such wholesome fare asMeat Cleaver Massacre  as well as innumerable softcore madeforvideoserialkillerstalkingmodelsinlingerie flicks You have to wonderwhose family the store caters tothe Mansons But Blockbuster and othersuch outfits have with the help of the MPAA given themselves a veneer ofrighteousness while trafficking in the same kind of sleaze as every otherentertainment conglomerate Thats capitalism            In a column for Daily Variety  Roger Ebert argues that a new ratingAsomething between R and NCwould allow audiences to see the originalcuts of movies such as Eyes Wide Shut and would provide a category foradult films that would be acceptable to theater owners and advertisingoutlets He goes on Theaters would not shun them Everybody understands theconcept of an adultsonly category And because NC would remain in businessnewspapers TV stations and theaters would remain free to discriminate againstit            I wish I could support Eberts suggestion but Im not so sure that A wouldwork Wasnt that the purpose of NC to begin with And does Ebert reallytrust the MPAA to distinguish between films that have artistic merit and thosethat dont Eyes                Wide Shut might be a nobrainer because of theKubrick imprimatur but what about South Park Bigger Longer Uncut a title whose second meaning allegedly passed straight over theMPAAs heads Before cuts for its R there were allegedly lines about sex withthe Almighty A or NC How long before Blockbuster and those big newspaperchains announce that they wont be carrying ads for A films            The larger issue is what the MPAAs distinctions say about our culture Inits press release the Los Angles Critics Association notes the disturbingdouble standard the MPAA continues to maintain when it comes to sexual andviolent movie content  The PG rated movie Wild Wild West  forexample opens with a humorous decapitation and the PG rated movie StarWars Episode The Phantom Menace  contains numerous violent deaths Imfond of citing Albert Brooks experience in  with Lost in Americabecause it so gorgeously encapsulates the issue The MPAA gave the film an Rrating because of a scene in which Brooks protagonist babbles to his wifeJulie Hagerty that he wants to fuck her over her office desk Thatsunacceptable said the ratings board because fuck is used in a sexualcontext Brooks pointed out that if the character instead of saying I wantto fuck you over this desk had said I want to fuck you over with thisdesk the film could have gone out with a PG            But if the MPAA is puritanically intolerant of sex it also has peculiarnotions of acceptable violence A director who frequently tangled with theratings board told me an instructive story He did some research on fistfightsand discovered that a lot of them last one punch In real life one personsnose gets broken and the other persons hand gets broken Theres a lot ofblood I once watched a friend get his nose broken in a brief fistfight andit remains one of the most ghastly things Ive ever seen Now lets pretend Iwant to film such a fight for the purposes of making violence realisticallyhorribleso that anyone who sees it will think twice about getting into afight I put in the sound of cartilage being crunched and show the bright redblood pouring out of someones nose and I give you a close up of the otherpersons broken fingers beginning to swell Agony right And very likelyif Ido my job correctlyan NC Too explicit for children Now lets pretend Idecide to restage that fight and make it painlessten punches back and forthPopeyestyle with no blood and both guys walking away unblemished Thats a Gfolks The lesson for kids is that violence is funny and bloodless and withoutreal consequences            It really wont matter if its PG R NC or even A until we figureout just what it is that we wish to protect children from  The next stepis to ask ourselves whats wrong with a cinema exclusively for adultsand whywe cant seem to keep from stigmatizing it
