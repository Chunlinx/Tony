                well what do you like to read   uh i read about just anything that i can get my hands on   you sound like me       if its printed ill read it   exactly   yeah its amazing to me the people that uh ive ive got a brother and sisterinlaw that uh like whenever i go to visit them ill always have to be sure and carry a book with me because theres nothing to read in their house and i go crazy     yeah i i pretty much carry my own reading material too i mean ill uh ill be walking to work i mean walking to the elevator to work and ill be reading a book on the way up in the elevator and everybody laughs at me   you know yeah well i i went to the library yesterday looking around and i found this uh new book by PJ ORourke called uh uh Parliament of Horrors and its about uh   umhum   its a  humorous humorous attence attempts to explain the entire US government and its really cute     hm   but anyway he wrote for Rolling Stone magazine for years and years i think he still does   uhhuh is it a is it a satire or   it is very much a satire   uhhuh   yeah   well i like i said i i i gosh i cant remember the last book i bought but ive read so many and any book my mother usually has a stack at her house so ill go and pick up one over there and or several actually and just get through them one by one mostly i like i dont know i suppose uh mystery or history true history   yeah   that type of thing   most ladies do like mysteries a lot i have i have a friend too is a voracious history buff she just she reads one history   yeah umhum   book after another and and i was telling her about the library here in Houston that has uh one particular library that has all of the mysteries arranged in one area uh and then another one that while theyre not arranged in one area they do they have question marks on the covers to indicate that theyre mysteries and she said oh that sounds like heaven to her so she wouldnt have to have to look for them   umhum   thats true no i cant say that ive been to the library lately ive found quite a bit i mean im either reading a newspaper or a magazine or like i said anything i can get my hands on   yeah the only problem that ive got now  is that uh i take a daily paper and then ive got oh i dont know four or five magazines coming in and then of course ive always usually im in the middle of two or three different books at the same time   exactly   and ive found lately that uh that i i feel  God for some reason i feel kind of bad about it but im not able to get through the newspaper i mean and i and and then if im not finished with it i dont want to throw it away and then all of a sudden its the next day and then its the next day   uh uhhum   my kitchen counter is covered with magazines newspapers so i finally just you know make a run to the dumpster   yeah   but   i uh i well i end up just picking out key sections and reading those and the rest of it if i get to it fine if not   hm yeah yeah the only really the only the only day that i just uh devour it cover to cover is on Sunday but thats sort of a ritual with me get the coffee and a bran muffin and the newspaper and   umhum   the turn on the stereo and im just im im set for about an hour   an hour is that all   well maybe a little more at least an hour at least an hour     yeah well i know my dad gets both i mean he gets the two Dallas papers here and he he sits down for at least about three so me i dont know i dont i dont sit specifically sit down on Sundays to read the Sunday papers sometimes i dont get to it till like Wednesday   yeah   yeah well thats the good thing about the Sunday paper though they have so many articles that arent necessarily uh you know you dont feel like theyre   but eventually   old if you dont get to them that on that one day   exactly exactly   well i uh i dont know i had bought books for years and years and uh the last time i moved when i was transferred to Houston i uh filled up one big closet with books because where i live now doesnt have a bookshelf doesnt have doesnt have the book shelves that i had in Dallas where i moved from   umhum   and uh i dont know see ive ive just ive got such so many books and moving them was such a pain that ive really stopped buying so many and i started going to the library again which uh i hadnt done in fifteen years you know and it was kind of like an awakening i thought you know gosh this is free its amazing so but ive enjoyed it  and i   umhum yeah its its really a much better idea its a bit inconvenient for me but ive ive always told myself id do that because i dont know i get the books and then after i read them if i really like them ill keep them but if if not you know its its wasted space for me so i end up giving them away   yeah yeah but um ive got im kind of sort of surrounded ive got three different libraries that are within oh i dont know its uh  i guess the furthest one away is maybe two miles one of thems only about a half mile away the other ones about a mile and a half   well thats good   and it and one in particular stays open until uh nine oclock   hm   Monday through Friday so its you know its great and that makes it it it you know if they were just regular hours then it would be difficult because im usually work pretty late at the office but um   umhum   anyway that uh i still like to go to the bookstores and browse around but uh   well ill ill read the reviews   uhhuh   and if they end
