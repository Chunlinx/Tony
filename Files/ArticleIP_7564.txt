                                 Cannibalism            Faster than you can sayRepublican revolution Newt Gingrich has surrendered his job as speaker ofthe House and House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston RLahas wrapped up the contest to replace him The media has already reachedconsensus on Livingston He represents moderation as opposed to Gingrichsconservatism and management as opposed to Gingrichs emphasis on ideologySupport for Livingston Represents Move Toward Pragmatism says MondaysNew York Times front page            OtherHouse leadership positions are up for grabs too and the candidates for thesejobs have joined Livingston and his enemies in the ideologypragmatism debateGingrich was a revolutionary Livingston argued Sunday on ABCs ThisWeek  I am a manager But once again the Republicans and the media arefailing to grasp the message of the  elections Its not about ideologyIts not about competence Its about selfabsorption            The performance of Livingston and two other leadershipcandidates on This Week illustrates how the House coup far from solvingthe GOPs problems is moving Republicans in the wrong direction Instead ofconfronting the publics material concerns theyre engrossed in blaming eachother and promoting themselves Speaking for the new management schoolLivingston advertised himself as a speaker who would provide the legislativemachinery to implement legislation When asked about his role asappropriations chairman in this years sloppily assembled halftrillion dollarbudget bill he replied that he had said at the time This is ugly but wehave to pass it and get out of here and go get reelected When asked aboutthe GOPs porkladen  billion highway bill he said opponents of the billwere right and that he was opposed in the preliminary votes but ended upvoting for the final bill since a lot of people are going to have highwaysbecause of that bill and a lot of people are going to have jobs because of thatbill When asked whether House Republicans had mishandled the Lewinskyinvestigation Livingston answered I dont know I personally was trying toget my appropriations bills out  and I wasnt paying that much attention towhat was going on As for the election results he blamed conservative voterswho stayed home from the polls because theyre sulking because they didnt geteverything they wanted            Rep JCWatts ROkla who ostensibly represents the partys conservative wingfollowed Livingston on the show His principal diagnosis of the election wasthat his colleagues hadnt heeded his wisdom about appealing to ethnicminorities I feel like Ive been beating my head on the wall for the lastfour years and saying that weve got to reach out he lamented Rather thanaddress the moral implications of this oversight Watts went on to explain howRepublicans by electing him could capitalize politically on new audiences Ihavent just talked about this outreach thing Ive done it he assertedIve executed the game plan            Finally speaking for the incumbents Rep JohnBoehner ROhio explained why he should be reelected as chairman of the HouseRepublican Conference Boehner agreed that the leadership needed to be changedWe have got to manage the House in a much different way he said There wereno clear lines of responsibility in the leadership No clear lines ofaccountability But when asked about his own responsibility for the partysfailure he replied Most members of the conference really believe that withNewts decision to leave thats enough changethat the problems in terms ofmanaging the House were mostly in the speakers office When pressed as towhether he had made any mistakes Boehner bravely allowed I dont think it isany secret to anyone that the speaker and I had our share of disagreements overthe last four years about how we operated When asked about the GOPs failureto pass budget bills by June  as required by law he replied No one haspaid attention to the Budget Act since it was enacted And summing up hisrationale for reelection he emphasized the services that Ive provided withmy staff to the members            Theconventional media analysis of the GOP leadership struggle is that Wattsfellow Oklahoma Republican Rep Steve Largent and other conservatives aretaking on Livingston Boehner and the pragmatists And the medias implicitconclusion is that the pragmatists would turn the GOP toward the mandate formoderation that was delivered in the elections But Gingrichs description ofthe House coupcannibalismis more accurate The candidates for theRepublican leadership are conveying a preoccupation not with solving thenations problems but with protecting themselves individually and devouringeach other And if theres one thing the electorate seems to disdain more thanthe violence of the cannibals its the narcissism of their palates                           RecentFrame Games                        The C Word The election didnt kill conservatism The postelection
