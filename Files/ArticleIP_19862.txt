                                 Holy Sheet            The Constitution is morethan the supreme law of the land Its the supreme political weapon If youoppose an ideasay censure of the president or the effort to establishfindings of factjust damn the idea as unconstitutional to silence theopposition Whatever your opponents politics hell have to  Constitutionworship extends beyond politicians to judgesnotably Robert Bork and ChiefJustice William Rehnquistwho embrace the  the belief that we should obey theConstitutions meaning as intended by its framers            The problem with allthis veneration is that Americans quarreled openly about what the Constitutionmeant when it was adopted Few thought it unassailable and not even itsauthors claimed that their views should be fixed for eternity So how did theConstitution become sacred And when did judges decide they must recover itsoriginal meaning            The Constitution grew out of a convention held in  by acabal of elite politicians including James Madison and Alexander Hamilton whodecided that the nations founding document the Articles of Confederation wastoo weak to hold the  But many citizens eyed the Constitutional Convention of warily worrying that a strengthened federal authority would metamorphoseinto precisely the sort of tyranny they had just toppled Patrick Henry said hesmelled a rat and stayed home Such selfselection screened out critics sothat those who gathered agreed on most key questions Contrary to myth the menwho would become known as the Founding Fathers spoke for no cross section ofAmerican opinion One state Rhode Island wasnt represented at all            The framers built theirConstitution on shaky ground The Articles of Confederation explicitly statedthat revision required the consent of every state but the Philadelphiaconventioneers doubtful theyd achieve unanimity lowered the threshold tonine of  stateson no authority but their own sayso            To placate skeptics supporters emphasized not the glory ofthe new Constitution but its imperfections promising it would be improved overtimewith the Bill of Rights as a down payment Even then North Carolina andRhode Island didnt ratify until after George Washington had been sworn in asthe first president In No  of The                Federalist Papers aseries of editorials that Madison Hamilton and John Jay wrote to sell theConstitutionMadison opined It is a matter both of wonder and regret thatthose who raise so many objections against the new Constitution should nevercall to mind the defects of that which is to be exchanged for it It is notnecessary that the former should be perfect it is sufficient that the latteris more imperfect In Federalist   Hamilton added Time must bringit to perfection Far from sacrosanct the Constitution was billed as a workin progress            Only after the newgovernment took over did Americans feel a need to suppress the documentsflaws Their first government had failed and it remained uncertain whether thefragile new one could withstand challenges to its legitimacy Historians beganto rewrite the saga of Americas founding now casting the Constitution as itsinevitable climax rather than as the sharp turn in the road it reallyrepresented George Washingtons Farewell Address of  began thepractice of using religious language to describe the document as he shared hiswish that the Constitution be sacredly maintained John Quincy AdamsInaugural Address  years later completed the apotheosis Administeredby some of the most eminent men who contributed to its formation Adams saidalluding to his own father  it has not disappointed the hopes andaspirations of those illustrious benefactors of their age and nation He wenton to deliver a veritable paean to the piece of parchment            The framers opinions now widely considered the keystoneto interpreting the Constitution traveled a similar path to legitimacyIronically the doctrine of original intent was itself not part of theframers original intent As a guide in expounding and applying the provisionsof the Constitution wrote Madison the documents primary author thedebates and incidental decisions of the Convention can have no authoritativecharacter Though he had taken extensive notes throughout the Philadelphiaconvention Madison never relied on them to buttress any constitutionalarguments he made whether as congressman secretary of state or presidentThe notes werent even published until  Others shared this aversion toreferring to the convention proceedings because it was felt each generationhad to make sense of the Constitution for itself Similar practices favored byoriginalists today such as appealing to the authority of The               Federalist Papers             When did Supreme Courtjustices and other constitutional interpreters began appealing to the framersoriginal intent Historian Leonard Levy argues that only with the SupremeCourts notorious Dred Scott decision of  was the doctrine oforiginalism codified In that decisionthe first in  years to rule an act ofCongress unconstitutionalChief Justice Roger Taney wrote that nothing shouldinduce the Court to give the words of the Constitution a more liberalconstruction  than they were intended to bear when the instrument was framedand adopted Of course Dred Scott  which ruled that blacks whetherslave or free couldnt be citizens came to be condemned not just as racistbut as a quintessential example of tortured reasoning in the service of ajudges personal prejudiceprecisely the kind of jurisprudence thatoriginalisms advocates claim it alone can avoid            This argumentthat judges only use originalism to disputedecisions they dont likeis as compelling a reason to distrust originalism asany historical reason As Levy notes when judges use history its typicallyafter theyve made up their minds on how they want to rule The Court resortsto history for a quick fix a substantiation a confirmation an illustrationor a grace note he writes it does not really look for the historicalconditions and meanings of a long time gone  to decide a case in one wayrather than another The Court moreover cannot engage in the sort ofsustained historical analysis that takes professional historians some years toaccomplish It would be nice to believe that originalists really apply theirdoctrine without first deciding the case on political grounds And it wouldalso be nice to believe that every Republican truly thinks censureand everyDemocrat thinks a finding of factwould be that worst of all possible thingsunconstitutional
