                    Background        Although electrocardiograms ECGs have been obtained in        conscious mice currently reported techniques require        restraint   or anesthesia and surgical implantation of        telemetry devices     Anesthesia however may        depress cardiovascular function and adequate recovery        after transmitter implantation in mice is nearly  weeks           Accordingly we developed a noninvasive technique        for obtaining ECGs in conscious mice by placing the animal        on a platform embedded with pawsized ECG electrodes        connected to an amplifier This method is much less        traumatic requires no anesthesia or surgery and promotes        rapid screening of large quantities of mice ECG data we        obtained noninvasively in conscious mice are comparable to        those recently published using surgically implanted        telemetry devices    To test the efficacy of our        system we evaluated ECGs in mice of either sex of several        strains and of different ages Moreover we tested whether        our system could detect ECG alterations in response to        pharmacological challenge by isoproterenol The baseline        heart rate data and responses to the adrenergic agonist        isoproterenol we recorded noninvasively in mice are        comparable to data published using invasive methods  We        developed an ECG signal processing analyzing and database        Web portal which we named eMOUSE accessible to the        biotechnology community The advantages of the ECG        recording and analyses paradigm we developed are clear        given the high cost of breeding housing and transporting        mice and the call for comprehensive yet widely available        phenotyping tests                      Results        We recorded ECGs in  males and  females each of        CBL Sv and FVBN mice three inbred strains        commonly used to model human diseases A representative ECG        recording from an adult male CBL mouse is shown in Fig         Since the mice are conscious baseline artifact and        noise are apparent in the unfiltered signals Yet the        Pwaves and Twaves are discernible by eye and        interpretable by the software algorithmic processing of the        signal digitized at  samples per second Analyses of        the digitized signals via eMOUSE demonstrated        significantly faster heart rates in CBL female mice        than in males    bpm vs    bpm         P   n   and shorter QRS        duration    ms vs    ms         P   Table summarizes        results in Sv mice  males and  females again        demonstrating faster heart rate and shorter QRS duration        and QT interval in female mice than in agematched males        Rate corrected QT QTc in male Sv mice was        significantly longer than in females    ms vs           ms         P   Gender differences in        heart rate were also apparent in the FVBN strain           bpm in males n   vs    bpm in females n           P          Reducing the spacing of the electrodes allowed us to        record ECGs in day and again in day old nursling        CBL mice  males and  females and return them to        their mother The ECG from a dayold CBL nursling        female is shown in Fig  Heart rate variability in        neonates was significantly less than in adults           bpm vs    bpm         P   Heart rate in nursling        females was significantly slower than in adult females           bpm vs    bpm         P   Interestingly the        gender differences in heart rate we observed in adult mice        were absent in day old and day old neonates Upon        weaning  days old however gender differences in heart        rate became apparent    bpm in males n   vs           bpm in females n           P          The acute increase in heart rate within the first        minutes following one intraperitoneal injection of the        adrenergic agonist isoproterenol  gg was        significantly less in female compared to male CBL adult        mice    females vs    males         P   n   for each group        Saline injection had no effect on heart rate After  days        of repeated isoproterenol injection  gg once at AM        and once at PM heart rate in males prior to the         thinjection was significantly reduced compared to control        heart rate in males prior to the  stinjection whereas the        heart rate in females did not change Both male and female        mice exhibited significant acute increases in heart rate           males and    females after the         thinjection of the drug on day           P   compared to  increases        following  stinjection on day  Fig illustrates        significant electrocardiographic alterations immediately        after the  stadministration of isoproterenol on day  in a        CBL male mouse ST segment depression suggestive of        acute subendocardial ischemia was consistently observed in        CBL male mice but not in all female mice immediately        following administration of isoproterenol Heart weight in        males and females treated with isoproterenol for  days was        significantly increased  compared to hearts from mice        treated with saline for  days          P                      Discussion                  Strain  Gender Differences in ECGs in Adult          Mice          To our knowledge this is the first study to describe          gender differences in heart rate in genetically          homogenous strains of conscious mice Studies in humans             and in rats    have shown females to have          faster heart rates than males differences that disappear          with age    In CBL mice and in Sv mice          we found that conscious females exhibited significantly          faster heart rates than male mice In FVBN mice          however we noted faster heart rates and briefer ECG time          intervals in male compared to female mice Mitchell et          al using implanted transmitters reported slightly but          insignificantly faster heart rates in male compared to          female FVB mice   Gender and strain differences in          heart rate may reflect differences in hormone activity          which are known to affect cardiovascular autonomic          regulation differentially in males and females   and          vary among mouse strains   Our straindependent          observations agree with results of invasive studies             and support the importance of genetic factors in          influencing heart rate                          Developmental Changes in ECGs in Conscious Neonatal          Mice          We found that the gender differences apparent in          CBL adults were absent in nursling mice Reduced          activity in newborns could contribute to reduced heart          rate and heart rate variability However observations in          quietly resting adult mice n   monitored  min          after placement on the recording platform of reduced          heart rate    bpm and increased heart rate          variability    bpm suggest that the results in          neonates may be attributable to reduced sympathetic and          parasympathetic signaling   The timedomain heart          rate variability data we obtained noninvasively are          comparable to those obtained using implanted telemetry          devices    The developmental changes in heart rate          we measured in mice parallel those in human neonates             lambs   and newborn rats   Moreover          our observations in neonatal mice are in agreement with          Wang et al who reported progressive and significant          shortening of RR intervals during neonatal development            Accordingly our approach adaptable to the study of          small mice that might otherwise die from anesthesia or          surgery might be valuable in examining developmental          changes and abnormalities                             Effects of Sympathetic Stimulation in Conscious          Mice          The blunted heart rate increase in response to          adrenergic stimulation in conscious CBL female mice          is consistent with gender related differences in          baroreflex control of heart rate in healthy humans            Estrogen has been shown to enhance baroreflex sensitivity            and attenuate the response of heart rate to          administration of isoproterenol in rats   After          repeated injections of isoproterenol heart rate          decreased and the QRS duration increased significantly in          male mice but did not change in female mice Yet both          males and females demonstrated increased sensitivity to          acute isoproterenol injection after repeated          administration that resulted in significant cardiac          hypertrophy    We observed a  increase in          heart mass in both sexes after days of isoproterenol          treatment compared to mice treated with equivolume of          saline Although adrenoceptor desensitization   or          reduced ATPase activity   may account for the          decrease in basal heart rate in the hypertrophied male          hearts the increased sensitivity to isoproterenol may          support the hypotheses of ischemiainduced activation of          adrenoceptor kinase   or modulation of Gprotein          signaling to preserve adenylate cyclase activity            To our knowledge this is the first report that describes          electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia in          conscious mice although ST segment changes have          characterized isoproterenolinduced ischemia in rat            and man   Why males consistently developed ST          segment depression following isoproterenol administration          and females did not remains unanswered However          significant genderrelated differences in the expression          of glutathione Stransferases GST have been observed in          mice with female mice expressing significantly more of          this antioxidant than male mice   In mice          isoproterenolinduced oxidative stress may be attenuated          in females due to higher levels of GST                            Study Limitations          Mice are sensitive to even modest handling    and          transport    The ECG indices we measured may          reflect physiologic responses to the experimental          environment relative to its home cage We encourage a           min acclimation period prior to recording data to          attenuate effects consequent to handling and transport          Usually mice establish contact between  electrodes and           limbs within  minutes after acclimation to record a          continuous ECG for approximately  seconds The duration          of the ECG recording should be considered in the          interpretation of heart rate variability   The age          gender and strain variations in heart rate may reflect          age gender and strain variations in physiologic          responses to transport   handling   and          adaptation to repeated measurements   Yet the          interstrain differences in heart rate we noninvasively          obtained after ECG recordings of short duration are in          agreement with invasive experimental techniques intended          to monitor heart rate in mice as caged    Our          measurements were made in daytime hours disrupting the          less active phases of the mouse circadian cycle Future          innovation might incorporate an array of conductive          electrodes into the animals cages to eliminate the          effects of handling and transport and perhaps enable          timed recordings                            Materials and Methods                  Mice          Young adult mice    weeks old    g from           commonly used inbred strains CBL Sv and FVBN          The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME were housed in          standard conditions within the Animal Resource Facility          at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Boston MA          Nursling CBL mice of either sex were examined at          postnatal day  and  and returned to their mothers          The same mice weaned were examined at  weeks of          age                          ECG recording          Mice were gently removed from their cages and          positioned on the ECG recording platform An array of          gelcoated ECG electrodes Red Dot  M St Paul MN          were embedded in the floor of the platform and spaced to          provide contact between the electrodes and animals paws          For adults the spacing between electrodes was  cm and          for nurslings the spacing was reduced to  cm Filter          paper with openings for the electrodes prevented mouse          urine from shortcircuiting the signals The electrodes          were connected to an amplifier HPA          HewlettPackard Andover MA by a shielded electrode          lead set MA Snap HewlettPackard Andover MA          Since even modest handling of mice may induce alterations          in heart rate   each mouse was permitted to          acclimatize for  min prior to collection of baseline          data The signals were digitized with bit precision          DI DATAQ Instruments Inc Akron OH at a          sampling rate of  samplessecond When mice were          sitting or otherwise positioned such that the paws were          not in contact with three electrodes the output from the          amplifier was discarded Only data from continuous          recordings of  ECG signals were used in the          analyses Data were transmitted to the           mousespecificscom Internet site          Mouse Specifics Inc Boston MA using standard          filetransfer protocols for ECG signal analyses by          eMOUSE                          ECG analyses          Each signal was analyzed using eMOUSE an          Internetbased physiologic waveform analysis portal          eMOUSE incorporates Fourier analyses and linear          timeinvariant digital filtering of frequencies below           Hz and above  Hz to minimize environmental signal          disturbances The software uses a peak detection          algorithm to find the peak of the Rwaves and to          calculate heart rate Heart rate variability was          calculated as the mean of the differences between          sequential heart rates for the complete set of ECG          signals Subsequently determination of  stand           ndderivatives and algebraic ifthens search the ECG          signals for probable Pwave peaks and onset and          termination of QRS complexes Since the Twave is not          separate from the QRS in rodent ECGs    there          have been discrepancies in the definition of the QT          interval and reported values   In accord with          Mitchell et al   we routinely included the inverted          andor biphasic portions of the Twave in our          calculations of the QT interval We defined the end of          the Twave of each signal as the point where the signal          returned to the isoelectric line    the mean          voltage between the preceding Pwave and QRS interval          The QT intervals were rate corrected QTc by application          of the equation recommended by Mitchell et al   for          use in mice The software plots its interpretation of          PQRS and T for each beat so that spurious data          resulting from unfiltered noise or motion artifacts may          be rejected eMOUSE then calculates the mean of the ECG          time intervals for each set of waveforms                          adrenoceptor stimulation          To test the sensitivity of our system for describing          ECG alterations in response to a drug CBL mice were          given either an intraperitoneal injection of  gg          isoproterenol Sigma St Louis MO  males           females dissolved in  ml saline or an equal volume of          saline  males  females twice daily for days ECGs          were recorded within  min prior to each injection and          between  and  min after each injection to capture the          peak of the response to the drug   After the last          measurement mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal          administration of pentobarbital  mgKg consistent          with the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on          Euthanasia guidelines Excised hearts excluding atria          and blotted dry were then weighed                          Statistics          Data are presented as the means  SE Comparisons          between genders among strains were performed using          Students           t test for unpaired observations          Effects of isoproterenol or saline injections within          groups were performed using Students           t test for paired observations          and between group comparisons using Students           t test for unpaired observations          Differences were considered significant with           P                              Conclusions        We developed a noninvasive technique for obtaining ECGs        in conscious mice We developed an Internetaccessible        portal for analyses of mouse electrocardiograms Using this        system we demonstrated significant strain gender and        agedependent differences in electrocardiograms in mice        Moreover we demonstrated significant genderdependent        differences in the cardiovascular response to        adrenoceptor stimulation Our results may suggest that        the stimulatory effects of genes and drugs on cardiac        function may be more profound in male or masked in female        mice This noninvasive and rapid ECG phenotyping technique        may improve the quality and increase the quantity of data        collected from mouse models
