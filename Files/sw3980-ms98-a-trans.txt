        im Bridget   hi hi im Joan  this is a riot  i im making money what are you doing   oh bull is this Mrs Slaubacher  what are you doing the same thing okay hold on   push your one and lets get with it     okay   okay  so what do you think about raising kids you dont know anything about this   well i dont have kids so its kind of hard to say   it is kind of hard for you   but i think that i mean i think its kind of sad that like theyre talking about like what the trends are today i think its kind of sad that people are so uh   umhum   involved with their careers and stuff that they dont take time for their kids i think its really sad i think they should reevaluate their priorities   i do to thats true   because i was waiting to get someone that would say yeah well you know its hard to spend time with my kids and i was just gonna be like gritting my teeth  hoping not to say something i didnt mean to   right right but i i think you need to take that for the little bit of time it takes like for or about   but i think its really sad   ten years out of your life of really being around them when they really need you and their younger ages its worth that ten years and it pays off i think   yeah see see i do too i agree   because the ten years isnt long till you can work on your career and then you have forty years more to do your career   no   i know if you dont if you wanna have a career thats fine but i dont think you should have kids you know or wait till youre   yeah thats true   ready to give up some of it   thats true what well you know some of the um i see it with our teachers that have waited for it till theyre thirty four thirty five   uhhuh really   and they have that first one and boy youd think they were the only ones that ever had kids   really   they and yeah they really love it   thats great   i think theyre kind of sorry then they didnt that they waited that long because they really enjoy them a lot   that they waited   see  i know   and i see that a lot with the young girls that think thats all they wanted was careers and then when they hit around thirty four thirty five they decide well the really want to try motherhood     uhhuh yeah   and uh that happens but i agree if they if they want a career though i think they should go with the career and forget the kids when   and   see i see too i mean i it sounds bad and i know people would totally disagree and say it shouldnt have to be a choice but for the welfare of the kid i think it is   yeah yeah right right are you at school now are you thats a riot yes   or at least it uhhuh  yep im in Lubbock thats hilarious must have been right when you said something i knew that was you i was like oh my gosh   um what are some of the things you think the parents should do with their kids   God anything i mean take them to the park on Saturday or God i mean even if they say they dont have time for kids they should sit down and eat dinner with their kids that would take all of thirty minutes   right yeah see i think that dinner time is real important with kids thats when a lot of things would come out     yeah   that if you and youd make i know that when theyre all going all different directions but i used to at least make three meals three meals out of a week they had to be together     yeah   and i kind of insist on it and they were pretty good about it they hated to miss it because theyd hear about the good time we had if they werent around   yeah i just think its important   yeah i do too because thats when i dont know why but kids start talking when youre when youre around a dinner table and all they start telling all the things     yeah especially you had so many kids too though so you get to hear the whole scoop on everyone because everyone would know   yeah yeah       and uh but i think any any entertainment that you can do with them is fun though when when you know we always loved to go camping   uhhuh   and thats great even even now we go camping in fact we have one set up in May   do you really   and the grand kids come now its the grand kids i mean we started out when the kids were young doing this and now they bring their babies um  Marys baby was four weeks old when we took her   oh how cute   we took him and uh we start them out real young even and in the winter we just take electric blankets and put them on     uhhuh   really see thats great   they and they love that outdoors   id love to do that   yeah and they go fishing from the time theyre little and uh the daddies take them out in the boats its fun     see this is important i know i i get engaged and my moms like so how long you think itll till you have kids and i was like God im not married even yet uh   yeah     dont start saying kids im not ready   yeah       but i think any any outings with kids is wonderful makes you get to know them better and another thing i like is um just making sure you have time with each one alone   yeah yeah thats of important   yeah even you you know no matter how many you have you should take a special day a special time for one   for each so they dont feel like there isnt singled out   yeah and make that day for shopping or going out to lunch or just taking them to the park alone and youd be surprised what theyll talk about when youre just sitting there on a swing talking     see   yeah just as long
