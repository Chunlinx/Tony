              okay   yes   uh well right now we have one dog inside   uhhuh   she goes out but i mean shes an indoor dog   yes   and two outside cats   oh gosh and how long have you had them   male and female the male the dog is probably about about thirteen fourteen years old and the cats are   yes   they might be as old im not sure  yeah   kind of lose track  well thats interesting because we have a similar we dont have cats but we do have a dog who is an indoor dog and she is going to be thirteen this summer so yes uhhuh   uhhuh uhhuh oh is that right what kind of dog do you have   um shes um a mix of Cockapoo Cocker Cocker Spaniel and Poodle   oh thats what ours is  yes   is that right isnt that interesting  what color is your dog   white   oh  well ours is black so  definitely different  yes shes a female and shes um been shes been a really a really good companion for me um shes like a little shadow you know kind of follows me around all the time and   oh uhhuh ill be darned uhhuh oh yeah   and um shes slowing down considerably she doesnt hear very well and she doesnt see very well but shes yeah at this age i guess so   uhhuh well thats to be expected at their age yeah   but um shes been a good dog to have and i dont know once shes gone im not sure if ill get another animal or not   well everybody always says no more  but i i think animals are really important in the family i   yeah yeah i agree yes um did you get yours as a pet for your children do you have children uhhuh   uh yeah we have five ah   uhhuh oh well i was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because youd had dogs before or   well we have had we had had a a dog before she was fifteen when she died and uh this one we bought by accident a farmer called us and wanted us to call the animal shelter to come or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this   my goodness uh   puppy that somebody people drop things like that off up there and i said gee she sounds like a cute little dog i told the kids lets go look at her   uhhuh yeah uhhuh oh yeah   go get her so thats how we got her quite by accident   isnt that yes so that often happens that way well we had um intentionally um planned to get a dog we had just moved into this house and um decided to wait a about a year and then went then we went out then and found one she was in the litter and um   uhhuh uhhuh   she was so cute because  all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy i mean they were all over the place and she was real docile and came over and just kind of sat next to us and i thought thats the dog for me       oh oh she picked us   yeah so she and it what was funny was that um our daughter must have been lets see she must have been about eight at the time i guess and um   uhhuh   she just loved this little dog to pieces but i think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her i think she was always a little bit leery of her   oh oh uhhuh   our son on the other hand who was about eleven at the time was um not very interested in pets but as it turned out he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals   oh for heavens sake   so you just never know how that works out   no but they say its real important for children to have pets because uh well they can go and talk to them any time they want to and tell them anything they want to and   uhhuh yes yeah   nobody is going to you know reprimand them or know their secrets or   thats right that yes theyre very unjudgmental  oh dear   yeah yes and the nursing homes now theyre finding that its real important to take a pet into a nursing home   yes i have been i have been reading and seeing about that on television uhhuh and how   uhhuh   our one our one nursing home in Brooksville has one   uhhuh   permanent   is that right   he he kind of has free run of the place and there is somebody or somebody takes care of him   isnt that amazing   but he goes up and down the halls visiting people and real nice dog uh and uh   uhhuh yes its funny how um how pets can kind of um oh take on a certain status in certain areas i mean um that made me think of uh when our daughter was looking at colleges we visited a campus in um Saint Louis and   uhhuh   um there were several dogs on the campus and and the what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly but they didnt appear to belong to anyone and um im sure someone you know fed them they were healthy looking dogs   uhhuh oh really oh yeah   but um our guide that day said that the lady one woman many many years ago had given a huge sum of money to to the university on the condition that there be um dogs just kind of left to roam around around the campus   is that right   which is the strangest thing i had ever heard   yeah because most campuses dont allow pets you know they just do not allow them   i know yes i know it   thats thats kind of great   yes it really was it was just a nice touch and it kind of made it seem more homy too  but um the i thought that was most unique and it just you know kind of goes along with what you were saying about the dog having sort of free run of the the nursing home   yeah yes yeah uhhuh   so um but uh i this is the only pet weve had since you know in all our years of marriage um and its been uh sort of a a change for my husband because as a a a boy growing up   um   his father had dogs but they were always hunting dogs and so they were never allowed in the house you know they were always kind of yeah right  thats what he said yes so having a pet was a little bit different for him   oh uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh yeah weve ruined them  they say theyll ruined them well weve had a lot of different pets we had the kids had rabbits for pets and we also raised them for food at one time   uhhuh yeah oh yes   and weve had it weve had a skunk for a pet   oh my golly   for more years than i want to think about  she was in the house   oh gosh isnt that interesting i dont think ive ever talked to anyone whos actually had a skunk for a pet  oh   well dont dont ever get one for a pet  theyre okay but like she uh they dont ever learn their name   ah   uh you cant you could never call her and she would come to you you had to go chas e her down   yeah ill be darned how interesting   and uh their eyesight they cant see very far either but   uhhuh i guess ive heard that uhhuh   they they before before we got her everybody said oh theyre just like a cat you know   uhhuh   and uh theyre not  i mean they use the litter box thats about it as far as     isnt that interesting thats thats really something um how long did you have that   oh my how how long probably seven or eight years   goodness sake   and finally my children are the ones who said mom youve put up with that skunk long enough so  we moved her to the basement and i dont think she was there a week till the men moved       built built her a pen outside  and i thought i put up with that all those years   oh my gosh Isnt that funny yes and this is what it took finally  that is   and weve had weve had cats two stay in the house we had we had two Siamese cats   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   different times   right   uh one of them ran off she ran off once or he i guess it was a male he ran off twice and the second time he never came back   my goodness   and we would see him uh several miles from our house he kind of moved into a woods down there and he got huge down there   uhhuh ill be my goodness   he really grew but he he never came back   thats interesting thats interesting i i wouldnt picture a Siamese as being an outdoor cat   well he wasnt a whole lot he was in the house most the time but uh he did go out sometimes and uh they make it makes a much nicer cat if theyre outside   uhhuh yeah is that right   yeah the the cats my son has a cat and the vet had told us they get strange if theyre kept in the house all the time and their cat uh was not a friendly cat it was   uhhuh well   it was not a good i dont know it got it was just did get strange  and since theyve moved to where they are they let the cat out and it has improved the personality   yeah so that that was right uhhuh
