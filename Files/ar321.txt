                    Introduction        Systemic sclerosis SSc is a connectivetissue disease        characterized by progressive thickening of the dermis        often accompanied by insufficiency of internal organs such        as the lungs heart or kidneys   These manifestations        are due to the excessive accumulation of extracellular        matrix proteins predominantly type I collagen in the        affected tissues   The cause of SSc is unknown but the        early stage is characterized by a dense mononuclear cell        infiltrate in tissues suggesting that activation of the        immune system results in the development of tissue fibrosis           A prominent humoral abnormality in SSc is        manifested by the presence of antinuclear antibodies          The circulating antitopoisomeraseI antiTopo I Scl        antibodies are highly specific for SSc   and they are        found in sera from  to  of patients   The presence        of antiTopoI antibodies is associated with diffuse        cutaneous involvement and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis          and is considered a predictive marker of diffuse        SSc        Human DNA topoisomerase I Topo I is a aminoacid        nuclear enzyme   involved in topological changes of DNA        structure   It plays key roles in DNA replication        transcription and recombination During the Topo I        catalytic process a transient covalent linkage termed the        cleavable complex is formed between the enzyme and DNA        strand nicks Camptothecin CPT and its derivatives        specifically target Topo I by binding noncovalently to        these cleavable complexes stabilizing them and interfering        with DNA religation   As a result of CPTs action        single and doublestrand DNA breaks are generated leading        to premature termination of replication and inhibition of        transcription   Cells can repair DNA breaks caused by        low doses of CPT whereas higher doses lead to cell death          Since many neoplastic cells are characterized by high        levels andor activities of Topo I    this enzyme        has become one of the cellular targets for anticancer        therapy    CPT derivatives such as topotecan and        irinotecan CPT are currently used in the treatment of        various cancers     Only limited side effects        such as manageable neutropenia in patients who received        high doses of Topo I inhibitors have been reported                  The mechanism responsible for the production of        antiTopoI antibodies in SSc is not fully understood        Recent studies suggest that activation of TopoIreactive T        cells is responsible for the induction and propagation of        these antibodies in SSc patients   At present the        origin of their target autoantigen is not clear        Significantly the disappearance of these antibodies        possibly because of removal of the autoantigen has been        associated with favorable outcomes   Because of the        potential pathogenic role of Topo I in SSc we undertook        this study to evaluate the utility of noncytotoxic        concentrations of Topo I inhibitors for the treatment of        SSc We have focused on the effects of the leading Topo I        inhibitor CPT on collagen production by dermal        fibroblasts obtained from patients with SSc                    Patients and methods                  Patients          The subjects were patients with diffuse SSc and          healthy volunteers The patient group consisted of           individuals  women and  men with a mean age of             years All the patients fulfilled the American          College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of SSc            The control group were  healthy donors with a          mean age of    years                          Cell culture          Dermal fibroblasts were obtained from clinically          affected skin on the dorsal forearm of the SSc patients          and from healthy donors matched with the patients for          race age and gender The control fibroblasts were          obtained within several days of SSc biopsy and were          processed in parallel For the experiments cells were          starved for  h before the addition of CPT in DMEM          fetal bovine serum FBS                          Reagents          CPT was purchased from Sigma St Louis MO USA and          dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide Sigma Aliquots of          stock solution  mM were stored at C                          Determination of collagen types and of elastin          production          Collagen and elastin deposition in cell and matrix          layers was determined by solidphase ELISA with          antibodies against goat anticollagen I Chemicon          Temecula CA USA mouse anticollagen III Telios San          Diego CA USA mouse anticollagen VI Telios or          mouse antielastin Sigma at dilutions recommended by          the manufacturers          To determine the effect of CPT on newly synthesized          collagenous proteins we used an established method of          metabolic labeling with  Hproline followed by SDSPAGE          electrophoresis   The results were visualized by          autoradiography The intensity of bands of collagenous          protein was quantitated using NIHImage Densitometry          Software version  The effect of CPT on total          protein synthesis was examined using metabolic labeling          with  Smethionine followed by SDSPAGE and          autoradiography                          RNA preparation and northern blot analysis          Fibroblasts were treated with CPT at concentrations          from  to  moll for  h Total RNA was extracted          and analyzed by northern blotting as described elsewhere            Membranes were sequentially hybridized with          radioactive probes for I procollagen and          glyceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH and          scanned with a PhosphorImager Molecular Dynamics Inc          Sunnyvale CA for mRNA quantitation                          Transient transfection and chloramphenicol          acetyltransferase assays          Transient transfections of normal dermal fibroblasts          were performed with  g of the  fragment of I          collagen COLA promoter linked to the chloramphenicol          acetyltransferase CAT reporter gene by the calcium          phosphateDNA coprecipitation technique as described          elsewhere   CAT values were corrected to reflect the          efficiency of transfection relative to the cotransfected          pSVgalactosidase vector Promega Madison WI          USA                          Statistical analysis          Statistical signifance was evaluated in paired          analyses using the Students paired           t test or the Wilcoxon test          nonparametric depending on the data distribution Data          values are

of CPT on production of collagen          protein          The effect of CPT on the production of types I III          and VI collagen by  pairs of SSc and normal dermal          fibroblasts was examined by ELISA using fibroblast cell          and matrix layers Fig abc Incubation with CPT for           h significantly decreased the expression of all three          collagen types although the degree of inhibition varied          among the different collagens Although CPT at  moll          decreased collagen production more in SSc than in healthy          control fibroblasts by respectively  and  for          type I  and  for type II and  and  for type          III Fig abc these differences were not          statistically significant The reduction of type I          collagen expression by CPT after  h was also          demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and indirect          immunofluorescence data not shown To assess the effect          of CPT on production of other extracellular matrix          proteins the effect on elastin was measured by ELISA no          effect was found in either SSc or control fibroblasts          Fig d          The effect of CPT on newly synthesized collagenous          proteins secreted into the media was examined in five          pairs of SSc and healthy control fibroblasts in nine          independent experiments CPT at concentrations from           to  moll significantly decreased secretion of          collagenous protein by up to  in both cell types          Fig ab The responsiveness of SSc and healthy          control fibroblasts to different doses of CPT was also          compared No major differences were observed at the three          highest doses used  to  moll but SSc          fibroblasts appeared to be slightly more sensitive to the          lowest dose of CPT  moll Secreted collagenous          proteins were inhibited by    in SSc fibroblasts          versus    in healthy control fibroblasts            P   The total protein          synthesis was not affected by CPT treatment even at the          highest dose used  moll Fig c The number of          cells after CPT treatment was not significantly decreased          Table  indicating that the doses used were not          cytotoxic to fibroblasts CPT is cytotoxic mainly to          Sphase cells and its effects are dependent on cell type            In general human fibroblasts are more resistant          than neoplastic cells or lymphoblasts to DNAdamaging          agents   Although it has been shown that CPT at          higher concentrations induces cell cycle arrest in          proliferating dermal fibroblasts   it is unlikely          that the inhibition of collagen production was related to          cell cycle arrest because our experiments were performed          with confluent serumstarved cells Taken together the          experiments presented in this part of the study suggest          that CPT is a relatively specific inhibitor of          collagenous protein production in dermal fibroblasts                          Effect of CPT on expression of COLA mRNA          The effect of CPT on COLA steadystate mRNA levels          was evaluated in seven pairs of SSc and healthy control          dermal fibroblasts in  independent experiments CPT          treatment resulted in a dosedependent decrease of COLA          mRNA expression levels in SSc and healthy control          fibroblasts as demonstrated by northern blot analysis          Note that GAPDH mRNA levels were not inhibited by CPT          Fig a The highest dose of CPT   resulted in          about  inhibition of COLA mRNA levels in both SSc          and healthy control fibroblasts Fig bc These          results suggest that the inhibitory effects of CPT occur          at least partially through regulating the levels of          expression of collagen mRNA                          Effect of CPT on activity of COLA promoter          The transcriptional activity of the human COLA          promoter fragment  linked to the CAT reporter gene          was examined in transient transfection assays after CPT          treatment Consistent with the mRNA data the maximal          inhibition of collagen promoter activity was  Fig           suggesting that the inhibitory effect of CPT on the          COLA gene occurs at the transcriptional level As          previously reported CPT has no effect on the activity of          the control vector   The activity of the collagen          promoter was inhibited by much lower doses of CPT           and  moll than those that inhibited collagen          mRNA levels  to  moll This probably reflects          the difference in sensitivity to CPT between exogenous          and endogenous promoters due to the protective role of          chromatin surrounding the endogenous promoter                            Discussion        DNA Topo I is an essential enzyme involved in such        crucial cellular functions as replication and        transcription This study was undertaken to determine        whether inhibition of its activity by noncytotoxic doses of        CPT a drug that selectively targets Topo I could reverse        the activated phenotype of fibroblasts from patients with        SSc CPT an alkaloid that exists in nature and has been        used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine is a        prototype of a new class of anticancer drugs   It is        commonly used in         in vitro experimental model systems        to study the mechanisms of action of Topo I inhibitors        Clinically approved Topo I inhibitors irinotecan and        topotecan are semisynthetic derivatives of CPT that differ        from CPT in toxicity profiles and water solubility but not        in the mechanisms of action           Our results show that CPT significantly inhibits the        synthesis of collagen by dermal fibroblasts from patients        with SSc The production of types I III and VI collagen        was significantly inhibited in SSc and healthy control        dermal fibroblasts without affecting total protein        synthesis The inhibitory mechanism of CPT was further        examined using COLA as a representative collagen gene        The drug inhibited COLA steadystate mRNA levels and        promoter activity by  indicating that it directly        inhibits transcription of this collagen gene It is not        known why collagen genes and particularly type I collagen        are more sensitive to CPT than other genes The drug either        may directly interfere with the transcription of collagen        genes or may influence signaling pathways that regulate        collagen gene expression        The role of Topo I in the initiation of transcription        has previously been shown   These previous studies        have revealed that Topo I can act as either an activator or        a repressor depending on the promoter and the presence of        other transcription factors   It has been proposed        that Topo I may be directly involved in transcription of        interstitial collagen genes   The nucleotide sequences        of these genes contain specific DNA motifs that constitute        highaffinity Topo I binding sites   Three such DNA        motifs reside within the COLA promoter   Further        studies are needed to determine whether Topo I plays a        direct role in the regulation of type I collagen        transcription        Recently a new role for CPT has been proposed   It        has been shown to activate transcription factor NFB in        various cell types including a fibroblastic cell line The        activation of NFB by CPT involves degradation of the        cytoplasmic IB by the ubiquitinproteasome pathway        Topotecan a clinically approved derivative of CPT showed        similar effects The activation of NFB by CPT may be        directly related to the mechanism of CPT COLA gene        regulation It has been shown that the inhibitory effect of        TNF on COLA gene transcription is mediated via NFB          Thus CPT may inhibit COLA by a mechanism involving        activation of NFB This hypothesis could be tested using        other DNA topoisomerase poisons known to induce NFB                 Despite significant progress towards understanding the        pathogenesis of SSc and other fibrotic diseases effective        treatment is still lacking Specific compounds that have        the potential to inhibit collagen production such as CPT        and the recently described inhibitor of geranylgeranyl        transferase I   may prove to be clinically useful in        the treatment of fibrosis                    Conclusion        In conclusion our study shows that CPT has a potent        selective inhibitory effect on collagen gene expression        however the specific molecular mechanisms of action are        presently not known and will require further study        The inhibitory effect of CPT on collagen gene expression        suggests that Topo I inhibitors may be an effective        treatment for limiting fibrosis in SSc patients
