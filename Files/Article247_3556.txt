                                 The Clintons Boomerang Politics                        Hey Brent            Nice to meet you Im a longtime reader of your work and though we dontalways agreeor because we dontIm glad to have the chance to engagedirectly            Its a nasty muggy morning where I am the worst of both seasons dark asonly fall mornings can be but still as humid as summer Even so I couldnthelp but gloat a little as I read the papers What could be more delicious thanthe flap Hillary and Bill have got themselves into over the FALN Ofcoursemaybe not of course from your point of viewI love to see them tripover their own manipulative politics Hes had more than  requests forclemency over the years and this onefor  Puerto Rican terrorists sounremorseful that they didnt even defend themselves at their trialis onlythe third hes offered But were supposed to believe it has nothing to do withHillarys Senate candidacy and the Puerto Rican voters who could help swingthat election Sure If you buy that you must still be living in the s orwhenever it was that we last took what politicians said at face value Ofcourse Clinton does this sort of thing all the time and often just asbrazenlybut here for once the public caught him at it Much moreinteresting in my view than catching him with any woman This is whatsreally wrong with his characterthe manipulator who thinks that his personalends justify just about any means no matter how unprincipled            But for me this case goes well beyond Clinton and the thing Im reallyglad to see exposed and embarrassed is the timehonored practice of a candidatepandering to an ethnic constituency Sure thats the oldest form of diversitypolitics in the books Candidates have been doing it in big American citiesfor more than a century now And sure I know the argument If was OK when theIrish were benefiting how can I object today when blacks and Hispanics do Butthe point hereand whats great is that its so obviousis that most New YorkPuerto Rican voters dont care one way or the other about the FALN Not onlyare they unsure about the terrorists causePuerto Rican independencebuttheyve never rallied around opposition politics let alone the use ofterrorist violence The people who care about the FALN are activists theleftleaning coalition that ruled New York for decades until Giuliani oustedthem six years ago They wrap themselves in the flag of ethnicity but on thisand many many other issues they dont represent anyone but other politicalactivists like themselves Of course this is hardly a new discovery and itisnt really delicious at all But its nice to see it exposed so clearly for achangenot only the fake ethnic leaders but also the folly of pandering tothem as the Clintons tried to do And now that Hillarys backed off ofcourse those socalled ethnic leaders are lashing her mercilessly But becauseshe and Bill and their party have played this ethnic game for so longandgenerally have so much invested in itthey cant even denounce herattackers            I dont knowI dont really like to gloat The more I think about the moreit all depresses me This is what we call political debate This is what passesfor democracy The only thing worse going on in the news now in my view iswhats passing for a discussion of race among the presidential candidates Butthats a whole other topicmaybe over lunch            Are you gloating over the papers today or wincing            Looking forward to hearing from you            All bestTamar
