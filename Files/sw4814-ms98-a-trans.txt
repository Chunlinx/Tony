              so interesting political trends or events huh   umhum   well i guess the uh most interesting one thats uh going on right now from my perspective is this uh phenomena of um  uh Ross Perot uh caught his interview last night with David Frost and it was the the first time i had you know heard um you know his views expressed by himself i had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in   uhhuh uhhuh   but the whole phenomena of him coming out of uh literally no where no party um at least no apparent party support on either side is pretty interesting   huh yeah i have not even heard believe it or not of that person im  not kidding when you when you said it it was kind of like a surprise   umhum like out of nowhere yeah   yeah i think mainly because i havent been watching whats politically going on um in that at you know   umhum   in that aspect uh as far as like now the new health bill that went through Minnesota uh being that it is their neighboring state and that i lived in Minnesota and more familiar with the politics that involved with that and that being passed   umhum   but um as far as politics in the grander uh part of it as if you want to look at uh election type things im not quite sure even if im going to vote uh   umhum yeah   it it gets harder and harder each time an election comes up like that to make the decision on who would be the best to run um   umhum well it seems that the decisions so far has been filtered by uh you know party politics so much that when the candidates finally get party approval party support and therefore get presented to the public   umhum sure exactly   the the candidates are already beyond what uh most public uh feels is acceptable behavior   umhum   you know the one of the common criticisms of Clinton is uh gee hell say or do anything in order to get to the White House and and up unto the point of uh Perot being a serious candidate it seems like that   sure   that was a requirement of being a a contender within the party is is to have done all those things   umhum sure   i mean heres a heres a guy who for twenty years has been working toward you know getting the party nomination and and preparing himself for the presidency and now it seems like both he and the incumbent President are you know pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of a whole nonpolitical arena   he might be a a one of those sure uh it its kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer uh when you think of some of the best presidents weve had in the past have been people that have struggled to get to the top i mean they were not rich in in any means   umhum   and it has been kind of in the past uh i dont know maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved involved with politics theyve had to have money   umhum   and you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way um   umhum   so it makes the common person uh not to say that a common person couldnt run for government and do a a fabulous job because hes got people that are quite intelligent and i dont know if well ever see that you know where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and uh has um you know you think of Abraham linking Lincoln and you know just the the background of Abraham Lincoln you know teaching himself to read he didnt go to college he didnt   umhum   you know do all the other things that um you know you would think that was real popular to do and to get politically politically involved and and have money he didnt come from money um   umhum yeah and and yet even he was a a consummate politician in the sense that uh not only did he fail uh fail in business twice with bankruptcy and and failure but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one   and now it it umhum sure umhum   and the first election first and only election he won was um the presidency       he he had lost every other office that he had you know he was appointed a couple of times to like uh  uh state legislator   so you really know a lot of his background   yeah then when then when he finally did when an election uh it was the presidency yeah   it was the big one its the one that everybody wants yeah whether or not uh you know you look at all these candidates that want to become President i really have to ask them why you know um   yeah but yeah   its the toughest job in the world to do and not only that you dont have that much freedom to make choices i mean you have to go through so many different you got to go through the House the Congress and all of the a other things to get a bill passed     umhum umhum   and sure you can veto veto it at the last minute but then its not like you have all that power and i think along time ago Presidents did have a lot of power and i think were   umhum
