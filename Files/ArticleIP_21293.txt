                                                            GratuitousMeritocracy                        It seemed too much to hope for that the list of the th centurys  greatest pieces of journalismproduced this week bythe New York University journalism department at no ones urgentrequestwould actually include The Fate of the Earth  But there it wasat No  Jonathan Schells  argument against having a nuclear war may bethe silliest book ever taken seriously by serious people  Rival claimants  See  forreaders suggestions Schell set out first to prove that nuclear war reallywould be a really really bad thing that should be avoided if at all possibleHe succeeded declaring at every stage that vast resources of courage andimagination were required to make this point He went on to argue thatvirtually all aspects of life as we know itincluding say libertyhavebecome inimical to life and must be swept away as the only hope of avoidingnuclear cataclysm At this he was less successful            You wont believechildren what a literaryintellectual event this overheated stew of theobvious and the idiotic became Many New Yorker readers actually took upSchells recommendation of nuclear monomania As long as nuclear weaponsexisted he declared to even think about anything else was deeply immoral Andmany people agreed For a few weeks            Schells manifesto is even sillier in hindsight Not somuch because of the end of the Cold War which Schell was not alone in failingto predict but because even Jonathan Schell it turns out cannot panic fulltime about nuclear war Lately hes been expressing alarm about the office ofthe independent prosecutor Threat to liberty or something like that            The Fuss Over The Fateof the Earth was the last gasp of the old New Yorker buzz machine ofthe William Shawn era The Shawn buzz machine was just as powerful as themuchcriticized Tina Brown model that came after and hypocritical to bootsince it denied its own existence Literary devices did most of the work Therewas the bullying portentous tone which said This is unbelievablyimportantso you shut up Then there was the pretense of simply presentingthe facts which put the author on a pedestal beyond the reach of quarrel andmade his or her conclusion seem inexorable            Actually the last gasp of the old New Yorker may bethis NYU list which is laughably heavy on New Yorker golden oldies Intruth the current New Yorker is a much better publication How couldanyone think that the pointless pointillism of John McPhee at No  shouldrank higher than No  a great book that happens to be by my best friendin journalism            But quarreling with anexercise like this while enjoyable misses the point Such quarreling buysinto the premise that there is something socially useful about inventingreasons to decide that some people are better than others Call it gratuitousmeritocracy I wouldnt say that the evergrowing profusion of prizes andawards and lists of the best this or that are inimical to life or anythingbut they are a minor blot on our democracy            Whats wrong with them Well of course theyrepseudoscientific or to put it another way dishonest Theres no objectivemeasure and no hope of broad general agreement that No  is superior to No though any sane person can see that No  should be much much higherThis is generally true of gratuitous meritocracy whether it takes the form ofa glossy magazines bestdressed list or a glitzy prize like the Oscar orthe Pulitzer or the employee ratings of a large corporation or the endlessvariety of hierarchical opportunities held out to children and collegestudents All of these pretend to a precision that doesnt exist But thatsnot the real problem Even if it were possible to determine scientificallywhose performance as a supporting actress last year was better than anyoneelses why should you want to do that            Human inequality is bothpart of the condition of our species and a specific necessity of thefreemarket economic system which relies on incentives and differentialrewards to motivate people Some inequality is inevitable in other words andmore of it is a price worth paying for a prosperity that benefits all to onedegree or another Looking back on the experience of the  thcentury most people have concluded that attempts to eliminate inequalitywholesale end in tears But we still argue about the relationship betweengreater equality and greater prosperity within a capitalist economy Will a taxcut have a huge productivity payoff or just line the pockets of the alreadywelltodo Will a government benefit program lift people up or just sap thepoor and sock the rich And so on            But a list of whos better than other people in some aspector another is not inevitable and does not make the economy any more prosperousor society any richer in other ways I suppose you could argue that abestdressed list encourages women to dress more beautifully or that a list ofthe greatest works of journalism of the  th century will motivatethose who didnt make it to try a bit harder during the next  years Its ahard sell though What actually inspires such lists is a love ofdistinctionmaking for its own sake which sits oddly with our allegeddemocratic principles            Of course more banalcommercial considerations are also at work as well as the Law of AwardEntropy which holds that awards tend to subdivide and multiply until they areworthless The Oscars begat the Emmys which begat the Cable Ace Awards ofwhich there are so many that any cable TV employee who actually attends theceremony is entitled to leave in a snit if he or she doesnt win oneMeanwhile on your television are the gala Bulgarian Press AssociationSyndicated Sitcom Excellence Awards hosted by Florence Henderson             In principle there is nothing tackier about an award givenby the National Association of RightWing Radio Blowhards than one given by theSwedish Royal Academy In practice awards seem to gain legitimacy with thepatina of age Pulitzer Prizes for example go to books and newspapers but notto magazines So a couple of decades ago the magazine industry created theNational Magazine Awards the prestigious Enema as occasional                  Slate                writer Mickey Kaus calls them A totally artificial andunnecessary addition to civilization And yet by relentlessly treating them asa big deal over the years magazine folks have succeeded in making them areasonably big deal Not as big a deal as the Pulitzers yet but in theballpark And yes wed like one hypocrites that we are thank you verymuch            Inevitably come now theWebby Awards given by something we are asked to believe is the International Academy ofDigital Arts and Sciences  For a medium that prides itself on itsinsurgent spirit this is a comically egregious exercise infauxestablishmentarianism But like all such operations this one traps itsvictims in a conspiracy of mutual hype They hype you by giving you an awardYou hype them by bragging about it            The folks at Lacadmie Internationale des Arts et desSciences Numriques have innovated a clever variant on this trick Theygive a separate set of awards based on how many votes your site gets in areader poll theyre running on their site As a result the Web is now litteredwith links to the Webby Peoples Voice page Why what a coincidence Heresone right here  Despite some pressrelease malarkey aboutdemocracy in action the true spirit of the Web and blah blah the connectionbetween this and any valid expression or measurement of Web popularity is aboutas close as Die internationale Akademie digitaler Knste undWissenschaften is to the National Academy of Sciences            Small type at the bottom of the home page confessesthat Laccademia Internazionale degli Arti e delle Scienze Digitali isan affiliate of IDG Conference Management Company Said company seems to havecopyrighted all the materials so I think its clear whats going on Buteveryone is pretending this is some sort of real industry honor The BBC isthrowing a cocktail party to celebrate the fact that its Web site wasnominated  And in a few years it will probably be just as real as allthe others And just as pointless            On behalf of all my colleagues at                  Slate                thank goodness we dont have the strength to resist
