                    Background        Over the past five years         in situ hybridization techniques        employing tyramide amplification reagents have been        developed and promise the potential detection of        lowsinglecopy nucleic acid sequences However the        increased sensitivity that tyramide amplification brings        about may also lead to problems of background staining that        confound data interpretation In this study factors that        allow reproducible sensitive and clean biotinyltyramide        based         in situ hybridization assay have been        investigated Formalinfixed paraffinembedded FFPE human        papillomavirus HPV positive celllines SiHa HeLa and        CaSki as well as FFPE cervical lesions preinvasive and        invasive infected with HPV have been used as model        systems In addition metaphase chromosome spreads prepared        from SiHa cells have been examined                    Materials                  Cell

contain up to  copies of HPV           integrated at multiple sites    were obtained from the          ATCC Manassas VA After culture cells were fixed with           paraformaldehydePBS and then suspended in  agar in          normal saline The plug of fixed cells was then          paraffinembedded by routine processing Slides of          paraffinembedded SiHa cells were also supplied with the

Invitrogen Carlsbad CA                            Methods and Results                  Section Preparation and Dewaxation          Sixmicrometer thick sections were floated onto slides          using autoclaved distilled water in the preparation bath          ADCELL slides Erie Scientific Company Portsmouth NH          were found to provide excellent retention of tissues          during NISH processing and were marginally better than          home prepared silane coated slides in terms of          nonspecific staining of glass Sections were baked onto          slides overnight at C Sections were dewaxed with          xylene washed with  ethanol  ethanol and           ethanol and rehydrated with sterile distilled water                          Tissue Unmasking                      NonProtease Unmasking            Five regimens were tested no pretreatment  mM            sodium citrate pH C  minutes with and            without the addition of  Triton  mM TrisHCl pH              pH    C    minutes  M sodium            thiocyanate C  minutes After dewaxation and            airdrying slides were immersed in these solutions in            Coplin jars preheated to temperature in water baths            After incubation Coplin jars were removed from the            water bath and slides immersed in sodium citrate or            TrisHCl and were allowed to sit in solution for a            further  minutes before being rinsed with water and            airdried Noninclusion of one of these steps            predisposed to background staining Cleanest results            were obtained with a sodium citrate step There was no            benefit to sensitivity of background by inclusion of            Triton which tended to result in loss of tissue from            slides Several other pretreatments regimens were not            tested These include the use of  mM EDTA pH at            hightemperature and tissue unmasking solutions            available from BioGenex DAKO Zymed and other            companies                                Protease Unmasking            Protease digestion was essential to enable target            signal detection with any of the above unmasking aids            Three proteases were tested pepsin M HCl            proteinase K  PBS and protease VIII  PBS Pepsin            M HCl digest preceded by sodium citrate treatment            yielded the cleanest and most sensitive detection of            viral and chromosomal sequences The pepsin solution            was prepared by heating  mls of  M HCl to C and            then mixing in  mg of pepsin Sigma P Sigma            St Louis MO Pepsin was allowed to dissolve for             minutes then  ml was mixed with  ml  M HCl at            room temperature C to yield a gml solution            Slides were incubated with this solution at C for             minutes fixed cell lines up to  minutes CIN            lesions The majority of FFPE pathology specimens            required  minutes digestion Slides were then rinsed            with water washed in three changes of PBS Tween             for a total of  minutes and then rinsed in water            Tissues were then immersed in methanol hydrogen            peroxide for  minutes as a precaution against            endogenous peroxidase followed by water rinses for             minutes and were then airdried The three proteases            were tested in the absence of nonprotease unmasking            steps Pepsin and proteinase K were tested with all            four nonprotease unmasking steps and protease VIII was            only tested in combination with sodium citrate            unmasking Overall tissue unmasking was found to be one            of the most critical steps for sensitive detection                                Postdigestion fixation            Including postdigestion fixation steps with             paraformaldehyde or methanolacetic acid  in the            NISH assay were investigated when pepsin or proteinase            K were used with or without sodium citrate No benefits            to sensitivity or background cleanliness were            identified                                    Hybridization                      Hybridization Mix Components            Dextran Sulfate Sigma was tested at concentrations            ranging from  to  and formamide Sigma at            concentrations ranging from  to  using pepsin            with or without sodium citrate unmasking regimen            Other proteases used were tested with  dextran            sulphate  formamide The following buffer solutions            were tested X SSC  mM NaCl  mM sodium            citrate X SSPE  mM NaCl  mM NaH              PO                mM EDTA and X STE  mM            NaCl  mM TrisHCl  mM EDTA Solutions were tested            at pH     and  using a pepsinsodium            citrate regimen Otherwise the proteases used with or            without tissue pretreatment were tested only with X            SSC pH Sonicated human placental DNA Sigma D            at a concentration of  ngl hybridization mix was            included when using an HPV probe Sonicated salmon            sperm DNA Sigma at the same concentration was            included when human sequence centromeric probes were            used A commercially available hybridization mix DAKO            S was also assessed            HPV or centromeric plasmid was labeled with biotin            by nicktranslation Invitrogen Life Technologies            Carlsbad CA Nicktranslation reactions were allowed            to progress for different lengths of time to enable the            effect of probe size to be examined Size of heat            denatured ie single strand probe fragments was            checked by agarose gel electrophoresis of denatured            probe followed by Southern transfer and demonstration            of biotin by BluGene kit Invitrogen Life            Technologies Probes were purified through            minicolumns Qiagen and tested at concentrations            ranging from  up to  ngl hybridization mix This            assessment was performed for tissues treated according            to the protocol listed in Table             Absence of dextran sulfate resulted in background            problems and at a concentration of  sensitivity was            significantly reduced The tested range of formamide            concentrations had little effect on background            staining Hybridization mixes prepared with STE            invariably gave background problems There was little            difference between SSC and SSPE buffers Hybridization            mix pH was found to be important Sensitivity was            significantly reduced at pH   Background was            significantly increased at pH   It was noted            that the pH of a X SSC solution diluted from X SSC            pH  had a pH of  and that it was preferable to            adjust pH hybridization mix buffer formamide dextran            sulfate directly Probes nicktranslated to yield            denatured fragments primarily ranging in size from             bases to  bases yielded strongest and cleanest            signals Sensitivity was significantly lowered when            singlestrand probe fragment size was predominantly            below   bases in length Probe concentration was            important for sensitivity which dropped noticeably            when the concentration was below  ngl It was not            possible to compensate for loss in sensitivity by            subsequently increasing the concentration of detection            reagents To detect the  copies of HPV  in SiHa            cells HPV probe at a concentration of  ngl was            sufficient Centromeric probes were used at  ngl            concentration                                Dirty Probes            Backgroundfree results were obtained for all            centromeric probes tested and most HPV type probes            tested However certain HPV probes such as that for            type  were consistently associated with nonspecific            background staining This problem remained despite            repeat preparation of plasmid by column extraction            Qiagen repeat nicktranslation of probe to yield            different sized fragments and repeat purifications of            labeled probe through minicolumns Qiagen or by            isopropanol precipitation This suggests the staining            is somehow related to the physical properties of the            probe sequence structure and is not due to some            unidentified contaminant However this nonspecific            staining was virtually eliminated when the commercially            supplied hybridization mix DAKO was used together            with pH controlled posthybridization washes see            below A number of other hybridization mix additives            that may benefit sensitivitybackground were not            tested These include ficoll polyvinylpyrolidone            bovine serum albumin individually or together ie            Denhardts reagent sodium dodecyl sulfate Tween             and Triton X Hybridization mix is also available            from other commercial companies such as BioGenex                                Denaturation            Hybridization mix was applied to sections and            coverslips were sealed with rubber cement Slides were            placed into Terasaki plates containing  mls X SSC            The Terasaki plates were then placed onto a  cm thick            aluminum block preheated in an oven set at C            Terasaki plates were removed after  minutes This            form of denaturation was found to be marginally more            effective than placing slides directly onto the heated            block for  minutes                                Hybridization temperature and time            Hybridization conditions and posthybridization            washes determine ISH assay stringency ie the number            of matchedmismatched sequences permitted between a            probe and its target The melting temperature             T             m is determined by a number of            factors that include temperature monovalent cation            concentration formamide pH probe fragment length GC            content and mismatched hybrids Herrington and            colleagues have specifically examined             T             m as it applies to ISH and have            defined the term tissue             T             m               T             m t having noted that the            theoretical             T             m derived from analysis of solution            kinetics did not match the empirically derived value            for             T             m in HPV ISH assays using            fulllength probes suggesting that hybridization            involving tissue sections involves additional            determinants of             T             m  After several studies                 it was concluded that the main difference between             T             m and             T             m tis probably due to the use of a            different endpoint for measurement eg a chromogenic            stain following application of intermediary reagents            rather than biochemical alteration of DNADNA            interactions measured by spectrophotometry     It            was also concluded that mismatched probe targets should            be removed using empirically derived posthybridization            washing conditions in order to achieve specificity and            that appropriate conditions should be determined by            experiment rather than calculated theoretically from             T             m  In a later study Herrington             et al    examined the ability            of ISH to discriminate HPV types using fulllength            plasmid probes It was concluded that when using a high            sensitivity system in which highcopy number infection            is present then ISH can lead to erroneous typing data            Accordingly HPV typing of lesions in the present study            was determined by PCR assay and hybridizationwash            conditions were then optimized empirically for            sensitivity and clean background using the appropriate            HPVtype probe as indicated following the PCR            Hybridizations that included sonicated human placental            DNA in the hybridization mix were tested at C and            C for  hours or overnight Highest sensitivity and            cleanest background was obtained with overnight C            incubations followed by highstringency washes see            below                                Controls            Nicktranslated biotinlabeled pUC plasmid was            used as a control for nonspecific probe binding and            HPV probes were also applied to normal cervical            tissues It was confirmed that a plasmid vector probe            did not result in hybridization signal with an            HPVpositive lesion and that HPV probe did not result            in signal with normal tissue                                    PostHybridization Washes          SSC SSPE and STE buffers at pH     and           were tested as variables of the protocol listed in          Table  After pealing away rubber cement slides were          immersed in X buffer Tween  and coverslips were          eased off slides Slides were then washed at stringency          X  X buffer Tween  at C C with or          without    formamide          As with hybridization mix wash buffer pH was an          important factor for a clean result Background tended to          occur at pH and at pH Sensitivity was reduced at           pH STE buffer gave background problems possibly          because the pH of this buffer tended to decrease as          temperature increased whereas SSC and SSPE better          retained pH The use or otherwise of formamide did not          alter backgroundstaining status HPV signal in SiHa          cells remained detectable washing in up to X SSC          Tween  at C                          Detection of Biotin                      Chromogen            Peroxidase was demonstrated using either DAB            diaminobenzidene DAKO or AEC            aminoethylcarbazole Sigma Use of AEC was of            particular benefit in avoiding nonspecific background            staining In addition the signal from AEC tended to be            more discrete than that from DAB The  copies of HPV             in SiHa cells were readily detectable using AEC            which was applied for    minutes A more intense            stain was obtained with DAB which was applied for             minutes Tissues were counterstained with hematoxylin            Punctate signals indicative of integration see            discussion were demonstrated with CaSki HeLa SiHa            and carcinoma samples Figure ABCDEF            Diffuse signals indicative of episomal HPV            diffuse and punctate or punctate signals alone            were demonstrated amongst preinvasive lesion samples            Figure ABand C These lesions were deliberately            over or underdigested There was no evidence that            punctate signals were a consequence of inadequate            tissue unmasking Punctate signal patterns in a tissue            unmasked at one set of digestion conditions continued            to be detectable as punctate signal under more severe            unmasking conditions Similarly diffuse signal patterns            did not appear as punctate when tissue was subject to            less severe unmasking conditions Aneusomic chromosome            counts were also demonstrated following assay with            centromeric probes Figure D            Comparisons of AEC and DAB on cervical tissues ISH            processed with DAKO widespectrum probe are shown in            Figures normal tissue  condylomatous lesion             CIN I  CIN II  CIN III and  squamous cell            carcinoma Figures and demonstrate normal cervix and            CIN I tissues hybridized with biotinlabeled pUC            vector Samples Figures         were            similarly processed apart from incubation with AEC or            DAB The authors prefer AEC because             Singlecopy HPV in SiHa cells is detectable            using AEC             In the authors hands DAB generally tended to            result in background staining using the optimized            protocol Table  or the protocol supplied with the            GenPoint kit Background was found to be present even            after  minute substrate incubation This staining has            a grainy appearance that could be mistaken for            punctate signals Punctatelike signals were found even            with normal cervix hybridized with HPV probe Figure            B or lesion hybridized with plasmid vector control            probe Figure B and were commonly found congregated            around nuclei circumferences and also in cytoplasm            Figures B B B B B B B B             AEC did not result in this type of staining            Leaving specimens in AEC for up to  minutes only            tended to result in a pinkish blush to tissues and not            the grainy background obtained with DAB Therefore it            was easy to interpret signals obtained using AEC as            genuine HPVrelated correlates whereas with DAB            diffuse signals were easy to interpret but the            interpretation of punctate signals was generally open            to question Occasionally nonspecific staining was            noted with AEC at the surperficial layers of normal            epithelium demonstrating parakeratosis                                    Metaphase Spreads

C before dropping cells onto slides                                    Hybridization          Slides of metaphase spreads were treated with           paraformaldehydePBS then rinsed with  glycine  PBS          PBS and water then airdried Hybridization wash and          detection conditions were then applied as above except          that chromosomes were denatured by placing slides          directly onto a heating block set at C for  min HPV           signal was not detected by staining with AEC or DAB          Detection conditions were modified to enable fluorescent          assay which successfully revealed integrated signal          Following application of primary          streptavidinperoxidase  and biotinyltyramide          streptavidinFITC Sigma S was applied at a final          concentration of  mgml diluted in PBS Tween           and incubated at room temperature with the chromosome          spreads for  minutes After staining with DAPI          chromosomes were visualized

by Geimsa          staining    and by detection of biotinlabeled HPV          probe detected with avidinFITC which enabled detection          of integrated HPV in metaphase spreads as a pinprick          signal     The SiHa cell line is aneusomic and has          been found to contain    chromosomes but to be          diploid for the acrocentric chromosome               Metaphase spreads hybridized with biotinlabeled          HPV probe detected with biotinyltyramide and          streptavidinFITC consistently demonstrated intense          signal in the central region of the long arm of an          acrocentric chromosome Figures Eand F By comparison          with previous studies     and because of the          consistency of this result it is concluded that this          signal represents the integrated HPV  on chromosome           There is no commercially available centromeric probe for          chromosome  to enable additional support for this          interpretation                            Discussion        In this study the factors that enable consistent        sensitive but background free         in situ hybridization for DNA        sequences using biotinyltyramide reagent have been        investigated Different protocols were compared and        assessed according to two criteria Firstly whether the        protocol was sufficiently sensitive to routinely detect        single copy  kb HPV in SiHa cellschromosome        spreads and secondly whether the protocol routinely gave        a clean background on archival FFPE tissues According to        these criteria a protocol has been optimized for routine        use Table  that allows detection of the  copies of        HPV  DNA integrated into the genome of SiHa cells        utilizing a chromogenic endpoint This protocol has been        successfully applied to cellline models Figures ABC        and to examine HPV infections amongst archival FFPE        cervical carcinoma Figure D and CIN lesions Figures        ABC Integration of HPV in metaphase chromosome        spreads prepared from the SiHa cellline has also been        demonstrated using a fluorescent reporter molecule Figures        Eand F        The most important factors for high sensitivity were the        use a sodium citrate step followed by the use of pepsinHCl        for tissue unmasking the use of probes at a concentration        of   ngl hybridization mix and the concentration        of primary streptavidinperoxidase That HPV DNA integrated        into metaphase chromosomes was detectable by fluorescence        but not chromogenic stains indicates an additional order of        sensitivity is possible by combination of biotinyltyramide        with reagents such as FITC        A sodium citrate tissueunmasking step was also of key        importance for the elimination of background staining AEC        was the chromogen of choice for clean background Certain        probes were more dirty than others Composition and pH of        hybridization mix and posthybridization wash buffer pH        were important in these instances        The optimized protocol was applied to archival FFPE        cervical carcinomas and CIN lesions for the detection of        HPV DNA Punctate signals were detected amongst        carcinomas and highgrade CIN lesions but were rare amongst        nonconylomatous CIN I lesions which were characterized        by diffuse signals occupying entire nuclei and detectable        in the midsuperficial layers These observations are        consistent with earlier studies that a punctate signal is        representative of integration and a diffuse signal of        episomal HPV and with the theory that integration is an        important factor in lesion progression      The data        suggest the optimized method may be useful in screening CIN        lesions for integration However further studies are        required to confirm a punctate signal is only        representative of integration The demonstration of         copies of integrated HPV DNA detected as punctate signal        begs the question as to why singlelowcopy episomal HPV is        not also detectable as punctate signal Initial infection        with HPV is understood to occur in the basal layer of the        epithelium and productive replication is tied to cell        differentiationmaturation Figure A     HPV was        not detected by the assay in basalparabasal cells of        noncondylomatous CIN I lesions   examined unless        HPV positive     suggesting lowcopy number episomal        HPV was not detectable and indicating a limit to the        sensitivity of the assay        A possible explanation maybe that that  kilobase        singlelowcopy episomal HPV sequences may be subject to        relatively more degradation and loss from tissues during        routine processing than HPV DNA that is physically        integrated into the human chromosome    megabase        pairs Excessive degradation may affect retention of DNA        sequences during         in situ hybridization assay as well        as hybridization efficiency Additionallyalternatively        the sensitivity of the assay on archival tissues may be        less than that on the SiHa cellline model despite        attempting equivalent procedures through formalinfixation        and routine paraffin embedding If this is the case then        punctate signal detected in carcinomas and highgrade CIN        lesions may only represent integration of multiple copies        of HPV at sites within the genome and lowcopy episomal        or integrated DNA may remain subthreshold on archival        FFPE samples Episomal HPV can also occur in the form of        concatamers comprising multiple copies of the HPV genome        compounded into supermolecules It can be speculated        that these forms could also give rise to punctate        signals        Centromeric probe signal was readily demonstrable using        biotinyltyramide based         in situ hybridization Figure D        Currently numerical chromosome count is generally        determined by hybridization with directly labeled        fluorescent probes This has the advantages of allowing        simultaneous assay of two or more differently labeled        probes and detection directly after posthybridization        washes The disadvantage is the requirement for specialized        microscopy visualization of tissue specimens through        multiple filters multiple image capture and the        relatively short halflife during which signal is visible        Biotinyltyramide assay has the disadvantage of requiring        several incubations to detect biotin label It has the        advantages of allowing hematoxylin counterstaining that        allows easier determination of celltissue morphology        visualization by bright field microscopy and signal that        is available for counting more than one year after test        application slides have been kept in the dark        Unequivocal signal was also demonstrated to the authors        knowledge for first time by a tyramide based assay of the         copies of HPV integrated at chromosome q        Figure Eand F on metaphase spreads prepared from SiHa        cells        There are many variables associated with tyramideISH        In this study a number of these have been systematically        examined and a sensitive backgroundfree assay has been        demonstrated In this study biotinlabeled probes and        biotinylatedtyramide were utilized Background may also be        reduced by using digoxigeninlabeled probe and        antidigoxigenin antibody conjugated with horseradish        peroxidase before the amplification step of        biotinyltyramide Dr ChaoCheng Huang personal        communication Possibly oligonucleotide probes may also        give less background than fulllength sequences        Nonbiotinbasedtyramide reagents including fluorescent        reagents are available from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and        from DAKO These reagents used in conjunction with        nonbiotinlabeled probes may be particularly beneficial        for applications on tissues where endogenous biotin is        problematic An additional level of sensitivity may be        possible on tissues using fluorescene given the finding        that HPV integrated on chromosome spreads could be        demonstrated with FITC but not AEC or DAB                    Conclusions        A biotinyltyramidebased         in situ hybridization protocol has        been optimized that allows sensitive detection of DNA        sequences in FFPE tissues and metaphase spreads The        protocol is especially robust with respect to absence of        background staining that can limit assay interpretation As        such the protocol may have clinical utility in the survey        of routine cervical samples for HPV punctate signals that        are associated with highgrade lesions Additionally the        method can be used to detect numerical chromosome        aberrations in archival pathology samples and so represents        an alternative to the use of FISH assays that require        specialized microscopy                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors Contributions        MFE conceived the study performed the
