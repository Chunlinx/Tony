                                 Grocery Store Grazer                           Please send your questions for publication to prudenceslatecom                                                         DearPrudence                                     I would appreciate your views about an experience I had recently Iwas at the supermarket buying bulk candy a confection called Hokey PokeyIts in a bin you scoop it into a bag write the bin number on the twisttieand pay for it by the pound at the checkout As I was writing the bin number onthe tie I noticed a woman politely waiting for me to finish I moved out ofthe way then sheI know you see this comingscooped up a handful of HokeyPokey and popped it in her mouth I didnt say or do anything and now I wish Ihad                                       Its irritatingenough that I and other shoppers have to cover the cost of instore snacks forher and others But I have recently become a parent and wonder how I shouldreact to this type of situation if I were with an inquisitive child Do youthink I should have said something to the woman Should I have told themanager Im interested in your opinion                                       R in St Paul Minn                        Dear R            This is one of those public issues where the actseems minor but the collective price is significant It is of course as youperceived an ethical lapse As for the questions you raise Prudie thinks youwere correct not to say anything because that would have undoubtedly led to abrouhaha in the aisleperhaps with some Hokey Pokey being lobbed It wouldalso have seemed petty to go to the manager and tattlemostly because he wouldprobably have been disinclined to approach her and say I was informed youvebeen eating the Hokey Pokey Arrests at candy bins are probably rare            Had Prudie been therein lieu of saying anything she might have made eye contact with the woman andthen raised an eyebrow the message being My dear what behavior If yourchild was old enough to witness the candy bin caper and wondered why the womanwas eating from the bin you would have been perfectly within the bounds ofpropriety to say You are quite right What the lady is doing is dishonestbut we are not in charge of other people If the transgressor were to hearthis youd be in the clear because you would not have been talking to her and she would be just as embarrassed as if you had been In sum what youwitnessed was petty thievery not someone poisoning the city water supply andno person was being harmed You did the correct thing by not trying to be apoliceman The key to the question To intervene or not to intervene isjudgment Thats what its all about            Prudie judiciously                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have a situationI have a good friend of the opposite sex who Ive known for three yearsAlthough he was initially attracted to me the feeling wasnt mutual so webecame platonic friends He even got married recently The thing is wevebecome closerand now Im attracted to him We havent had sex but a frolicor two has occurred Since Ive never thought of myself as the other womantype we are not hanging out again until this goes away His friendship isimportant to me and I take those duties seriously Do you think we can go backto being really good friends sans frolic Or does my wish to be a good friendrequire severing the relationship Help                                       Where the Hell Did This Come From                        Dear Where            It is quite likely thatyou are suffering from the GrassIsGreener Syndrome And oh to know what afrolic is The image it suggests to your steadfast adviser is of two childrendancing in a meadow  though Prudie knows this cant be what you mean Andwhen you say the friendship is on hold until this goes away what exactlyis this The wife The marriage The attraction Perhaps what needs to goaway is you that is put the kibosh on the gettogethers The electricity isnot going to diminish because most men like to  frolic If you are sincereabout being a friend you will save him from himself by keeping your distanceNot entirely unmarried men are seldom worth the trouble            Prudie definitively                                             DearPrudence                                                      Having read many cases in which you handledtricky situations very adeptly I am hoping you can help me do the same withmine I have known a good friend for several years now we are both graduatestudents within a small department and weve always gotten along very wellHowever I have noticed that there is a great turnover in her circle of friendseach year as people inevitably get dropped To compensate she always seems toturn to a new crowd usually new arrivals in the department about whom she iswild for a while until the ardor cools Several people have noticed that shepursues people to add to her collection of friends and she takes great pridein bragging about all the people she knows She is intelligent attractive andfriendly but it seems to me she turns on the extroversion to hideinsecurity                                       Having been herfriend for years and watched this happen again and again I had thought I wasimmune But alas in the last months I seem to have been increasinglyblacklisted She still refers to me as a friend but I feel I am treated quitecoldly now I hate to see this hurtful pattern continue Prudie work yourmagic                                       Newest Odd Man Out                        Dear New            OK abracadabra Clapyour hands together three times and say All right Im out of this game Thefriend sounds like the kind of person we used to call a user in juniorhigh or a narcissist in grownup psychological circles At best thissoidisant queen bee is fickle so what is there about the friendshipthat is of value Since its easier to change ones own behavior than that ofanother you might want to consider why this person is important to you Thereis perhaps an element of your having felt like the chosen onesomeone somarvelous that even a notoriously picky person could not discard you This isnot what friendship is about Prudie is sympathetic however becausenarcissistic people are often attractive The problem is that theyre not
