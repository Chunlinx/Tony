                okay um Bryan youve said you have one child right now have you had any problems with day with child care services   yes well yes uh yes in fact we have had a uh a minor problem weve we tried to use the child care facility at the tennis club that we belong to and just didnt feel that it provided the kind of quality care that that we want for our child at this point   umhum   um so it is in fact difficult to find uh quality services uh   did you utilize utilize that fulltime while you were working   no um my wife doesnt work so we were just uh planning on trying to use that as a as a break in our activity and to give her a little more free time   umhum   but the uh the the center that we went to had weve felt like uh had too many children for each counselor and so you know any any child that had any kind of problem or was just upset wasnt going to receive the kind of attention that we wanted our child to have   umhum   and uh im im sure thats thats the problem with many uh care centers like that its uh a difficult task to provide you know reasonable cost child care   what type of costs were you facing excessive or   no it was uh i think it was four dollars an hour   umhum   what i was what i was thinking of was that you know for the for the uh the sitter to be able to provide low cost care they you know they cant pay too much for the counselors and cant provide too many counselors per child   umhum   but its you know were were used to used to just uh just felt more comfortable with uh you know with more of a babysitter situation where the the child has has the full attention of someone   yeah were at a stage in our life where we dont have any kids       yeah but were approaching that point where were going to have make a decision as far as does does my wife continue to work or do i continue to work to uh   right   make ends meet and do you put child child in day care somewhere along that lines and the reality is that well probably have to have a child in day care   right   and uh been thinking about how much thats going to cost its uh rather frightening figure you really cuts into your income   yeah   uh   right   one of the things we have at our my company is uh day care reimbursement program we actually put money away into a tax free   hm   uh program um and they its youre reimbursed out of that out of that funds provided its used specifically and only for day care   right   its probably one of the few programs that ive seen uh that accomplished that   right   it it helps out a little bit       yeah but unfortunately im not you know able to tap into that until we have kids so thats down the road a little bit   right   but i do have some brothers and sisters who are struggling as as as it is right now to make ends meet and theyre also very uncomfortable with the idea of day cares but theyre forced into that situation right now   yeah its its difficult i i dont know whether well find it easier when when the child gets a little bit older say one year old when it doesnt seem quite so vulnerable to uh you know to the outside world and my my wife keeps wondering how you know how how anybody can turn the child over to uh   whats   day care and i just tell her that you know its just its not a matter of choice for most people were fortunate we we have a choice   you know most people i know who have had to make that decision the spouse usually the the mother in situations that i can think of have been in tears theyve dreaded the moment   right   for throughout most of the pregnancy knowing that theyd have to eventually go back to work and uh when the time actually came to send your child child child to day care it was basically a very traumatic moment   right   in my i see my wife nodding in the corner       as she dreads that date too i imagine   yeah   but it uh unfortunately it is a reality you just cant get by without well very few people can get by without two incomes um   yeah its  true   least especially in the early stages of a career   yeah yeah it it does make it difficult to because now our childs six months old and you know essentially my my wife hasnt been away from him from more than a few hours at a time   umhum   so that takes its uh emotional toll on her   do you find any uh that there would be any benefits to a day care such as exposure to uh unlimited basis exposure to other kids um developing social interaction   yeah we think so we we we think that is important were just not not sure at what
