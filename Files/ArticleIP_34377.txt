terror and urged Israelis to stand with Arafat in a coalition ofsane people versus the opponents of peace            Thewords coming out of the Middle East these days are as revolutionary as thedeeds Barak and his deputies are not merely changing Israels policy towardthe Palestinians They are trying to redefine and reconfigure the wholeconflict Where Netanyahu saw a struggle between Israelis and PalestiniansBarak perceives a struggle between those who support the peace process andthose who oppose it In this configuration Palestinian militants are alliesnot of the Palestinian Authority but of Israeli extremists and terrorismagainst Israel is a reason for more collaboration with Arafat not less            Israeli hawks invoking the old configuration blamed this weeks attacks onthe Palestinians in general They accused Barak of betraying Israel anddemanded that he suspend the new agreement But Baraks aides while affirmingthat no peace process shall prevail over the personal security of the peopleof Israel rejected the premise that the former threatened the latter Theydenied that peace talks were a zerosum game and they dismissed the Israelirights equation of terrorism
