                    Introduction        Progression through the mammalian cell cycle requires        that gene expression is coordinated with the activity of        cell cycle control proteins A critical period is the        transition from the G into the S phase as cells become        committed to the division cycle Binding of free EFDP        heterodimers to EF sites generally activates transcription        of proteins required for G  S transition and DNA        synthesis       whereas complex formation with        pRb or other pocket proteins including p and pRbp        silences transcriptional activities of downstream target        genes       The resulting retinoblastoma        protein RbEF interaction not only blocks        transcriptional activation by EF but also forms an active        transcriptional repressor complex at the promoter of cell        cycle genes that can block transcription by recruiting        histone deacetylase HDAC and remodeling chromatin                    Several HDAC inhibitors mediate cell growth arrest        andor differentiation     We chose to examine        the effect of HPCs which have been reported to induce        terminal differentiation andor apoptosis     in        many transformed cells Although treatment with HMBA        induces remission in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome        and acute myelogenoud leukemia it is not currently used        therapeutically because of the high dosage required        millimolar blood levels and the accompanying toxic side        effects thrombocytopenia          In this study we report a novel mechanism of cell        growth inhibition by the second generation of HPCs named        SAHA which is fold more potent than HMBA and bears at        least one hydroxamide in place of the amides in HMBA          SAHA was reported to be a histone deacetylase inhibitor and        caused accumulation of hyperacetylated histone H in murine        erythroleukemia   Very little is known about the        anticancer mechanism of SAHA in epithelial cells however        a recent study demonstrated that SAHA diet at  parts        per million ppm fed to rats reduced        methylenitrosoureninduced mammary tumor incidence by         total tumors by  and tumor volume by    In this        study we tested whether SAHA has similar potency to        inhibit cell growth in two mouse mammary epithelial cell        lines TM p wt and TMH p null We identified a        novel mechanism for SAHA in cell growth arrest through        inhibition in DNA synthesis concomitant with significant        increases in the nuclear localization of pRbp        associated with EF decreases in key molecules in DNA        synthesis EF PCNA and p and increases in histone        H and H protein and acetylation levels This study        discusses the difference in recovery from cell growth        inhibition in two mammary epithelial cell lines TM and        TMH after SAHA removal from cultures                    Materials and methods                  Development of cell lines and cell culture          The TM and TMH cell lines chosen for this study          were isolated from two different mouse mammary          hyperplastic outgrowths TM and TMH respectively as          described earlier   The parental TM outgrowth is a          moderately tumorigenic outgrowth line

media for a subsequent  days Based on the          results of these studies subsequent experiments examined          asynchronously growing TM and TMH cell lines in the          presence or absence of

Trevingen Gaithersburg MD USA and the DNA          Fragmentation Assay described elsewhere                              Results                  Effect of SAHA on TM and TMH cell proliferation          and morphology          The TM and TMH cell lines were used to investigate          whether the status of p influences the outcome of SAHA          treatment The origin of TM and TMH cell lines was          described earlier   The rate of cell proliferation          at concentrations of     and  M SAHA was          examined by  Hthymidine assay at the indicated time          points The inhibitory effect of SAHA at concentrations          of  M and higher on cell proliferation was profound          on both cell lines after  h The TM cell          proliferation continued to be inhibited during the          following  days in the presence of SAHA whereas minimal          growth in TMH cell growth on days  and  was observed          Figs A C After removing SAHA from the cultures          following  days of exposure to all SAHA concentrations          TM cells continued to be inhibited at concentrations of           M and higher during the following  days of SAHA          free cultures Fig B whereas TMH cells resumed          proliferation Fig D These results suggest that SAHA          induced a dosedependent block in DNA replication on both          cell lines A  M dose of SAHA was used in further          experiments because this concentration seems to be          unequivocally effective on cell growth inhibition on both          cell lines after  h of treatment Furthermore no          apoptotic activity was observed after  and  h of          treatment with  M SAHA in both cell lines data not          shown          The effect of SAHA on blocking cell proliferation          through blocking DNA synthesis was examined by BrdU          labeling as determined by immunofluorescence staining          Fig A and the cell cycle profile by flow cytometric          analysis Fig B The BrdU indices in the control TM          and TMH cells including all types of BrdU staining          patterns were  and  respectively indicating that          the percentage of TMH cells synthesizing DNA or in the          S phase were more than double that of TM cells Fig          A Upon  M SAHA treatment for  h  cells per          sample were counted stained with BrdU against cells          stained with DAPI and BrdU labeling indices dropped          dramatically to  and  in TM and TMH cells          respectively Furthermore the BrdU staining revealed the          size and pattern of replication clusters which are          related to the general patterns of DNA replication in          mammalian cell nuclei at early mid and late S phase            These data suggested that  M SAHA was capable of          inhibiting cell proliferation in both TM and TMH cell          lines by blocking DNA synthesis regardless of their          differences in the number of cells synthesizing DNA          These results were confirmed by flow cytometric          analysis after staining cells with BrdU for newly          synthesized DNA and with propidium iodide for DNA          content The percentages of cells in the G and S phases          in control TM cells at the time of treatment were           and  respectively and those for TMH cells were           and  respectively Fig B The number of TMH cells          growth arrested in the G phase upon SAHA treatment for           h increased by  compared with the  increase in          the TM cell line concomitant with similar differences          in the percentage of cells inhibited in the S and GM          phases Fig B This difference in G cell growth          arrest between the two cell lines may be attributed to          their differences in the initial number of cells          distributed in each cell cycle phase before          treatment          The shape and morphology of TM and TMH cells grown          on slides in the presence and absence of  M SAHA were          examined The dimensions of  randomly selected cells of          each cell line were measured using a microscope scale          The TM and TMH mammary epithelial cells measured             and    m in width and    and             m in length respectively TM cells generally had          five to seven extensions whereas TMH cells had three to          five extensions TM and TMH cells became flattened and          increased in both nuclear and cytoplasmic volume after           h of  M SAHA treatment Both cells exhibited less          distinct intracellular borders Fig  The morphology          of both cell lines was similar to cells committed to cell          differentiation however these mammary cells grown on          plastic dishes were unable to differentiate by SAHA                          Effect of SAHA on histone protein and acetylation          levels in TM and TMH cell lines          It is not known whether SAHA alters the protein          acetylation levels of various histones in the mammary          epithelial cells Changes in the acetylation or          phosphorylation of histones result in alterations that          can be visualized as changes in protein mobility on an          acidurea gel following western blot analysis             These gels separate histones on the basis of charges as          well as size resulting in multiple bands for each          histone that correspond to differently modified isoforms          These isoforms can be identified by their characteristic          mobility and by staining with antibodies specific to each          histone isoform   Protein and acetylation levels of          histone H and H isoforms on histone samples isolated          from SAHA treated and untreated TM and TMH cells          stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue Fig A and by          western blots Fig B were examined to identify the          potency of SAHA as a histone deacetylase inhibitor on          mammary epithelial cells We focused on H and H because          antibodies are available and acetylation events in those          histones have been studied These results suggested that          SAHA not only increased histone acetylation as shown in          H Fig A but also increased histone protein levels          in TM and TMH cells Fig B The increases in          protein and acetylation levels of H and H in SAHA          treated TM and TMH cell lines were indicated by the          strong staining with the acetylation specific antibodies          of H and H while the acetylated slow migrated isoforms          showed smearing due to the increases in their protein          level Fig B We did not however observe differences          in the initial acetylation levels between untreated TM          and TMH cell lines                          SAHA induced hypophosphorylation of all the three          pocket proteins          Phosphorylation of three major pocket proteins Rb          p and Rbp were examined after SAHA treatment as          each pocket protein affects the G and S phases of the          cell cycle Upon treatment with  M SAHA for  h a          profound increase in hypophosphorylation of the three          pocket proteins was observed in both TM and to a lesser          extent in TMH cells as compared with their control          counterparts judged by the faster mobility of the Rb          pocket protein isoforms on SDS gel Fig  The          difference in the level of hypophosphorylated pRb pocket          protein isoforms between the two cell lines treated with          SAHA may be attributed to differences in G and S phase          cdk activity examined in the following section Results          suggested that SAHA induced cell growth arrest through          dephosphorylation of three pRb pocket proteins which may          be related to inhibition in GS phase cdk          activities                          SAHA inhibits multiple cyclinassociated kinase          activities          There are extensive studies on the relation between          specific phosphorylation sites on pRb and its potential          transcription repression     It is well known          that pRb phosphorylation sites are recognized by specific          cdks   and that most of the  pRbphosphorylation          sites are sequentially phosphorylated throughout the cell          cycle reviewed in    SAHA treatment resulted in          G cell growth arrest in TM and TMH cell lines          concomitant with the profound increase in          dephosphorylation of the three pRb pocket proteins          Therefore we examined cyclin D E and A cdk activities          in TM and TMH cell cultures after  h treatment with          SAHA because they reflect kinase activities before          during and after the G  S checkpoint respectively The          three cyclincdk complexes directly reflect the          sequential events in DNA synthesis   The initial          levels of cyclin D E and A associated kinase activities          were   and fold higher in untreated TMH          compared with TM cells respectively Fig A B C          These results were predicted based on their differences          in cell distribution throughout the cell cycle as          appeared in the cell cycle profile analysis and may          reflect the cell line differences in known p status          Cyclin D E and A associated kinase activities decreased          by four four and fivefold respectively in TM          cells compared with control on SAHA treatment whereas          only cyclin D and A associated kinase activities          decreased  and fold respectively in SAHA          treated TMH cells compared with control Fig  These          data demonstrate that SAHA inhibits multiple cdk          activities and the degree of inhibition was more          profound in TM verses TMH cells                          Effect of SAHA on p PCNA EF and EF          proteins as a function of cell growth inhibition          The difference in the protein level of pCip          between TM and TMH cell lines was predicted based on          their differences in p status Fig A Perinuclear          localization of p was detected in only few TMH cells          p null when both cell lines were immunostained for          p whereas p was localized in both cytoplasmic and          nuclear compartments in TM cells p wt data not          shown The p expression level decreased by  in TM          cells upon SAHA treatment Fig A These results          suggest that SAHA inhibited DNA synthesis in the presence          or absence of p protein          PCNA   and EF    are two key mediators of          the G  S transition and DNA synthesis Because such          regulatory proteins can be present at different levels          and in different molecular complexes in nuclei as          compared with the cytoplasm separation of the two          cellular compartments allowed an assessment of the          sites at which these proteins exert their primary          activity unimpeded by artifacts that may result from          intermixing the two compartments In the untreated cells          the cytoplasmic PCNA protein levels in TM and TMH cell          lines were similar but the level of PCNA in the nuclear          fraction was fourfold higher in TMH cells compared with          TM cells Fig B The effect of SAHA was profound on          the nuclear PCNA fraction in both cell lines but minimal          on the cytoplasmic PCNA fraction The pronounced          difference in the levels of PCNA in growing versus          arrested cells is in accordance with the determinant role          PCNA plays in DNA synthesis             To further investigate the effect of SAHA on          inhibition of DNA synthesis we examined EF as a key          mediator for G  S transition and DNA synthesis The          initial nuclear protein level of EF in the untreated          TMH cells was fold higher compared with the TM          cell line Fig C Nuclear EF protein was completely          abolished in TM cells after  h of SAHA treatment and          decreased fold in TMH cells Fig C These results          demonstrate that SAHA treatment also inhibits EF          protein levels          It has been reported that expression of           EF gene does not change in          relation to cell growth although a modest increase can          sometimes be observed in growing cells   EF          protein levels were examined in the nuclear and          cytoplasmic fractions in both cell lines with and without          SAHA and the protein levels did not change upon SAHA          treatment in either fractions of either cell line Fig          D It is noteworthy that the mechanism of SAHA in G          cell growth arrest may target the expression of specific          proteins involved in DNA synthesis as it inhibited EF          and PCNA but not EF suggesting that SAHA may cause          different levels of histone acetylation at distinct          regions of the genome          Rbp subcellular localization and interaction with          EF was examined in both cell lines in the absence and          presence of SAHA because Rbp is an important          cytoplasmic partner of EF and is capable of inducing          nuclear localization of the complex upon cell growth          arrest and differentiation    Immunostaining          analysis using monoclonal antibody specific for pRbp          revealed that SAHA enhanced pRb p nuclear          localization in both cell lines treated with SAHA for           h compared with their controls Fig A To examine          whether the increase in hypophosphorylation of pRbp          Fig  and its nuclear localization after SAHA          treatment was associated with interaction to EF equal          amounts of nuclear protein extracts were          immunoprecipitated with antibodies against EF followed          by western blot analysis against pRbp antibodies          Interestingly the results revealed an unequivocal          increase in the nuclear pRbp protein level          associated with EF in both cell lines treated with          SAHA Fig B These intriguing results indicate that          the interaction of hypophosphorylated pRbp with          EF followed by enhancement in nuclear location after          SAHA treatment is a novel mechanism in SAHAmediating          cell growth arrest                            Discussion        In this study we present novel data on the mechanism of        SAHA in cell growth arrest on two mouse mammary epithelial        cell lines TM p wt and TMH p null SAHA was        able to increase histone H and H protein and acetylation        levels and caused a profound decrease in the protein        levels of key molecules PCNA and EF essential for DNA        synthesis Furthermore SAHA significantly enhanced the        interaction of pRbp to EF and the nuclear        localization of the pRbpEF complex SAHA also        resulted in the inhibition of GS kinase activities and        consequently hypophosphorylation of the three pRb pocket        proteins which led to G cell growth arrest and dramatic        decreases in DNA synthesis in both cell lines TM cells        continued to be inhibited for  days upon removing SAHA        after  days of treatment whereas TMH cells were able to        recover their proliferation potentials A summary of the        differences in the molecular status and cell cycle profile        between TM and TMH cell lines before SAHA treatment are        summarized in Table  These differences in p protein and        BrdU index were predicted based on p status of these two        cell lines and are in parallel with other reports on        mammary tumors where the absence of p results primarily        in greater proliferation response in the affected cell          No differences in histone H and H acetylation levels        were however observed in relation to p status between        the two cell lines It is not known at this point whether        specific mutations of p alter the degree of histone        acetylation in cells Histone acetylation and p mutation        appear not to be correlated in this study nevertheless it        is necessary and more sensitive to examine histone        acetylase and deacetylase activities in correlation to p        status        The mechanism of SAHA in blocking DNA synthesis as        demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis appeared similar        in both TM and TMH cell lines and implicated several        events First SAHA increased histones H and H protein        levels after  h of treatment which could result in cell        cycle arrest It has been reported that upregulation of        KIAA gene expression which has been implicated in        activation of histone mRNA synthesis was related to cell        cycle arrest in MCF cells after treatment with SAHA          As SAHA treatment increased histone H and H        protein and acetylation levels in both cell lines this may        have altered the association of histones with DNA thereby        altering nucleosomal conformation and stability           Local perturbations of chromatin structure can specifically        affect the accessibility andor function of transcriptional        regulatory proteins that bind DNA sequences in the region        where histone acetylation or deacetylation took place          HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A and trapoxin        modulate gene expression in either a positive negative or        neutral fashion   Ample studies have demonstrated the        implication of histone hyperacetylation in gene        transcription but also in silencing gene expression of        others            It is well known that EF regulates transcription of        genes predominantly expressed during the G  S transition        such as cyclins    cdks           EF gene   the         RB tumor suppressor gene           and genes for DNA replication and repair enzymes and        factors   It appears that SAHA has a profound        inhibitory impact on the protein levels of key molecules        EF PCNA and p essential for DNA synthesis Based on        previous reports disintegration of the cyclincdk        complexes important for DNA synthesis is correlated to        EF expression level    It is thus conceivable to        interpret that the profound inhibition in EF and PCNA        protein levels after  h of exposure to  M SAHA may        result in disintegration and deactivation of D E and A        cdk complexes which consequently leads to        hypophosphorylation of the three Rb pocket proteins It is        plausible to suggest that the inhibition in EF protein        levels by SAHA was either at the transcription level or        induction of the ubiquitinprotein ligase responsible for        EF degradation but not EF and this resulted in        blocked DNA synthesis Further work is necessary to prove        whether the effect of SAHA is at the RNA transcription        level or on stability of EF protein        The inhibition in nuclear p in SAHA treated TMH as        well as TM cells underscores that SAHAarrested cell        growth is through a pindependent pathway A recent        report indicated that the transcription of p Cipand        accumulation of acetylated histones associated with the        promoter and coding regions of that gene were induced after         h in  M SAHA and fall by  h in T bladder        carcinoma cells   Although we have utilized  M        SAHA our results are in agreement with their data on the        fall in p level after  h of treatment        A more intriguing and novel mechanism of SAHAmediated        cell growth arrest was the enhanced interaction and nuclear        localization of RbpEF complexes in both cell lines        after  h of treatment It is well documented that EF        possesses an intrinsic nuclear localization signal whereas        EF is devoid of such signal    and that the        mechanism of EF nuclear localization has been documented        to be through its interaction with Rbp pocket protein        which impedes cell cycle progression           Furthermore recent studies demonstrated that Rbp in        complexes with EF actively represses EF transcription        in cell differentiation and growth arrest and that this        complex was considered the main EF regulator during the        early G phase     Other reports suggest that Rb        recruitment of HDAC activity repressed EF           Although SAHA increases acetylation of histones H and H        it is not known whether SAHA is able to inhibit all HDAC        activities of all types of histones including HDAC or        whether the profound increase in RbpEF nuclear        complex after SAHA treatment may have an alternative        pathway other than recruitment of HDAC activity        The difference between TM p wt and TMH p null        cell cultures in response to removing  M SAHA following         or  days of treatment was significant We suggest that        it might reflect their difference in p status The TM        cells did not exhibit signs of cell proliferation or        recovery during the following  days TMH cells in        contrast recovered by  after  days of treatment        Longer treatment may be necessary to inhibit TMH p        null mammary epithelial cells as preliminary results        indicate TMH cells did not recover after  days of SAHA        treatment data not shown We suggest that the difference        in growth recovery between TM p wt and TMH p        null cell lines after  days in  M SAHA may be        attributed to two factors both related to their p        status Firstly the p in TM p wt cells might have        been acetylated upon treatment with  M SAHA for  or         days Recent studies demonstrated acetylation of p in the        Cterminal domain increased the DNAbinding capacity of the        protein     This event is obviously not present        in TMH p null Secondly although TM cells p wt        have lost  of their nuclear p during SAHA treatment        the remaining  of the nuclear p plus the continued        synthesis of p by p activity     during the        recovery period would maintain TM cells in the inhibited        state for several days without SAHA TMH cells p null        in contrast lack both negative regulatory potentials of        acetylated p and the availability of nuclear p        We conclude that the mechanisms of SAHA inhibition of        DNA synthesis and cell growth arrest at G were similar in        both TM p wt and TMH p null mouse mammary        epithelial cell lines A proposed mechanism of SAHA        stresses the involvement of pRbpEF interaction and        nuclear localization which ultimately results in cell        growth arrest and repression in nuclear EF and PCNA        protein levels and the subsequent inhibition of DNA        synthesis in both cell lines However p status was        critical in maintaining growth arrest in TM cells  days        after removing SAHA treatment whereas TMH cells p        null recovered growth arrest under the same conditions We        therefore suggest that the dose and time regimen for        histone deacetylase inhibitors such as SAHA may have to        consider the p status of breast cancers                    Abbreviations
