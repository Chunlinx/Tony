                    Introduction        Advances in transplantbased therapy for type  diabetes mellitus  and a dearth of        cadaveric pancreatic islets of Langerhans have focused interest on developing renewable        sources of transplantready isletreplacement tissues Pancreatic islets derive from        embryonic endoderm but display features of neurons including a shared set of        cellautonomous developmental regulators  Islets are the principal source of insulin in        humans but in some invertebrate species such as         Drosophila brain neurons are the main source of circulating insulin         The similarities between islet cells and neurons are further underscored by the        demonstration of insulin gene transcription in the vertebrate brain  although it        remains unclear whether these vertebrate neurons produce or secrete insulin protein         Moreover recent studies also suggest that in some settings mouse pancreatic epithelial        cells can engender neuronlike cells  These and other findings  suggest that        common ancient developmental programs may govern the differentiation of islet cells and        neurons Methods promoting neural differentiation by embryonic stem ES cells have been        adapted  to derive insulinproducing cells IPCs but it remains unclear        whether such IPCs were derived from neural progenitors or whether a neuralbased strategy        can generate transplantable human IPCs        Neural cells derive from multipotent progenitor cells and recently clonal human neural        progenitor cells that remained multipotent and karyotypically stable through at least         passages were purified by flowcytometrybased methods  The availability of human        neural progenitor cells allowed us to investigate whether inductive signals involved in        normal pathways of islet development could direct these neural progenitors to develop into        glucoseresponsive IPCs Here we describe experimental strategies for developing IPCs        directly from human neural stem cells                    Methods        All studies were performed in accordance with appropriate human participants approval        according to Stanford University Institutional Review Board guidelines                  Cell Lines and Culture Conditions          The human neurosphere NS cell lines line numbers   and  were          established following enrichment for AC           cells as previously described  although none of the cell lines          was expanded from a single cell and they are therefore not clonal The different cell          lines were from distinct donors and karyotypically normal They gave comparable results          but line  produced less insulin by stage  in our protocol than the other cell lines          Following cell thaw NSs were expanded in suspension culture and in each case were used          between passages  and  Undifferentiated human NS cells stage  were cultured

                 IPC Transplantation and Physiologic Tests          All animal studies were performed in accordance with Stanford University Animal Care          and Use Guidelines Under general

 subcapsular renal space  IPC clusters each or received a sham transplant of saline          solution Transplantation of more IPC clusters in a renal graft site was not feasible          because of the size of the clusters Two weeks after IPC cluster transplantation we          subjected mice to an overnight fast Then we measured serum human Cpeptide before and           min after intraperitoneal injection with  g of glucose per kilogram of body weight using          a human Cpeptide ELISA kit When stage  IPC clusters were transplanted tumors were not          observed  wk

were conducted to determine statistical significance                            Results                  Glucose Restriction Initiates IPC Development          Culture media with high glucose concentrations have been useful for isolating and          maintaining progenitor cell populations from the central and peripheral nervous systems           and for permitting differentiation by neurogenic cells  We routinely          expanded NS cultures in medium containing  mM glucose a level  to fold higher than          physiologic glucose concentration Isolated human neural progenitors spontaneously          aggregate in these conditions to produce a cell cluster called a NS and  of NS          cells produce the intermediary filament Nestin Figures  and  a putative marker of          neural stem and progenitor cells  Prolonged exposure to high glucose levels can also          severely reduce insulin expression in pancreatic cells  Thus we postulated that          glucose reduction might blunt neurogenic programs by NSs and promote alternate fates          including development of IPCs Therefore we switched NS culture conditions from high          glucose  mM stage  to low glucose  mM stage  see Figure A to initiate          development          To assess developmental changes resulting from glucose reduction and later culture          modifications we examined NS cell composition and expression of gene products known to          regulate or define in vivo fates of embryonic neural or islet cells A tubulin III          isoform produced in differentiating neurons was not detected in stage  cells whereas          expression of Ki an Sphaseassociated nuclear antigen was expressed in the majority          of stage  cells see Figure  Genes specifying transcription factors essential for in          vivo differentiation of lineagerestricted neural progenitors and their differentiated          progeny  including           En Hb Isl Hoxc NRSFREST and           Nkx  were expressed at low or undetectable levels in stage  see          Figure BC consistent with the reported multipotency of proliferating NSs grown in          high glucose           After  wk at stage  NSderived cells remained in clusters see Figure A but          Nestin and Ki were expressed in fewer than  of cells see Figure  indicating          possible differentiation of cells toward lineagerestricted fates Consistent with this          view we detected increased expression of           Nkx NRSFREST and tubulin III see Figures B and  We also          detected increased expression of           Neurogenin ngn see Figure C a transcription factor expressed in          differentiating neurons and required for development of pancreatic islet progenitor          cells            Nkx and           ngn expression were never observed in NS cultures maintained in  mM          glucose see Figure B data not shown These data suggest that glucose restriction          initiates developmental programs known to promote differentiation of mammalian neural and          neuroendocrine cells As shown below insulin expression in NSderived cells required          culture in lowglucose medium at stage  but we did not consistently detect insulin           cells by immunohistochemistry until stage                           RA Promotes IPC Development          RA induces development of primitive endodermal cells from a subset of embryonal          carcinoma cell lines and is an endogenous signal that directs development of posterior          organs like the pancreas from embryonic endoderm  In vivo exposure to RA is          sufficient to induce ectopic development of insulinexpressing tissue in the anterior          foregut  Moreover stage  NSderived cells expressed RA receptors including RAR          and RAR see Figure C indicating competence for RA signals To investigate whether          RA could stimulate development of NSderived cells toward an IPC fate we measured          expression of           Pdx Cdx and           FoxA transcription factors that regulate gastrointestinal organ          development            Pdx Cdx and           FoxA expression was induced in stage  when cell clusters were          allowed to adhere to precoated wells at a density of  NSscm           and cultured in lowglucose medium with  M RA for  wk see Figure          A and C We then tested other concentrations of RA and other plating densities NS          cells exposed to  nM RA at   or  NSscm           and NS cells exposed to  M RA at a plating density of  NSscm           did not express these markers or insulin at a later stage stage           Figure A data not shown Thus higher doses of RA induced markers of posterior          fate in NSderived cells a dosage response like that seen during RA patterning of          posterior gut development in vivo Moreover this response was sensitive to plating          density revealing that additional cellnonautonomous factors may regulate this          response Mesoderm develops in close association with gastrointestinal endoderm both in          vivo and in vitro  Thus detection of gut markers like           Pdx and           FoxA in NSderived cell cultures raised the possibility that          mesodermal cells might codevelop However we did not detect expression of known markers          of mesoderm formation including           brachyury flk myosin light chain and           globin at any stage in our cultures see Figure B By contrast          mesoderm development invariably accompanies endoderm development in embryoid bodies          derived from human ES cells or embryonic germ cells  In stage  cultures          Nestin and Ki expression was nearly extinguished see Figure  while expression of           En ngn and           Hb increased see Figure B and C While their numbers increased          slightly during stage  tubulin III           cells composed fewer than  of cells in NSderived clusters see          Figure  suggesting that the majority of differentiated cells had acquired nonneural          fates Consistent with this interpretation we also did not detect expression of          homeodomain proteins Hoxc or Hoxb see Figure B data not shown which are induced by          RA in spinal cord neuronal precursor cells           RA can activate signaling through the Hedgehog Hh pathway and recent studies show          that Hh signals control development of embryonic pancreatic islets in vivo  To          elucidate the mechanisms underlying RAinduced expression of markers like           FoxA and           Pdx we examined Hh signaling during IPC development We detected          expression of the Hedgehog receptors           Patched Ptc and           Smoothened Smo at all stages Figure B consistent with the          possibility that NSderived cells are competent for Hh signaling However we did not          detect NS expression of genes encoding Hh ligands like           Shh Figure B similar to previous studies  Increased           Ptc transcription is a known consequence of Shh signaling but we did          not detect changes of           Ptc expression during stages  consistent with the absence of          detectable expression of Hh ligands To test directly whether the absence of Hh signaling          was required for expression of endodermal or islet markers including           FoxA Pdx and insulin we added Shh protein to stage  cultures          which do not express           Shh or genes encoding other Hh ligands like           Desert hedgehog or           Indian hedgehog Figure C At  nM a dose used to induce          neuronal development in ES cell cultures  Shh produced a significant increase in          neurite outgrowth in NSderived cells Figure D and E see Methods and resulted in          increased           Ptc expression Figure F Moreover Shh treatment during stage           eliminated expression of           Pdx FoxA and insulin Figure F These data are reminiscent of          prior studies demonstrating that excess endodermal Shh signaling disrupts pancreas          development in vivo  Thus in contrast to the response of ES cells  RA          treatment of NSderived cells does not stimulate endogenous Hh signaling The lack of Hh          signals in NSderived cells blunts neural differentiation and permits differentiation          toward endocrinelike cell fates                          Insulin Expression by IPCs                    ngn Pdx and           Hb are essential factors for mammalian cell development  and          their expression in stage  suggested the potential for deriving IPCs Insulin expression          has not to our knowledge been reported in NSderived cells  Moderate          hyperglycemia is a potent stimulus for cell differentiation and expansion in vivo and          in utero  so we tested whether exposure of stage  cells to elevated glucose levels          could induce insulin expression Semiquantitative RTPCR measures of insulin mRNA          expression showed that exposure of cultures grown in  mM glucose at stage  to  mM          glucose at stage  induced insulin expression Figure A Growth of cells at stage  in           mM glucose followed by exposure in stages  and  to  mM glucose also resulted in          insulin expression at stage  but at lower levels By contrast no insulin was expressed          by cultures maintained in  mM glucose or  mM glucose throughout stages  Figure          A Thus reduction of glucose in stage  growth medium followed by a later increase in          glucose at stage  or  was essential for development of IPCs Insulinlike growth          factor may promote insulin secretion and prevent apoptosis of cells in vivo  and          addition of this factor at stage  reduced apoptosis approximately fold see Figure          A data not shown Nicotinamide which can stimulate in vivo pancreatic endocrine cell          differentiation  did not affect cell survival but did increase insulin Cpeptide          expression approximately  to fold data not shown Thus simultaneous exposure to          high glucose levels insulinlike growth factor and nicotinamide optimized insulin          expression at stage  Comparable results were obtained with three independently derived          NS lines          Coinciding with the onset of high insulin expression levels in mouse islets           ngn expression is virtually extinguished  while expression of           Pdx FoxA Isl and           Nkx in islet cells is maintained or increased  Similarly we          noted that IPC maturation from stage  to  was accompanied by increased insulin          expression reduced           ngn expression and increased or maintained levels of           Isl FoxA and           Pdx expression see Figure B and C Thus tissues derived from          neural progenitor cells express insulin           Pdx and           FoxA markers typically coexpressed in foregutderived tissues          Expression of these markers suggests differentiation of some neural progenitor cells          toward an endodermlike fate We were unable to detect expression of Pdx and FoxA using          immunohistochemical methods in stage  IPCs data not shown We also did not detect          expression of Nkx or islet amyloid polypeptide markers of mature pancreatic cells          see Figure C data not shown Thus the sequence of gene expression accompanying          formation of IPCs from NSs was similar but not identical to that described for          differentiating pancreatic cells and further molecular studies are required to          determine the degree of endodermlike differentiation of cells in IPCs          We detected expression of insulin protein by immunohistochemistry in  of stage           cell clusters Figure  An average of  of cells in stage  clusters were insulin            and appeared healthy with abundant cytoplasm and a welldefined          nucleus delineated by the nuclear stain AAD Figure A Of the cells composing stage           clusters  were tubulin III            none of which contained insulin Figure AC Insulin           cells showed little or no coexpression of neural stem cell markers          like Nestin see Figure  or other markers of neural lineages known to develop from          human neural progenitors like MAP differentiated neurons Figure DF Olig          multipotent precursors bipotent glial precursors and oligodendrocytes Figure JL          see  or myelin basic protein data not shown Occasional rare insulin           cells expressed detectable GFAP a marker of astrocytes Figure          GI Thus while we cannot completely rule out the possibility that some neural cell          types expressed insulin these data suggest that nearly all insulin           cells produced in stage  cultures were nonneuronal          Nuclei in insulin           cells were not stained by an antibody to Ki see Figures  and          B suggesting that insulin           cells at stage  are postmitotic like mature pancreatic cells          Immunostaining with specific antibodies revealed proinsulin and Cpeptide an internal          portion of the proinsulin translation product in the cytoplasm of all insulin           cells see Figure DG and O supporting our conclusion that          insulin protein was produced in stage  IPCs In situ hybridization with antisense          riboprobes specific for human insulin mRNA labeled  of stage  cells see Figure          HJ providing further evidence of insulin production We observed only rare insulin           cells stained by antibodies specific for activated caspase           see Figure K or TUNEL assay data not shown In stage  cell clusters we          did not consistently detect expression of glucagon see Figure L pancreatic          polypeptide or somatostatin by immunohistochemistry The absence of glucagon gene          expression in our IPC cultures was further confirmed by RTPCR data not shown Thus          like in pancreatic islets insulin was the principal hormone produced by IPCs However          the composition of IPCs was distinct from that of pancreatic islets and further studies          are required to determine the basis for this difference          To quantify insulin expression in IPCs we used a human insulin Cpeptidespecific          ELISA see Figure P By ELISA we did not detect Cpeptide in stage  or stage           culture media which contained supplementary bovine insulin Thus use of a Cpeptide          assay did not detect mediumderived bovine insulin in measures of IPC insulin content           Cpeptide levels at stages  were low or undetectable see Figure P consistent          with the lack of immunostainable insulin see Figure  in cells at these earlier stages          Similarly in cultures maintained in  mM glucose during stages  HHHH Cpeptide          levels were not detectable see Figure P In cell clusters exposed to  mM glucose in          stages  then switched to  mM glucose at stage  HLLH insulin Cpeptide levels          were  fmol per cluster and the average number of Cpeptide           cells per cluster was  Thus we estimate  fmol Cpeptide          per NSderived IPC A single cell contains approximately  fmol Cpeptide and insulin           so we calculate that insulin Cpeptide content in one stage  IPC is approximately           of the level in isolated human cells Collectively these experiments confirm that          IPCs transcribe and translate insulin and rule out that insulin measured in IPCs is          derived from medium as shown in another system                           IPCs Are Glucose Responsive          Glucokinase and glucose transporters like Glut are essential regulators of glucose          responses in pancreatic cells and expression of these regulators in stage  insulin           cells see Figures C M and N suggested that IPCs could sense          and respond to glucose To test whether IPCs respond appropriately to glucose          stimulation we measured insulin release in static batch in vitro assays We found that          IPC insulin release increased markedly following a step increase of glucose from  to           mM see Figure Q To examine whether IPCs are similarly responsive to glucose          stimulation in vivo we performed a series of IPC grafting experiments in          immunocompromised recipient mice Two weeks following engraftment  IPCcontaining          clustersmouse recipient mice and shamtransplanted controls were fasted overnight and          human Cpeptide levels measured Human Cpeptide was undetectable in mouse sera prior to          glucose challenge or following glucose challenge of shamtransplanted controls see          Figure R In contrast  min after intraperitoneal glucose challenge of IPC recipients          we detected    pmoll human Cpeptide           p   approximately  of serum Cpeptide levels observed          following engraftment of  human islet equivalents in a prior study  Thus IPCs          respond to glucose challenge in vivo by releasing insulin Cpeptide Analysis of IPC          graft sites  wk after transplantation revealed nests of transplanted cells without          obvious tumor formation Histologic analysis and immunohistochemical detection revealed          that Cpeptideexpressing cells persisted in the graft site see Figure S and T Thus          engrafted IPCs remained differentiated and survived up to a month following          transplantation                            Discussion        There is widespread interest in developing tissue replacement strategies for treatment        of human disorders like diabetes mellitus and Parkinson disease While much attention has        been focused on the promise of ES cells for tissue replacement recent work suggests that        neural stem cells like ES cells may have an unusually broad differentiation potential        For example Gage and colleagues demonstrated the conversion of mouse neural stem cells to        the endothelial lineage indicating that plasticity is a bona fide property of cultured        neural stem cells  These results were also unexpected because endothelial cells and        neuronal cells normally derive respectively from mesoderm and ectoderm distinct        embryonic germ layers Here we show that human neural stem cells have a similarly broad        differentiation potential and that specific in vitro culture conditions can divert neural        stemderived cells from neural lineages toward a fate with endocrine and endodermal        characteristics        Our study shows that application of endogenous signals governing pancreas development to        human neural progenitor cells can generate glucoseresponsive IPCs Systematic variation of        the identity concentration and sequence of these signals led to discovery of methods        culminating in IPC formation However there are limitations to our findings that should be        noted First our molecular analysis of differentiating IPCs showed that they remain        distinct from mature pancreatic islet cells in other words the insulin         cells derived by our methods are not mature cells For example        reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed that IPCs were enriched for a        combination of gene products that approximate those expressed in developing pancreatic        islet cells However the temporal sequence of expression of some of these products like        glucokinase Glut and Pdx does not precisely recapitulate that observed in the        embryonic pancreas reviewed in  and transcription of other genes typically expressed        in cells like         Nkx was not detected in later stage IPCs see Figure  Thus the        insulin         cells derived in this study are not bona fide cells Further        experimentation may elucidate the basis for these differences revealing the extent of        neural progenitor cell development toward an endocrine cell fate Recent studies suggest        that neural cells can be derived from adult pancreatic epithelium  adding to a        growing body of data demonstrating numerous similarities in neural and pancreatic endocrine        development reviewed in  In light of these similarities we speculate that methods        leading to the production of cell factors like Nkx in stage  clusters may enhance the        celllike qualities of neuralprogenitorderived insulin         cells and thereby permit differentiation of tissues that more closely        resemble endodermderived islet cells Second our immunohistochemical analysis shows that        stage  insulinexpressing cells do not express markers like Nestin tubulin III MAP        or Olig suggesting that these insulin         cells are nonneuronal but we cannot formally rule out the alternate        possibility that our methods produced neural cells capable of secreting insulin Third we        have not demonstrated fully that the stimulussecretion coupling apparatus in IPCs is        similar to that in pancreatic islets While insulin release by IPCs produced here appears        to be glucosesensitive both in vitro and in vivo future work should elaborate whether        IPC insulin is stored in densecore secretory vesicles and whether secretogogues or        secretion potentiators other than glucose like amino acids or sulfonylureas stimulate        insulin release by IPCs like in pancreatic islets Lastly we have not ameliorated glucose        regulation in diabetic animal models with the human IPCs described here Serum levels of        insulin Cpeptide expression achieved following IPC transplantation in glucosechallenged        mice were less than  of normal see Figure  Thus we did not attempt IPC        transplantations in overtly diabetic animals since prior studies suggest that insulin        production at  of normal or greater may be required to improve glucose regulation in        diabetic patients and animal models  Additional studies to test the impact of        transplanted IPCs in animal models of diabetes therefore await production of IPCs capable        of insulin secretion at levels higher than achieved here        Nevertheless compared to other methods for IPC development from human stem cells         our methods produced insulin at the highest levels yet achieved from an        expandable human stemcellderived tissue Multiple experimental approaches were taken to        demonstrate that these IPCs transcribe translate and secrete insulin and to rule out the        possibility that insulin measured in IPCs derived from the culture media In vitro studies        demonstrate that IPCs release insulin in a glucoseresponsive manner like islets        Moreover IPCs transplanted into mice remained differentiated and released circulating        human insulin in a glucosedependent manner Thus for the first time we demonstrate        moderately efficient production of glucoseresponsive IPCs from an expandable population of        human stem cells Current islet transplantation methods require an estimated            to          cells per recipient  From          cells at stage  we produced an average of  clusters with        approximately  cells per cluster approximately  of these cells are Cpeptide         and release  of Cpeptide secreted by cells Based strictly        on these yields we would need to expand IPC production approximately          fold to meet the need for one transplantation Undifferentiated NSs        can be readily expanded through at least a dozen passages  suggesting sufficient cell        numbers could be generated to scale up this protocol for transplantbased therapies        We did not exhaust all possible factor combinations in our study we speculate that        further method refinements may improve the efficiency of NS conversion into IPCs as well        as IPC insulin synthesis and stimulussecretion coupling the hallmark functions of mature        cells If so then human neural stem cells may serve as a valuable model for elucidating        the mechanisms and factors that regulate neuroendocrine cell differentiation For instance        addition of glucagonlike peptide TGF ligands or other factors that potentiate cell        maturation growth and insulin secretion  may improve the methods described        here Because our method is based solely on extracellular factor modulation in the absence        of genetic manipulations it could serve as the basis for developing replacement islets        from a wide range of human stem cells including neural stem cells and ES cells                    Supporting Information                  Accession Numbers          The National Center for Biotechnology Information
