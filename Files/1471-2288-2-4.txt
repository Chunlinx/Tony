                    Background        Most current methods of cancer early detection such as        mammography or cervical cytology are based on anatomic        changes in tissues or morphologic changes in cells        Recently various molecular markers such as protein or        genetic changes have been proposed for cancer early        detection        This has spurred many investigators        with longterm cohort studies to serially collect and store        blood or tissue specimens The aim is to later perform a        nestedcase control study where specimens from subjects        with a particular type of cancer cases and specimens from        a random sample of subjects without the cancer controls        are tested for various molecular markers Sometime this        sort of study is called a retrospective longitudinal study           although retrospective longitudinal data could arise        in other ways as well Unlike crosssectional study        designs the markers are measured on specimens collected        well before the onset of clinical disease in cases This        avoids the potential confounding effect of the target        disease on the marker        For example in the ATBC alphatocopherol        betacarotene    and CARET    studies subjects were        randomized to placebo or drug to in a longterm study to        determine the effect of the drug on lung cancer mortality        During the course of the trial serum was serially collected        and stored in a biorepository In a subsequent nested        casecontrol study stored serum samples from all cases of        prostate cancer and a random sample of controls were tested        for prostatespecific antigen PSA        Importantly the nested casecontrol study of early        detection biomarkers may be distinct from the original        longterm study from which serum were collected It is        designed to answer a different question it typically        studies subjects with a different disease and it often        ignores the intervention in the original longterm        study                    Methods        We had three considerations in formulating appropriate        guidelines First we wanted to link the analysis to the        goal of study namely to help decide on further study of        the biomarker as a trigger for early intervention Second        we wanted to minimize possible biases in the selection of        cases and the controls and in the investigation of many        markers Third we wanted to extract as much information as        possible relevant to the evaluation                    Results        We offer the following guidelines for the design and        analysis of nested casecontrol studies of early detection        cancer biomarkers                   For the clearest interpretation          statistics for binary markers should be based on true and          false positive rates or predictive values based on the          true prevalence  not odds ratios relative risks or          predictive values based on the prevalence in the          study                 A promising marker should have a high degree of accuracy        in discriminating between subjects who are likely to get        cancer from those who are not For a binary marker which        is either positive or negative the basic measures of this        type of accuracy are the true positive and false positive        rates Consider the hypothetical data in the Table from a        nested casecontrol study of early detection biomarkers        The true positive rate TPR or the test sensitivity is        the probability the marker is positive given cancer The        false positive rate FPR or   specificity is the        probability the marker is positive given no cancer In        Table  TPR is estimated by    and FPR is        estimated by    For a perfect test TPR   and        the FPR   There is always a tradeoff between the TPR and        FPR so it is meaningless to assess one without assessing        the other For example one could make the TPR equal to         simply by classifying every subject as positive for cancer        But this would be a poor classification rule because the        FPR would also be                   Guidelines for FPR and TPR                 Because the underlying prevalence of cancer is so low in        average risk populations for acceptable cancer screening        of asymptomatic people the FPR should be very small            As a starting point we recommend basing guidelines for        FPR and TPR on the FPR and TPR for mammography which as        discussed below is FPR and TPR A mammogram is        analogous to a biomarker test for cancer but there is extra        information from various studies that makes it useful for        setting guidelines        One reason for using FPR and TPR from mammography as a        standard is that unlike biomarker measurements in nested        casecontrol studies in mammography studies there is a        biopsy at the time of a positive test This biopsy is the        gold standard for determining cancer status in subjects        with positive mammograms and is used for computing TPR in a        way not possible with biomarkers in nested casecontrol        studies The TPR for mammography is the probability of a        positive biopsy as a direct result of mammography in women        with cancer and is estimated via mathematical models or        data collected after following subjects not biopsied As        discussed in Baker and Pinsky     estimates ranged        from  to  with  a conservative value        Importantly the estimated TPR for mammography is not        likely to be affected by overdiagnosis which means that        some screeningdetected cancers would never have caused        medical problems during the patients life     This        would make the biomarker appear more promising than        actually the case Results from the HIP screening trial of        mammography and clinical selfexamination    suggest        that if there were overdiagnosis with mammography it would        be relatively small At the time of the last breast        screening in the HIP trial there were more cancers in the        group randomized to screening than in the controls But        with further followup the number of cancers in the control        group eventually equaled the number in the screened group        which would not have occurred if there were substantial        overdiagnosis        A second reason for using FPR and TPR from mammography        is that based on various randomized trials with cancer        mortality endpoint mammography is generally considered an        acceptable screening modality The implication is that a        similar FPR and TPR for a biomarker would lead to an        acceptable screening modality For a particular biomarker        these target values of FPR and TPR from mammography may        need modification depending on various factors One factor        is the invasiveness of a followup procedure to investigate        a positive test eg needle biopsy of the prostate to        investigate an abnormal PSA versus laparotomy to        investigate an abnormal CA The more invasive the        followup procedure the lower the FPR must be to gain        acceptance in practice A second factor is additional        workup prior to a biopsy If a positive biomarker is        unlikely to trigger additional diagnostic workups prior to        biopsy a higher FPR might be acceptable        One caveat when using FPR from mammography is to be        careful as to its definition The restricted definition is        the probability of a positive biopsy as a direct result of        mammography in women without cancer The less restricted        definition is the probability of a suspicious mammogram        warranting additional diagnostic followup of any type in        women without cancer Typically nestedcase control studies        of early detection biomarkers do not provide information on        additional diagnostic followup Therefore they cannot be        used to estimate a less restricted FPR involving diagnostic        followup However because nested casecontrol biomarker        studies provide data on cancer diagnosis they can be used        to estimate a more restricted FPR based on unnecessary        biopsies Therefore the target FPR is based on the more        restricted definition of FPR in mammography For        mammography the more restricted FPR is estimated by the        fraction of women screened by mammography who received a        biopsy in which no cancer was detected As discussed in        Baker and Pinsky     estimates of FPR from three        studies ranged from  to  with a middle value of        around                   Inappropriateness of odds ratio and          relative risk                 When evaluating binary early detection markers it is        inappropriate to report an odds ratio or relative risk as        is common in epidemiology or clinical trials Because an        odds ratio or relative risk is a single number it does not        capture the tradeoff between correctly classifying cancer        and incorrectly classifying noncancers Also the odds        ratio or relative risk can lead to an overoptimistic        impression of the performance of an early detection test if        the interpretation is based on experience in epidemiology        or clinical trials In the latter settings an odds ratio of         is often considered large Much larger odds ratio are        needed from early detection tests for useful application in        the screening setting     For example for the target        values of FPR   and TPR   the odds ratio equals        TPR  FPR TPR  FPR   as in Table                   Appropriate computation of predictive          values                 It is sometimes useful to use the FPR and TPR to compute        the predictive value negative PVN the probability of no        disease if the marker is negative and the predictive value        positive PVP the probability of disease if the marker is        positive For cancer screening it is the PVP that is most        important to the physician in clinical decisionmaking        Because the likelihood of any individual cancer type in an        asymptomatic person is nearly always very low a negative        early detection test usually adds little information to the        clinical impression The computation of the PVN and PVP        depend on the prevalence of cancer as well as on the FPR        and the TPR as shown below        PVP  TPR  prevalence  TPR  prevalence  FPR        prevalence        PVN  FPR  prevalence  TPR  prevalence         FPR prevalence        When the prevalence is small as with cancer screening        a small absolute change in FPR but not TPR can have a        large impact on the PVP It is erroneous to directly        compute the prevalence from data in the nested casecontrol        study as in Table  because the ratio of cases to        controls in the study is not the same as in the population        For example suppose FPR   TPR   and prevalence          We obtain        PVP                    PVN                      If we had incorrectly substituted the apparent        prevalence in Table of    we would have        incorrectly computed PVP   and PVN   For this        reason calculation and reporting of PVP and PVN using only        data from a nested casecontrol study is not useful or        appropriate                  Extension to ordered categories via ROC          curves                 Many markers for the early detection of cancer can be        reported as ordered categories Some markers such as        sputum cytology inherently involve ordered categories        such as no evidence of cancer slight atypia moderate        atypia severe atypia and frank cancer Other markers        such as PSA involve a continuous measure for which higher        values indicate a greater probability of cancer Dividing        these continuous measures into ranges either based on        predetermined values or percentiles gives ordered        categories        With ordered categories the statistics should still be        based on FPR and TPR Each ordered category is a possible        cutpoint where values equal to or higher than the cutpoint        are called positive and values lower than the cutpoint are        called negative For each cutpoint one can compute FPR and        TPR Table  and generate a receiveroperating        characteristic ROC curve which is a plot of TPR versus        FPR for the various pairs     See Figure  The        higher and farther left the points on the ROC curve the        better the test performance As mentioned previously        acceptable cancer screening requires very small false        positive rates Therefore for evaluating cancer        biomarkers we are only interested in the leftmost sliver        of the ROC curve in Figure                    To avoid overdiagnosis bias cases          should be diagnosed as a result of symptoms rather than          on screening                 For the TPR in the biomarker study to reflect the true        TPR cases should be diagnosed as a result of symptoms        rather than on screening For example in the study of PSA        in the ATBC trial     cases were subjects diagnosed        with prostate cancer as a result of symptoms If the        prostate cancer cases were detected as the result of        screening say with ultrasound the TPR could be        artificially elevated if there were overdiagnosis as        previously discussed                   To minimized selection bias the          spectrum of control conditions should be the same in          study and target screening populations                 For the FPR in the nested casecontrol study to reflect        the true FPR in the target population the spectrum of        control conditions should be the same as in the target        population By control conditions we mean characteristics        of the population such as the presence of other diseases        or certain known risk factors that could elevate the false        positive rate        The spectrum of conditions could differ considerably if        the retrospective biomarker study were embedded in a        randomized trial with strict eligibility requirements For        example consider a biomarker for the early detection of        lung cancer where the data comes from a biorepository        arising from a randomized trial of healthy subjects It        would be inappropriate to apply the results to a population        with a high prevalence of chronic obstructive lung disease        bronchitis or viral pnuemonitis because these conditions        could increase the number of positive readings in subjects        without lung cancer Because FPR is very small for        screening to be acceptable this spectrum bias could have        important consequences in a clinical application        It would not always be possible to identify all relevant        control conditions but to the extent possible the control        conditions should be similar in both populations                   To extract additional information          criteria for a positive test should be based on          combinations of individual markers and changes in marker          levels over time                 Data from multiple markers present an opportunity to        extract potentially valuable information not available by        analyzing markers separately Consider the hypothetical        data in Table  The left side corresponds to subjects        without cancer and the right corresponds to subjects with        cancer In our idealized circumstance markers A and B are        independent for subjects without cancer and are perfectly        correlated for subjects with cancer The indicated region        for A   or A   and B   or B   designates a positive        test that has FPR   and the TPR   Suppose that        marker A and marker B were evaluated separately The        indicated region corresponding to A only namely A   or A          and the indicated region corresponding to B only        namely B   and B   each designates a positive test        that has FPR  and TPR  Thus in this particular        example the combination of markers leads to a much better        test than the separate markers with a smaller FPR         versus  for the same TPR of  One could create a        similar example with any number of marker levels For an        ideal test in which FPR   and TPR   the region would        encompass all subjects with cancer but no subjects without        cancer        A real application of how marker combinations provide        extra information comes from a recent study by Mok et al           on CA and Prostasin as markers for ovarian cancer        Although the data are not from a nested casecontrol study        and have not been validated in subsequent studies they are        useful for illustration Based on Figure  of Mok et al           with approximate values for the outpoints we        investigated regions with FPR The combination for a        positive test of CA  greater than or equal to  Uml        and Prostasin greater than or equal to  gml had FPR          and TPR   Evaluating CA  alone the criterion        for a positive test of CA  greater than  Uml had        FPR and TPR  Evaluating Prostasin alone the        criterion for a positive test of Prostasin greater than         gml had FPR  and TPR  Thus in this real        example the combination of markers led to a better test        than the separate markers with a larger TPR  versus         or  for the same FPR of         To more generally compare performance of a combination        of markers with a single marker we need to compare ROC        curves Creating an ROC curve from a combination of markers        is different from creating an ROC curve from a single        marker With a combination of markers the number of        possible regions as in Table a for calling a marker        positive is extremely large Some choices of regions        correspond to AND rules for example A and B as        in Table a Some choices of regions correspond to OR        rules for example A or B Other choices are also        possible but for biological reasons one would usually        require all regions to be contiguous A plot of the FPR and        TPR for each region would lead to a cloud of points rather        than the smooth curve in Figure  To create the best ROC        curve one should select those points that are highest and        farthest to the left which is generally all that would        need to be presented and only for small false positive        rates For complicated situations Baker    proposed an        algorithm to select the regions creating the best ROC curve        without the need to enumerate all the regions        Mathematically in any sample of data the best ROC curve        for a combination of markers must be as good or better than        the ROC curve for any of the markers evaluated separately        The reason is that the set of possible regions for calling        a combination of markers positive includes as a special        case the regions for calling any single marker        positive        Alternative approaches that do not directly optimize the        ROC curve include linear logistic regression or linear        discriminant analysis     which choose regions based        on linear combinations of the markers and neural networks            which choose regions in a very complicated        nonlinear manner Due to the potential for overfitting to        follow it is not possible to make a blanket statement as        to which approach for choosing regions is best If one        takes the set of regions for calling a combination positive        that gives a good ROC curve in a random sample of data it        may give a poor ROC curve in another random sample of the        data simply due to selecting chance patterns in the first        sample As discussed in the section on overfitting this        motivates splitting the data into two random samples        training and test and using the regions from the training        sample to compute the definitive ROC curve based on data in        the test sample        Changes in marker values over time also provide        potentially valuable information not available when        examining markers at a single time point With marker        measurements at two different times per subject and        approximately the same interval between times a common        summary measure is the slope If investigators believe that        both slope and baseline level predict cancer the        combination can be evaluated using the previously discussed        methods for evaluating multiple markers namely treating        baseline level and slope as two separate markers With        measurements at more than two times per subject        investigators may identify a more complicated feature such        as whether or not there is a sudden increase in marker        levels            When biomarker measurements occur at regular time        intervals and allowing different numbers of measurements        for each subject one can estimate TPR and FPR by using a        first order Markov chain in reverse time as described by        Baker and Tockman    for the analysis of precancerous        lesions for lung cancer                   To avoid overfitting the criteria for          a positive marker combination developed in a training          sample should be evaluated in a random test sample from          the same study and if possible a validation sample from          another study                 With a single marker and a large number of subjects        there is usually no concern with overfitting However with        many combinations of markers overfitting could invalidate        results Overfitting is often associated with stepwise        regression models    but it can occur in other        situations as well Overfitting of a larger number of        markers to a relatively small number of subjects produces a        model that is overly sensitive to chance fluctuations in        the data As a simple example overfitting occurs when a        sports announcer reports that a baseball player had a very        high batting average against lefthanded pitchers in        ballpark X over the past month This average is not very        reliable for future predictions because the particular set        of factors lefthanded pitchers and ballpark X were        selected to give a high average In reality the high        average is more likely the result of chance factors that        coincided with left handed pitchers at ballpark X during        that particular month One way to adjust for overfitting is        to apply the factors in another sample not used for initial        reporting The first sample is known as the training        sample and the second sample is known as the test sample        For example the prediction of the average against left        handed pitchers in the ballpark X could be tested on data        from a different month Similarly a standard statistical        approach to adjust for overfitting is to randomly split the        data into a training and test samples This is called the        splitsample approach Promising marker combinations are        identified in the training sample but more reliable FPR        and TPR measurements are made in the test sample because it        involves different data Baker    used the splitsample        approach to evaluate the performance of four markers for        prostate cancer        More sophisticated adjustments for overfitting include        crossvalidation and bootstrapping Suppose the interest        lies in a single statistic such as the area under the part        of the ROC curve corresponding to a small FPR In a typical        crossvalidation analysis i the data are randomly split        into ten samples each with  of the data ii one of the         samples is deleted iii the statistic is computed by        applying the classification rule recalculated from the        remaining  of the sample to the deleted  sample and        iv an average is taken of the statistic over all ten         samples     Although one could use a different        fraction than  ROC computation it is not possible with        the most extreme version of crossvalidation that involves        leaving out one subject at a time With bootstrapping i        the entire data set is resampled with replacement many        times ii on each resampling the statistics is computed        and iii the statistics from each resampling are combined        in a special way     In a recent study comparing these        adjustments with other types of statistics in a different        setting Steyerberg et al    found that the        splitsample approach tended to underestimate performance        crossvalidation performed poorly on some statistics that        were not normally distributed and bootstrapping performed        best overall For our purposes of estimating an entire ROC        curve rather than a summary statistic more research is        needed for crossvalidation and bootstrapping as it is not        clear how best to combine ROC curves over different        samples        Regardless of the method used to adjust for overfitting        in forming a classification rule to obtain the most        reliable FPR and TPR measurements the classification rule        should ideally be evaluated in a         validation sample from a         different study as in Baker                              To identify biomarkers with true and          false positive rates similar to mammography the          training test and validation samples should each          include at least  randomly selected subjects without          cancer and  subjects with cancer as based on FPR and          TPR for mammography                 The sample size is based on the need to determine if the        biomarker is sufficiently promising for investigation as a        trigger for early intervention in a future trial As        discussed previously based on considerations from        mammography our target values are FPR   and TPR         In most situations we think it would be of interest to        specify a  confidence interval for TPR of          Using a normal approximation the target standard error is        approximately  Setting the standard error of TPR TPR         TPR  square root of n equal to  and solving for        the sample size n we obtain n  which we round up to         In addition we think that in most situations the        largest reasonable value of FPR would be  which is         times the number of false positives as with mammography        screening Because FPR is so small we do not use a normal        approximation We specify a sample size of n   so that        under the binomial distribution with FPR the upper         bound equals    Strictly these sample sizes        apply only after a single criterion for a positive test has        been identified For a training sample one might consider        larger sample sizes                    Conclusion        A major advantage of nested casecontrol studies for        early detection biomarkers is that they can be done quickly        if serum from a longterm study has been stored in a        biorepository Importantly the retrospective aspect does        not compromise the validity There are none of the usual        problems with retrospective studies such as recall bias        Thus we anticipate that in the coming years there will be        many reports in literature from studies of this design        These guidelines should greatly help investigators        design and analyze nested casecontrol studies for early        detection biomarkers and help readers of the literature to        interpret them It bears emphasis that these studies do not        prove clinical efficacy of the markers Rather they        suggest which markers or marker combinations are the most        promising candidates for further study as a trigger for        early
