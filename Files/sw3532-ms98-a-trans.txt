                 okay you know what happens is ive tried i was out because of surgery last week so i tried calling a couple of eight oclock calls and i got a person from Utah and a person from New York and a person from New Jersey so i thought sort of need her calling really early in the morning   early in the morning and you got somebody from Dallas uh well im from Mesquite   out of town so  thats why thats why ive been making been making it a habit of calling in the morning   umhum   but anyway uh the topic was the most important benefit of your job today besides salary and how satisfied are you and everything im sort of selfemployed so uh i   umhum umhum well i am too for the first time in my life umhum   really id be at a a little loss for words on this as far as im concerned most definitely uh most important benefit today would be hospitalization and of course retirement and things like that   umhum well ive worked for a large Fortune  company before and have had the luxury of uh benefits and um at a very  small cost and uh  then got out on my own through no fault of my own i was with Safeway and they left the country  or left the um north part of the state   uhhuh   and uh i find myself in the insurance industry and i am finding i although i dont sell group insurance or major medical i sell supplemental health im finding that every place i go to talk to them about my product its theyre in such a dilemma about um the major medical group market right now its just not very desirable um     well thats very true i can understand that because im a just a small business person i run a my company has five people but uh theyre all straight commission salesmen so they all provide their own   umhum   insurance and its been that way since nineteen seventy four and my office is just a one person office i have myself plus my secretary and she comes in at nine leaves at five and uh   umhum   shes on her husbands insurance program and i just uh   so youre fortunate in that manner   yes   well um i think some of the benefits that are being made available nowadays like the K to the employees   yes   um is beneficial i was not a participant or that was not available when i was employed but uh i did participate in a stock program and uh   oh thats great   and that really worked out well for me when i had been with the company for thirteen years and now have a a you know a small retirement set aside which is allows me to go on commission sales and um and do it you know comfortably   oh thats neat are you married   uh no im not   okay well im married and my wifes a school teacher so im on her they have pretty good insurance so i they she carries me on her insurance program which works out real well   they really do what uh school district is she in   shes in the Plano School District in Plano   umhum   and its not cheap its like all insurance insurance just keeps on going up more and more every day and course the uh the prices theyre charging today and because of the problems they have   exactly and the deductibles are going up and that   oh deductibles are high   umhum thats one of the reasons my um the what my product is just getting more and more popular because its a catastrophic cancer insurance intensive care and a daily hospital indemnity and so those kinds of things not only help a person um cover um their deductibles it helps you know pay the rent and or the mortgage and they and the car payments when uh that person has to be off with something like cancer or heart attack   oh you bet supplemental anything is important today ill tell you whether   exactly and im i real feel real fortunate that ive landed in a with a really good company in a good position   well thats great   and theyre really nice too one of the benefits of that company is that they provide me with some stock um they give it to me uh three point five percent of what i sell and um uh annualized premium and so this is really going to add up through the years ive been doing this over a year and have already accumulated quite a bit   well thats super     so   were just uh i carry my own Keogh Plan as far as benefits and ive been doing that since nineteen seventy four or seventy five or whatever and   umhum   thats more or less my wifes and my retirement im fifty years old my wife is forty nine and she didnt start teaching till she was forty so   umhum umhum   we raised our kids first and she went back and got her degree and started teaching so it looks like were gonna retire in a couple of years and shell uh shell qualify for a little something after ten years of teaching but not a whole lot but itll be   umhum umhum   certainly be useful and needed   right what kind of business are you in   im in the sporting goods business im a own a manufacturers rep firm and uh we we represent eighteen different hunting and shooting type companies and thats all ive done since   i see umhum   i graduated school years ago sold a sold   is that right well its the first time ive been in sales in my life uhhuh   really oh its neat isnt it   i love it i love it i shouldve been there a long time ago   oh yes
