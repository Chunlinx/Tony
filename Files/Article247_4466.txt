                                 The Sporting Life and Real Life                        Hi Chris            Read your lament about Derrick Thomas the Kansas City linebacker who wasleft paralyzed yesterday in a car accident and I felt the same pang you didwhen I saw the news this morning that hed been hurt I did have the pleasureof interviewing Thomas in the past and the memory of his smile is whatshaunting me todaythat smile and the mischievous light that always shone inThomas eyes even though he had to deal with another numbing tragedy beforethis Remember Thomas father died in a jet fighter crash a couple of decadesago when Derrick was only a few years old Now this            Im sure Thomas will be remembered in Atlanta this week at the Super Bowlespecially today as the reporters descend on the players and coaches for areaction But I think we both know when reality intrudes in sports the peoplein sports tend to retreat even deeper into the games they play And they cantwait for the games to resume            To be sure theres always some sad talk about the infinity of possibilitiesthat are lost when something like this happens or when some similar tragedycomes along Theres been a spate of them recently hasnt there How aboutthat driveby shooting that Rae Carruth the exCarolina Panthers wide receiverwas recently charged with after his girlfriend was shot and died How aboutthat car crash that claimed Bobby Phills life after he and a Charlotte Hornetsteammate David Wesley were drag racing in their Porsches down a city streetafter practice The police guessed Phills was travelling  miles per hourbefore his car spun out of control            John Rocker the bigmouth Atlanta Braves pitcher had a ride atop theheadlines a few weeks ago after he insulted nearly every minority group thiscountry harbors But sports being sports Ill bet the buzz about MichaelJordans return to basketball as part owner of the Washington Wizards will lastfar longer and generate reams more copywhich again isnt surprising            Ive always thought that people flock to sports because the people who playthem simultaneously defy and define the limits of what human beings canachieve You never think someone can throw as hard as Rocker or hang in the airas long as Jordan until they come along and prove it And not only thattheycan summon such magic consistently And on command Thats whats sotransfixing Its like all of us not just the athletes need to see someonewhos fearless and acts like theyre going to live forever            Its been interesting to me for example that after all the rejoicing abouthow nice it is to have Jordan back in the NBA just a year after his retirementas a player the next thing that most of his fans fretted about was whether hisinvolvement with the sadsack Wizards will eventually cloud his legendClearly Jordan is less worried about protecting his mythic standing than hisfans are            I think the other thing that something like Thomas accident does is remindus how little life actually does resemble sports try as we might to say itdoes After all sports have these neat agreedupon rules Theres thiscomforting belief in sports that no matter what happens today no matter howbad a certain game or loss might seem tomorrow can always be betterand youcan do something to make it better you know            Then a man like Thomas ends up in the hospital with a broken back and yousnap back to reality            Maybe tomorrow will bring some better news             Catch you thenJohnette
