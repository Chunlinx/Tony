        have you had to return anything  lately            uh i had a uh i have a boat i live on the water and i i have a boat that i like to take out pretty much every day and i uh took it into the shop to be repaired and i brought it back and it didnt run and i got to i had to i took it back and told them what was wrong and   uh   uh took it back out and it still didnt run three times i had to take it back   did you think it was uh the mechanics problem  with the bolt   uh was a mechanic mechanics problem he didnt really know what was wrong with it and you thought he had fixed it but he he not didnt eventually it got to the point where i said i dont think you know what youre doing im going to take it somewhere else and so i did and someone else finally fixed it   you mean did you have to pay this fellow   uh no i didnt pay him   i wouldnt image youd want to     i paid him original money to do some other work that he did right but uh the rest of it i didnt   um   didnt pay him   no  thinking about products and have they really changed   and uh   i i think its hard to say cross the board that youre not getting what youre getting what you pay for anymore i um just recently had an experience with Sears do you have that down in Florida   yeah   well Sears is kind of famous for taking back almost anything theyre very good about it i had bought a leather jacket almost about twelve years ago for my exhusband he is still wearing the darn thing and you know after some time i was fortunate enough to get remarried to a really nice fellow and i happen to like this leather  jackets and his lasted about a year and a half and i said there theres no uh this makes no sense the good guy didnt get the good jacket and i called them up and i said i would expect a winter coat you know we do have in winters in New York and you i guess you use four months out of the year um this guy didnt get eight months out of a winter coat all the stitches were coming out its a real mess you know i really expect you to do something about this and i didnt really hang on to receipts or anything and it it took much song and dance uh to get it done but i just picked up a brand new leather jacket today   oh good   so im im pretty pleased about that the thing is it only cost about a hundred dollars which for a leather jacket is quite reasonable but the repair i was going to just bring it in and have it repair the repair wouldve been about seventy and i was going to i was just going to do it i hated to throw it out so i i think if you make enough noise you can get your problems taken care of in most cases     yeah so they took and just exchanged   uh yeah i i had to bring it in i had to talk to people in Roanoke Virginia i guess thats Sears central but they were really good about it you know they i i wasnt nasty i didnt attack them i said im so used to your stuff being wonderful im so shocked  and alarmed  this should happen   yeah   and i think its how you conduct yourself as well if if youre kind of mean and nasty if you you get treated mean and nasty   yeah   but um i was really please and and it is true uh uh generally they back up what they have and it worked out nicely fortunately and its you know its like you know when someone else hits your car its not your fault and you dont pay for it but youre majorly inconvenienced   yeah   and i had to carry this jacket around to repair shops and make dozens of phone calls to get it fixed you know its not like it didnt cost me anything in time and effort   yeah   but um   yeah       what aggravating is uh how much how much time and effort you expect things to be       to be right the first time   right well you you were talking about boats it made me think about cars i had a Ford station wagon that one day just died and i called up the repair shop apparently this some kind of uh box in the uh Ford car that just dies and they know it dies and in every car youre going to have thats a Ford car its going to die and i guess after so many miles and he told me over the phone before he even saw thats probably what it was   yeah   and it is and and they build this little time bombs in so  you know you got to bring it back     a little black box that   huh   tells you when to bring it back in to to for repairs   well some kind of part where you cant even an electrical spark off the engine anymore it just the whole thing just dies when you this thing goes   yeah   and you really dont know when its going to happen you just know that youre going to be stranded if you get a Ford and   thats not too not too nice   its kind of upsetting   yeah   at at the time i knew what it did and what it was called but i dont remember that now   yeah   have you found that uh clothes and shoes and things you bought  shoddy than they have in the past   uh well i havent bought too much lately uh not for clothing   um   but uh i bought a a lot of stuff i remodeled the house and i bought a lot of a lot of new uh a new new kitchen and new uh fixtures and everything and uh one thing that we i did buy that i had the only problem was a Sears stove   um   and uh when i got it itd a big dent on the top of it so i had to
