                    Background        Medulloblastomas embryonal neoplasms arising in the        cerebellum are the most common malignant pediatric brain        tumor In man three inherited syndromes associated with        medulloblastomas have been described Turcots Gorlins        and Li Fraumeni reviewed in     Li Fraumeni syndrome        is caused by inherited mutations in the p tumor        suppressor gene Affected individuals develop a large        spectrum of CNS and extraCNS neoplasms including        medulloblastomas     Interestingly alterations in p        are relatively rare in sporadic medulloblastomas with        mutations detected in  or less of cases             The genes most commonly altered in medulloblastoma are        members of developmental signaling pathways Gorlins        syndrome results from inherited mutations in the Hedgehog        receptor         PTCH that constitutively activate the        pathway Mutations in the Hedgehog pathway members         PTCH          PTCH           SUFU and         Smo  have all been identified in        sporadic medulloblastomas as well with approximately         of cases containing mutations affecting these genes                A murine medulloblastoma model was recently        developed by disruption of the         PTCH gene with medulloblastomalike        tumors arising in  of heterozygotes by  months of        age      Breeding PTCH mice to p knockout animals        markedly increased tumor incidence Mice heterozygous for         PTCH and lacking p all developed        medulloblastomas by  months of age            Turcots syndrome is caused by germline mutations in the        gene         APC  a member of the Wnt signaling        pathway This developmentally important pathway contains        several proteins including APC Frizzled Axin and GSK        which act in concert to promote the proteosomal degradation        of catenin      When         APC is rendered inactive by mutation        catenin levels rise and the protein moves into the        nucleus where it acts with TcfLef cofactors to regulate        transcription of         cmyc          cyclin D and other oncogenes                    APC mutations have been identified in        medulloblastoma cell lines and up to  of sporadic        medulloblastomas      Furthermore point mutations        or small deletions in          catenin exon  have been identified        in  of sporadic medulloblastomas and in supratentorial        primitive neuroectodermal tumors PNETs              Finally large deletions in         AXIN were recently found in  of        sporadic medulloblastomas     In the absence of Wnt        signaling catenin is sequestered in the cytoplasm and        nuclear translocation of catenin has been used to monitor        activation of the Wnt pathway in a number of different        tumor types We have previously shown that nuclear        catenin is present in  of sporadic medulloblastomas                   The greatly increased incidence of medulloblastomas in        patients inheriting mutations in the         APC tumor suppressor gene suggests        that activation of Wnt signaling could be sufficient in        some cases to initiate medulloblastoma formation The        mitogenic role played by Wnts in normal CNS development        also supports the concept that the pathway could promote        growth in the brain      In order to test this        hypothesis we created transgenic mice in which the Wnt        pathway was aberrantly activated in the CNS        In order to avoid possible         in utero lethality caused by excess        pathway activity we used the murine PrP promoter element        to construct our transgenic lines Wnt signaling is known        to play a critical role in the development of the brain        and the midbrain and cerebellum do not form in animals        lacking Wnt     Furthermore targeted disruption of        the         frizzled gene results in cerebellar        abnormalities in mice     Transgene expression from        the PrP promoter is extremely low during embryonic        development with highlevel postnatal expression largely        restricted to neurons and glia of the CNS            Transgenic mice expressing either wildtype or mutant        catenin were generated so that a range of pathway        activation could be examined Mutant catenin was        stabilized by a serine to phenylalanine alteration in codon         a change found in human tumors We hypothesized that        increased expression of wildtype protein might result in        modest activation of the pathway while expression of        mutant stabilized protein would increase Wnt signaling        activity more significantly The mutant catenin        accumulated in neuronal nuclei in our transgenic mice but        no tumors or other microscopic abnormalities were detected        The lack of aberrant neuronal proliferation in our mice        suggests that differentiated neurons may not be as        susceptible to the mitogenic effects of Wnt signaling as        are neuroepithelial progenitor cells                        Methods

   Results                  Transcriptional activity of catenin constructs in          medulloblastoma DAOY cells          In order to evaluate the transcriptional activity of          FLAG epitopetagged catenin in a medulloblastoma cell          line the SF and wildtype constructs were introduced          into DAOY cells along with the Wnt pathway TOPFLASH          reporter This reporter plasmid contains three optimal          TCF binding sites     TOPFLASH luciferase activity          was activated fold by SF mutant catenin and           fold by wildtype catenin in DAOY cells Fig                           catenin protein expression in transgenic          mice          Five transgenic lines were established two expressing          wildtype human catenin WT and three expressing          human catenin stabilized by mutation of the          phosphorylation site at residue  Mut Levels of          transgenic protein were evaluated by Western blot using          antibodies directed against a FLAG sequence in the          Cterminus of the transgenic protein Fig A          Transgenic protein was expressed at high levels in the          brains of WT Mut and Mut mice and at lower levels          in the WT and Mut lines Protein extracts prepared          separately from the cerebral cortex and          cerebellumbrainstem had similar protein levels data not          shown Attempts to localize expression of the transgenic          protein immunohistochemically in brain tissue sections          using antiFLAG antibodies were not successful To          evaluate overall expression levels of catenin          transgenic and endogenous Western blots were probed          with an antibody that binds both human and murine          catenin WT brains contained only modestly increased          amounts of protein data not shown However cerebellum          from the Mut and Mut lines contained  more          catenin protein than nontransgenic controls Fig B          Some variation in catenin protein level was seen          between animals but this was not related to age and high          expression levels were seen at all time points evaluated           weeks to  months data not shown                          Nuclear catenin in hippocampus cortex and          cerebellum of transgenic mice          To determine whether expression of transgenic          catenin resulted in increased Wnt pathway activity we          analysed the subcellular distribution of catenin in the          brain Nuclear translocation of catenin is generally          associated with Wnt signaling activity Nuclear          fractionation was performed and the amount of total          catenin in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions          assayed Fig B Stains for the cytoplasmic protein          HSP were used to evaluate fractionation and revealed          some contamination of the nuclear fractions Still the          amount of catenin appeared significantly increased in          the nuclear fraction of CNS protein extracts from the          Mut transgenic line and somewhat increased in Mut          nuclear fractions          We also analysed catenin distribution          immunohistochemically In nontransgenic mice catenin          is abundant in cytoplasm but excluded from hippocampal          cerebellar or cortical nuclei Fig AC In contrast          several of the transgenic lines contained numerous          neurons with nuclear protein in the hippocampus cerebral          cortex and cerebellum Consistent with the nuclear          fractionation experiments described above nuclear          catenin was most prominent in the Mut animals In the          cerebellum  of the granule cell nuclei were          positive and positive nuclei were also found scattered          throughout the molecular layer Fig B Purkinje cell          nuclei were negative In the cortex nuclei of many small          to medium sized neurons were strongly positive Fig D          Nuclear catenin was only rarely detected in glial          cells mostly those with oligodendroglial morphology          Strongly positive nuclei were also present in the dentate          gyrus and pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus Mut          animals contained scattered catenin positive nuclei in          the hippocampus cortex and cerebellum but fewer than          were seen in Mut In Mut animals  of cerebellar          neurons in the granule and molecular layers contained          nuclear catenin and hippocampal cells were          occasionally positive but the cortical neuronal nuclei          were largely negative The nuclei of hippocampal          cerebellar and cortical neurons in WT and WT mice          were also mostly negative for catenin although          occasional weakly positive nuclei were seen in these two          lines No nuclear staining was seen in these structures          in most nontransgenic animals suggesting that weak          activation of Wnt signaling may occur with overexpression          of wild type catenin protein Nuclear catenin was          detected in the thalami and other cortical deep grey          matter loci in both transgenic and nontransgenic          animals          In order to determine if Wnt signaling was aberrantly          active in the cerebellar neuroblasts thought to give rise          to some medulloblastomas catenin immunostains were          performed on newborn Mut and Mut animals Nuclei in          the proliferating external granule cell layer of P          transgenics did not contain catenin Nuclear catenin          was also absent from the ventricular zone cells in P          transgenic animals                          Phenotypic analysis          The most striking phenotype was the kinking of tails          seen in lines Mut and Mut Table  A large          percentage of the Mut animals had kinked tails while          in the Mut line it was a rare finding It is not clear          why the Mut line which has lower levels of transgenic          protein in the cortex was most susceptible to tail          defects Tail kinks ranged from single acute bends to          multiple angulations resembling knots Fig  Kinked          tails were of normal length or slightly shortened          Radiographic analysis revealed vertebral bodies in the          kinked regions to be attenuated in size or malformed          Peculiar circling or waltzing behaviors were also noted          in many of the transgenic animals These animals spun in          place or ran repetitively in tight circles for up to           seconds at a time While the waltzing was most common in          mice expressing mutant catenin one nontransgenic          mouse also exhibited a loose circling behavior          Mice from each transgenic line as well as          nontransgenic siblings were observed daily to identify          any animals with signs of tumors or other neurological          abnormalities However uncoordinated movements          somnolence or poor grooming as is seen in PTCH animals          developing tumors were never observed A total of           mutant catenin and  wildtype catenin animals were          observed for at least nine months before being sacrificed          Table  Of these  Mut and Mut animals          expressing high levels of mutant stabilized catenin          were observed for over one year with  animals reaching           to  months of age Animals were sacrificed at the          end of the observation period and their brains removed          but no tumors or other gross or microscopic CNS          abnormalities were detected While a number of transgenic          animals died in the first nine months the percentage of          animals surviving was not significantly different between          the transgenic and nontransgenic groups Table           Necropsies on animals expiring prior to sacrifice failed          to reveal brain tumors or other CNS alterations Several          of these animals had glomerulonephritis but overall the          causes of death were variable and except for tail          kinking no clear pattern of extraCNS defects emerged in          the transgenic animals                          No increase in tumorigenesis in p mutant animals          expressing transgenic catenin          To increase the probability of brain tumor          development several transgenic lines WT and          Mut were crossed onto a pdeficient background          No brain tumors were identified among the  WT           Mut  Mut and  Mut animals that were p null          These animals all died within  months from lymphomas or          other extraCNS neoplasms known to be associated with          abrogation of p function Brain tumors were also absent          in the  WT  Mut  Mut and  Mut animals          that were mice heterozygous at the p locus All of the          Mut and Mut mice heterozygous for p were observed          for at least  months and  were observed for  to           months                            Discussion        We have created transgenic mice expressing either        wildtype or mutant human catenin in differentiated        neurons and glia of the CNS The mutant gene encodes        catenin protein stabilized by alteration of a        phosphorylation site required for proteosomal degradation        In the transgenic line expressing high levels of human        wildtype catenin significant amounts of FLAG        epitopetagged protein were detected however overall        catenin levels were only slightly increased suggesting        the mechanisms that normally regulate catenin level were        able to compensate for the addition of the human transgenic        protein In contrast expression of SF mutant catenin        resulted in a  increase in overall CNS catenin        protein levels Expression of the transgene seemed to be        higher in selected neuronal populations catenin nuclear        translocation was detected in a subset of hippocampal        cortical and cerebellar neurons normally lacking nuclear        protein consistent with activation of the canonical Wnt        pathway in these cells        Two lines of evidence suggest that the stabilized        catenin protein in our mice is biologically active and        promotes Wnt signaling First cotransfection of the cDNA        used to make our transgenic mice and the TOPFLASH Wnt        pathway reporter plasmid into DAOY medulloblastoma cells        resulted in over fortyfold induction of reporter activity        Similar results were reported for this FLAG epitopetagged        mutant in other cell lines     Second the tail        kinking and waltzing phenotypes in our transgenic animals        expressing stabilized human catenin are highly similar to        those seen in         Fused mice             Fused encodes the murine Axin        homologue and mutation of this gene results in activation        of Wnt signaling     The tail kinking in our animals        presumably results from low level expression of the mutant        transgene         in utero during vertebral patterning        The circling behavior could be due either to ongoing        aberrant Wnt activity in the adult brain or to subtle        developmental defects that are not easily detectable        microscopically We observed the tail and behavioral        phenotypes in multiple transgenic lines suggesting they        are not caused by disruption of an endogenous gene by        transgene integration        Our Western blot analysis showed that transgenic protein        was expressed in the cortex and cerebellum from the        earliest time point assayed six weeks postgestation        through  months of age As has been previously reported        in nontransgenic animals we detected nuclear catenin        only in the thalamus and other deep grey matter structures            In transgenic lines expressing mutant stabilized        protein immunohistochemical analysis revealed nuclear        catenin in both internal granule layer IGL and        molecular layer neurons of the cerebellum Cortical neurons        and hippocampal granule and pyramidal cells also contained        nuclear catenin in transgenic but not nontransgenic        animals We also examined the subcellular localization of        mutant catenin in newborn transgenic mice In these P        animals we failed to identify nuclear catenin in the        proliferative cells of the cerebellar external granule cell        layer or in periventricular neuroblasts Thus in our        transgenic animals aberrant Wnt activation appears to be        limited to mature postmitotic neurons        Wnt activation in the adult hippocampus cortex and        cerebellum did not result in tumors or other CNS        malformations Strain effects are unlikely to have played a        role in this lack of a neoplastic phenotype as mice with        the same background as the one we used have previously been        shown to develop medulloblastomas     We further        attempted to induce CNS tumors by abrogating p function        in conjunction with transgenic catenin expression The        rational for this approach was the markedly increased        incidence of medulloblastomas seen in PTCH heterozygotes        deficient for p and the enhanced intestinal adenoma        phenotype of         p null APC heterozygous         Min mice      We did not        observe any significant phenotypic changes in the CNS of        catenin transgenic animals heterozygous or homozygous for        disruption of the         p locus However most of the        catenin transgenic mice heterozygous for         p were followed for only  months        and it is possible that some of these mice could develop        tumors at a later age        In transgenic mice expressing mutant catenin in the        breast or colon protein levels similar to those we        describe are sufficient to promote abnormal differentiation        and tumors Harada and colleagues documented intestinal        polyposis in catenin transgenic mice with a less than        fold increase in catenin protein level in the polyps            The authors point out that because the transgene was        only expressed in a fraction of cells in this tissue        protein levels are likely higher in some epithelial cells        A similar explanation can be applied to our mice in which        nuclear translocation of catenin was only detected in a        fraction of neurons A fold to fold increase of        catenin level in the mammary glands of transgenic mice        also results in aberrant differentiation and tumors             Thus while it is possible that a greater than fold        increase in catenin level would have a neoplastic effect        on adult neurons evidence from other transgenic models        suggests the increased protein level in our mice could be        sufficient for tumor promotion Overall our data suggest        that activation of Wnt signaling in adult cerebellar and        cortical neurons may not be sufficient for formation of        medulloblastomaPNET        Recent experiments by Fults and colleagues support the        idea that stabilized catenin expression in the postnatal        CNS is not sufficient to initiate tumor formation            Using the RCASTVA system they showed that overexpression        of cmyc but not of activated catenin promoted the        proliferation of neural progenitor cells         in vivo and         in vitro  In their         in vivo experiments expression was        initiated in nestin positive cells postnatally via        injection of catenin stabilized by a point mutation in        codon         Activation of the Wnt pathway in primitive        neuroepithelial cells         in utero results in a quite different        outcome Chenn and Walsh recently created transgenic mice        in which catenin stabilized by an aminoterminal        truncation was expressed in subventricular zone precursor        cells         in utero under control of the nestin        promoter     Brains from these transgenic embryos        contained increased numbers of periventricular        neuroepithelial cells because a greater number of the        precursors reentered the cell cycle after mitosis The        cerebellar phenotype in these mice was not reported and it        is not clear if the aberrantly proliferating        neuroepithelial precursors in their mice represent a        preneoplastic population These transgenic lines express        catenin lacking the entire aminoterminal inhibitory        domain and this truncating catenin mutation they may        have an increased or changed activity compared to our        construct Alternatively the contrast between the         in utero cortical changes reported by        Chenn and Walsh and the lack of a CNS phenotype in our mice        or those of Fults could indicate that the developmental        stage of the neuroepithelial cells in which stabilized        catenin is expressed is critical        In summary we have expressed wildtype and mutant        stabilized human catenin in differentiated neurons and        glia of adult transgenic mice While expression of        wildtype human protein does not significantly alter        overall catenin levels stabilized protein accumulates in        hippocampal cortical and cerebellar neurons and        translocates into their nuclei The tail kinking in these        mice is highly similar to the phenotype seen in Axin        mutants with activated Wnt signaling indicating the        catenin protein expressed in our transgenic mice is        functional However no tumors preneoplastic changes or        other CNS morphologic alterations were detected suggesting        that postnatal aberrant Wnt activation is not sufficient to        induce CNS tumorigenesis in mice It is possible however        that higher catenin protein levels or expression in        undifferentiated precursor cells         in utero  would result in tumor        formation                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions
