                    Introduction        The liver exclusively synthesizes bile acids from        cholesterol via two biosynthetic pathways The classical        pathway begins with the hydroxylation of cholesterol and        operates entirely in the liver     The alternative        pathway begins with the hydroxylation of the cholesterol        side chain Although this reaction occurs in a wide variety        of cells the completion of bile acid synthesis takes place        in liver cells The classical pathway is responsible for        the bulk of the bile acids synthesized by the liver                    The major bile acid species produced by the liver are        cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids These bile acids are        conjugated to either taurine or glycine before secretion        into bile     which is subsequently released into the        small intestine Bile acids are reclaimed from the lumen of        the intestine and returned to the liver via portal blood        for reuse     The recovery of bile acids from the        intestine is an efficient process that involves both        passive transport along the entire axis of the intestine        and active transport in the terminal ileum     The        apical sodiumbile acid cotransporter asbt mediates the        active uptake of conjugated bile acids in the ileum             In hepatocytes both sodiumdependent and        sodiumindependent transport systems on the sinusoidal        membranes extract bile acids from portal blood Of these        the sodiumbile acid cotransporting polypeptide ntcp is        considered to be quantitatively the most important        transporter of conjugated bile acids in these cells             The transport of bile acids from the basolateral to the        canalicular membrane of liver cells is a poorly understood        process Intracellular bile acid binding proteins have been        postulated to participate in the transcellular transport as        well as to buffer against the cytotoxic effects of bile        acids ATPdependent transporters on the canalicular        membranes of hepatocytes mediate the secretion of bile        acids into bile            Recently it was discovered that bile acids are the        natural ligands for a nuclear receptor termed farnesoid x        receptor FXR NRH       Therefore bile acids        may be important regulators of gene expression in the liver        and intestines To date the genes that have been shown to        be responsive to regulation by FXR encode proteins involved        in the biosynthesis and transport of bile acids            Bile acids have been shown to modulate a variety of other        cellular functions such as secretion of lipoproteins from        hepatocytes     and translocation of bile acid        transporters to the hepatocyte canalicular membrane            In McNtcp cells which are liverderived cells engineered        to transport bile acids actively            taurineconjugated bile acids induce the formation of        intracellular vesicles that resembles structures observed        in cholestatic liver cells without apparent cellular        cytotoxicity      In contrast glycineconjugated        bile acids promote apoptosis in these cells     Thus        different classes of conjugated bile acids stimulate        distinctive responses in McNtcp cells Whereas        taurineconjugated bile acids are well tolerated        glycineconjugated bile acids are extremely cytotoxic Here        we examined if this differential response is limited to        cells that normally metabolize bile acids and whether high        level expression of an intracellular bile acid binding        protein can attenuate the cytotoxic response of McNtcp        cells to glycineconjugated bile acids                    Results                  Differential cytotoxicity of glycineconjugated          bile acids in McNtcp cells          We previously showed that taurineconjugated bile          acids such as taurocholic TCA and          taurochenodeoxycholic TCDCA acids were well tolerated          by McNtcp cells     In contrast          glycineconjugated bile acids such as glycocholic GCA          and glycochenodeoxycholic GCDCA acids were cytotoxic          to McNtcp cells    concordant with what has been          documented in hepatocytes     Consistent with the          induction of apoptotic cell death GCDCA but not TCA          preferentially induced the activation of the initiator          caspase  in McNtcp cells Figure A Indeed          glycineconjugated bile acids as a class of molecules          induced genomic DNA fragmentation in this cell line at          low concentrations  M while their taurine          counterparts did not Figure B The cytotoxicity of          glycineconjugated bile acids cannot be attributed simply          to the preferential cellular accumulation of these bile          acids because McNtcp cells can accumulate GCA and TCA          to similar levels Torchia and Agellon unpublished          observations          There is considerable evidence to suggest that bile          acids activate a variety of cellular signaling pathways          in liver cells     TCDCA is capable of activating          PIK activity in McNtcp cells and direct elevation of          PIK activity by transient expression of a plasmid          encoding PIK can protect McNtcp cells from          GCDCAinduced apoptosis     TCA like TCDCA also          caused the elevation of PIK activity in McNtcp cells          Figure A suggesting that activation of PIK may be a          general response to taurineconjugated bile acids          Treatment of McNtpc cells with LY a PIK          inhibitor prior to the addition of TCA or TCDCA resulted          in the loss of tolerance to these bile acids as          demonstrated by the activation of caspase  Figure B          On the other hand preincubation of McNtcp cells with          either TCA or TCDCA attenuated the GCDCAmediated          activation of caspase  Figure C suggesting that the          activation of a PIKdependent survival pathway is          dominant over the death pathway These results also          indicate that the differential sensitivity of the          liverderived McNtcp cells to conjugated bile acids is          due to the existence of a specific mechanism that is          capable of recognizing different classes of conjugated          bile acids In these cells taurineconjugated bile acids          specifically increase PIK activity which in turn leads          to the activation of a survival pathway                               Expression of bile acid uptake activity in CHO          cells          To determine if nonliver derived cells also posses          differential sensitivity to bile acidinduced          cytotoxicity we engineered CHO cells to take up bile          acids actively by expressing asbt Colonies surviving the          selection process were assayed for asbt activity and          several clones showing a range of bile acid uptake          activities were selected for further analysis Analysis          of total RNA from the selected clones CHOasbt readily          showed the presence of the recombinant asbt mRNA Figure          A Correspondingly in CHOasbt lysates an          immunoreactive band of comparable size  kDa to rat          asbt protein can be easily detected using an antiasbt          antibody Figure B The uptake of bile acids by the          CHOasbt cells was saturable with an apparent K           m ranging between  to  M Figure          C The V           max values ranged from  to           nmolmg proteinmin and correlated with the abundance of          the recombinant asbt mRNA encoded by the transgene The          uptake of  M TCA by CHOasbt and CHOasbt cells          reached steady state within  min Figure D implying          the presence of a pathway for bile acid efflux in CHO          cells Furthermore it was possible to chase the          incorporated radiolabeled TCA from CHOasbt and          CHOasbt cells Figure E These results demonstrate          that CHOasbt cells express a fully functional asbt          protein                          Cytotoxic potential of bile acids in CHOasbt          cells          The increase of LDH activity in the culture medium of          CHOasbt and McNtcp cells after treatment with          glycine and taurineconjugated bile acids were compared          to assess the cytotoxic potential of bile acids on these          cells The CHOasbt cell line was chosen for this          study because this cell line has bile acid uptake          activity that was comparable to McNtcp cells              LDH activity in the culture medium of McNtcp cells          increased by  to  within  h of incubating the cells          in medium containing  M of glycine conjugates of          cholic acid chenodeoxycholic acid and deoxycholic acid          GCA GCDCA GDCA respectively Figure A GCDCA was          the most potent in inducing the release of LDH among the          bile acids tested whereas TCA had little effect as          compared to the no addition controls In contrast          incubation of CHOasbt cells in medium containing           M of taurine or glycineconjugated bile acids resulted          in a time dependent increase of LDH activity the culture          medium Figure B GCA and GCDCA were equally potent in          increasing LDH activity raising the level in the medium          of treated cells by  within  h Taurineconjugated          bile acids also raised the LDH activity in the medium of          treated cells to levels approaching GDCAtreated cells          Figure B Treatment of McArdle RH and CHO cells          with taurine or glycineconjugated bile acids had little          effect on the release of LDH Figure Cand D          indicating that bile acid uptake activity is necessary to          manifest their cytotoxic potential in both cell lines In          addition the cytotoxicity was specific to conjugated          bile acids since the addition of nonconjugated bile          acids to the culture medium of bile acidtransporting          cells had a negligible effect on the release of LDH into          the culture medium                          Mechanism of cell death          Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases          have been implicated in the initiation and execution          phase of apoptosis     In addition several studies          have shown the activation of the caspase cascade by toxic          bile acids in hepatocytes      We thus measured          caspase activity after bile acid treatment in CHOasbt          cells Activation of caspase  was detected in          CHOasbt cells after treatment with either taurine or          glycine conjugated bile acids Figure A but absent in          bile acidtreated CHO cells Figures A Analysis of          genomic DNA isolated from treated cells showed that TCA          and GCDCA induced DNA laddering in CHOasbt cells          Figure B indicating that both classes of conjugated          bile acids induce apoptosis in this nonhepatic derived          cell line To further characterize the initiation of the          caspase cascade we determined the time course of caspase          activation by bile acids in CHOasbt and McNtcp          cells Activation of caspase  in both cell lines was          first detected by  min following GCDCAtreatment and          was maximal by  min Figure  In contrast          TCAmediated activation of caspase  was first detected          at  min and reached the levels induced by GCDCA by           min          Because the bile acid transporters used to establish          bile acid uptake activity in McNtcp and CHOasbt          cells were not the same it was possible that the          sensitivity of CHOasbt cells to taurineconjugated          bile acids was a consequence of asbt expression To          address this possibility asbt was expressed in McArdle          RH cells and then tested for response to glycine          and taurineconjugated bile acids As shown in Figure A          asbt conferred active bile acid uptake activity in          transfected cells However activation of caspase  was          evident only in the cells that were treated with GCDCA          Figure B These results demonstrate that the          sensitivity of this cell line to taurine and          glycineconjugated bile acids is not dependent on a          specific kind of bile acid transporter          Activation of a PIKdependent pathway by          taurineconjugated bile acids appears to decide the fate          of McNtcp cells Figure and ref     Therefore          we determined if PIK activity was altered in bile          acidtreated CHOasbt cells As shown in Figure           PIK activity in response to TCA or GCDCA was not evident          in CHOasbt cells suggesting that the inability to          activate survival pathways by taurineconjugated bile          acids commit these cells to apoptosis These findings          also indicate that liver derived cells posses a mechanism          that responds to taurineconjugated bile acids leading to          the activation of PIK                          Cytotoxic potential of bile acids in          HBABexpressing McNtcp cells          It has been suggested that sequestration of bile acids          by intracellular bile acid binding proteins may also          protect cells from bile acid cytotoxicity Thus the          human bile acid binder HBAB was expressed in McNtcp          cells to determine if this class of proteins can protect          against GCDCA cytotoxicity Figure Ashows the presence          of the recombinant mRNA encoding the recombinant HBAB in          clones that have incorporated the HBAB expression vector          into their genomes In addition the HBAB protein          abundance in the total lysates correlated with the          abundance of the HBAB mRNA Figure A Analysis of          radiolabeled TCA uptake Figure B showed that          expression of HBAB had minimal impact on bile acid uptake          despite the fact that the range of HBAB protein abundance          was up to fold greater than that in the lowest HBAB          expressing cell Moreover the rates of decline in the          amount of radiolabeled TCA associated with the cells          after withdrawal of the radiolabeled bile acids from the          culture medium was comparable among the different clones          Figure C indicating that the rate of bile acid efflux          from these cells was also not affected by the presence of          HBAB          Incubation of the BN clones with GCDCA increased the          LDH activity in the culture medium to a level similar to          that in the medium of GCDCAtreated McNtcp cells          Figure A In addition caspase  activity in bile          acidtreated BN BN and BN was comparable to          that in McNtcp which were elevated compared to that          in McArdle RH cells Figure B The time course of          caspase  activation in BN cells after treatment with           M bile acids was similar to that observed for McNtcp          cells Figure C Therefore the presence of an          intracellular bile acid binding protein did not protect          these cells from glycineconjugated bile acid          cytotoxicity even at low bile acid concentrations These          results indicate that the activation of a signaling          cascade involving PIK is the dominant mechanism          responsible for protecting McNtcp cells from the          cytotoxicity of glycineconjugated bile acids                            Discussion        In this study we determined if the differential        sensitivity elaborated by the liverderived McNtcp cell        line to different classes of conjugated bile acids is        limited to cells that normally transport bile acids We        previously demonstrated that taurineconjugated bile acids        are not toxic to McNtcp cells     In contrast        glycineconjugated bile acids induce apoptosis in McNtcp        cells and primary mouse hepatocytes through activation of        the Fas receptor in a FasLindependent manner             Moreover GCDCA was demonstrated to activate both initiator        and effector caspases and that the apoptotic response can        be blocked by Crm A a caspase  inhibitor     The        mechanism by which bile acids stimulate the activation of        Fas receptor remains unclear In Fas deficient hepatocytes        toxic bile acids were still able to induce apoptosis        suggesting that bile acids are capable of stimulating        multiple pathways to initiate cell death            To gain further insight into the specificity of bile        acid cytotoxicity we conferred active bile acid uptake        capacity in CHO cells a cell type that does not normally        metabolize bile acids by expressing a bile acid        transporter CHOasbt cells produce recombinant asbt with a        molecular mass and kinetic parameters that are similar to        previously reported values     It is not known if CHO        cells have pathways capable of facilitating the efflux of        bile acids out of the cell The apparent efflux observed in        CHOasbt could be attributed to the fact that asbt is        capable a bidirectional transport of bile acids            However it is conceivable that an efflux mechanism that        recognizes bile acids exists in CHO cells and other        mammalian cells Indeed yeast and plants express proteins        capable of active bile acid transport     As these        organisms do not normally synthesize bile acids their        ability to transport bile acids may illustrate a        generalized mechanism for cellular transport of hydrophobic        organic anions        CHOasbt cells were used as a model to assess the        cytotoxic potential of taurine and glycineconjugated bile        acids in nonhepatic derived and nonbile acid metabolizing        cells Unlike McNtcp cells treatment of CHOasbt clones        with taurineconjugated bile acids resulted in cell death        TCA was the most potent of taurineconjugated bile acid        tested It is unlikely that the observed cytotoxicity of        the conjugated bile acids could be attributed to the        generalized intracellular accumulation of bile acids        because unconjugated bile acids were transported by        CHOasbt cells but did not cause significant release of LDH        into the culture medium Torchia and Agellon unpublished        observations In contrast glycineconjugated bile acids        GCDCA in particular were highly effective at causing the        increase in LDH activity in the culture medium of both        McNtcp and CHOasbt cells Primary hepatocytes        exhibit differential sensitivity to taurine and        glycineconjugated bile acids in culture     The bile        acidtransporting WIFB cells which are rat hepatomahuman        fibroblast hybrids     remain viable even when grown        in TCAcontaining culture medium for up to  days            In contrast our study shows that taurineconjugated bile        acids is toxic to a cell type that is not normally exposed        to bile acids Liver cells which normally metabolize bile        acids apparently possess a mechanism that can distinguish        and differentially elaborate distinct biological activities        of taurine and glycineconjugated bile acids        Both taurine and glycineconjugated bile acids induce        apoptotic cell death in CHOasbt cells The involvement        of the caspase cascade in CHOasbt cells was illustrated        by the fact that conjugated bile acids activated caspase         in a time dependent manner However the different profile        of caspase  activation suggests that taurine and        glycineconjugated bile acids may trigger apoptosis by        different pathways At present it is not known how        conjugated bile acids activate caspases in CHOasbt        cells A protein that is immunoreactive to a Fas receptor        antiserum and has a molecular mass similar to the rat Fas        receptor is detectable in CHO cell extracts Torchia and        Agellon unpublished results This leaves the possibility        that conjugated bile acids may activate the apoptotic        cascade through Fas receptor in this cell line as        glycineconjugated bile acids do in hepatocytes            However the activation of caspases does not require a        specific kind of bile acid transporter since TCA is not        toxic to McArdle RH cells irrespective of whether        these cells internalize bile acids via ntcp or asbt        The differential response of McNtcp cells to        different classes of conjugated bile acids is apparently        due to the selective activation of either a PIKdependent        survival pathway     or caspasedependent death        pathway     Indeed neither taurine nor        glycineconjugated bile acids stimulated PIK activity in        CHOasbt cells and both classes of bile acids were        toxic In addition pretreatment of McNtcp cells with a        PIK inhibitor rendered these cells susceptible to TCA and        TCDCA mediated cell death The latter finding indicates        that taurineconjugated bile acids are capable of inducing        apoptosis when PIK is inhibited probably by utilizing the        same mechanism activated by glycineconjugated bile acids        That TCA is able to activate PIK in plasma membrane        fractions from McNtpc agrees with a previous study        showing that TCA increases PIK activity in canalicular and        sinusoidal membrane vesicles     The activation of        PIK in that report was also associated with recruitment of        sister of Pglycoprotein the bile acid export pump and        other multidrug resistance proteins to the canalicular        membrane     Extended treatment of McNtcp cells        does not appear to have detrimental and permanent        consequences on cellular function The marked morphological        changes that occur during long term incubation with TCA           dissipate after the withdrawal of the bile acid from        the culture medium and the cells remain viable        The significance of an intracellular and high affinity        bile acid binder in bile acid mediated cytotoxicity was        also evaluated Several proteins capable of binding bile        acids in vitro have been identified reviewed in ref            It is thought that the major bile acid binding protein        in the cytosol of rat hepatocytes is hydroxysteroid        dehydrogenase a member of the aldo keto reductase        supergene family     However the exact role of this        protein in intracellular transport of bile acids and        cytoprotection was undefined HBAB a member of the human        aldo keto reductase gene family has been shown to bind        bile acids with high affinity  M and is postulated        to play a similar role as hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase        in human hepatocytes     Expression of HBAB in        McNtcp cells was expected to increase the capacity of        these cells to sequester bile acids in the cytoplasm and        thereby reduce their toxicity High level expression of        HBAB had a negligible effect on the ability of the BN        clones to take up or secrete bile acids suggesting that        HBAB has a minor role in the net transport of bile acids in        these cells More importantly however expression of HBAB        in McNtcp cells had no effect on GCDCAinduced cell        death even at low bile acid concentrations indicating        that this class of protein does not provide cytoprotection        against toxic bile acids as previously suspected This        finding is consistent with the idea that bile acids        directly modulate specific signaling cascades that control        cellular death and survival        In summary the failure of CHOasbt cells to tolerate        taurineconjugated bile acids has revealed the existence of        a mechanism that may be specific for cells that normally        metabolize bile acids Since bile acids undergo        enterohepatic circulation it would be reasonable to expect        the existence of the same mechanism in other cell types        that naturally transport bile acids such as ileocytes and        cholangiocytes      The last few years have brought        significant advances in our understanding of bile acid        transport in liver and intestinal cells However the        regulatory potential of bile acids is only beginning to be        realized With the recent discovery that bile acids        represent the natural ligands for the nuclear receptor FXR              there is heightened interest in identifying        the genes that are regulated by bile acids Insight into        how bile acids directly modulate a variety of other        cellular functions will be important in understanding the        significance of cellular responses to bile acids                    Materials and Methods
