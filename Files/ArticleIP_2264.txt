                                 CorporateWelfare NIMBYs            By JacobWeisberg            A great turn of phrase cantransform the political debate Robert Reich as secretary of labor firstdeployed the phrase corporate welfare in a  speech The phrase wasbrilliant political jujitsu turning the Republicans favorite issue againstthem The GOP wanted to cut poor people off the dole but was ignoring the muchlarger sums that go to businesses in the form of tax breaks direct subsidiesand regulatory favoritism In fact Reichs slogan has been so successful thatit has created a new bipartisan class of Washington hypocritesthecorporatewelfare NIMBY            Corporatewelfare NIMBYs arethose who want to slash corporate welfare but not in their own back yardsThey are unalterably opposed to handouts for private businessesas long as thebusinesses are in somebody elses state or district They are outraged byfederal largess that goes to the undeservingexcept when the undeservinghappen to include their own friends contributors and constituents            To see this double standardin action you dont even have to watch CSPAN for very long On Feb  forexample the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee busied itself with hearingson something called the Corporate Subsidy Reform Commission Act This is a billto create a commission to propose cuts in corporate welfare Like themilitarybaseclosing commission on which it is modeled the corporatewelfarecommission would produce a hit list and Congress would then vote yes or noon the whole package Chairing the hearing was a fervent supporter of the ideaRepublican freshman Sen Sam Brownback of Kansas            Brownback who succeeded toBob Doles seat in the Senate casts himself as the Senates most fervid enemyof government waste Pork has no place when were so broke he told a roomfulof reporters at a Jan  press conference announcing thecorporatewelfarecommission bill At the end of the event journalists fromKansas surrounded Brownback to ask whether he considered government ethanolsubsidies to be corporate welfare Ethanol is distilled from corn so thesubsidies benefit Kansas farmers as well as the politically connected ArcherDaniels Midland Co There are few better examples of corporate welfare ButBrownback made clear that wasnt what he meant says one person who attendedthe event Brownback by the way cast the lone vote against the confirmationof William Daley as commerce secretary Brownback insisted that Daley hadntmade clear enough his hatred of corporate welfare            The chiefDemocratic sponsor of the Senate bill is Sen Russ Feingold of WisconsinEnding corporate welfare is not a luxury it is a necessity Feingold notedin a press release Would that include say federal dairy supports andmarketing orders for the milk industry which somehow escaped being scaled backin the  Farm Bill I told you hes for a commission  saysFeingolds press secretary Mary Bottari Feingold who is up for reelectionin  carries a different tune when it comes to aid to families withdependent cheese            Liberals and conservatives do tend to mean different thingswhen they denounce corporate welfare To Democrats corporate welfare usuallymeans indirect subsidies in the form of tax breaks like the ethanol tax creditor the rule that allows firms to depreciate some of their advertising costs ascapital Reich himself seldom complained about spending programs like theOverseas Private Investment Corp and the ExportImport Bank which subsidizeAmerican exports            To Republicans on the otherhand corporate welfare generally refers only to spending To close any of theloopholes that the Congressional Budget Office says cost the Treasury billion a year would mean raising taxes  Grover Norquist of theAmericans for Tax Reform who is part of Ohio Rep John Kasichscorporatewelfarecutting coalition takes the standard conservative line thattax subsidies should be addressed separately and only in context of ataxcutting bill that reduces rates Meanwhile Republicans are busy expandingthis form of corporate welfare According to the Washington Post  HouseSpeaker Newt Gingrich and Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer slippedinto last years minimumwage bill a new version of the huge tax break thatgoes to firms operating out of Puerto Rico The corporatewelfare queens whoasked for this goody were lobbyists for the National Federation of IndependentBusiness            But the distinction between atax subsidy and a payment subsidy doesnt account for all the double standardsMany Democrats supported the old version of the Puerto Rico tax subsidy AndRepublicans will support subsidies for any form of agricultural productionPerhaps the most absurd examples are people like Sen Dan Coats of Indianaacosponsor of the corporatewelfarecommission billwho voted last year tostop a brave attempt by Arizona Republican Sen John McCain to get rid of thesocalled Market Access Program This handout for the rich is perhaps thepurest example of corporate welfare in the federal budget Its a direct grantto giant food and wine companies like Gallo Tyson Foods and Campbell Soup topay for their advertising costs overseas            Another favorite Republicancause is the Small Business Administration which exists to make loans tocompanies that banks deem nonviable Even a maverick like Republican RepMichael Forbes of New Yorkwho according to press reports has been treatedas a nonperson by his GOP colleagues since he voted against the reelection ofNewt Gingrich as speakerbleats like a goat when the SBA field office in hisLong Island district is threatened And then there are the Democrats like TedKennedy and John Kerry who have the gall to sign on as cosponsors of thecorporatewelfare bill while holding out for ludicrous federal maritimesubsidies Their interest is in protecting the shipyard in Quincy Mass            There are a few opponents ofcorporate welfare who dont instinctively exempt their own oxen from beinggored McCain is one though it should be noted that the big federalboondoggles in retireerich Arizona are Social Security and Medicare notcorporate welfare Kasich who represents farmfree Columbus in the House isanother who practices what he preaches But even these relatively honestconservatives have let all the fat fish wriggle off the hook Kasichs proposedcorporatewelfare package draws together a measly  billion in cuts overfive years The Progressive Policy Institutes Rob Shapiro who invented theconcept of corporate welfare before Reich gave it a name has identified billion worth            And slight as they are mostof Kasichs proposed cuts arent really corporate welfare at all Theyreregular old spending that Republicans happen not to like such as support forthe International Monetary Fund and highway demonstration projects inDemocratic districts Kasich isnt a corporatewelfare NIMBY Hes acorporatewelfare wimp But thats another story
