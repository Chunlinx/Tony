what do you think about being a star  ill buy you buy you lots of cat food with that   thats right   yeah thats right you can buy lots of cat food with that so or hire somebody to do your lawn so then you dont have to worry about it we have a big problem around here with insect problems you know fire ants and   yeah you believe that oh yeah yeah   so thats it gets expensive around here to do a lawn because youre always you know buying the fertilizer and the you know the bug killers and weed killers yeah   yeah and all that stuff well im im pretty easy as far as yard work ill go out there and cut it and ill edge it if it dies it dies   uhhuh uhhuh oh my husband just has to have it green has to be green its     no i uh ill take my chances with it course now where i where im at now i dont have to worry about the lawn because they got somebody that comes in and does it     oh thats nice   it is nice he matter of fact he was here today it was the first really warm weather weve had and he came out and cut the yard and trimmed the hedges and all that   uhhuh yeah well we had a real warm day today and all the neighbors were out you know in their front yards doing their yard and   yeah i guess i i guess were really into spring now   its a perfect day for it yeah i i love spring i just love it   i dont i like winter yeah i like i like cold dreary weather   do you oh not me oh i dont i i grew up in Wyoming and its cold enough there for me so   yeah i it its humum no i gosh i got use to it when i lived in South Dakota   uhhuh   its just great up there   oh do you have a lot of that kind of weather there in North Carolina   no this is another one of those winters that wasnt   oh winter that wasnt huh   yeah its i dont know i was expecting snow and all of that i maybe i should have moved over to the mountains instead of here  but uh they didnt get a lot of snow in the mountains either     uhhuh yeah no talking to my folks in Wyoming they uh they were still hoping they get some more because if they dont theyre going to have water problems this summer so   yeah yeah that was a big problem was i was in South Dakota course wed had plenty of snow but uh every once in a while they they get shorted on the snow and the water supply starts drying up   uhhuh thats right they need the the snow for the water so   because those i mean those those summers up there are brutal   uhhuh   terrible you get those uh Chinook winds coming across the prairies and golly its uh its unbelievable the extremes in weather up there but i enjoy it gosh i   and just dries everything out uhhuh   i i hadnt been anywhere where the weather was so tremendously great for me   oh well it sounds like you need to move back there   yeah i ive been thinking about  it only problem is i i would be very limited in any job opportunities out there     yeah thats thats it wed like to be closer to family but limits the job your welcome Brittany   yeah yeah the uh i mean theres still basically ranchers and farmers up there you know   yeah but its hard to make it being a rancher or farmer   yeah i   what Brittany okay good hunting   thats all right thats just  another one wanting to get in on the conversation   oh yeah she she was wanting   oh i meant to ask you can you hear me okay on this thing okay good its a its a its a headset so it makes it a little easier   uhhuh yeah i hear you just fine oh yeah You doing lots of these calls you work for TI oh oh okay my husband works for T I   oh no i dont im a im a student uh   oh oh okay my   just about everybody ive talked to has been with TI i guess thats i guess thats the same with your husband   uhhuh yeah he works for them right now hes been there almost six years now   yeah i had a i had an interesting call about uh two weeks ago um came in late too it was like eleven thirty at night and i answered it and   oh wow   i said yeah well you know im not doing anything so i took it and the subject was discuss the weather and find out how your weather compares to the callers weather     i had one of those too it was a weather phone call yeah   well the interesting thing was this was from another student at state right across town from me   oh oh well you really kind of have the same kind of weather   i mean yeah gosh whats you weather like you know well i dont know let me look out my window yeah its kind of foggy tonight     i had one from somebody that was up in New York and they were out of their house because of the ice storm yeah they were living with families that would take them in and   oh that ice storm yeah yeah i talked to somebody about two weeks ago from Rochester and same story they uh they really had a lot of damage from uh ice and all that   uhhuh yeah yeah they couldnt even be in the house because they had no power and everything   yeah yeah thats pretty bad   yeah and here we were i mean i talked to her we had just gotten over a ninety four degree day so  we really had a lot to compare so   oh oh sounds like that young one wants some attention   oh i shes talking to my husband i think so yeah so   oh oh thats okay yeah Rochesters a nice town too they they said that they had had uh lots of pretty little parks and stuff up there that just been wiped out   oh yeah thats what she said they they were going to have the governor was going to try to have it declared a disaster area   thats too bad because i yeah yeah thats too bad because i i i had a an old an exprofessor who uh is up there in Rochester and he told me about how much they had worked to beautify the place   uhhuh   and all these beautiful gardens and parks and all that good stuff now its all been wiped out its a shame   oh yeah it really is   oh well such is life   yeah it seems like you work hard and something  else goes wrong nothings forever i guess   yeah exactly its like me with gardens i can go out there and plant a garden and then watch the bugs and   oh thats what it is with us too you just like get so frustrated you get something about ready ripe and there goes the bugs and   uhhuh you get a get a frost or something hail thats even better   uhhuh or hail yeah it just you know   yeah my the only the only thing i ever accomplished i i mean ive had gardens for a long long time when i was a kid i started uh i had some squash and tomatoes and watermelons   uhhuh   and i grew a thirty four and a half pound watermelon yeah absolutely tasteless had no taste whatsoever uhhuh   oh my word oh was it we trew grew cantaloupe last year and thats how they were just tasteless you couldnt even eat them   uhhuh cantaloupes difficult to grow and get taste out of them i mean theyre theyre easy enough theyll grow easy enough but you cant get any flavor   yeah uhhuh yeah yeah you have to be so careful when you buy at the stores   yeah i i buy them every once in a while and and i bought one and it was you know blah   uhhuh   and then i said well ill try another one so this is several weeks later and i bought another one and it was just as sweet and wonderful but you never know   uhhuh yeah nope you dont its hard to pick them   uhhuh its like oranges and everything else but anyway   oh yeah the oranges here look disgusting so   oh yeah they look terrible here i look at those thing i say i wouldnt buy them not even to squeeze for orange juice uh   so uhhuh yeah theyre all
