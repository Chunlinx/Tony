                                  Unforgiven            Seconds after the Senatevoted last Friday not to remove President Clinton from office networkproducers stamped the words ACQUITTED and NOT GUILTY across the nationstelevision screens This is a real slap at the House prosecutors declaredCBS correspondent Bob Schieffer echoing colleagues on other networks CLINTONACQUITTED DECISIVELY announced the New York Times  Sundays talk showpundits scavenged the battlefield pronouncing Republicans the losers            Not so fast Though theSenate has cast its votes historys verdict remains in doubt The spin warover who was right or wrong doesnt end with Clintons acquittal And the earlyconventional wisdomthat the GOP has lost the fightrests on three erroneousassumptions            The first fallacy is that the debate over Clintons guiltis an upordown question Actually its a spectrum Pundits crippled byshort memories focus on the publics opposition to Clintons impeachment andremoval But this was only the last stage of a gradually escalating scandalThe first question unresolved until Clintons Aug  confession was whetherhe had done something immoral The second question debated throughout theStarr investigation and the House Judiciary Committees inquiry was whetherClinton had done something illegal The third questionwhether he had donesomething impeachabledidnt come to the fore until the House impeachmentdebate and the Senate trial            Its true that by thetime the Republicans got to the third stage they had lost the public But onthe first question the polls remain squarely on their side In apostacquittal Los Angeles Times survey only  percent of respondentssay Clinton shares their moral values Likewise in a CNN poll  percentexpress a negative opinion of him as a person only  percent express apositive opinion  percent say he has diminished the presidencys statureand  percent say he would commit adultery if he knew he could get away withit Only  percent say the Senates verdict vindicates Clinton  percentsay it does not These numbers show how Republicans can rewrite the scandal bysliding the debate back across the spectrum to the moral question andportraying every vote to acquit Clinton as a vote to exonerate him            This is why Democrats have scrambled to avoid a fight overClintons morals and to assure the public that hes been sufficientlycastigated They denounce his conduct at every opportunity Having failed topass a censure resolution Friday they signed it anyway and put it in theCongressional Record  They denied that in acquitting Clinton they hadvoted to exonerate him morally They even touted the  to  Republican votesto convict Clintonwhich they had unanimously opposedas suitable punishmentThe votes for conviction confirmed the humiliation of the president SenFrank Lautenberg DNJ observed approvingly Senate Minority Leader TomDaschle DSD called the verdict a rebuke of Clinton and asserted thatthis whole process  has been a level of punishment that was commensuratewith the failures of the president to act appropriately            Several Democraticsenators assisted by the media depicted the House prosecutors failure to wina majority vote in the Senate as a disgraceful setback for the GOP Thisargument reflects a second fallacy that the Republicans are out to get Clintonand that their vindication depends on his repudiation by Congress Inpostacquittal comments some Republican senators did try to portray the Senateas united in its denunciation of the president Were going to end up withtwothirds of the Senate either having voted to convict or to censure SenRobert Bennett RUtah told ABC And that I think sends a very stronghistoric message to our children ABC commentator George Stephanopoulos seizedon Bennetts remark Its the first Republican talking point you see thattwothirds have voted either to convict or censure            But Stephanopoulos is missing half the story There are twoRepublican camps The pedagogical camp led by Bennett and Sen Orrin HatchRUtah wants to unite the country in condemnation of Clintons behaviorthereby resolving the impeachment issue The political camp led by Sen PhilGramm RTexas and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RTexas wants to divide thecountry and keep the issue alive for the next election The pedagogicalRepublicans want Clinton punished and repentant The political Republicans wanthim un punished and un repentant so the public will stay angry athim and his party Theyre not interested in using congressional Democrats tohurt Clinton Theyre interested in using Clinton to hurt congressionalDemocrats            The politicalRepublicans first objective was to kill the censure resolution They arguedcorrectly that Democrats were using it for political cover But the GOPsdecision to kill it for the same reason was no less political First DeLayblocked it in the House then Gramm killed it in the Senate insisting thatsenators render an allornothing verdict According to the New YorkTimes  Gramm had warned his Republican colleagues that censure would muddlethe partisan rift over impeachment making the issue less potent in Friday evening he got what he wanted In a tone of disbelief Schieffer toldCBS viewers The trial ended without even a verbal reprimand from theSenate            Gramms allies proclaimed far and wide that Clinton hadescaped untouched It looks as though as the Democrats put it a recklessreprehensible and irresponsible man will remain our president for the next twoyears said DeLay He won He always wins agreed Sen Bob Smith RNHChildren now have the lesson that lying cheating and breaking the law arepermissible moaned Christian Coalition leader Randy Tate On Meet thePress  Republican strategist Mary Matalin accused the White House ofgloating On This Week  the chief House prosecutor Henry HydeRIll called Clintons acquittal another skirmish in the ongoing culturewar Former Vice President Dan Quayle signaled his intention to pound VicePresident Al Gore in the  presidential campaign for having defendedClintons character            Democrats think theyreimmune to this attack because theyve got both ends of the spectrum covered Onthe removal question the polls are on Clintons side and on the moralquestion on which the polls are against Clinton Democrats have acknowledgedand condemned his misconduct This is the third fallacy Democrats haveoverlooked the legal question in the middle On that question they have failedto reconcile themselves to the polls In a Gallup survey shortly before theSenate verdict  percent of respondents said Clinton was guilty of perjury Apostacquittal CBS poll finds that  percent think hes guilty though only percent think his crimes merited expulsion from office And in a postacquittalWashington Post survey  percent still say Clinton should facecriminal charges at some point            Yet every Democratic senator voted not guilty lastFriday A few have conceded Clintons guilt on the perjury charge but the resthave either denied that the case was proved or have dodged the question byarguing that either way the alleged crimes wouldnt merit the presidentsremoval And while their censure resolution may immunize them against thecharge of moral indifference it doesnt protect them from the charge ofindifference to Clintons apparent lawbreaking Its language pointedly avoidsaccusing him of perjury or obstruction of justice            Republicans smell theiropportunity At their press conference after the Senate verdict several Houseprosecutors interrupted their sermons against the polls to point out wherethe public agreed with them We take great satisfaction  that one pollshowed that  or  percent of the people  recognized that the presidenthad committed falsehoods under oath said Rep George Gekas RPa Rep JimRogan RCalif cited the same figure The public by  percent or morebelieves that hes committed perjury chimed in Rep Chris Cannon RUtahThe political cleansing that did not happen through the impeachment processleaves Clinton with a great and serious burden            Republican strategists will make Democrats carry thatburden into the elections On Fox News Sunday  when Democratic Partychairman Roy Romer ritually expressed his disappointment in Clintonspersonal behavior GOP chairman Jim Nicholson shot back I find itinteresting that Roy Romer would say Democrats are on the high ground when percent of the people say his president lied to them and over half of themsay he obstructed justice On Face the Nation  political consultantRalph Reed went further calling the scandal Al Gores albatross because heacted as an advocate for a president who  percent of the American peoplebelieve committed perjury and only  percent think is honest andtrustworthy            Pundits often sayhistory is written by the winners They think this maxim shows how clever andcynical they are Actually its half of a circular argument and their failureto grasp this irony exposes their naivet Thirtyfive years ago BarryGoldwater was a landslide loser Today hes the father of the conservativemovement Winners it turns out are written by the historians And the contestto write the history of Bill Clintons impeachment is just beginning
