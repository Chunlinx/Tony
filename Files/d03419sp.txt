United States General Accounting OfficeGAOJanuary GAO FORUM ON GOVERNANCE AND ACCOUNTABILITYChallenges to Restore Public Confidence inUS Corporate Governance and Accountability SystemsaGAOSPGovernance and AccountabilityForum DiscussionThere was general agreement among the participants that the rootcauses of the accountability breakdowns are systemic in naturecomplex and will require leadership and alterations to the currentmodels in each of the four interrelated areas to transition to anoverall system that is more focused on protecting the publicinterest and in that regard accountability They also agreed thatconsiderable actions have been taken andor proposed towardsachieving those objectives but that having the right people andstakeholders involved was critical to successfully achieve andeffectively maintain the necessary reforms Several other keyobservations followMany boards of directors are reassessing their roles andresponsibilities and currently it is difficult to determine

Securities and Exchange Commission isneeded to maintain investor confidence Concern was raised that theCommission is not fully at that status and that funding issues needto be resolvedThe new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board needsto officially get up and running with immediate priorities focusingon establishing policies and procedures for performing itsdisciplinary inspection and standardsetting functionsContentsComptroller General Aof the United StatesUnited States General Accounting Office Washington DCJanuary  The last  years witnessed major accountability breakdowns atEnron and WorldCom leading to significant restatements of financialstatements and bankruptcy adversely affecting thousands ofshareholders and employees Unfortunately such failures were notisolated instances as other accountability breakdowns in recentyears included Qwest Tyco Adelphia Global Crossing WasteManagement Micro Strategy Superior Federal Savings Banks andXerox Although stakeholders of these companies were directlyaffected by the accountability breakdowns these failures havecumulatively contributed to the general shaking of investorconfidence inUS capital marketsLast year on February   GAO held a forum to discusssystemic issues related to these accountability failures such ascorporate governance accounting and reporting and auditingSince that time major reform legislation has been enactedtheSarbanesOxley Act of and regulators have proposed andorfinalized a number of new requirements to address issues related tothe failures However much of the regulatory reform action is inprocess and experience will be needed to evaluate the effectivenessof the changes Moreover the changes to date do not address allthe issues raised by the accountability breakdownsOn December   GAO convened a governance andaccountability forum for the purpose of identifying past pendingand proposed actions designed to protect the public interest byidentifying challenges to improving public confidence inUS corporate governance and accountability systems to assistregulators the accounting profession and boards of directors andmanagement of public companies to effectively implement theSarbanesOxley Act of  and other related regulatory actionsandplacing special interest on steps designed to enhanceindependence of the corporate governance system and enhancing theaccountingauditing and attestassurance models for the stcenturyUS General Accounting Office Highlights of GAOs CorporateGovernance Transparency and Accountability Forum GAOSPWashington DC March Page  GAOSP Governance and Accountability ForumSpecifically the forum focused on four interrelatedareascorporate governance the financial reporting model theaccounting profession and regulation and enforcementThe invited participants were from public private andnotforprofit entities having extensive experience and subjectmatter expertise in the accounting profession corporate governanceissues financial reporting and disclosure models auditingaccounting and related regulatory issues GAO also extendedinvitations to chairs and ranking minority members of relevantCongressional committees Over  invites attended As agreed withthe participants the purpose of the discussion was not to reach aconsensus but rather to engage in an open no attributionbaseddialogue Therefore this report summarizes the collectivediscussion and does not necessarily represent the views of anyindividual participant or GAOThe participants acknowledged that recent legislative andregulatoryCorporate Governancereforms in response to issues raised by significant restatementsof financial statements and corporate failures were placing greateremphasis on the roles and responsibilities of boards of directorsThey noted that many boards are reassessing their roles andresponsibilities and at this time it is difficult to determinewhat is working and what is not working Information on bestpractices of boards would be useful to help improve boardoperations for example in areas of improving communications withmanagement and using external advisors However participantsgenerally agreed that there is no silver bullet for enhancing theeffectiveness of boards of directors in their role of oversight ofmanagement and protecting shareholdersIn discussing the role and responsibilities of boards ofdirectors participants stated that it starts with having the rightpeople on the board who are independent knowledgeable and ethicaland whose integrity is unquestionable The basic roles andresponsibilities of the board were defined as enhancing shareholdervalue assessing and monitoring risk and ensuring managementaccountability It was noted that boards need to do a better job ofidentifying their constituencies and understanding and addressingtheir concerns In addition board members have a responsibility toeducate themselves about the companys operations and plans and toseek advice of external experts when and as appropriateParticipants also focused on the roles of the nominatingcompensation and audit committees noting that  nominatingcommittees need to independently identify candidates for boardmembership rather than rubber stamp managements candidates compensation committees need to focus more on achievements relatedto the companys longterm strategic objectives and less onshortterm accomplishments such as meeting earnings projectionsand  audit committees need to work more effectively with theindependent auditor as defined by the SarbanesOxley Act of and not get tied up in procedural matters concerned with theirlegal liabilities as committee membersParticipants stressed that having the right people on theboard was just as important if not more so than having the rightrules In that respect it was noted that board members shouldpossess an independent spirit to ask the tough and probingquestions of management Participants stated that the existingsystem for identifying board members might not always be attractingthe right people For example it was stated that some boardmembers are serving on too many boards to be effective and thatsome board members are serving for personal incentives that couldadversely affect their independence Some participants believedthat in todays environment potential legal liabilities wereadversely affecting finding qualified board members Otherparticipants believed that there is no shortage of qualified boardmembers willing to serve and that the board needed to look beyondthe list of usual suspectsThe traditional financial statements in terms of form andcontent have notFinancial Reportingchanged much over the years The financial reporting model usesa mixture of historical costs and fair value to present a companystransactions This model has value but fails to meet the broaderrange of information needs of investors who want moreforwardlooking information and data that reflect a companysoverall performance risk profile and expectations for futureperformanceLittle progress has been made in moving toward a morecomprehensive reporting model that would include both financialinformation financial statements and related disclosures andnonfinancial information such as highlevel operating andperformance measures used by management and forwardlookinginformation about opportunities risks and managements plansParticipants stated that the current model is too driven byaccountants regulators corporate management and boards ofdirectors who have historically focused on the technical aspects offinancial reporting and are more likely to move slowly andcautiously in makingThe Accounting Professionchanges As a result the current model has failed to getadequate traction to move toward a more comprehensive reportingmodelGoing forward participants believed that the impetus for changeto the financial reporting model would have to come more from theinvestors and other users of financial information who need timelyaccurate and useful information to make value and risk judgmentsabout publicly traded companies Also a safe harbor for preparersand auditors of more forwardlooking information may be necessary toprogress Other suggestions by participants included moving towardmore principlebased accounting rules to provide more substanceversus form in reporting There was general agreement that  acombination of principlebased and rulebased standards would beneeded and  principlebased accounting rules were not a panaceato solve financial reporting problems In that respect someparticipants suggested that standard setters first needed to getthe basics right with the current financial reporting model forexample in areas such as accounting for pensions postemploymentbenefits and proforma financial statements to help restoreinvestor confidence It was also suggested that the financialreporting model have different layers of reporting while stillhaving full disclosure coupled with different levels of assurancesdepending on users needs Such layering would allow a user todrill down to the level of detail neededAn expectation gap between what an audit is and is not continuesto exist especially with regard to the auditors responsibilityfor detecting fraud Some participants believed a periodic forensicaudit may be needed to supplement the traditional financialstatement audit to assist in detecting fraud However it wasrecognized that an audit cannot create precision or certainty wheresuch factors do not exist as financial statements are not asprecise as users may believe In addition management and auditcommittees have important roles and responsibilities for internalcontrol to prevent and detect fraud The SarbanesOxley Act of will help to close the expectation gap concerning the effectivenessof internal control over financial reporting by requiringmanagement and auditor reporting on these controls Nonetheless anexpectation gap may still exist as users may be expecting that anaudit addresses internal control over the companys overalloperations and performance Educating users on the terminology ofinternal control reporting such as reportable conditions was alsourged so that the users and capital markets do not over react ininterpreting the internal control reportsRegulation and EnforcementParticipants suggested the need for a new reporting model forauditing a renewed focus on the quality of auditing and buildingmore effective working relationships with the audit committee Itwas recognized that the standard auditors report could be mademore useful to users who are seeking greater information about whatthe auditor did and found as well as expanded assurances Tieredreporting that would provide expanded optional assurances wassuggested Participants stated that the quality of audits can beadversely affected by time and fee pressures that lead to lesssubstantive auditing Caution was also urged that rotation of auditpartners required by the SarbanesOxley Act of  does not havethe unintended consequence of adversely affecting the quality ofaudits through loss of experience with a particular companysoperations and financial reporting It was recognized thatconfidence in audits needs to be restored not only for investorsbut also to attract and retain the best people for the accountingprofession over timeA strong viable Securities and Exchange Commission SEC isneeded to maintain investor confidence in the markets Participantsrecognized that the SECs resources had not kept up with itsincreased workload over the years This situation has adverselyaffected the SECs ability to adequately enforce the securitieslaws and also its ability to invest in technology to moreefficiently manage its workload Some participants suggested thatthe SEC may wish to consider pursuing the status to operateindependently in setting its own funding levels as the FederalReserve does It was also suggested that the SEC needed to explorehow it is using its enforcement powers as civil penalties mayultimately be hurting shareholders more than those who haveviolated the securities laws In that respect the SEC shouldreexamine the amount and targeting of its civil sanctions its useof criminal statutes and working effectively with the Departmentof Justice to put violators behind bars when appropriateThe new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOB needsto officially get up and running Suggested priorities for thePCAOB included establishing policies and procedures fordisciplinary actions and conducting inspections of registeredpublic accounting firms Also decisions need to be made on thesetting of standards for auditing quality control ethics andindependence It was also suggested that the PCAOB should evaluatethe recent events that have affected the publics confidence inauditors to consider what further actions may be needed beyondthose mandated by the SarbanesOxley Act of  and recentregulatory changes and proposals In addition the PCAOB needs towork cooperatively with the SEC and state boards of accountancyThe fragmentation of the regulatory system for the publicaccounting profession was not completely dealt with by theSarbanesOxley Act of  At a minimum the PCAOB will need toeffectively work with the other public regulators onenforcementdisciplinary matters Participants generally believedthat the provisions of the SarbanesOxley Act of  should beimplemented and assessed before the Congress should consider addingany new legislative requirements however participants agreed thatmuch can and should be done by other responsible parties such asby regulatory and selfregulatory bodies within their existingauthorityRestoring public trust and confidence in a manner that can besustainedGAO Observationsover the longterm will require concerted actions by a varietyof parties including accounting and auditing standard settersregulators management and boards of directors of public companiesThe SarbanesOxley Act of  provides a strong framework for moreeffective corporate governance and regulation of the accountingprofession The SEC and the stock exchanges along with theFinancial Accounting Standards Board have also been activelymaking progress to address a range of issues raised by theaccountability breakdowns However the fundamental principles ofproviding the right incentives providing adequate transparencyand ensuring appropriate accountability are even more important andrelevant as the new structure and reforms are beingestablishedIt is important to recognize that rules alone will noteffectively resolve the problems that resulted in massiverestatements of financial statements and ultimately bankruptcy ofcertain public companies The Congress cannot legislate nor canregulators establish by rule human behavior or integrity to alwaysdo the right thing in protecting the publics interest Publiccompany management needs to set the appropriate tone at the topand that culture needs to be carried throughout the company andexhibited by the board of directors in its oversight of managementand in its protection of shareholder interestsThe accounting profession needs to vigorously work to rebuildits greatest assetpublic trustin order to restore faith in theintegrity and objectivity of the profession Accounting andauditing standards need to be reexamined to provide enhanced valueto users of financial statements related disclosures and morecomprehensive business reporting Users of these products will needto step forward to help ensure the value of an enhanced financialreporting model and related auditor assurances for the effectivefunctioning of US capital markets Accountants and regulators whohave historically driven changes to the financial reporting modeldo not have the same set of needs as users of financial statementsIn that respect a broader performance and accountability reportingmodel is needed and should include not just financial statementsbut also performance and other information necessary to betterassess institutional value and riskGAO will continue to play a professional objective nonpartisanand constructive role in assisting the Congress regulators andthe accounting profession as initiatives are proposed agreed uponand become operational In that respect the views of theparticipants in this forum represent considerable experience in thematters discussed and represent one way in which an independentparty such as GAO can assist those who define andor implementpolicyThe results of the forum are organized by the major areas ofdiscussion and reflect subsequent comments we received from theparticipants on a draft of this report Appendix I provides a listof the participantsFor additional information on our work concerning corporategovernance the accounting profession financial reporting andrelated regulatory matters please contact Jeffrey C SteinhoffManaging Director Financial Management and Assurance on  or at SteinhoffJgaogovI wish to thank each of the participants for taking the time toshare their knowledge and to provide their insights andperspectives on the important matters discussed during the forum Ilook forward to working with them on these important issues ofmutual interest and concern in the futureDavid M Walker Comptroller General of the United StatesCorporate GovernanceDefining the Roles and Responsibilities of the Board ofDirectorsRecent legislative and regulatory initiatives such as theSarbanesOxley Act of  Securities and Exchange CommissionSEC proposals and rules and proposed revised stock exchangelisting requirements have addressed weaknesses in corporategovernance exposed by the major financial reporting issues raisedby restatements and corporate failures placing greater emphasis onthe roles and responsibilities of boards of directors Althoughthese reforms are not yet fully in place and not all issues havebeen addressed many corporate boards are reassessing their rolesHowever participants agreed that there is no silver bullet andthat it is difficult at this time to say what is working and whatis not workingParticipants believed that it is important to continue workingtoward more effective boards of directors and discussed theimportance of clearly defining and in some cases redefining theroles and responsibilities of the board of directors of publiccompanies as a significant measure to help restore investorconfidence in the market The board has a responsibility to enhanceshareholder value assess and monitor risk and ensure managementaccountability In that respect the operations of the boardsshould reflect a culture that embraces these responsibilities Inaddition to focusing on what accountants regulators and corporatemanagement and boards of directors the supply side should doboards need to focus more on what investors and other users offinancial information the demand side want from corporategovernanceIn order to fulfill its responsibility of effectively overseeingmanagement the board must have a thorough understanding of thecompany its business model and related risks corporate cultureand the various interests the board represents Participantsbelieved that the board has a responsibility to educate itselfthrough the use of external advisors or other means and not relysolely on information provided by management This will betterallow the board to raise difficult questions and probe issues toprovide input on strategy assess and manage risk and holdmanagement accountable for its actions The time frame needs to bevery clear as creating value is a longterm not a shorttermprocess Investors are not looking for quick schemes that endangerthe companyIn addition to its responsibility to oversee management theboard also has a responsibility to shareholders and otherstakeholders of the company such as employees creditors and thepublic Participants believed that boards need to do a better jobof identifying their constituencies and understanding andaddressing their concerns For example from the shareholderspoint of view many believe that board structures have not beenworking properly to both protect shareholders interests and growshare value We have become a nation of investors and boards needto focus attention on the fact that there has been a shift fromshareholders not only being individual investors but alsoinstitutional investors such as pension plans and mutual fundswhich are acting as fiduciaries for others Institutional investorsmay have concerns different from those of individual investorsregarding expectations for corporate governance and the role of theboard of directorsParticipants also felt that boards needed to reexamine how theyare structured and how they operate Many boards were not perceivedto function properly for investor protection which is a negativereflection on the entire corporate governance process To someextent deficiencies in the functioning of boards may have beenmasked by the effect of a flourishing market and may not have beenreadily apparent until market downturns began to occur It isincumbent upon boards to establish processes that are appropriateand effective to restore investor confidence rather than relying ona checklist approach to corporate governance Participants believedthat information on best practices of boards would be useful tohelp to improve board operations Some best practices includefocusing on improving communications with management and usingexternal advisors It was also suggested that boards shouldeffectively use the gatekeepers auditors and audit committeesfor help in the boards oversight of financial management andreporting activities of the companyIndependent committees of the board of directors such as theauditing compensation and nominating committees play animportant role in effective corporate governance Audit committeesshould not only oversee both internal and external auditors butalso be proactively involved in understanding issues related to thecomplexity of the business and when appropriate challengemanagement through discussion of choices regarding complexaccounting financial reporting and auditing issues In thatrespect the role of the audit committee which in some cases hasnot been very active or effective in its oversight of management orauditors as related to financial reporting is evolving into notjust financial management oversight but the overall aspects of thecompanys financial reporting such as releases on earningsexpectations and quarterly financial reports In addition theSarbanesOxley Act of  defines a number of audit committeeresponsibilities for the hiring compensation and oversight ofauditors However a serious concern exists over whether auditcommittee members are focusing more on procedural matters toprotectIdentifying the Right People to Serve on Boardsthemselves from liability than on improving their competence andeffectiveness as a committee Also compensation committees need tounderstand the implications of compensation to provide incentivesfor management to do the right thing for the company and itsshareholders versus themselves Compensation committees need tofocus on executive performance more related to the companyslongterm objectives rather than just shortterm business resultsIn addition nominating committees need to ensure that theyidentify the right mix of talent to do the job and make it clear tocandidates what is expected of them as a board member rather thanmerely approving candidates identified by management In thatrespect some participants stated that boards are often made up ofconsensus builders and in that case a dominant member of theboard could effectively control the boards agendaParticipants also discussed the importance of providingreasonable transparency of key information with regard to bothfinancial information of the company and board operations Boardsneed to focus on enhancing the quality and reliability of financialreporting identifying key elements of disclosure and ensuringthat such information is appropriately disclosed to investors andthe public Participants also believed that there is a need forbetter transparency of board activities to help restore investorconfidence such as reporting on the boards progress against bestpractices of leading companies noted for the effectiveness oftheir boards If the board is not following best practices itshould report why it is not following these practices The pointwas also made that successful companies have reinvented themselvesthrough two fundamental focusesethicsintegrity and respect forpeople These behaviors have been demonstrated by longtermsuccessful companiesParticipants stressed the importance of independence both infact and appearance as essential for the board to be able tofulfill its responsibilities Participants expressed the beliefthat having the right people on the board is just as important ifnot more so as having the right rules under which the boardoperates Nominating committees need to identify competentindividuals who possess an independent spirit which allows boardmembers to raise difficult questions and probe issues relatedOne source of information on best practices of leadingcompanies is the  Report and Recommendations of the Blue RibbonCommittee on Improving the Effectiveness of Corporate AuditCommitteesPage  GAOSP Governance and Accountability Forumto managements decisions to ensure that the company operateshonestly and effectively in the shareholders interest Even ifboard members are independent they can be ineffective as directorsif they lack expertise or knowledge relevant to the company and itsbusiness Therefore board members must also be willing to educatethemselves about the company and the risks it faces rather thanrelying on a checklist mentality of corporate governancerequirements issued by the stock exchangesParticipants also noted that unfortunately as a result of therecent major financial reporting issues leading to restatementsand in some cases bankruptcy board members have focused on therules and may be concerned more about their personal reputation andfinancial liability rather than focusing on protectingshareholders interests and adding shareholder value Participantsexpressed concern that disincentives such as legal liabilitiesincluding financial and reputation risks may limit a boardsability to attract the right people to serve over timeParticipants raised the question whether the current system ofselecting directors needs to be reexamined because the existingsystem from a shareholders point of view has not been working toget the right people on boards For example it was viewed thatindividuals who serve on numerous boards at the same time andorwho serve for personal incentives over time lose the independentspirit needed to be an effective board member Participants alsostated there is some evidence that the recruiting of directors isbeing adversely affected by the current environment that is placingeverincreasing demands on board members Examples were cited ofincreased premiums for finding qualified board members and suchsearches needing to identify  candidates for a board positionjust to get one who is willing to serve Other participantscommented that there is no shortage of qualified people to serve onboards of directors Many people are willing to serve higher goalsand the selection process needs to go beyond its usual pool ofsuspects Some participants suggested that perhaps serving as adirector on a board should be a salaried position if shareholderswere willing to bear the cost Other participants noted howeverthat having salaried board members could be problematic becauseshareholders would have to be able to hire and fire the directorsthat would cause great instability and salaried board members mayalso lack an independent spiritParticipants also discussed the appropriateness of the chiefexecutive officer CEO serving as chairman of the board ofdirectors which could present potential conflicts resulting from asingle individual functioning in these dual roles Someparticipants believed that separation of the CEO and chairman ofthe board positions recognizes the differences in their roles andeliminates conflicts in functions For example management isresponsible for the operations of the company and members of theboard in their oversight function should have the ability tochallenge the CEO in managing the company Although the corporategovernance community in the United States may not currently bereceptive to requiring the separation of the CEO and the chairmanof the board such a practice does exist in the United Kingdomwhere apparently there is more receptivity Therefore regulatorsmay need to look beyond the United States to consider the merit ofwhether these positions should be held by differentindividualsOther participants pointed out that not allowing the CEO to alsoserve as the chairman of the board of directors does not guaranteethat problems will be avoided if the board lacks an independentspirit to question management citing such examples as EnronGlobal Crossing and WorldCom all of which had a separate CEO andchairman Some separations of the CEO and chairman functions aresuccessful and others are not A CEO may lose authority when theposition is too diluted United States firms have been successfulbecause they have had strong leaders running them and an effectiveand strong board of directors can counterbalance a strongexecutiveFinancial ReportingLittle Has Changed with the Financial Reporting ModelParticipants commented that traditional financial statements interms of their form and content have not really changed over theyears The model we have today can be traced all the way back tothe early s back to the Trueblood Committee Participantsattributed this lack of change to the financial reporting modelbeing largely driven by the supply side that is accountantsregulators and corporate management and boards of directorsParticipants referred to a landmark study on financial reporting bythe Jenkins Committee as evidence that little has changedParticipants acknowledged that accounting standards have changed tocapture fair value in addition to historical value resulting in amodel that is now a mixture of the two whereas the originalfinancial statement model was based solely on historical costsHowever the majority of the Jenkins Committees recommendationsnever got any traction to move them forward The FinancialAccounting Standards Board FASB has many of these items on itsagenda At the same time there are many other items on FASBsagenda Participants felt that if stakeholders were serious aboutimproving the financial reporting model a group would beestablished and funded specifically for this purpose Participantsstated that such a group was proposed by the Jenkins Committee butit was never established There needs to be a sense of urgency inorder to make the investment commitment and ultimately change themodel However one participant questioned that since almost years have gone by since the Jenkins Committee made itsrecommendations is there really a demand for changeThe Trueblood Committee named after the chairman a groupformed by the American Institute of Certified Public AccountantsAICPA to study the objectives of financial reporting recommendedfinancial statements that set forth the objectives of financialaccounting and reporting and provided a conceptual framework fordeliberations about accounting matters See the AICPAs Objectivesof Financial Statements Report of the Study Group on theObjectives of Financial Statements October The Jenkins Committee named after the chairman a groupformed by the AICPA in  to address concerns over the relevanceand usefulness of financial reporting recommended in its report that standard setters develop a comprehensive reportingmodel that includes both financial information financialstatements and related disclosures and nonfinancial informationsuch as highlevel operating data and performance measures used bymanagement managements analysis of changes in financial andnonfinancial data and forwardlooking information aboutopportunities risks and managements plans See the AICPAsImproving Business ReportingA Customer Focus Meeting theInformation Needs of Investors and Creditors Comprehensive Reportof the Special Committee on Financial Reporting Current Financial Reporting Model Has Limited Value in TodaysBusiness EnvironmentSome participants agreed that financial statements are animportant aspect of overall business reporting but were concernedthat the existing model focuses too much on financial statementsrather than on the broad range of information that is needed byinvestors to make good financial decisions Other participantscommented that financial statements that exist today while theymay be useful to some are not used very much by investorsFinancial statement disclosures are difficult to understand asthough written in a foreign language Participants stated thatthe disclosures must be made more understandableHowever there is a lot of dialogue taking place todayconcerning business reporting For example regulators are askingwhat should be disclosed what is the purpose of financialstatements and how useful are they What are analysts doing withfinancial statements What do analysts use to value stock Are theyusing financial statements If so what information in thefinancial statements are they using to value stock What additionalinformation would assist them in more accurately valuing stockParticipants noted the need to report information about thebusiness model as users of financial reports first must betterunderstand the entitys business model in order to comprehendfinancial and nonfinancial information about the entityFinancial statements today focus on reliability much more thanon relevance Historical information is reliable but notnecessarily relevant Fair value information is evolving butimprovements in reliability are needed Participants agreed thatreliability is fundamental to useful business reporting howeverparticipants felt that financial reporting would be much moreuseful if it were expanded to include key performance indicatorsand measures including disclosures on how the key measures werechosen Participants raised questions about the gaps in reportingof intangibles For example in a knowledgebased economy onecould argue that the most important assets are people humancapital however current financial reporting records investmentsin people as an expense and liability Participants agreed that itwould be useful if financial reporting recognized people as assetsbut raised the difficulty in valuing human capital Participantsgenerally agreed that there is a demand for both historical andfair value reporting However participants felt that FASB neededto better differentiate between the two In that respect someparticipants felt that FASB is marching toward a fair value pathand cautioned that the fair value reporting model is not alwaysgood and needs to be used only where it really makes senseConsiderations for Moving toward a Comprehensive FinancialReporting ModelParticipants acknowledged that financial reporting in additionto being largely driven by the accounting profession also has beendriven by the legal system resulting in an overload of informationthat is too complex and not easily understood Disclosures that runon for pages are not understandable Experts are needed tointerpret the disclosures and sometimes even they cannot decipherwhat is being reported However participants understand thataccountants are taking a risk when they issue an opinion on thefinancial statements The litigious environment has also led to acheck box mentality where it is more important to follow theaccounting rules when preparing financial statements than actuallyreporting the economic substance of the transactionParticipants generally agreed that financial statements are notdesigned to serve all business needs and that other types ofbusiness reporting are needed to assist investors and other usersin making decisions Participants also generally agreed that thedemand side investors and other users of financial informationhas not been as involved as it needs to be to make financialreporting more meaningful and understandable More needs to be doneto convince investors and other users to demand differentreporting Voluntary disclosures are rare and only in industriesthat demand this type of information The voluntary process hasresulted in some movement toward better reporting but it is veryslow moving Change is going to have to come from the demand sideand is going to require a lot of leadership from very influentialpeople Input from advisory councils may also be beneficial fordeveloping a broader business reporting model While it isessential that a new model not be driven totally by the supply sideaccountants regulators corporate management and boards ofdirectors there cannot be a disconnect between the supply anddemand sidesParticipants also cautioned that we need to move forwardpatiently toward a new comprehensive reporting model It was viewedthat forward realtime qualitative information all of which wouldbe helpful in predicting future cash flows may require a safeharbor from liability It is also important to keep in mind therole of the regulator in this process since the public needs tohave confidence in the regulators to enforce rules Regulators maynot be totally supportive of a more comprehensive business modelbecause they are concerned that the information would be based on alot of judgment and therefore lack of precision which could makeenforcement of reporting standards difficultParticipants discussed the lack of investor confidence in thecurrent financial reporting model and the need to first improve thereliability of financial reporting before adding any new reportingFirst get the basics right that is the blocking and tacklingof financial reporting Participants cited accounting for pensionspostemployment benefits and proforma financial statements asexamples of accounting treatments that need attention beforebuilding on any new reporting requirements Issuers of financialstatements who are inappropriately bending the current accountingrules need to know they cannot get away with this anymoreParticipants discussed the merits of replacing accounting ruleswith principlebased standards to promote more substance versusform in reporting However some participants cautioned thatprinciplebased standards should not be viewed as a panacea tosolve the problems with financial reporting and could lead to anundesirable situation where you would not have comparability oragreement as to the treatment of similar transactions Alsostakeholders may not interpret principles consistently and it isimportant for stakeholders to have the same conceptual framework aspreparers when interpreting a principle In addition you wouldneed the right kind of implementation guidance to carry out aprinciple Participants agreed that while accounting rules are alsoneeded there should not be such blind adherence to accountingrules to result in reporting form over substance Participantsoffered that an artful blend of both principles and rules wouldbe useful The Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA wascited as an example of an approach that blended both aprinciplesbased general fiduciary standards and rulesbasedprohibited transactions approach to an important issueretirement securityParticipants also discussed the idea of exploring differentlevels or layers of reporting while still having full disclosureSuch layering will allow users to get only the information theyneed For example the basic level of reporting would includeperformance and risk data an industry layer could includebenchmarking information and a company specific layer couldinclude information management feels it is appropriate to disclosethat is not contained in other layers of reporting Along with thisidea is the need to explore different levels of verification orassurances by independent parties based on the users need for suchverification or assurances For example what type of assurancesare needed for nonfinanical information and can auditors providesuch assurances Overall it is critical to get the demand sideinvestors and other users of financial information to weigh in onwhat information they need and want It is not realistic to onlyexpect the supply side accountants regulators and corporatemanagement and boards of directors to come up with the bestsolutions for improving the financial reporting modelAlthough time did not permit its discussion financial literacywas raised as an important issue that needs addressingParticipants agreed that there clearly is a need for more educationand for investor assistance in this areaThe Accounting ProfessionAn Expectation Gap Exists Concerning the Role of AuditingThe participants discussed the auditors responsibility fordetecting fraud and the meaning of the assurances provided by theauditors report on the financial statements These issues havecontinued to plague the accounting profession since the sdespite actions taken by the profession to narrow the socalledexpectation gap between what the public expects or needs and whatauditors can and should reasonably be expected to accomplishUsers often equate a clean audit opinion with a seal of approvalthat fraud does not exist and annual reports are both complete andaccurate However auditors do not provide absolute assurance andthe scope of the opinion is limited to certain financialrelatedinformation One participant explained that there are a lot ofthings an audit cannot do For example an audit cannot createcertainty in an environment where there is no certainty An auditcannot guarantee precision in an environment where estimates aremade An audit cannot ensure that stock prices will be achieved Wecannot lose sight of the fact that in a risktaking environmentbusinesses do fail Auditing is not the be all and end all tosolve the problems in the business place However participantsgenerally agreed that while the accounting profession needs to takeadditional steps to address any misunderstanding as to the limitsof an audit there is room to improve the audit process and auditorreportingWe reported on this issue in The Accounting Profession MajorIssues Progress and Concerns GAOAIMD Washington DC Sept Page  GAOSP Governance and Accountability ForumParticipants recognized that management has the responsibilityfor preventing and detecting fraud At the same time they agreedthat it is fair to expect auditors to provide reasonableassurance of detecting any material fraud Participants discussedthe need to mitigate the opportunity and risk for fraud byeducating boards of directors and ultimately changing the tone atthe top of the company Some participants liked the idea ofauditors periodically performing more of a forensictype auditin which auditors would be more skeptical of management butcautioned that this approach could have a negative effect on auditquality because management and the auditor might not work asactively together on an ongoing basis Participants agreed that anadversarial relationship between the auditor and management wouldnot be constructive in that the cooperation of management iscritical to both an effective and efficient audit Howeverparticipants agreed that auditors should be more skeptical andshould say no and walk away from clients more often than theycurrently do The participants applauded the deterrent put in placeby the SarbanesOxley Act of  which sends a signal thatpersons who prepare or attest to fraudulent financial statementscan go to jail This deterrent has raised awareness andconscientiousness within all levels of the financial reporting andauditing process as to the significance of their job in preparingfinancial statementsThe concept of forensic auditing was recently suggested by thePanel on Audit Effectiveness to improve the likelihood thatauditors will detect fraudulent financial reporting see The Panelon Audit Effectiveness Report and Recommendations Aug  Forensic auditing as explained by the Panel would require thatauditors undertake an attitudinal shift in their degree ofskepticism and presume the possibility of dishonesty at variouslevels of management including collusion overriding of controlsand falsification of documentsParticipants generally viewed the new internal control reportingrequirements of the SarbanesOxley Act of  as a goodrequirement A participant added that earlier mandatory internalcontrol reporting probably would have surfaced problems withineffective boards of directors and audit committees Howeverparticipants cautioned that reporting only on internal controlsover financial reporting could lead to more of a gap in whatinvestors perceive as the scope of the auditors work For exampleusers of financial reports are interested in a companys overallperformance and outlook and accordingly would be interested inthe effectiveness of internal control over the process thatproduces that data In that respect participants also discussedthe need for auditors to expand their focus on internal control toinclude controls over performance data in order to better meet theneeds of investors for assurances on financial statements and forunderstanding all business risks Also new information not onlyneeds to be useful but also needs to be understood by investorsFor example investors do not understand terminology such asreportable conditions which could result in investors over orunderreacting to problems Participants also suggested that theonepage audit opinion should be replaced with tiered reportingof audit results where firms can obtain the level of assurancethey desired For example in todays environment audit committeeswould most likely ask for the deepest tier of audit reporting tobetter carry out their responsibilitiesParticipants generally agreed that the profession needs a newreporting model for audits to eliminate the misunderstanding as towhat an audit of financial statements is and what its limits areThe participants acknowledged that the financial audit process islargely driven by the accounting profession and suggested that theprofession needs to spend more time understanding what the demandside investors and other users of financial information needs andwants from auditors However the participants recognized that oneof the big obstacles for innovation inThis comment was based on the standards and guidance containedin Internal ControlIntegrated Framework published by theCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations COSO of the TreadwayCommission for reporting on the effectiveness of internal controlwhich addresses a companys control environment including boards ofdirectors and audit committeesThe AICPAs Generally Accepted Auditing Standards defines areportable condition as a significant deficiency in the design oroperation of internal control that could adversely affect theentitys ability to record process summarize and reportfinancial data consistent with managements assertions in thefinancial statementsMore Attention Is Needed on the Quality of Auditsreforming the audit process and auditor reporting is theauditors fear of legal liability One participant added that thecurrent regulatory structure has dampened the professions spiritfor innovationParticipants commented that there are good solid audits beingperformed however some participants expressed concern thatoverall time and fee pressures both from company management andfrom within the auditing firms have resulted in less and lessauditing particularly less substantive testing of transactions Inthat respect the financial audit is considered the loss leaderin many audit organizations with a focus on cutting hours and costsand as a means to obtain consulting engagements Some participantsalso pointed out that most of the auditing is currently beingperformed by inexperienced auditors Further several participantscautioned that the auditor rotation rules currently being developedby the regulators could further reduce audit quality by resultingin a loss of continuity experience and technical knowledge on anauditParticipants felt that the profession needs to elevate andrestore the importance and the quality of the financial statementaudit Participants stated that the accounting profession needs tocandidly discuss what it is doing to improve the audit process torestore public trust Further a growing concern for the professionis its ability to attract and retain the best people over time Itwas stated that auditors frequently leave the profession early intheir careers to join clients and that over half of CPAs are notpracticing public accounting One participant added that theinterest in the profession over the past  years has dropped byhalf although the recent publicity stemming from Enron andWorldCom albeit negative has actually sparked increased interestin the profession Participants generally agreed that theprofession needs to aggressively address the issue of attractingthe best people to the professionAuditors Need to Strengthen Their Relationship with Others inthe Corporate Governance ProcessParticipants generally agreed that improvements in corporategovernance will bring about improvements in auditing It was viewedthat one of the more positive outcomes of the SarbanesOxley Act of is the relationship the act establishes between the auditorand audit committee by making the audit committee in essence theclient versus company management Historically participants feltthat auditor communication with audit committees has been variableParticipants generally agreed that auditors should be able to speakmore freely openly and honestly with audit committees on risksfacing the company and on the appropriateness of the companysaccounting policies Audit committees should be demanding moreinformation from auditors and asking auditors if they havesufficient resources both in number and expertise to adequatelyperform the audit Audit committees and auditors together canbecome good safeguards for investors A point was also made thatthe role of the internal auditors specifically their cooperationand coordination with the external auditors and the board ofdirectors should be improved which ultimately could improve thequality of financial reporting and the external audit In additiondisclosures such as those required to be reported to the SEC onForm K should be improved to be more transparent and helpful toregulators in determining the reasons and circumstances surroundingauditor changesAn SEC registrant must file a Form K when its externalauditor resigns declines to stand for reelection or isdismissedPage  GAOSP Governance and Accountability ForumRegulation and EnforcementProviding the SEC with Sufficient Resources to Restore InvestorConfidenceParticipants uniformly agreed that the nation needs a strongviable SEC to instill investor confidence in our markets The SECplays an important role through its responsibilities to regulateactivities of public companies and their auditors and to conductrelated enforcement actions as well as to establish and sustainthe new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board PCAOBestablished by the SarbanesOxley Act of  until the PCAOB iscertified by the SEC as ready to operate However participantsnoted the SEC may not have been provided with sufficient resourcesto achieve such results For example participants stated that theSEC has recently been operating on a budget of about million It was noted that although the Senate authorized about million for the SEC for fiscal year  an amount that theSenate believed would be sufficient to implement provisions of theSarbanesOxley legislation to restore investor confidence theOffice of Management and Budget only proposed a funding level ofabout  millionParticipants believed that a lack of sufficient funding providesconstraints in two areas that are vital to the SECstaffing andtechnology To carry out its important function of restoringinvestor confidence the SEC may not always be able to attract theright people and retain them under the existing structure Inaddition to effectively conduct its reviews of public companiesthe SEC will require a large technology investment and relatedtraining of SEC staff Participants questioned whether given thecurrent funding restraints existing models for generating revenuesfor the SEC were workable Participants believe that models thatprovide temporary resources to SEC such as through fellowshipsfrom the accounting profession are not the answer to its fundingand staffing problems and can raise conflict of interest issuesAccordingly some participants believed that it is time to thinkabout having the SEC operate independently in setting its ownfunding levels like the Federal Reserve and to let the SECdetermine and set its own fees with industry participation forthe activities it conducts If the SEC were able to establish itsown annual budget and collect fees the SEC would be better able toconduct itsPrior GAO reports and testimonies discuss SEC resource issuesand the need for the SEC to

Participants notedthat even if the SEC were independent regarding its funding theCongress could still oversee the SECParticipants discussed the importance of effective SECenforcement actions as a means of restoring investor confidence inthe markets The SEC tries to create deterrence and be measured inimposing sanctions If there are no clear negative consequences tosecurities violations or wrongdoing investors may perceive thatthe system is not working properly Although the SEC has an arrayof sanctions available all SEC enforcement actions are civilbased which ultimately results in shareholders bearing the burdenof the costs of legal proceedings and sanctions Some participantsbelieved that shareholders were benefiting from litigation andquestioned the appropriateness of civilbased enforcement actionsciting the fact that shareholders have already been financiallyhurt by the actions that lead to the sanctions Participants alsodiscussed whether the right people were being held accountable andwhether the SECs civilbased enforcement actions were sufficientto discourage the bad actorsParticipants raised questions about whether the SEC shouldreconsider the amount and targeting of its civil sanctions and morefrequently use other types of remedies such as criminal sanctionsto hold people accountable for wrongdoing In that respectparticipants noted that the SEC should be effectively using theoption of referring cases when appropriate to the Department ofJustice for investigation for possible violation of criminalstatues Participants questioned how well that process wasworkingThe SarbanesOxley Act of  provides for additionalenforcement authority for both the SEC and the newly created PCAOBIn response to the question of whether the SarbanesOxley Act of should be revisited participants believed that althoughultimately some technical changes to the act may be necessary theSEC and the PCAOB needed to move forward to implement the actAlso the SEC and the PCAOB should explore integrating theiractivities to get the new enforcement mechanisms in place todetermine how well they may address some of the issuesdiscussedEstablishing Priorities for the PCAOBParticipants believed that the PCAOB needs to be quickly set upand establish its priorities so it can begin the difficult task ofrestoring public confidence Many participants believed that thePCAOBs most immediate priority should be implementing adisciplinary process to let the public know that failed auditingwill be dealt with and trust can be restored The disciplinaryprocess needs to have the necessary incentive measures to serve aspreventative measures before problems can become more seriousOther immediate priorities should be setting up an inspectionfunction of auditors that audit SEC registrants and determining howstandards that govern the work of the accounting profession suchas auditor independence rules and standards for conducting auditsshould be set Some participants believed that the existinginspection process could be improved by looking less at theaccounting firms internal systems for quality control and more atthe quality of the judgments that were made by the auditors inconducting the auditParticipants also believed that the PCAOB also needs to evaluatethe events that have lead to the lack of public confidence in themarkets and take a fresh look going forward For example the PCAOBshould consider the reasons the accounting profession is organizedthe way it is including federalstate regulation such as thelicensing structure reasons accounting firms practice aspartnerships the effects of private litigation and the structureand role of the state boards of accountancy Participants alsonoted that the PCAOB should take advantage of the fact that underthe current environment no one has more motivation for getting badauditors off the street than the accounting firms themselves Theaccounting firms do remove bad auditors but this is accomplishedwithout publicity so that their efforts are not well knownParticipants also believed that a challenge facing the new PCAOBwill be dealing with the complex relationship between federal andstate governments involved in regulating the accountingprofession Participants identified the need for bettercommunication and sharing of information between federal entitiessuch as the SEC and the new PCAOB and the state licensing andregulating entities For example states are often hampered intheir ability to take appropriate regulatory actions becauseOur report The Accounting Profession Status of Panel onAudit Effectiveness Recommendations to Enhance the SelfRegulatorySystem GAOWashington DC May   discussesthe various bodies that regulate the accounting professionPage  GAOSP Governance and Accountability Forumthey do not get referrals from the SEC and the AICPA or becausethose organizations have made the information confidential Alsoongoing litigation impedes information flow In additionparticipants stated that some states have been independently tryingto address accountancy reform and in some cases have proposedreforms that have gone further than the SarbanesOxley Act of because they feared that the federal government would not act Thishas led to additional inconsistency in requirements betweenstatesParticipants encouraged the SEC and the PCAOB to work closelywith the states in taking actions to restore public confidence andensure an appropriate degree of consistency needed for viableinterstate commerce Some participants suggested that the PCAOBconsider the banking industry to provide examples of theintegration of federal and state regulation and lessons learnedabout that structure from the savings and loan and banking crisesParticipants noted that with increased globalization of businessesoperations and the need for harmonization of accounting andauditing standards as well as the need for preemptive measuresthere may be more federal involvement such
