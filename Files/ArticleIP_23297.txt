                                  Ground War Euphemisms            On March  PresidentClinton went on television to explain the rationale for US participation inthe bombing of Yugoslavia I do not intend to put our troops in Kosovo tofight a war Clinton assured the public A week later Dan Rather observedthat Clintons verbal gymnastics about his relationship with Monica LewinskyIt depends upon what the meaning of the word is is had made peoplesuspicious of how Clinton was parsing his words about Kosovo When you sayyou have no intention to commit ground troops to accomplish the mission inKosovo Rather asked Clinton does that mean we are not going to have groundtroops in thereno way no how no time            Its possible thatClinton can still avoid a ground war But the probability that he will have toreverse that positionand explain his way out of itis now at least as highas the probability was a year ago that he would have to admit to aninappropriate relationship with Lewinsky and explain away his previousdenials If an aboutface on the question of a ground war becomes necessarythe phrase no intention will be only one of Clintons escape clauses Hispromises to avoid a ground war like his denials of the Lewinsky affair arelaced with convenient loopholes             Permissive environment Clinton has pledged notto send US ground forces into a hostile environment Secretary of StateMadeleine Albright and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger have promised notto use American troops to invade Kosovo or enter a combat situationHowever administration officials have held out the possibility that USsoldiers would be sent into a permissive environment            At first everyone assumed that a permissiveenvironment was one in which Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic his willbroken by the bombing had agreed to permit NATO troops to enter Kosovounchallenged Lately however American officials have enlarged the meaning ofpermissive Last Sunday Albright acknowledged that Milosevic might neverwillingly yield There are other ways however to create a permissiveenvironment she added What we are doing is systematically diminishing ordegrading his ability to have that kind of control over the area            The next day in acatandmouse game with reporters over the meaning of permissive environmentClinton spokesman Joe Lockhart alternately defined it as a one where there isa political settlement and b an environment where the Serbs and Milosevicdont have the ability to impose their will On this theory once the Serbsdefenses are sufficiently crippled by bombing US ground forces would enterKosovo without significant resistance             Peacekeeping force In his March  speechClinton said US troops would join a peacekeeping force to implementNATOs peace plan if Milosevic accepted it A week later when a reporterpointed out that the peace plan was dead Clinton insisted that the Kosovarsmust nonetheless be allowed to return home and live safely That will requireclearly for some period of time some sort of international force that will beable to protect their security Clinton conceded US officials havealternately described this entity as an international peacekeeping forceinternational security presence implementation force andpostimplementation force            But ever since the Serbscaptured three US soldiers snooping around the YugoslavMacedonian border aweek ago peacekeeping has become a plastic term Clinton insisted thesoldiers were carrying out a peaceful mission in Macedoniaprotecting thatcountry from the violence in neighboring Kosovo The next day when reportersasked what the soldiers had been up to Lockhart insisted they were left therein a peaceful and peacekeeping fashion as a peacekeeping force This may bejust the first of many armed confrontations NATO plans to attribute to peaceWhen asked Sunday about NATOs plans to return Kosovar refugees to their homesNATOs military spokesman told CNN that the peacekeeping forces in Macedoniawere always planned to make sure that the Kosovar Albanians could live inpeace and harmony             Protectorate From the outsetClinton stipulated that US troops wouldnt fight for Kosovar independenceand Albright said the United States wouldnt impose an occupying force inKosovo Clinton told Rather it would not be appropriate to discuss creatinga Kosovar enclave that would keep NATO troops there forever When Ratherpointed out that Clintons pledge to guarantee the Kosovars securityamounted to the same thing Clinton asserted that this wasnt so and arguedthat he was only saying that the Kosovars were entitled to security Thismirrors Clintons favorite domestic policy spin arguing that Americans areentitled to assistance or protection eg a patients bill of rightswhile avoiding discussion of what it will cost Once Clinton ruled out anenclave anonymous senior administration officials came up with a new phrasefor the NATOguarded territory to which the Kosovars would return aninternational protectorate             Supporting the air campaign Clintons originalpromise to deliver air strikes against Serbian forces responsible for thebrutality in Kosovo without putting troops in Kosovo to fight a war hasproved to be selfcontradictory To hit the Serbs who are committing thebrutality NATO has to bring its forces down to the ground The first step inthis transition is the delivery of  US Army helicopters to Albania Thehelicopters are more like ground weapons than like air weapons They will flylow over Kosovo shoot at Serbian tanks and troops and risk being shot down inreturn Thats why they belong to the Army not the Air Force To protect thehelicopters the United States is also sending  surfacetosurface rocketlaunchersindisputably a ground weapon            To operate service and guard the helicoptersClinton is supplying  Army troops adding to the  NATO soldiers whoare arriving in the region to help refugees Everyone knows these troops aretrained for combat and can be quickly converted into an invading forceAlternatively the fuel and communications networks they will build can be usedto support an invasion US officials insist that at most these troops mightbe dispatched to escort Kosovars back to their villages once hostilitieshave ended Presumably these are alternative euphemisms for a peacekeepingmission in a permissive environment Nevertheless US officials assert thatthe helicopters and Army soldiers are an expansion of the air operationsupporting the air campaign and not a ground force            American hawks havecomplained for weeks that Clinton underestimated Milosevics rigidity Byswearing off ground forces they argued Clinton tied NATOs hands givingMilosevic confidence that he could destroy Kosovo without effective resistanceBut Milosevic in turn may have underestimated Clintons agility A presidentwho can talk his way out of a perjury rap can talk his way into a war
