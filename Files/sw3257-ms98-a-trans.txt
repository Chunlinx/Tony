        what do you like to watch on television Maureen     well  i guess a lot of the uh something thats kind of more of a comedy  we do have uh cable and we have premium stations like HBO and Showtime and such and i guess a lot of times when i first turn the TV on i i normally go to those because i pay for them im like i guess i want to see if theres anything i really want to see there so i dont end up watching the um   yes   prime time on some of the standard channels as much i i tend to go to my premium channels first   uhhuh uhhuh well we have cable but we only have Cinemax and uh i think our favorite night is uh Monday night and we start out with Evening Shade     umhum umhum   and Major Dad and i think thats the one night that we really try to watch television you know my husbands always got it on im not always sitting down at it   umhum   yeah Monday nights pretty good with Murphy Brown and Designing Women   yes yes yes i just i love that all those that that two hours and uh now tonight i just finished up with that A Woman Called Jackie did you watch did you watch it   umhum uhhuh we had watched it uh i guess Sunday night and Monday night but we didnt get to watch it tonight   yeah it was it was pretty good it uh sometimes i like a dramatization and i like uh USA when they have their uh  uh mystery movies and things their made for TV movies   umhum umhum   and uh i like those and we very seldom watch any uh Public Television channel thirteen do you watch it much   the only night we tend to watch some of that is on Sunday nights starting fairly late like im talking ten oclock and maybe till midnight they have some British comedy   yes   that weve weve really liked a theres a variety some of them is uh Black Adder or Good Neighbors or Yes Prime Minister and Are You Being Served they they rotate those around       and um we like that British comedy British comedy is very fast you really have to listen but   yes it is now we havent watched any of those   theyre real good but they do come on kind of late but we really do enjoy those sometimes we get to watching some stuff on Discovery Channel   yes now we have watched some things on that   and im amazed sometimes what i see on there  but im very intrigued i one time i was watching a operation and i thought gee i i dont believe im watching this   yeah we had uh i dont know my husband loves to uh that male syndrome of flicking that channel thing you know and hes flipping around there and       and he went by and he said whoops and he  backed up and you know theres this surgery going on as were eating our dinner  you know and and im saying lets move right on     yeah yeah right right   but our grandchildren like that Discovery Channel if theyre over here because lots of times they will have things on uh animals and they just thoroughly   umhum umhum   you know enjoy that in fact i think they were watching something on uh   umhum   whales or killer sharks sharks one or the other  couple of weeks ago over here and uh so we have watched that and uh  otherwise  of course my husbands into the football   umhum umhum umhum oh   and you know i will watch that some if im reading or doing something else you know with him and uh but other   right yeah im not into watching sports now my husband likes to watch football hes not really into uh baseball or basketball too much but uh football soon as its fall then he likes to watch college on Saturday and then of course Cowboys on Sunday   yes   yes and sometimes now were getting it that uh the other football where they play it inside and you know im hollering this is a you know this is too much       Saturdays and Sundays this is fine but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring  you know all of that and uh but he will uh hell flip around i think the other night we had on uh   yeah um   uh it was a it was car races some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down i dont know what channel he found that on   hm   and uh but he will turn that on especially for if again if our uh oldest grandson is over here hes ten and uh theyll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it i you know   umhum     i keep telling him its the same mentality there you know somethings wrong  and uh but uh and we very seldom watch television on a Friday night or Saturday night because were not home     oh   and uh so and Sundays uh we usually have all of our kids are over on Sunday so you know we dont get into that except that sometimes well get into the home videos   um   do you ever watch that   yeah the you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff yeah those are pretty good  yeah   yeah umhum that are sometimes so dumb   but true to life i mean some of the those   but very true to life i mean ive seen our family in several of those situations
