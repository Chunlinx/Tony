                    Background        In the United States infant mortality rates remain more        than twice as high for African Americans as compared to        other racial groups such as nonHispanic Whites        Hispanics and AsiansPacific Islanders     Two of the        objectives for Healthy People  and  are to        eliminate the racial disparities in infant mortality and        increase participation in prenatal care particularly for        AfricanAmericans             In  Washington DC DC a primarily African        American urban community reported significantly higher        infant mortality rate than the national averages in fact        the highest rate of infant deaths compared to any state in        the United States  infant deaths live births in         almost twice the national rate of      In        addition Black infant mortality in  in DC was four        times higher than for Whites  vs  infant        deaths live births respectively     Although        decreasing each year the infant mortality disparity in        DC remains            Prenatal provider practice is built on the notion that        early and regular care according to the American College        of Obstetrics and Gynecology ACOG schedules    is        important The relationship of prenatal care PNC to lower        infant mortality in general may be controversial                 but in populations at high medical and social        risk such as minority women residing in DC        comparatively low PNC utilization and high infant mortality        coexist and are potentially related        Nationally fewer African American women enter prenatal        care PNC beginning in the first trimester as compared to        White women  and  respectively in             The disparity is even greater in DC  and         respectively in      Minority women from poor        urban communities such as D C enter prenatal care later        and have fewer prenatal care visits than white women of        higher socioeconomic levels      Women who make        little or no use of prenatal care often are disenfranchised        members of the community such as homeless and substance        abusing women      In DC many people        particularly those from disenfranchised communities do not        believe that prenatal care is important                 Further although there is no mandatory reporting of        drug use during pregnancy in DC drug dependent women        exhibit late prenatal care initiation and less utilization                   Prior studies have sought to understand the reasons for        poor prenatal care utilization among disenfranchised women        Documented barriers to prenatal care among similar        populations include  previous unsatisfying experiences        with prenatal services including culturally inappropriate        care           unplanned or denied        pregnancy         avoidance of sanctions for        poor health habits such as drug and alcohol use risky        sexual behaviors heavy smoking and eating disorders                  stress or depression                homelessness         poor treatment in        the system due to race particularly for African Americans                  beliefs about the importance of        initiation and compliance with prenatal care             and  financial issues       While we understand        some of the barriers health care providers need to better        understand what attracts vulnerable urban women to and        retains them in prenatal care          To        address issues related to initiation and compliance with        prenatal care and its association with infant mortality in        DC the National Institutes of Health NIH National        Institute of Child Health and Human Development NICHD and        the NIH Office of Research on Minority Health ORMH        sponsored this study of barriers and motivators of prenatal        care as identified by vulnerable hard to reach        populations The study reported here includes current and        retrospective observances about prenatal care obtained        through focus group methodology                    Methods                  Focus groups          Eighteen focus groups were conducted There were four          types each conducted with at least  groups to allow          participant comments to reach saturation the process of          ceasing to encounter new information on the topic              Participants were identified through care center          representatives community activists and shelter          administrators Five groups were conducted with homeless          childbearing age women hereafter referred to as homeless          women focus groups Four were conducted with          childbearing aged women with a history of substance abuse          hereafter referred to as drugdependent women focus          groups Four were conducted with male significant others          of homeless childbearing age women hereafter referred          to as male significant others focus groups Five were          conducted with members of a community with high infant          mortality and poverty indices and low incidence of          adequate prenatal care    hereafter referred to as          community focus groups Each focus group in the          community had specific types of participants pregnant          and postpartum women two focus groups grandmothers          one focus group community leaders one focus group          and men who had fathered at least one child and were          currently partners of child bearing age women one focus          group Prior to conducting focus groups the study had          IRB clearance from all participating institutions and all          researchers were trained in focus group methodology                          Sample description          The findings represent the views of  people with          characteristics as presented in Table  The participants          tended to be older since participants were purposively          chosen for experience with the system and for          characteristics drugdependence homelessness that          develop over time Teenagers were not excluded          The four general types of focus groups each comprised          approximately onefourth of the sample The community          focus groups totalparticipants n   conducted in          community sites included pregnant and postpartum women          n   grandmothers n   community leaders n            and male partners of childbearing age women n            The drugdependent women focus groups conducted in          shelters or treatment facilities included pregnant and          postpartum women n   and women of childbearing age          n   The homeless women focus groups conducted in          shelters included pregnant and postpartum women n            and women of childbearing age with at least one child n            The male significant other focus groups included           men                          Focus group description          Prior to conducting focus groups issues related to          access to prenatal care were identified from literature          review and expert opinion An overall guide was          developed which included the following questions          minimally adjusted by type of group          What do people in D Cin your communitywith your          lifestyle do to keep themselves and their children          healthy          When I say prenatal care what do you think of          Many people find it difficult at least some of the          time to keep their prenatal care appointments What          barriers might prevent a woman from receiving prenatal          care in the District          What motivates women to start and keep getting          prenatal care          What kind of help would encourage women in the          Districtin your communitywith your lifestyle to get          prenatal care          So that focus groups were as consistent as possible          specific probes and followup questions were included in          the script          Focus groups were conducted by teams that included          AfricanAmerican and White women and men There was          racial diversity in each team which consisted of a          trained moderator assistant moderator and note          takeradministrator For the twohour focus groups          participants were given  as reimbursement for their          time Although childcare was available occasionally          children were present All focus group responses were          audiotape recorded and transcribed          When the groups met the moderator assistant          moderator and note taker welcomed and oriented the          subjects individually and obtained informed consent The          moderator presented ground rules to the participants and          discussed the purpose of the study as to solicit their          views of prenatal care Assurances were given that all          opinions were welcomed no answer was right or wrong and          that all comments would remain anonymous and          confidential                          Analyzing and validating data          As focus groups were completed qualitative analysis          proceeded using an evaluative approach    with          emphasis on counting to enhance validity     Data          were transcribed verbatim by outside transcribers Only          minor editorial changes were made to ensure accuracy of          example quotes Subject identifiers were eliminated Data          were read and organized into beginning themes with no          limitations put on numbers of themes Themes were          inductively identified that emerged from the data then          codes were developed to represent them              Ethnograph was used as a tool for data management               Using Ethnograph segments of data were coded and          sorted by code examined recombined or collapsed          After coding the research team chose the themes that          indicated possible system reform The approach to reform          was through organizational change as defined as how to          enhance human service organization effectiveness in          relating to clients with a goal of increasing the          effectiveness of the services provided to the client          population served                              Coding process          The process of coding the data ensured a high degree          of accuracy agreement and rigor through coding and          recoding to validate important issues     Ten          members of the research team described as first level          coders were oriented to qualitative evaluative methods          as advised by Patton     and assisted in identifying          initial codes Each transcript was first evaluated by two          researchers and then reevaluated by a specially trained          team focused on identifying codes representing          frequently mentioned relevant issues Consistent with          inductive analysis the number of codes was expanded as          each transcript was evaluated Codes were added to the          scheme as there was repetition approximately  or more          times Further evaluation compared codes for          consistency completeness and relevance to system          change To ensure interrater consistency a final          researcher recoded all documents using the developed          coding scheme Adjustments were made in the coding scheme          when minor differences in interpretation were identified          The codes that emerged were further classified as          barriers or motivators of prenatal care utilization          Coded transcripts were returned to researchers who          conducted each type of focus group for final validation          of codes          Due to the richness of the data set and to present a          cogent discussion of the variety of codes that emerged          issues were prioritized Using an approach suggested by          Miles and Huberman     counting of final codes          representing barriers and motivators was used to draw and          verify conclusions The codes representing the ten          barriers and motivators that were identified most          frequently in all groups were culled from the data and          were compared across type of focus group For this paper          using Shulmans definition of systems     the          research barriers to or motivators of prenatal care          related to systems or organizational change This          approach was chosen because social medical and          educational systems may be hard to access for both          individuals well equipped to handle them as well as those          with limited education and resources     The          services established for people are often so complex that          it is difficult for individuals to make use of them                            Results                  Views of the total sample                      Theme one drug lifestyle            One of the pervasive themes apparent in all types of            focus group was related to drug lifestyle From            community focus groups this was the most frequent code            representing a barrier to prenatal care Women voiced            that drug lifestyles delayed initiation of prenatal            care Women also feared that their provider would find            out about current drug use This was particularly            poignant in community focus groups as the sampling was            not purposive for substance abusers yet drug            lifestyles were defining issues for the community A            community member summed it up in the following                          Their priority is drugs and the              appointment is secondary                         In drugdependent women focus groups drug lifestyle            was also the most frequently mentioned barrier to            prenatal care The drug lifestyle dominated any concern            about having prenatal care As one focus group            participant put it                          The fast life just plain              laziness withdrawal symptoms                         prevented adherence to prenatal care            Another said                          Do you think that Im going to              look at my watch and say its nine oclock              everybody so put down the crack pipe so I can go              to my prenatal care appointment                         Another participant in the substance abusing women            focus group summed it up as follows                          I was using heroin and crack              cocaine What led me here detox was I was sick and              tired of being sick and tired and I knew I could be a              better parent to my children and I just was tired I              was fed up and I just couldnt take it no more I was              just worn out and I knew that my mother was a drug              user and I knew that it kept her away from me and I              knew how I felt by my grandmother raising me my whole              entire life                         For homeless participants the effect of drug use on            the unborn child and the new baby was important This            concern is characterized in the following quotes                          I was so far out drugging and              using I had a son that was born he was born at five              months he weighted  lb and  oz I had him at              hospital and they were really looking for him to              die because it was no way that he was suppose to              survive that young Thank the Lord that he did and              now he is four years old now He has a respiratory              problem he has to have a machine So far he is doing              okay That was due to my addiction not getting the              proper prenatal care because I just drugged all the              time                                       Just because the baby have all              parts of their body you still cannot tell whether              you gonna affect that baby later on in life thats              what a lot of people fail to realize you know they              can have learning disabilities                                       On TV I see these babies with the              bottle in their mouth and I was drugging in my first              month I just started crying and I said I cant do              this to my child So I stopped I just stopped              Every time I got pregnant I could stop drugging Soon              after I had that baby I just went right on              back                         Significant others focus groups were also quite            revealing about how the drug lifestyle was a barrier to            prenatal care as in the following quotes                          And I was out there smoking crack              So I wasnt there for her and I blame myself for that              because if I had been there not saying that she              wouldnt have had a miscarriage but maybe I could              have got her to the hospital Maybe just being there              to support Maybe other women are experiencing that              too That the father of the unborn child is not              around Maybe they are worried that he dont              care                         One aspect of drug lifestyle prenatal caredrug            treatment interaction was mentioned as an important            potential motivator Prenatal care and drug treatment            facilitated each other through interacting requirements            that women in detoxification programs receive prenatal            care and women in prenatal care abusing drugs receive            high priority referrals for detoxification            centersprograms detox Participants noted that to            receive a referral into drug treatment one must first            enter detox However according to focus group            participants if they were not currently drugging they            could not get detox treatment Thus to get into detox            participants reported using drugs before going for            prenatal care causing positive drug urine screens            resulting in priority detox referrals                                Theme two role of babys father            For all focus group participants the most            frequently mentioned motivator was the role of babys            father When there was male involvement there was a            belief that the womans overall condition improved For            example one significant other focus group participant            commented                          When my girlfriend was pregnant              she had to take care of this take care of that              and she was smoking and drinking and I was going              behind her saying thats the wrong thing to be doing              Wont you do this In certain ways I stood behind              her to make sure she was doing the right things              She started going to programs and liking them              You must make sure that they make appointments on              time and just spend the time                         One significant other participant summed up the            majority of the groups feelings when he said                          and the Black male what we can              do is be the support unit for them we could be a              shoulder for them in a way where we could take them              to their appointments if we have time or we could be              a sounding board for them if they have problems If              theyre eating the wrong food try to convince them              to eat the right food cause not only are they              carrying the babies themselves if were the father              its our baby also And if its not our baby we still              play a part because its part of our generation so              well be a community                         While the men strongly vocalized the need to support            women they admitted that their actual behavior could            be a barrier to care Two quotes significant others            illustrate this                           Lets not lose perspective              here Now we admit we have an obligation too Im              saying that the women are out there too but we as              men have an obligation We give these babies to these              women Why cant we take some time out and tell the              woman what she needs to do even though she may not              listen Why cant we say give me the baby Ill              take it to the doctor                                          Some men are scared of              responsibility so they are gonna say whatever they              think could hurt the woman and or mess the woman up              to the point that it mess her and the baby up make              them wait or what have you Scared of              responsibility                         A grandmother participant of the community focus            groups also voiced this issue as in the following            quote                         because theres a lot of children            being born that if born will never know their fathers            because theyre killed Thats a setback for the            mothers then the mothers are going to be father and            mother and thats a strain Thats a strain on one            persona young person too No dont be kind Be            blunt Be to the point How many of you still have that            man How many of you even see that man How many of you            even talk to him on the phone even know where he is            if hes not in Lords  most of em are in Lords you            know thats in the cemetery But the ones that are            still alive and not locked up theyre out there with            some other dummy pregnant thinking the same thing            that youre thinking             Further a community leader said                          And somebodys going to have to              sit up some place in an auditorium in a school and              ask the pertinent question how many of you all think              you all are going to keep your men by having a              baby                         Participants in the drugdependant women focus            groups supported that role of babys father was a            barrier to care as in the following                          I didnt go for my prenatal care              or nothing I stayed home I was lazy wouldnt do              nothing My babys father sent me through so much              stuff I was like forget it                                             Third general theme staff or provider            attitude            The attitude of health care providers and staff was            another important issue although not as pervasive as            drug lifestyle or role of babys father This code            representing a barrier to prenatal care was frequently            identified in all group types except significant            others            Staff attitude was generally framed such that if            staff were friendly it would motivate care as in the            following from drug dependent women focus groups                          Thank you And how are you And              Good morning how did you rest last night We got to              go back to the basics they need to start taking a              group and start sending them out to seminars Start              having these seminars where learning to care if              youre in that field you got to learn how to care              about people or what the hell are you doing with              that type of job                         One participant said                          When providers find out you use              drugs they treat you bad ie like an addict              They put you on the table like youre a piece of              meat it all has to do with oh youve been sent              over here from treatment site you know what Im              saying Addicts being addicts under privileged and              you done been through the ringer and youre trying to              get your life back into perspective and they treat              you like a bunch of crap                         Significant others in the community focus groups            also saw staff or provider attitudes as important as            in the following                          I will come back But first you              have to motivate me to get me in the door Maybe              youre looking for a program something that              teenagers are looking for whatever gimmick to get me              in there                         Homeless women emphasized the complexity of this            issue in the following quote                          nurses and staff And they need              to advertise it to the community not just come free              for a service anywhere you coming free for a              service that is a good service that you would receive              anywhere else You need not know its a free              service                         Substance abusing women stated the following                          In the community they say you              better go to the doctor you know youre suppose to              go to the doctor but you dont want to go to the              doctor because the doctor is not private anymore              Hes got a list and he tells everybody he              knowsbecause there is no one there with that              oneonone kind of treatment Its just like yeah              your pregnant get in line wait your turn                                                   Discussion        This study provided an opportunity to listen to        perceptions of some of the most vulnerable people in urban        settings the homeless the substance abusing and members        of highrisk communities The focus group painted a        collective rather than individualistic view of health        attitudes beliefs and experiences in the community The        candor of the quotes attests to the ability of the        researchers to elicit and be open to whatever remarks        participants were willing to contribute It is important to        note that the researchers learned much about what prohibits        and what encourages utilization of prenatal care However        more important is the lesson that utilization of prenatal        care must be viewed in context of peoples lives ie the        complexity of surviving in vulnerable situations        overshadows the need for prenatal care Some issues were        more relevant for certain types of groups than others        This study presents issues that are reported to be        barriers to prenatal care as well as motivators of care        The three pervasive issues were so dominant that they        should be considered by any group seeking to provide        relevant prenatal care services to vulnerable populations        These issues drug lifestyle role of babys father and        attitudes of health care providers and staff emphasize the        importance of developing healthcare policies that meet the        perceived needs of the population served In published        literature about barriers to care influences of drug        lifestyles and poor treatment in the system are documented        barriers However the role of babys father has not        frequently been articulated as either a barrier of        motivator Real creativity is needed to include fathers in        development of prenatal care services as well as in the        health care delivery system to provide relevant easily        accessible care One way that prenatal care should be        modeled based on these findings would be to include an        emphasis on developing an environment hospitable to        individual clients an alertness to drug dependent        lifestyles and an emphasis on inclusion of the babys        father in every aspect of care Although drug lifestyles        are typically identified as barriers to prenatal care        providers and staff need to be alerted to the notion that        occasionally drug use might also interact with prenatal        care to facilitate access to both prenatal care and drug        treatment As in DC there is no mandatory reporting of        maternal substance use during pregnancy the fear of        discovery of illicit drug use is not a reason for non        participation in prenatal care Rather the hope of getting        into drug treatment facilities may have prompted women to        present for prenatal care since drug treatment facilities        catering to pregnant women and women with small children        are scarce                    Conclusions        The pervasiveness of drug lifestyle is one that has been        only moderately well addressed in current care systems        Inpatient drug treatment is often overcrowded and        inaccessible although women pointed out that pregnancy        could break down some of the barriers to drug treatment        which in turn provided access to prenatal care In        outpatient prenatal care settings it was apparent that not        only did drug use interfere with obtaining care but also        sometimes the outpatient care received was perceived as        judgmental inadequate or irrelevant for their real need        to address substance abuse issues Designing prenatal care        that includes expertise in drug related issues and        incorporating drug treatment in care are possible        interventions The provision of more drug treatment        facilities that cater to pregnant and postpartum women        should be considered an imperative        The role of babys father requires a concerted focus        The babys father as a barrier to be overcome as well as        his usefulness as a motivator or facilitator of care must        be considered in the design of prenatal care systems        Fathers can no longer be an observer to care particularly        for vulnerable women Emphasizing their role in prenatal        care may have many benefits among them adding to the        prenatal care experience and encouraging stronger families        in the future Separate programs focusing on fathers and        expectant fathers that address unique male issues and        parenting programs would be a benefit to this        community        In designing prenatal care systems the importance of        health care providers and staff attitudes cannot be        overemphasized As presented by subjects what can        facilitate care with openness and helpfulness to the most        vulnerable can also block care when attitudes are        threatening or judgmental Addressing this issue is not        simple Providers are tasked with emotionally draining work        and may have few resources which may be reflected in their        attitudes As providers and staff gain skill working with        vulnerable families they become qualified for and move on        to less difficult jobs Each system should evaluate        communication patterns with vulnerable women with an        emphasis on providing clear and nonjudgmental        communication Support staff such as appointment clerks        WIC personnel and nurses aids should also be trained to        communicate with patients in a respectful way Clinics        providing prenatal care could have occasional peer        evaluation of their communication patterns as well as        ombudsmen to function as client advocates and help them        feel more of a part of the system        As with any qualitative study there are certain        limitations     There was no verification of subjects        actual prenatal care experiences Rather the information        provided by the subjects was considered to be honest and to        accurately represent their experiences Although the goal        was to include hardtoreach women by definition the        hardest to reach may not have been willing to participate        In spite of these limitations qualitative methods were        appropriate for this study as these methods are superior to        quantitative in allowing for contextual meanings of events        from personal perspectives            In conclusion to design a prenatal care system that is        relevant to the vulnerable people of urban communities will        take creativity thoughtfulness and sensitivity There        must be frequent interaction with mothers fathers and        providers There must be an increased availability and        access to drug treatment that is sensitive to pregnant and        postpartum women in an urban society Strategies should be        developed to promote understanding of what is included in        sensitive care among providers and consumers                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions
