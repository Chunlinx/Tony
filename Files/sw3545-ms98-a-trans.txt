                okay um tell me about where you live   i live in uh Richardson area   uhhuh   just close to uh Richland College do you live in the area too   yeah no i live in Houston   oh okay   although i did live in Dallas for uh six years up until uh nineteen ninety and then i i moved to Houston   hm umhum   but uh i uh had lived in Houston before and uh from nineteen eighty to nineteen eighty four and uh lived worked downtown   uhhuh   and when i was transferred from Atlanta uh to Houston i i bought a condo in southwest Houston   uhhuh   no and i clocked it and it was only nine miles from the office and of course didnt think that would be bad uh but the only time i ever drove it was not during rush hour   right   so so after it was a rude awakening to me to find out what i faced every morning and every afternoon in Houston traffic because where i lived in Atlanta was i lived right on Peachtree um a mile and a half from the office   oh uhhuh   and so i wasnt accustomed to commuting and it nearly killed me so whenever i moved back to Houston i said i i declared that i would not live where i had to drive on the freeways so now i live   um   in really inner city and uh but its only it takes me about ten minutes to get to the office and i love it   umhum well what kind of a a house is it now are you still in a condo   well im in an apartment   oh okay   but uh  its just i dont know its uh i mean most most of the people that i work with you know commute in anywhere from thirty to forty five minutes some of them an hour or more one way   umhum   and you know  i mean ive ive had a house before and i mean and its nice but its just not worth it to me to sit behind the wheel of a car for that long   right   i just i cant do it so   right   anyway im very im im pretty content for the time being where i am     oh we um rent a duplex right now and its only like a couple of miles from where i work its a little bit further for my husband we used to both work at the same building at TI and it was only like two miles from the uh duplex   uhhuh   now hes moved but hes going against the flow of the traffic so its not too bad of a commute it only takes him about fifteen minutes   uhhuh that isnt that isnt bad really   no he can get on the highway and  hes going north whereas most of the people are like in Plano going south so hes you know in a good situation because the traffic is not as heavy in his direction but weve been looking for a house but  the first consideration to us is location you know they keep building   yeah   further and further out and of course you can get more house for the money and stuff but you know to me im the same way that day to day commute i dont like   right uh you know its like i said i i mean ive even had people at the office ask me they say how do you justify paying the kind of money you pay for rent because i do pay a lot of money every month for rent i dont deny it but at the same time i said well you know lets think about it  i said i drive um less than ten miles a day roundtrip and they go you know theyre jaws dropped and then and then they go and i spend way less than thirty minutes a day       roundtrip commuting and you know that doesnt thats regardless of the weather if its raining it still doesnt take me any longer i mean sometimes whenever and you know how Houston is its just so flat   uhhuh   and we have these torrential downpours sometimes and people literally get you know traffic gets backed up with the wrecks and everything and itll take them an hour and a half to get to work   umhum   and theyre just frayed by the time they get there i think no way so   yeah and i think too now we both have little bit older cars i mean both our cars are over ten years old now if you get a house if you buy a house more for your money further out youre gonna have to have a pretty decent car and put a lot into uh your car payments and your gas and stuff   thats right   i mean you know if youve got to drive it sixty miles a day youre gonna go through that car a heck of a lot faster than what we did i mean thats not something people think about is the car the car payments and the gas   oh i agree with you a hundred percent since im um  moved got this place i mean i used to i can remember years ago when i worked especially whenever i lived in Houston before i used to put twenty thousand miles a year on my car   umhum   last year i put less than twelve on my car   um   you know and you you can really tell a difference i mean i just dont you know its just not   umhum   i dont have that expense and by the time i cut down the the cost of my insurance because my car insurance is a little bit less by living so close then the additional automobile expense   umhum   i dont know its i i thought about it  its i mean i would like to own again ive owned in the past but i dont know im im hesitant to give up the convenience   yeah   plus where i live is so well managed i mean if i have any little thing go wrong i just pick up the phone at the office i call my manager i said we got this problem i come home in the afternoon theres a note on my dining room table saying weve been in we fixed it let us know if theres a problem       you know i love it ill be honest with you hey it   umhum
