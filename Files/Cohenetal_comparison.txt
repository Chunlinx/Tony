A Comparison of the Burden of Universal Service in Italyand the United StatesRobert Cohen Rossana ScoccheraPostal Rate Commission Poste ItalianeCarla Pace Vincenzo Visco ComandiniPoste Italiane Poste ItalianeMatthew Robinson John WallerPostal Rate Commission Postal Rate CommissionGennaro Scarfiglieri Spyros XenakisPoste Italiane Postal Rate Commission INTRODUCTIONSamuel Johnson said Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundreland many postal observers believe that the Universal ServiceObligation USO is the last refuge of a postal service wishing toprotect inefficiency monopoly profits or economic rents Despiteinefficient service opaque accounts and large rents many postalofficials maintain that the monopoly whatever its faults is theonly means of ensuring universal affordable postal service forcitizens throughout the nation Without the monopoly they arguethe post office would be crushed by the cost of the USO This paperexamines when this argument might be validAll posts probably have some cost associated with the USO butit has been difficult to quantify We agree with John Panzar that the cost of the USO is the cost of the services that would notbe provided in a competitive market Under this definition inpractice there has been no discernable USO cost Competitionexists in both Sweden and New Zealand and the incumbent posts havecontinued to provide universal service with no subsidyThe USO as defined by the proponents of the monopoly goes wellbeyond ubiquitous service It also includes a uniform price withrespect to location of the recipient and a uniform frequency ofdelivery These conditions might have been appropriate a centuryago when the post was the primary means of communication Todayhowever this definition seems unduly restrictive It is incumbenton defenders of the restrictive definition of USO to explain whypostal service should be treatedThe views expressed in this paper are those of the authors anddo not necessarily represent the opinions of Poste Italiane or thePostal Rate CommissionIn other words a firm cannot charge more for delivering similaritems to addresses in one section of the country than anotherUnder this definition United Parcel Service UPS is not a trueuniversal service provider because it imposes a surcharge forresidential delivery This is ironic because UPS delivers to everyaddress in the continental US and delivers right to the door ThePostal Service which is a universal service provider under thedefinition used here delivers to mail boxes that are in manycases remote from the actual addressdifferently from other important products such as groceriesbank accounts and internet service Notwithstanding we use thisrestrictive definition of universal service for this paperThe obligation to provide ubiquitous service is not in itselfonerous It has been pointed out by the American coauthors of thispaper that a post could rationalize its delivery costs by reducingthe frequency of service on unprofitable routes to the point wherethey become profitable Cohen et al  A post could alsorationalize its prices by reflecting the cost of service todifferent areas The restrictive definition of the USO does notallow a post to rationalize either its cost or pricing structurethus creating creamskimming opportunities under liberalizationThe burden that the restrictive USO imposes on a post is theincrease in its unit costs resulting from cream skimming underliberalization caused by the requirements of uniform pricing andlevels of service We use the term burden of the USO todistinguish our concept from other papers that use the term costof the USOWe believe that insights into the burden of the USO can begained by comparing postal systems Assuming that the keenestinsights can be gained by comparing systems with large differencesthe Italian and United States systems are good candidates TheUS has the highest volume per capita in the industrial world pieces in  while Italy has one of the lowest  piecesin Previous work by Cohen et al shows that the US Postal ServiceUSPS is not likely to require the monopoly to continue to satisfythe USO Cohen   However this result may not apply toall posts and it is important to distinguish magnitudes of burdenfor different posts To this end we develop a model to determinethe USO burden for posts with different per capita volumes Inparticular applying the model demonstrates that the burden of USOis very great for Poste Italiane and other posts with small percapita volumes On the other hand for the US and other postswith large and medium per capita volumes the burden is smallWe first compare some statistics for Italy and the US We thenexamine the consequences of volume loss on postal systems in orderto provide a measure of burden in terms of increases in averageunit costs as volume is lost to competitors orMany postal services are increasingly becoming primarilycarriers of advertising US households receive far moreadvertising than letters bills or other similar matter Accordingto the Household Diary Study United States Postal Service in   percent of the pieces received by US households wereadvertising mailAn apparent exception is Consignia It rationalizes its deliverycost by delivering twice a day in most urban areas and once a dayin rural areasItaly has a very undeveloped direct mail market and the Italianmonopoly does not include direct mail TheUS monopoly includes all addressed direct mail consisting offewer than  pages The US Postal Service handled  pieces percapita of direct mail in equivalently the increase in average rates for the volumeremaining Next we introduce the concept of delivery route profitand quantify the relative profits from delivered mail and mail notrequiring delivery in both Italy and the US We then compare thedistribution of profit margins for routes in Italy and the US andthe effect this has on vulnerability to cream skimming Finally wediscuss two measures of the cost of universal service the entrypricing measure and the net avoided cost measure in the context ofdelivery profits We compare them with our burden measure for thePoste Italiane and the US Postal ServiceOur principal findings areThe burden of the USO is much greater for small per capitavolume posts than it is for large and medium per capita volumepostsThe likelihood of a graveyard spiral resulting from volume lossto cream skimmers is remote for medium to large volume per capitaposts whereas it is a real threat to small volume per capitapostsThe measure of burden presented here combined with thedistribution of route profit margins for Poste Italiane and theUS Postal Service yields results contrary to the entry price andnet avoided cost measures for the cost of the USOThe portion of mail not requiring delivery is a very importantcontributor to the finances of a post COMPARATIVE STATISTICSTable  contains some statistics for Italy and the US and fortheir postal administrations Italy has  percent of the USpopulation and  percent approximately one seventh of the USper capita volume Most of the delivery statistics in the tablessecond section are reasonably close to this  percent figure Thenumber of delivery points in Italy as a percentage of those in theUS is aTo provide a basis for comparing Poste Italiane and the USPostal Service we use a model of postal operations that followsthe structure of FY  costs in the US Postal ServiceParametric analyses are conducted by varying volume under differentassumptions about the extent that institutional cost varies overthe long run The model is validated for Poste Italiane by makingadjustments for major differences in the two posts such as theextent of worksharingPrices of goods and services vary between Italy and the UnitedStates and the prevailing market exchange rate does notnecessarily account for the relative differences in prices We haveused the Purchasing Power Parity PPP of  liras per USdollar to convert the  Italian statistics reported in Italianliras The PPP has been produced by the Organization of EconomicCoOperation and Development OECD and shows the number of Italianliras required in  to buy goods and services equivalent to whatcan be purchased with one US dollar In  the average marketexchange rate reported by the International Monetary Fund IMFwas  liras perUS dollardisproportionately high  percent The disproportionate numberof small business addresses in Italy Scarfiglieri and ViscoComandini  may help explain thisPoste Italiane also has disproportionately more delivery pointsper route This results from a much lower coverage percent ofaddresses receiving mail on a given day a higher populationdensity and other unexplored route and topographicalconsiderations We see in the fourth section that the US PostalService cost per piece is much lower than Poste Italiane cost perpiece despite having a much higher labor cost per employee This isprimarily a result of economies of scale worksharing and theextensive use of automationTable  Selected National and Postal Statistics for FYaItaly as Italy US Percent of US FinallyPopulation  Area Square Miles PopulationSquare Mile  Number of Households   we note that the

concept of the USO has many moredimensions than ubiquitous delivery However the crosssubsidythat results from ubiquitous delivery and uniform prices andfrequency of delivery is widely regarded as the most importantaspect of the USO mitigating against liberalization This paperwill be restricted to dealing with this aspectMotorcycles are the primary means of carrier transport in Italyand automobiles are the primary means in the USIt is also the result of the quantity of nondelivered mail SeeSection  RELATIVE IMPACT OF VOLUME LOSS ON POSTAL SYSTEMSThe burden of the USO on a postal system lies within its fixedcosts Ceteris paribus unit per piece fixed costs are higher ina low volume per capita system than in a high volume per capitasystem We examine the effect of volume on unit total costsThe sensitivity of cost to volume for a postal system can beinvestigated directly provided the ratio of fixed to variable costsis known by function Some postal administrations do not have thisinformation and some choose not to make it available to regulatorsor the public Consequently we have built a model to estimate therelationship between unit average costs and per capita volume The model is described in the appendix and includes parameters forthe portion of variable costs by major postal functions When theaverage unit cost is graphed as a function of volume per capita oneobtains a curve with a parabolic shape The exact shape of thecurve depends on the specific set of parameters used to benchmarkthe model such as the proportion of fixed costs at a specific percapita volume Because the cost behavior of the US Postal Servicehas been studied extensively and because US postal costs are themost transparent in the industrialized world we use US data from as provided in the most recent omnibus rate proceeding DocketNo R to benchmark the model Table  shows the USinstitutionalvariable percentages for the major postalfunctionsTable   US FixedVariable Cost By Major Function a FYaSource Postal Rate Commission Docket No RbDelivery includes inoffice and outofoffice costsBecause the US Postal Service may differ greatly from otherpostal systems in labor cost automation route topographyworksharing mix of mail by shape and the percentage ofnondelivered mail etc we cannot expect the cost estimatesfurnished by the model to be extremely accurate estimates ofparticular nonUS systems For ourWe use pieces per capita rather than total volume to normalizethe volumeThis model has been developed on the assumption that the costbehavior of postal administrations is essentially similar Thefunctions of collection delivery transportation processing andwindow services are common to the postal administrations of allindustrialized countriespurposes we do not need great accuracy we only need reasonableestimates in order to examine the sensitivity of total unit cost tovolume per capitaThe fixed portion of nondelivery costs would be expected tochange as we move from higher volume administrations to lowervolume ones It would be expected that lower volume postaladministrations would try to keep them small to reduce the burdenon rate payers Since these costs are variable in the long run andwe do not know how other postal administrations deal with them weparameterize them for purposes of modelingAs a preliminary matter using the fixedvariable ratios forUS Postal Service costs from Table  Figure  shows that as percapita volume increases the mail processing proportion of totalcost will increase and the delivery proportion will decrease Thisis because mailprocessing costs are almost all variable whiledelivery costs have a very large fixed component Since the USvolume per capita is the highest in the world the US PostalService delivery costs proportion should be the smallest of anypostal service On the other hand Poste Italiane per capita volumeis among the lowest in the industrialized world and so itsdelivery costs proportion should be among the highestFigure  Functional Percentage of Total CostsBenchmarked by US Costs and Volumes with  of NonDeliveryInstitutional Costs LongRun VariablePercentage of Total CostsPieces per CapitaAgain using the ratios for US Postal Service costs in Table Figure  shows the variability of the major functions as per capitavolume changes It can be seen that at low volumes mail processingand transportation costs have a high degree of fixity while at highvolumes they are almost all variableFigure  M odeled Variabilities by FunctionB enchm arked by U S  C o sts and V o lu m es w ith  of

ofnondelivery fixed costs as shown in the legend It appears thatunit costs are not very sensitive to changes in per capita volumeat the high end but are quite sensitive at the low end Forexample a tenpercent reduction in pieces per capita for the USPostal Service would result in costs increasing about one cent Atenpercent reduction for a post at  pieces per capita wouldincrease unit costs by nine cents The increase in unit costresulting from a tenpercent decrease in per capita volume for arange of volumes is shown in Table Figure  Model Estimates of Unit CosBenchmarked by US Costs and

of the USO netrevenue losses revenue minus cost must be made up from theremaining volume to maintain breakeven status The burden measurequantifies the resulting increase in unit cost and revenue thatmust be made up from each piece of mail that remains in the systemAn important question is whether the rate increases would lead to agraveyard spiral We think the burden measure provides an answer tothis questionInsofar as the burden of the USO might introduce a death spiralCrew and Kleindorfer  owing to the loss of volume because ofliberalization the probability seems slight until per capitavolumes are in the  to piece range Below that point thepossibility of a death spiral increases rapidly Thus we concludethat the burden of the USO is much greater for low per capitavolume posts than for medium to high volume onesIn order to make the model more useful for comparing PosteItaliane and the US Postal Service we adjust model costs toaccount for important known differences Since worksharingactivities reduce United States costs by about  percent Cohen etal  we increase model costs to account for the lack ofworksharing in Italy The portion of the model costs that are laborcosts is adjusted downwards to reflect hourly labor costdifferences between Poste Italiane and the US Postal Service Inaddition model costs are adjusted to reflect the Poste Italianeproportion of lowcost letters and cards mediumcost flats andhighcost parcels The appendix describes the adjustment factorsTable  shows estimates of Poste Italiane unit costs derived usingthe modelIt can be seen that the model comes fairly close to PosteItaliane unit costs Of course the model could be further refinedto account for many more specific differences We leave thatproject for another day Nonetheless we think the model issufficiently accurate to allow us to draw a major conclusion theburden of universal service is highly dependent on volume percapita so policies suitable for liberalizing medium and large percapita volume posts are likely not suitable for small per capitavolume postsGreece Italy Portugal and Spain have per capita volumes belowTable  Model Estimates of Poste Italiane Unit Costs Based

Cost  PROFITS FROM DELIVERED AND NONDELIVERED MAILBecause of the interest in the USO and crosssubsidy within thedelivery system it is important to define the concept of routeprofit and loss We define the profitability of a delivery routeas the revenue generated by the mail delivered on the route minusthe attributable upstream costs of the mail delivered and the totalcost of the route Cohen et al  Some mail handled by apostal service does not require delivery recipients pick up mailfrom post office boxes and large volume recipients pick up mail inbulk from designated counters Nondelivered mail can also beconsidered to have delivery profits in the same manner as deliveredmailA postal service has variable and fixed upstream costs as wellas variable and fixed delivery costs In a breakeven postal servicetotal delivery profits from all routes plus profits fromnondelivered mail must equal fixed upstream costs Put anotherway fixed upstream costs minus profits from nondelivered mailmust equal delivery profitsIn order to compare profits from delivered and nondeliveredmail in Italy and theUS we increase Poste Italiane revenue by  percent so that itequals cost and is thus at breakeven Table  shows thatnondelivered mail accounts for a very disproportionate share ofdelivery profits in both posts and presumably in all posts Themost obvious reason for this is that nondelivered mail incurs nocarrier delivery cost In addition although many delivery routesare highly profitable losses from unprofitable routes reduce thenet delivery profit from delivered mailIn the United States this is frequently called firm holdoutmailRevenue minus attributable upstream costs that includes thesmall amount of costs for noncarrier box or counter deliveryactivities associated with nondelivered mailAn analogous identity holds for a post at any given profitlossData in this paper are from  In that year the US PostalService had profits of  million and total revenue of billionTable  Distribution of Volume and Profits betweenDelivered and Nondelivered MailPercentItaly US Volume Profits Volume ProfitsDelivered    Nondelivered   Because total delivery profits from delivered and nondeliveredmail must equal fixed upstream costs nondelivered mail plays animportant role in reducing the revenue needs of a breakeven postCeteris paribus the higher the proportion of nondelivered mailthe lower the rates that a breakeven post must charge Thus thehigher the proportion of nondelivered mail the less opportunitythere is for a cream skimmer to undercut the incumbentMoreover highly profitable nondelivered mail is much lessvulnerable to diversion DISTRIBUTION OF ROUTE PROFIT MARGINS AND VULNERABILITY TOCREAM SKIMMINGVolumes revenues and route profits differ widely on routes inboth Italy and theUS The uniform pricing constraint of the USO creates creamskimming possibilities because an entrant can target only highlyprofitable routes and charge a price below the uniform priceConsequently it is not crosssubsidy per se that allows creamskimming All routes could be above incremental cost and theproblem would still exist Cream skimming stems from the uniformpricing and service constraints given that routes have disparateprofits and not necessarily from the need to crosssubsidizeroutesWe would expect that the USPSs percentage of nondelivered mailto be among the highest of industrialized country posts because theUS payment system involves a large fraction of financialtransactions paid by check and mailed to large volume recipientsThis mail is generally picked up by them or their agents at apost office ie it is nondelivered mailIn a small per capita volume post the fixed cost of deliveryrepresents a larger share of total cost than in a large per capitavolume post Ceteris paribus per piece profit from nondeliveredmail is greater in a small per capita volume post than in a largeoneMany of the  million boxholders in the United States do notwant mail delivered to their premises We cannot quantify thenumber but presumably this is an important reason why mailrecipients rent a post office box These box holders would not begood candidates for cream skimmers Fiftysix percent ofnondelivered mail is single piece It is not likely that creamskimmers would be able to successfully put a collection system inplace to capture much of this mail Of the  percent ofnondelivered mail that remains  percent is First Class much ofwhich is time sensitive According to most models of creamskimming delivery frequency would be reduced Time sensitive FirstClass would be less likely to make use of a service with lessfrequent delivery Finally nonsingle piece mail addressed to boxholders is being transported and delivered over large areas of thenation A delivery cream skimmer would have to have a nationalpresence to compete for this mail This means much of the mailcould not be handled by local niche players or even regional creamskimmersThe more revenue that leaves the system because of creamskimming the more rates must be increased on the remaining mail tomaintain a breakeven status Consequently the greater the share ofsystemwide revenue that is from high margin routes the greaterimpact that cream skimming could have on a postal administrationIn order to compare the possible effect of cream skimming on theItalian and US postal administrations we have arrayed theirroutes by profit margin using FY  data Again we have adjustedthe Poste Italiane revenue to breakeven in order to facilitatecomparisonFigure  displays the profit margin of routes arrayed bysemideciles The most profitable Italian semidecile has a marginof just over  percent while the most profitable US semidecilehas a margin of over  percent However a greater percentage ofItalian routes are profitable than US routesWe do not know the profit margin that would actually attractcream skimmers If it is  percent then  percent of US routeswould be vulnerable and less than  percent of Italian routes wouldbe vulnerableVirtually all profitable routes in Italy are urban In the USonly about half of the routes served by city carriers areprofitable while three quarters of the routes served by ruralcarriers are profitable It may well be that competition is muchmore likely to develop in urban areas If so Poste Italiane wouldbe at greater risk from cream skimmers than the US PostalServiceFor purposes of this discussion profit margin is defined as theratio of delivery profits to route costs ie upstream variableplus total delivery costIn the US about one fifth of the routes served by ruralcarriers are in highdensity suburban areasAverage Profit margin Percentage         Semidecile Routes by  IncrementsaRevenue for Poste Italiane is increased by  to createbreakeven conditionsThe percent of total revenue by semidecile is shown in Table At every semidecile except the first Poste Italiane receives agreater percentage of total revenue than the US Postal ServiceThis is due to the fact that a much larger percentage of USrevenue comes from undelivered mailThe distribution of profitable routes shown on Figure indicates that the US Postal Services revenue volume per routeis much more skewed than Poste Italianes as measured by therelative size of the bars at the extremes This would tend to maketheUS Postal Service more attractive to cream skimmers than PosteItaliane at most profit thresholds This skewness results frommail volume being highly correlated with income and US incomedistribution being much more skewed than Italian incomedistribution Berthelemy and Toledano  Kolin and Smith In fact the US has the most skewed income distribution of anyindustrialized country as measured by the World Banks Gini IndexThe US Gini Index is  while Italys is  Thus Italyshould be fairly typical of the distribution of route profitmargins of industrial countries and the US should be anoutlierWorld Development Indicators  Table  The World BankWashington DC

revenue are highly correlated if volume islost to cream skimming then revenue is also lost Figure  andTable  can be used to estimate likely profit and revenue losses tocream skimmers and Figure  to estimate the cost impact of volumelosses Depending on the threshold selected the potential impacton the respective posts can be comparedWe doubt that cream skimmers could capture even a majority ofthe volume on any route owing to the limited amount of contestablevolume in the US and perhaps other countries Nevertheless tothe extent that volume would be lost to cream skimmers the impacton Poste Italiane would be greater than on the US PostalServiceAs mentioned above the Italian data have been adjusted forbreakeven Had we not done this very few Italian routes would beprofitable A postal service that is below breakeven will be lessattractive to cream skimmers than otherwise On the other hand ifa postal service is above breakeven its routes will be even moreprofitable and hence more attractive to cream skimmers ENTRY PRICINGThe entry pricing measure defines the cost of the USO as the sumof lost profits from entry by a competitor The form of entry thatwe consider is delivery cream skimming If an entrant were moreefficient than the incumbent then the USO would not cause the lostprofit Under the restrictive definition of the USO however it ispossible for the incumbent post to be more efficient than theentrant and still lose profits because the incumbent must charge auniform price The entrant would most likely attack routes withmuch higher than average profit margins The incumbent would not beable toCohen et al  found that less than  percent of totalUS Postal Service volume is contestablerespond because of the restrictive USO Ceteris paribus themore skewed the incumbents route profit margin distribution themore vulnerable the post is to entryFigure  shows that the Poste Italiane profit margindistribution is much less skewed than the US Postal Servicesdistribution Thus according to the entry price measure the costof the USO is higher in the US than in Italy This is contraryto the conclusion that we have drawn in Section  ie that theburden of the USO is much higher for Poste Italiane than for theUS Postal ServiceThe possibility of an equal or less efficient entrant capturingsignificant volume depends on the fraction of mail on profitableroutes that is actually contestable Given the huge scale economiesof a universal service provider and the limited amount ofcontestable mail it is very difficult for an entrant at least inthe US to charge prices lower than an incumbent Cohen et al NET AVOIDED COSTThe net avoided cost measure NAC of the USO is the sum of thelosses from unprofitable routes Dobbs and Golay  Elsenblastand Stumpf  As stated earlier the profits from delivered andnondelivered mail must equal the upstream fixed cost in abreakeven post If the profits from the money making routes andnondelivered mail exceed the upstream fixed cost then there mustbe an offset of money losing routes This is simply an accountingidentity The more skewed the distribution of delivery route profitmargins the greater will be the losses from unprofitable routesFigure  shows that the NAC would be greater for the US PostalService than for Poste Italiane assuming adjustments for scaleAgain this is contrary to our finding in Section  about therelative burden of the USOFurthermore we believe that the logic of the NAC measure isflawed Suppose that a government decides to provide a subsidy toits breakeven postal service to offset losses on unprofitableroutes because it wishes taxpayers and not rate payers to fund theUSO The postal service would then have a surplus In order for thepostal service to return to breakeven prices would be reduced Because of the price reduction unprofitable routes would becomeeven more unprofitable and some formerly profitable routes wouldbecome unprofitable Because the total losses from unprofitableroutes are greater than before the government would have toincrease its subsidyFor purposes of the discussion of entry pricing and net avoidedcost we ignore the impact of the percentage of nondeliveredmailBradley and Colvin  estimated the entry pricing cost ofthe USO for the United States That estimate assumed that theentrant would capture all volume on all profitable routes It is aworst case scenerioThe same logic would hold for a postal service earning any givenprofit lossThis process would continue until there is but one route notsubsidized by the government and that route would be the route thatinitially was the most profitable one in the system Thus the netavoided cost measure implies the absurdity that a government mustfund the entire delivery network if it wants to fund the cost ofuniversal service CONCLUSIONWe introduce and quantify the concept of the burden of the USOwhich is the upward impact on unit costs that would result fromcompetitive entry We find that the burden on low per capita postalsystems is much greater than on medium to high volume postalsystems This is contrary to results obtained when using the netavoided cost or entry pricing measures of the cost of the USO Wealso find that the burden decreases as the percentage ofnondelivered mail increases The distribution of route profits ismuch more skewed for the US Postal Service than for PosteItaliane This would tend to make the US more attractive topotential cream skimmers On the other hand a greater percentageof Poste Italiane revenue is generated by delivered mail and thiswould cause cream skimming to have a greater impact on its unitcostsAPPENDIXModel DefinitionThe model is designed to define average unit cost as a functionof volume Q based on the USPS cost structure for FY

USPS and Poste Italiane To make the comparisonof the unit cost from our model which is based on USPS cost dataand the actual unit cost of Poste Italiane more meaningful weapply three factors to the results of our model The unit costassuming  of institutional fixed costs vary with volume in thelong run is calculated in the exampleFirst the attributable variable cost from the modelVQP   is

respectivelyThe weighted average unit cost that results  cents is thendivided by the actual USPS unit variable unit cost of  centsThe resulting ratio  is applied to the variable cost fromthe modelExample     Next the resulting variable cost is adjusted to accountfor the savings from worksharing reflected in the USPS costs whichdo not exist for Poste Italiane The USPS variable costs in FY were  lower than they would have been without worksharingCohen et al  so the variable cost from step one  isincreased by that amountExample     Finally both variable and institutional costs areadjusted for labor cost differences Since  of USPS costs arelabor costs that portion of the variable cost from step two and institutional cost from the model  is adjustedby the ratio of Poste
