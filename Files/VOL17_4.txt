                              The Niceness Principle            This is an essay about language and false recallI am interested particularly in how recall distortsto smooth things out to alter the old harshmeanings into new pleasant forms reminiscent ofHallmark greeting cards  I call it the Niceness PrincipleLet me illustrate            Last year I taught an introductory literaturecourse in which I assigned EE Cummingss poemnext to of course god america i  It is a short pasticheand parody of jingoist sentiment swatchesfrom a patriotic afterdinner speech at the local ElksClub perhaps  I pointed out how Cummings wasmaking fun of superpatriotism and saberrattlingand we discussed the split between Cummingss andthe speakers point of view  I got some intelligentresponses as well as some incredulity  Some of thestudents could not accept that Cummings was impugningthe flag  When it came time for the midtermseveral identified the poem as God BlessAmerica            This is a good case in point I think because itexposes how the Niceness Principle works peoplefind a particular meaning unpleasant so they unconsciouslychange it to something more comfortableThey make it nice just as nice itself has changedfrom a word meaning niggling to a word meaningpleasant and applied to everything from ice creamto sexual partners  Unfortunately this is hardly justa foible of youth rather it seems endemic to culturesthat have shied away from the abattoir and thebaseness of human behavior  In certain cases thenew meanings have become so ingrained in the languagethat the old ones have been totally effacedHere are some nasty examples            The Greek myth of Pandoras box is one thatmost of us recall vaguely though Pandora was toldnot to open that box of course she didat whichpoint all manner of evils flew out making our worldone of pestilence famine death and destructionThe consolation for all this lay at the bottom of thebox hope the precious quality that would helpmankind through it all  Or so I had been taught  Itwas not until I took a classics course in college that Iwas told the original reading the worst evil of allwas at the bottomhope which feeds men illusionswhich renders them blind to reality which thriveson lies  And in fact this reading is far more in keepingwith the ancient Greek temperament  So muchfor historical accuracy            Our culture seems to like taming the GreeksRough edges are planed away disturbing elementsare omitted  Readers of Platos Symposium  for examplemay recall Aristophanes absurd myth of creationmen and women were originally egglike creatureswith eight limbs and one head but two facesThey were quite powerful and in order to nullifyany threat they might pose to the gods Zeus cutthem in two  From then on concludes Aristophanespeople sadly roamed the earth looking for their losthalves  When the two halves meet they embraceand this is love            Ask any nonclassicist who has read the Symposium and you will get this basic recollection  But inAristophanes description only one type was cloveninto male and female the original hermaphroditesThe two other types were malemale and femalefemaleand they account for homosexual love  Thisis no coincidence since the Symposium portrays homosexualityas useful and ennobling  How curiousthen that nine out of ten readers of this work happento forget this part of Aristophanes myth            The Romans provide more fodder for the NicenessPrinciple through Vergil who wrote in his Eclogues Omnia vincit amor Love conquers allGenerations of romantics including the wife ofBath have interpreted this to mean that love willtriumph over war and poverty even over strict parentsand curfews but this is a fuzzy reading of themilitary metaphor Vergil intended  The image Vergilpursues is that of a commander forced to surrenderbeaten by an allpowerful passion  Take a normalcleareyed individual Vergil implies subjecthim to love and it will transform him into a physicalwreck who cannot sleep and cannot eat because ofhis obsession  The ancients had a point            There is an etiology behind all this  In Freudianterms the Niceness Principle is often equivalent tothe defense mechanism of reversal in which the individualtransforms the situation into its oppositeusually as a retreat from unpleasant emotions  Otherdefense mechanisms such as repression and selectiveforgetting may also take part  The question remainsis this simply a human foible or have we as aculture grown ever more fond of sanitizing andsweeping under the carpet  Freuds Civilization andIts Discontents suggests an answer as civilizationprogresses it removes itself further and furtherfrom harshness and crude emotions  The emotionsstill exist however and the psychological price wepay for the repression is in neurosis and other civilizedills            The GrecoRoman tradition is not the onlyhappy hunting ground for the Niceness PrincipleThe Bible provides a wealth of material for misinterpretationand faulty recall though it often requiresnice readers for this to happen  In Genesis  forinstance most believers see Lot as a pious man livingin the midst of the wicked city of Sodom  Whentwo angels come down to see him he protects themagainst the evil crowd of men who wish to molestthem sexually  Lot is thus the good host who willallow no harm to come to anyone under his roofWhat many people forget or omit or simply neverheard of is that Lot offers a sop to the crowd histwo virgin daughters  Take them he begs instead ofhis guests  Whether this reflects the inviolable ruleof hospitality the undeniable misogyny in the OldTestament or that angels have higher standing thanhumans is open to question  But the question cannoteven be asked when the details are mislaid            This is not to say that the Western tradition hasa monopoly on Niceness  The Japanese proverbInu ga arukeba bo ni ataru A dog that walksaround will find a stick illustrates this nicely  Modernsources translate the proverb as something likeSeek and ye shall find with the stick as a bone orreward  The original meaning is harsher and morein keeping with traditional Japanese culture thestick is used to beat the dog who should not havepoked around  In other words Curiosity killedthe cat            Fairy tales have also come in for their share ofNiceness  The folklore the Grimm Brothers unearthedwas full of beheadings and torture the storieswere both amusements and cautionary talesThey certainly did not all end happily ever afterThe classic Little Red Riding Hood for instancewas told to me as a child in the Nice version afterthe wolf swallowed the grandmother he got intobed and waited for Little Red Riding Hood to comeWhen he sprang out at her she fled screaming  Anearby woodsman came and cut open the wolf witha hatchet freeing the grandmother  Not so in theoriginal What big teeth you have says Little RedRiding Hood  The better to eat you with says thewolf and gobbles her up  End of tale            Shakespeare at a remove of four centuries providesa hapless hunting ground for nice misinterpretationseither through misquotation or quoting outof context  A typical example is the oftenrepeatedOne touch of nature makes the whole world kinThe pleasant drift is nature reminding us that we areall in this world togetherbut this was not whatShakespeare intended especially in his most satiricaland pessimistic play Troilus and Cressida  Theline itself is spoken by the wily Ulysses attempting topersuade Achilles to return to battle  The argumenthe uses is that people tend to praise what is recentThat all with one consent praise newborn gaudsis the line that follows and the implication is clearthat this is what links mankind this tendency to focusonly on the new and conveniently forget thepast  It may be merely a coincidence that this iswhat quoters of Shakespeare are doing when theyuse this line incorrectly            Other examples abound  To choose one fromthe movies in Casablanca there is the famous linePlay it Sam as Rick tells the piano man to playwhat Ilsa remembers as their song  Not only is theline usually misquoted as Play it again Sam butthe sentiment itself is misunderstood as a nostalgicglow  In fact it is painful for Rick to hear the musicnow and the only reason he tells Sam to play it is forIlsas sake  An etymological analogy is useful herenostalgia really means the ache or pain of return butmost people think of nostalgia as pleasurable recollection            Transmutation of tales legends and sayings arenot the only effects of the Niceness Principle  Itsweeps words in its passage as well  Awesome oncemeant terrible now it means great and terrible isreserved to describe airline cuisine  Whatever happenedto a terrible strength  Great was also once afrightening word  Even bad means good nowadaysIt is worth noting that some good words over timehave acquired a bad reputation such as square goingfrom honest to dull and criticism movingfrom appraisal to denigration  But in general weseem to lighten up meanings rather than darkenthem            I do not mean to sound like a hidebound traditionalistLanguage is a living changing phenomenonand it is no use railing against shifts in meaningwhich are bound to occur  And avoiding unpleasantnessis often a reasonable aim  But as an English professorwho tries to teach the spirit of literature Ihave a vested interest in accuracy  I cannot helplamenting what I see as distortion  And memory isimportant  Fuzzy recall indicates a disregard for historyOr as my uncle once said Those who cannotremember the past are condemned to misquoteSantayana                              That is a mute point now of course with

restaurantswhere you can get along with a fairly highrisk of heartburn what must rank as the ultimate inculinary oxymorons a hamburger called a Mini Big If that sounds a trifle too indecisive you may choosefrom such offerings as a Cheeseburgare  a Baconburgare a Big Dream  or something called a Big Clock All these names are English more or less  It appearsthat in Sweden these days as in the world generallypeople not only increasingly speak English but alsoeat it            And they wear it  Anyone who has traveled almostanywhere in the world in the past couple ofyears will have noticed that young people everywheresport Tshirts sweatshirts and warmup jacketsbearing messages that are invariably  in Englishand  gloriously meaningless  Recently inHamburg I saw a young man in a bomber jacket thatstated on its back FullOPep Laying Mash  Inslightly smaller letters it added Made by TavernitiOats Company Chicago USA DS  In Tokyo acorrespondent for The Economist sighted a Tshirtproclaiming O D on Bourgeoisie Milk Boy MilkThe words one supposes were chosen from an unabridgeddictionary by a parrot with a stick in itsbeak  What is even more alarming is that these bewilderinglyvague sentiments have begun appearingin the Englishspeaking world  In a store on OxfordStreet in London I saw a jacket made in Britain thatannounced in large letters Rodeo per centBoys for Atomic Atlas            What do these strange messages mean  In theliteral sense nothing of course  But in a more metaphoricway they do rather underscore the huge almostcompulsive appeal of English in the world  It isan odd fact that almost everywhere on the planetproducts are deemed more appealing and sentimentsmore powerful if they are expressed in Englisheven if they make next to no sense            English words are everywhere  Germans speakof die Teenagers and das Walkout and German politicianssnarl  No comment  at German journalistsItalian women coat their faces with col cream Romanians ride the trolleybus  and Spaniards whenthey feel chilly don a sueter   Almost everyone in theworld speaks on the telephone or the telefoon oreven in China the te le fung   And almost everywhereyou can find nightclubs and

weekendjeans knowhow sex appeal and no problem As The Economist put it The presence of so manywords to do with travel consumables and sport atteststo the real source of these exportsAmerica            There is no denying that the English languagequite apart from its utilitarian purposes holds anodd almost quaint fascination for many foreignspeakers  I have before me a Japanese eraser thatsays Mr

Snoopys Dribbling while just off the Grand Place in Brussels youcan find a boutique called Big Nuts  where a sign inthe window intriguingly offers Sweat  francsCloser inspection reveals this to be merely a Belgiantruncation of the English sweatshirt             Usually English words are taken just as they arebut sometimes they are adapted to local needs oftenin quite striking ways  The SerboCroatians for instancepicked up the English word nylon  but took itto mean a kind of shabby and disreputable variationso that a nylon hotel is a brothel while a nylon beachis where nudists frolic  Other nations have left thewords largely intact but given the spelling a noveltwist  Thus the Ukrainian herkot might seem whollyforeign to you until you realize that it is what aUkrainian goes to his barber for  Similarly unlessyou heard them spoken you might not recognize ajskrymerebeta  and kontaklinser as respectively Polishfor ice cream  Japanese for elevator  and Swedishfor contact lenses   The champion of this dissemblingprocess must surely be the Italian sciacchenze  whichis simply a literal rendering of the English shakehands  although the Swahili word for a traffic islandkiplefti  keep left  runs it a close second            This practice of taking English words and hackingaway at them until they emerge as somethingmore like native products is particularly rampantamong the Japanese who have borrowed no fewerthan  English wordsat least ten per cent ofall the words in common use there  It has beensaid not altogether jokingly that if the Japanesewere required to pay a license fee for every Englishword they used their trade surplus would vanish            Occasionally the Japanese stretch the borrowedwords to fit more comfortably to their pronunciationaswith productivity  which became inJapanese purodakuchibichi but for the most partthey use the same sort of ingenuity miniaturizingEnglish words as they do in miniaturizing tape recordersand video cameras  So word processor inJapan become wapro personal computer becomesmasukomi  and commercial is unceremoniouslyshorn of its troublesome consonant clusters andshrunk to a terse monosyllable cm  Nopan  shortfor nopanties  is a description for bottomless waitresseswhile the English words touch and game havebeen fused to make tatchi geimu  a euphemism forsexual petting            Sometimes English words are given not onlynew spellings but also entirely new meanings  In thelast century the Russians for reasons that no onenow seems quite sure of took the name of a Londonrailway station Vauxhall and made it their genericword for all railroad stations vagzal   In much thesame way the Japanese word for a fashionable cutsuit sebiro  is a corruption of Savile Row   More recentlythe French borrowed the English slangwords jerk and egghead but gave them largely contrarymeaningsnamely an egghead in France isnot a brainy person but a dimwit while jerk is a termof praise for an accomplished dancerthough atleast they respect the spellings            Occasionally borrowers of English words usethem to create new words  The Japanese have latelyappropriated the English word mansion  respelled itmanshon  and used it to signify not a large singledwelling but a highrise apartment building  But becausethe syllable man also means ten thousand inJapanese they have coined a further word okushon based on their word for one hundred million oku because that implies greater luxury still            This practice of adopting an English word andthen using it as the basis for forming other wordsquite unknown in English is more common than youmight expect  The Germans in particular are adeptat taking things a step further than ever occurred toanyone in English  In Germany a young person goesfrom being in his teens to being in his twens  a bookthat doesnt quite become a bestseller is instead einsteadyseller  and a person who is more relaxed thananother is relaxter             A final curiosity of borrowing is that the wordssometimes lose their emotional charge when conveyedoverseas  The Dutch most notably haveadopted an English expletive too coarse to reproducehere though if I say hits the fan I expectyoull be with me but they use it as a mild andlargely meaningless epithet roughly equivalent toour gosh or golly or even just hmmmm to such anextent I am told that they must now take specialcare not to startle Englishspeaking visitors  Oddlyenough a century ago we did much the same thingwith a rude Dutch term pappekak  which we anglicizedinto the anodyne poppycock             Of course not all these borrowings are free ofcharge  The English language has become a very bigbusiness indeed  Globally the teaching of English isworth  billion a year in Britain alone it is the sixthlargest source of invisible earnings worth  milliona year            Some people are naturally better at masteringEnglish than others  In the s according to Timemagazine Soviet diplomats were issued with aRussianEnglish phrasebook that included suchmemorable phrases as this instruction to a waiterPlease give me curds sower cream fried chickspulled bread and one jellyfish  When shoppingthe wellversed Soviet emissary was told to order aladies worstednylon swimming pants            If there is one thing we should be worried aboutin the Englishspeaking world it is not that we aredoing poorly at learning other peoples languagesthough that is worrisome enoughbut that we increasinglypay so little attention to the competentuse of our own  Sir Randolph Quirk put it succinctlywhen he wrote It would be ironic indeed if themillions of children in Germany Japan and Chinawho are diligently learning the language of Shakespeareand Eliot took more care in their use of Englishand showed more pride in their achievementthan those for whom it is the native tongue            We might sometimes wonder if we are the mostresponsible custodians of our own tongue when wereflect that the Oxford University Press sells as manycopies of the Oxford English Dictionary in Japan as itdoes in America and a third more than in Britain                              Ethnic Slurs and the Avoidance Thereof            Back in  when Dick Cavett had his talkshow on PBS I heard him interview AlfredKazin on his program  Kazin had just had publishedan autobiography titled New York Jew  and was probablyon television to plug the book apropos ofwhich he and Cavett had more or less this to sayDC Why did you call the book New York Jew  Imean some people might consider that titleuh a little provocativeAK smiling amused Well the title pretty wellsums me up  I happen to be a Jew who has identifiedhimself in the New York intellectual environment                        To my mind Dick Cavetts question remainedintriguing not so much because Kazin failed to answerit fully as because I wondered why the questionhad occurred to Cavett in the first place  IndeedNew York Jew does somehow seem to have analmost hostile overtone  Why  Are we so imbuedwith antiSemitism or hypersensitivity to it that anydirect reference to Jews particularly culturally intensiveNew York Jews touches a raw nerve  Somemonths after the interview I asked a friend of mine aJewish professor emeritus of English who was originallyfrom New York albeit the state not the citywhat he thought about the matter  He replied somethinglike this Hmm well yes but isnt it a littleblunt a little hostile to call anyone by a bare ethnicnoun  Suppose we saw a German we knew walkingtoward us  And then what if one of us said to theother Here comes that German  Theres a nuanceof putdown almost hostility there  If we liked theguy and had nothing against Germans generallywed probably say something like Say here comesthat German fellow that young German guythat old German gentleman             I have tested my professorial friends observationin a number of real and imagined situations involvingseveral ethnic or national categories andhave found it to be correct  The unmodified nounfor an ethnic group or nationality does imply a certainhostility or contempt or especially on the lips ofa member of that group a nuance of defiance as inKazins case  Prouder or more arrogant people areapt to fling the bare noun at you almost as if to addAnd youd better believe it  A snooty Brit maystaunchly declare  I am an Englishman where amore modest denizen of England would be morelikely say Im English employing the adjectiverather than the noun  There seems to be a kind ofsemantic quality that makes adjectives softer andgentler than nouns and makes of them softeningagents            In some cases the adjectives and nouns for ethnicgroups are formally identical as for exampleGerman Swiss or Russian   But to soften the ethnicterm in such cases it can still be used adjectivally asin the example already given or in A Russian guyonce told me  Perhaps particularly where thenoun and adjective are identical in form if not functioncolloquially a blunt noun is invented such asDutchman for German n Russky for Russian nJap for Japanese  or Chinaman for Chinese n  Converselyplain nouns for ethnic groups or nationalitiesare sometimes replaced with adjectivally softenedterms like Colored Folks African Americans  orNative Americans             If adjectives soften ethnic terms nouns canharden them  This function can be demonstrated bycomparing the noun Jew with the adjective Jewish incontext  When someone says That Jew business isnew here he isnt saying quite the same thing asThat Jewish business is new here  Because of theabomination and shame of antiSemitism you tendto respond more sensitively to language reflectingattitudes toward Jews which is why jew down isboth derogatory and offensive while gyp or welch onare relatively innocuous  But the hardening effect ofplain nouns can be detected with regard to otherpeoples  That Swede church isnt quite the sameas That Swedish church            The ethnic terms that seem bluntest or most indelicateare sometimes simply what people callthemselves  Chinaman is nothing but a calque ofzhongguo ren  morpheme for morpheme Chinaman and Polak is simply Pole in Polish  And sometimesironically or defiantly people will call themselves bynames intended to be pejorative or downright insultingas when African Americans call each othernigger or Jews of Odessa call one of their folk heroesPoltorazhida Yidandahalf            When a people has been dealt with shamefullythere is reason to dissociate it from its former identityby giving it a new name  The niggers anddarkies where again the primarily adjectival word isthe less offensive of slavery became the Negroes andColoreds of Jim Crow and are the African Americansand blacks of today  Blacks of course are usually nomore black than whites are white  The misnomermust be acceptable because the parallelism impliesequality between the folks so designated by adjectivesof color            Newcomers to the American Southwest wherethere is a large population of Latin Americans oftenask What do you call these people  Hispanic though currently the best answer isnt entirely satisfactorybecause the term lumps together people whoare about as alike as say Tahitians and HaitiansForty years ago before a sizable emigration fromMexico into New Mexico in this state the Spanishspeakingelement of the population carelessly calleditself mexicano  as some of the older Hispanics stilldo though New Mexico had not been part of Mexicofor more than a century and then for only about aquarter of a century after New Spain became theMexican Republic  Anglos usually referred to theSpanishspeaking element as native or again in akind of leveling parallelism as Spanish  never asSpaniards  on the model probably unconscious ofAnglo  short for AngloAmerican   Hispanics whoprefer to emphasize cultural ties with Mexico especiallyla Republica Azteca as most in New Mexicodefinitely do not may prefer to go by the name ofChicano  which implies political as much as nationalor ethnic identity            There are nationalities and ethnic groups soconfident so satisfied with themselves that ethnicepithets either bounce off them like pebbles off anelephant or are adopted as amusing or even ornamentalWhat do you call an American or Australianto insult him  Yank and Aussie have been tried butto no avail  WASP started off with a pejorative nuanceit seems to me but has been accepted sosmugly by white AngloSaxon Protestants that theterm has been appropriated by some people itdoesnt fit for instance Americans of German orIrish descent who may be agnostics of Catholic backgroundWhere Americans are called gringo  theytend to be more amused than offended by the epithet            Then there are peoples too alien or exotic to themainstream of the dominant culture to haveprompted an attitude expressed in language  AmericanIndian tribes seem to fall into this category  Onesays indifferently Hes Navaho or Hes aNavaho as most people do not say indifferentlyHes Jewish or Hes a Jew though in the caseof the Indian the noun seems somehow more naturaland no less friendly  This indifference does nothowever extend to particular kinds of IndiansSquaw papoose  and maybe even brave are nolonger used except humorously Smile when yousay that or again defiantly  The boys basketballteam of the Indian School in Santa Fe call themselvesthe Braves and the girls team is called theLady Braves  There is likely a touch of humor hereIn my experience the most endearing characteristicof American Indians generally is their keen sense ofhumor            When it comes to sensitivity to ethnic or nationaldesignations the bulk of Americans seem tobe indifferent to nuance  We as soon say Im anAmerican as Im American or jauntily Im agringo or proudly Im a Yank  Are we made imperviousby a shell of arrogance numb by selfsatisfactionor tolerant by the wild ethnic diversity inwhich most of us live

andverse to refute all those linguistic reactionaries whocannot see why there is all that fuss about using heand man to mean a person of either sex The debatesthat Deborah Cameron illustrates are fundamentalto everyones use of language whether theybe female or malehow it is used how it is perceivedand received by speakers and readers of bothsexes how it can on the one hand bolster and on theother break down attitudes and prejudices and howit can create new awarenesses                           The Feminist Critique of Language brings togethera wide range of views and approaches to itssubject ranging from the conservative linguist OttoJespersen and the author Virginia Woolf writing inthe s to contemporary critics  One of the mainstrengths of the collection is that it does not just putforward one view it maps out the debate allowingdifferent views to be stated and then criticized orrevised  The eighteen essays and extracts and theperceptive introduction reveal the range and depthof the debate about feminism and language            Cameron divides the book into three main sectionsThe first Speech and Silence has Woolf asits starting point and includes Cora Kaplan on Languageand gender as well as two French extractsfrom Annie Leclerc on Womans word and an interviewwith the leading French psychologist LuceIrigary entitled Womans exile  These essays explorethe notion of womens silence and the utopianquest for a specifically female voice in cultureMuch of the real meat of the book comes in PartTwo  Naming and Representation  DaleSpenders quasiWorfian views

fuss reactionBodine analyzes the ways in which malegrammarians both descriptive and prescriptivehave since the seventeenth century sought to establishhe as the sexindefinite pronoun despite evidencethat actual usage consistently contradicts thatIt is a pity that the most recent material in the collectionappeared in the mid s  In answer toAnne Bodines point both the Longman Dictionaryof Contemporary English and the Collins CobuildDictionary use they and their as the nongenderspecificpronounadjective which the reader probablynoted also in the first paragraph of this review

alphabeticallyarranged reference book on given orfirst or as they like to call them in Britain regardlessof the religion of their possessors Christiannames  It seems to be the product of a publishersdecision that such a book should be on every wellroundedreference list but as a work viewed in thelarger context of onomasiology it breaks no newground as far as I can tell and offers nothing not alreadycovered by the works of Leslie A  Dunklingfor one  Which is to say that if you already have afairly comprehensive dictionary of first namesthisone claims  names definedyou do not needthis one on the other hand if you have none andwant a good one this one is likely to be as good asthe best and better than most            Laurence Urdang                              A Dictionary of SurnamesA Dictionary of First Names            Both of these books will find a place on theshelves of any good reference library  They containa great deal of information that has been intelligentlycollated  The surname dictionary in particularbecomes the best available work on the subjectthe chief value of the first name dictionary for melies in the Supplements which deal with Arabicnames by Mona Baker and with the given names ofthe Indian Subcontinent by Ramesh Krishnamurthy            The awkward fact about the surname dictionaryis that a great many people will consult it in vain forinformation about their own names  It contains entriessays the Introduction for most major surnamesof European origin as well as for many rarerones  Major in this context means names likeSmith and Jones  frequently found in any telephonedirectory  Such names must of course be includedthough the people most anxious to discover somethingabout the original meaning of their surnamesare invariably those who bear the rarer names  Theauthors say that if they came across reliable informationabout rarer names they wrote entries  In otherwords if someone else had done the research inwhat appeared to be a scholarly way they took advantageof it  That seems to me to be a sensible approachsince the only way properly to investigate asurname is to go back through the male line as far aspossible noting the various spellings of the namewhere the family was living in past centuries and soon  Being asked to make a judgment about a surnamemerely on the basis of its modern spelling israther like being asked to give the meaning of aword such as pain without being told whether theword is English or French and without knowingwhether the word should really be spelled pane             I have been using the surname dictionary regularlyand usually feel satisfied with the informationpresented but there are criticisms to be made  Recentlyfor instance I was wondering about Boffin  aname that obviously appealed to Charles DickensHanks and Hodges say that it is an English name ofunknown origin but hint that it may be an anglicizationof Welsh Baughan found also as Vaughan  adiminutive of Baugh  ultimately from bach little  Ageneral comment on the treatment of the Welsh chsound in English would have been useful but I personallyaccept that theory  I wonder though whythe Baughan and Vaughan  entries do not mentionthat bach was an epithet that distinguished a son andfather a kind of Welsh equivalent of junior   I alsohave my doubts about how ordinary users of this dictionarywill cope with its metalanguage  Linguisticboffins have no problems with a statement like dimof BAUGH from W bychan  hypocoristic form of bachlittle  But try that on an ordinary member of thepublic the kind of person who will presumably consultthis book in a library and add in for good measurethe last line of the Baughan entry which readsCogn of  Corn BEAN  Acting on that lasthint I looked at the Bean entry  I found suggestionsthat it is a metonymic occupational name an Englishnickname or an anglicized form of a Gaelic personalname meaning life  There was no cross referenceto Baughan  however nor a mention of Cornishbyhanvyhan little            Genealogical information is occasionally addedto the surname entries but only when the familiesconcerned are important according to a very traditionaldefinition of that word  People wellknownin the entertainment world such as FrankieVaughan are definitely not mentioned  Under theentry for Howard  therefore we are given notes onthe noble house of that name along with the possiblederivations of the surname  The noble themeis continued in the firstname dictionary  Readersare there told that Howard represents transferreduse of the surname of an English noble family            Entries like that for Howard in the Dictionary ofFirst Names hardly encourage me to take the mainbody of the book seriously  The absence of hardstatistical evidence about the use of first names inthe Englishspeaking world is also very worryingSuch evidence is vital for many reasons  It enablessensible decisions to be made about which namesshould be included in a work of this kind  Hanks andHodges include Hrothgar  for instance because itoccurs in Beowulf and was borne by a vicechancellorof Oxford University at the turn of the century  Ido not consider that a sensible inclusion especiallywhen they choose to ignore Hugo  which has beenregularly if infrequently used in Britain and the USsince the s            Statistical evidence also indicates the reason fora names use  It is absurd to suggest that Howard hasbeen used in modern times because it is the surnameof an aristocratic British family  The popular use ofthe name in the US in the s must have been inhonor of Oliver Otis Howard  sincethe surnames of Civil War officers were often used inbaptism  American bearers of the name such asHoward Hughes and Howard Keel  later made thename well known to British parents  Hanks andHodges totally ignore such American influencethough the evidence for it is overwhelming            The authors respective treatment of Howard asa surname and Howard as a first name is perhapssymbolic of the different qualities of these two dictionariesSurname interpretation mainly requiresgood philological skills which Hanks and Hodgessupply  First names call for a frequent delving intoareas of nonacademic popular culture and recentsocial history as well as a certain amount of linguisticjudgment  The student of first names needs anenthusiastic and genuine interest in the behavior ofordinary human beings  Whatever else is in this OxfordDictionary of First Names  it lacks that basicenthusiasm  It is much the poorer for it

published in the New York Yiddishweekly Forverts a sharp attack on the outrageousilliteracy of the Yiddish translation of the CensusBureau Guide April   p   In a letterto the Census Bureau he asked whether other foreignlanguage translations of the Guide were similarlyentrusted in such incompetent hands              I sent a copy of my article XVII  to theCensus Bureau  After a delay of more than sevenweeks I received a reply from Mr Allan A StephensonAssistant Division Chief for Outreach and ProgramInformation Decennial Planning Division  Hewrote To find a contractor to translate AssistanceGuides in  languages we required the foreignlanguage expertise to be at least at the  levelas rated by the Foreign Service Institute or a recognizedequivalent  Communication

apologized for any inadvertentoffense that the Yiddish translation may havecaused assured me that in light of your commentsthe Guide will no longer be distributedan emptyassurance since the count is overand that the Bureauwill be interested in my views about materialsprepared in Yiddish for the year  Census            One may seriously question his characterizationof the translator of the Yiddish Guide as a nativeYiddish speaker see below  Besides it is axiomaticthat there is a basic difference between spokenlanguage and written language and it is highly fallaciousto assume that a native speaker even with afluent command of his language can ipso facto intelligentlywrite in it let alone translate from or into it              I spoke twice on the telephone with thetranslator of the Yiddish Guide   He was born in theUnited States and received his education in publicschools  In his childhood a Hebrew teacher wouldcome to his home for several hours a week  Henever went to a secular Yiddish school where Yiddishwas taught as a basic subject and where othersubjects as well were taught in Yiddish  I hadguessed correctly that his parents spoke Yiddishand that that was the main source of his knowledgeof the language  In the course of our lengthy telephoneconversations I could not detect a sense ofinformed literacy about Yiddish as a language  Italso became clear that the Yiddish of his parents wasnot standard Yiddish  He never wrote or publishedanything in Yiddish and he seemed to have used asaids in translating the Guide Alexander HarkavysYiddishEnglish Dictionary and Uriel

readers might like toknow that in mid December of  I received a callfrom an official of the Census Bureau asking mewhether I concurred with Dr Bachs negative commentson the Yiddish Guide   Having seen the Guide I replied that I indeed agreed fully with Dr Bachsassessment  I explained that the Guide was riddledwith atrocious spelling syntactic and semantic errorsThough printed in the traditional YiddishHebrew alphabet most of the words were misspelledas though the writer had never seen a Yiddishdictionary the syntax was garbled almost beyondrecognition the lexical content made littlesense            The Census Bureau official informed me thatthe translator had been approved by CommunicationsTechnical Applications Inc a private contractorwhose word on the expertise of the translatorthe Census Bureau tacitly accepted  The official admittedthat at least in the case of Yiddish the CensusBureau had erred in relying on this contractor  Headded that in the light of Dr Bachs and my commentswe will no longer distribute this Guide   Ina subsequent letter he added that we will keep your name on file for the year  census  If weprepare materials in the Yiddish language we wouldbe interested in your comments            I hope to live to the year  to help with theYiddish Guide   I am sure that Yiddish will still bearound surviving its detractors as it has for a thousandyears                              I must take issue with both of the BIBIOGRAPHIAby Alan S Kaye XVI   In his review of WordsThat Make a Difference  he praises a sentence fromThe New York Times describing the miscellaneousjunk in a harbor as eclectic bounty  If these itemswere in a collection that I put in my front yard eclecticmight be the word but what is missing fromthe harbors variety is the element of choice eclecticcome from the Greek legein to choose or pick            In the same piece he traces savvy to Portuguesewhich might be correct but Menckens AmericanLanguage derives it from the Spanish

he and whoever revised Bernsteins bookare behind the times on boxing weight classes featherweightshould precede lightweight  and other principaldivisions have been ignored                              Is monotheism an inadequate word to describebasic beliefs set forth in the Old Testament  Recentlywhile browsing through the dictionary Icame across the word henotheism  defined as theworship of one of a group of gods in contrast withmonotheism which teaches that only one god existsIf many of the people of the covenant believedthat Jehovah was the supreme god amonglesser gods were they henotheists rather thanmonotheists  Harpers Bible Dictionary suggestsEven Moses whom we may regard as the founderof the religion of Israel was more probably a henotheistthan a monotheist            The distinction is a neat and illuminating one  Iwonder why henotheism is not as common a philosophicaldesignation as monotheism  It seems to bea way station between polytheism and monotheisma useful concept that provides a missing link in theevolutionary process            The root hen one is found in hendiadys  a rhetoricalfigure labeling expressions like nice andwarm  instead of nicely warm  It is also found inhendecasyllable hendecagon  and hendecahedron                               Milton Horowitz wrote about a mistranslation ofa word in the Bible which was ostensibly responsiblefor Michelangelos putting horns on his sculpture ofMoses XVI  Another mistranslation which hasprobably had a much greater influence on the Westernworld is that of the Hebrew word almah  whichmeans young woman but was translated as virginThe King James version of Isaiah  reads Thereforethe Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold avirgin shall conceive and bear a son  Matthew in the New Testament describes the birthof Jesus referring it back to Isaish saying Now allthis was done that it might be fulfilled which wasspoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Beholda virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth ason            The Hebrew word for virgin is bethulah  whichwould have been used in the original had the youngwoman been a virgin            In the New English Bible which was the subjectof another article in the same issue of VERBATIM thepassage from Isaiah reads Therefore the Lord himselfshall give you a sign  A young woman is withchild and she will bear a son  In the translationof the Holy Bible according to the traditionalHebrew text published by the Jewish PublicationSociety of America Isaiah  reads Assuredlymy Lord will give you a sign of His own accordLook the young woman is with child and about togive birth to a son            These thcentury corrections of the originalmistranslation cannot of course undo the implicationsthat have resulted from translating almah asvirgin instead of young woman                              American Grammar            Although this is essentially a textbook it is lucidlywritten and presented and can be commendedto those who have been less than satisfied by earlierattempts to provide a clear exposition of Chomskyangrammar  It is readable but that compliment mustbe taken in the context in which it appears a grammarcould scarcely be classified as a good read inthe same sense as a novel  Also it should be understoodthat American Grammar  while it happens todeal with illustrations from American English describesthe grammar of most of English the title derivesfrom the association with America of the particularkind of grammatical analysis describedexcept for a few anomalous differences the grammarsof the major dialects of English are of courseuniform            This is not the place to launch a commentary onthe shortcomings and virtues of the various theoriesof grammar or grammatical theories that have beenproposed suffice it to say that no one of them providesall the answers to all the myriad questionsraised by language  Certainly Chomskys theorywhich denies behaviorism makes one wonder ifthere cannot be certain aspects of language that dependon behavior without requiring one to acceptall facets of behaviorism  Traditional grammarwith its eight parts of speech has proved woefullyinadequate to the task of describing how languageworks so something is clearly needed  Much ofChomskyan grammar is very boring and mechanisticwith its transformational rules and deterministicreflexes            For me some questions about grammar are stillmore comfortably answered by traditional theorythough I draw on transformational grammar when itsuits meany port in a storm  To hold that psychologyevenphysiologyhas no relationship togrammar seems overbearing to me for experiencehas a great deal to do with how we use and understandlanguage which I consider highly associative            However I should not enter the argument hereall theories have their strong and weak points andtransformational grammar appears to have fewerweak ones  I am interested in meaning which istreated as badly by Chomsky and his followers as itwas by the structuralists who preceded them  AsCarl Mills writes linguistic competence includesknowledge of phonology and syntax but not semanticsa view of Leonard Bioomfields that createdmany difficultiesAt the other extreme some linguists in the lates and early s argued that almost all aspectsof meaning in language ought to be explainedby semantic rules in the grammar  Notonly the meanings of words and the meanings ofsentences as most linguists define sentencemeanings but also the appropriateness of theuses of sentences the functions carried out bysentences and numerous other facets of what wecall meaning have been proposed as part of thenative speakers linguistic knowledge  We note that adopting this view  ultimatelymay be equivalent to Bloomfields view that noaspects of meaning belong in grammar  p                         I think it patently silly to waste time trying todecide whether the Lexicon note the capital L ofEnglish is conceived of as a list of words or as a list ofmorphemes meaningful elements that may standalone or combine to form words with a set of rulesgoverning how the elements operate  The questionis trivial for the systems need not be mutually exclusivenor need they exclude phrasal sets like Shut upand kick the bucket and red herring which do notyield to immediate constituent analysis  It may behard to believe but in the s some linguists advocateda stochastic approach to grammatical analysisthatis one in which each word was analyzedon its own without reference to what preceded orfollowedan approach that even the merest intelligenceought to have rejected            Grammar is a formidable term to many largelybecause of their associations with it from theirschooling either in learning a foreign language or inlearning more about their own  It is far from an easysubject but it can be an interesting one particularlyto those who enjoy seeing how such an extremelycomplicated phenomenon as language is and canbe put together to work  Carl Mills has written auseful understandable understanding and informativeintroduction to the subject            Laurence Urdang

generally regarded asunacceptably obscene is that even today it in noway coincides with the usage of the great majority ofthe audienceany more than did the excessivepuritanism of the old production code  Thus manypeople who go to the cinema encounter language towhich they are not accustomed in daily life  Eventhough such language is much more a feature ofAmerican than British films in the United Statesthere is a majority to whom this mode of speech isquite alien            Is all the language necessary then  The Americanfilm trade would argue that it is  The bourgeoisieand the Bible Belt are not after all the most profitableaudience the public that is wants strongsensation which they will to an extent measure bythe language in which the films are couched  Moreoversince the public tends to prejudge movies bytheir classification the film distributors aim for thoseclassifications that promise the strongest fare whileadmitting the largest age range  In Britain this is the certificate in the US the PG  Often there is acontractual obligation on filmmakers to achieve aPG for which the minimum requirement is oneuse of the obscenity fuck   It is perhaps significantthat even in the supremely family film MemphisBelle an attentive ear will detect the single requisiteusage            The level of language affects the extratheatricalcareers of films  Airline versions must have all thestrong language excised  In this country video versionslikely to be viewed at home are sometimesmore stringently classified by the BBFC than theoriginal films  American television is generally muchmore puritanical than Britains in reediting films fortransmission  British television has its own rulesBBC  and ITV will generally show films uncut after pm BBC  and Channel  after   When filmsare shown before those hours there is a danger thatthe viewer might be confused by abrupt cuts andbleeps  For the first time on Christmas Day the BBCcensored a film classified as U by the British boardwhen a shit was removed from ET  which followedthe Queens speech            Does language matter  James Ferman Secretaryof the BBFC points out that it is only in theEnglishspeaking world that such strong taboos havebeen built up around dictionary words and that thiscountry shares with South Africa alone its extremeanxiety about bad language            The most serious result of the proliferation ofthis comparatively restricted vocabulary is the impoverishmentof writing  For hack screenwriterssexually based words have become a kind of shorthandto represent insult or anger while rectalexcretory words more generally are used to get aneasy laugh  As inevitably as Pow or Wham incomic strips a comedy crash or fall has to be accompaniedby a cry of Sheeit

in their directionsregarding the citing of others writings  But I havebeen unable to find any recommendations regardingthe quotations of oral material though such quotationsare very common in newspapers and otherperiodicals that deal with current affairs and especiallywith the world of entertainment andcelebrities  The quotations marks are intendedto emphasize criticism of the practice of all the mediato devote an inordinate amount of time andspace to the interviewing and promotion of actorssingers and other entertainers most of whom havenothing to say and who make their living utteringwords created by others  Articulate artists writersmusicians lawyers scientists teachers historiansetc are almost totally ignored by the media unlessthey can be identified as newsmakers            The style problem is fairly simple to describe  Ifan American writer quotes a British speaker as sayingHonor thy father it would be arrant nonsensefor some pedant to say If he is British he did notsay that  He said Honour thy father   And in arecent article by Peter Stothard in The Times SaturdayReview  October  about DianneFeinstein the California politician she is quoted assaying California does not want to swap one greypinstripe suit for another grey pinstripe suit inwhich it would be silly to point out that as an Americanshe would have said gray not grey  Onthe other hand the same article quoted GeorgeBush as having said I kicked some arse last nightin his debate against Geraldine Ferraro in the campaign for vice president and we all know thatBush does not say arse   In reference to Feinsteinsadversary in the recent campaign Pete Wilson ananonymous taunt is quoted as And what about Wilsonsnew blue Paul Newman contact lenses  Andhis steppedup shoes  As the taunter was an Americanwhy is he using the Briticism steppedup shoes Admittedly its meaning is transparent but Americansdo not use expressions like steppedup shoes             Some idioms do need translating  If such an idiomoccurs in a direct quotation it ought to be leftthe way it was then explained even though therhythm of the writing be disturbed  In live interviewsthat is not always easily done especially whenthe interviewer is unfamiliar with an expression andis too embarrassed to admit it  In a recent televisioninterview a British actor was recounting an anecdotein which he used the idiom the penny dropped which means I saw the light came the dawn  Amomentary flicker of perplexity on the interviewersface showed that he had not the slightest idea ofwhat the speaker had said but he blandly continuedwithout missing a stroke            I am reminded of an incident that took placesome twenty years ago when I first began visitingBritain regularly and was unfamiliar with nonliteraryBriticisms  Several of us were locked in a long andtiring discussion of a projects costs which I consideredto be realistic and the others thought expensiveFinally a bit exasperated I blurted out what Ithought would be the metaphor that would settlethe issue saying If you want to make a pennyyouve got to spend a penny  Although those presentwere too polite to split their sides and roll aboutin hysterics they were obviously amused for as wasexplained to me I had picked the wrong metaphorspend a penny is a Briticism for go to the loo or asthey say in America the bathroom  It might notbe inappropriate here to point out that in additionto this British idiom the only other major contributionmade to culture by pay toilets was the inventionin Scotland I understand of limbo dancing            Struggling back to the subject I should suggestthat in quoting spoken material mere spelling of theorder of honorhonour travelertraveller panelingpanelling should follow the style of the mediumwherever it is published  The speakers wordsshould never be changed that is arse ought not besubstituted for ass or vice versa and if an explanationof an unfamiliar word or phrase is required itought to be supplied even if this must be relegatedto a footnote  In this particular case it is doubtfulthat anyone reading The Times is unaware of themeaning of American ass   Another alternative notalways possible is to avoid entirely the passage containingthe problem word or phrase  Perhaps thebest choice is to use indirect discourse Bush saidthat he had kicked some arse in his debate against Almost anything is preferable to putting into peoplesmouths things they did not say                              Dictionnaire de Franglais            There has come into my possession

Power Made Easy            Why is it that I seem to be able to find typographicalerrors in others works but seldom in myown  The first thing I spotted in this British editionof a book that has enjoyed enormous success inNorth America for some forty years was opthalmologista common enough spelling error but becauseit is spelt correctly elsewhere merely a typoI started looking for signs that it has been suitablyBriticized  Sure enough gynaecologist and paediatricianwere so spelt in a section called How to talkabout doctors            As the book has been around for a long time itprobably works for many people despite the factthat it violates my principle that the only legitimateway of increasing a persons vocabulary is throughreading reading reading and then writing writingwriting  There is no doubt that the book is verywell presented well written and well organizedmoreover it offers good sound accurate informationabout the lexicon of English  Whether one canput that information to the appropriate use of buildingup vocabulary is moot indubitably some canand one never knows till one tries            Laurence Urdang                              Unbeknownst to many but historians and

quadrangle mapsare named for the most prominent feature on themap he had difficulty trying to explain his choice ofname  He sent the following report to the officeThe Sherman quadrangle is named after thetown of Sherman  There is no town by the nameof Sherman  The chief center of population of theSherman quadrangle is called Dwyer but thepost office at Dwyer is called Faywood Post OfficeFaywood Post Office used to be located atFaywood but since Faywood no longer exists itwas moved to Dwyer  It is not possible to namethe Sherman quadrangle the Faywood quadranglebecause there already is a Faywood Station quadrangleadjacent to the Sherman quadrangeFaywood Station is of course the station of thetown of Faywood which no longer exists  In thedays when it did exist it was located in the Shermanquadrangle about three miles east ofFaywood StationAs was mentioned above there is no town bythe name of Sherman  This is because the townof Sherman is really called San Juan  Howeverbecause there is another town by the name of SanJuan somewhere else in New Mexico they had tocall the post office Sherman Post Office  It wasnamed after Sherman  San Juan is not in the Shermanquadrangle but

determination of pronunciaton etymologysynonyms usage notes and any other paraphernaliaoffered comes low on the list            As I have observed on numerous occasions inthe past dictionaries are rarely consulted by thosewho need them the most  In order to consult a referencebook one must first acknowledge either ignoranceor insecurity neither of which is either acrime or a reprehensible condition many people arevery certain about things about which they are deadwrong thus never look them up to check their accuracyOn the morning of  September  in areport on the BushGorbachov meeting in Helsinkia reporter on CNN the US Cable News Networkreferred to the conference using a term that couldonly be spelled tteth which might have beensome strange metaphor meaning head in the tea orperhaps it was an oblique reference to China or tohocking a tchainik gossiping  In any event as it wasbeing read from a script and not delivered off thecuff I classified it as an illiteracy            Recently I was editing a manuscript of a dictionaryin which the lexicographer labeled irregardlessan illiteracy and I suggested that a less criticalmore clinical term might be nonstandard   Readersmight disagree but I felt that regardless is more soto speak in the public domain than an expressionlike ttette  which one might classify as an intellectualismand certainly a more pretentious termthan gettogether or meeting   If one is going to bepretentious one ought to get his pretences properlyin a row  The antiintellectual version of ttette isits English translation headtohead  which soundssomewhat vulgar to me and carries with it more thesense of confrontation than intimate encounterAnother example of an antiintellectualism is theexpression between a rock and a hard place  that isa rock and not Iraq regardless of currentevents  which I take to be a corruption of betweenScylla and Charybdis  neither of which is easy topronounce from its spelling  More examples of antiintellectualismswhile not exactly welcome willbe reported on as received            Linguists and lexicographers try to avoidloaded terms in the labeling of words and sensesin dictionaries  Taking a detached view is more scientificor clinical regardless of what the individualscholar might feel one would scarcely expect adoctor diagnosing a victim of some revolting afflictionto accuse the patient of having a disgustingdisease  By the same token the sober observer oflanguage ought not allow his emotions to get in theway of his cool evaluation of the facts as he seesthem and a label like Illiterate has pejorative overtonesand undertones inappropriate to the detachedscholarly view            Years ago lexicographers used the label Colloquialto designate words and senses that were at alanguage level somewhat below that of formal usagebut not so low down and dirty as to be consideredVulgar or Slang   A word like Goody Great piddling or tart up would fall into this category thoughthe kind and quantity of terms included dependlargely on the prudishness of the person doing thelabeling  Vulgar  which really means no more thanunrefined is rarely encountered in modern dictionariesas a label because people have taken todesignating fourletter words as vulgar illustratingthe semantic process known as pejoration depreciationthe opposite of melioration   Today we shouldprobably consider labeling Great as Vulgar a bitharsh  Because dictionary users became accustomedto seeing words and senses of which they disapprovedin formal contexts bearing the Colloquiallabel the word colloquial began to undergo pejorationitself  By the early s when the labels to beused in The Random House Dictionary were beingreviewed and discussed we decided to drop the Colloquiallabel used in The American College Dictionaryin favor of Informal  a practice followed by mostEnglish dictionary publishers from that time untilnow  Colloquial means nothing more than used incolloquy or conversation and is thus no more than ahighflown term for conversational  which as far as Iknow carries no stigma   Slang is far too complex anotion and label to discuss here and will be treatedat another time            Why lexicographers have not used Conversationalor its abbreviations Conv or Convers  I cannotsay perhaps some have and I am not aware of itMy own observation is that Informal might be undergoingits own round of pejoration  these thingssometimes go in cycles  and in a reference book Irecently completed which will be published by OxfordUniversity Press in the autumn of  I havechosen to return to Colloq   As the book is inmachinereadable form should the publisher decidein a generations time to switch back to Informal the change can be readily accommodated
