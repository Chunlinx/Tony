                                 Enemies of the WTO            If a picture is worth a thousand words a twopagespread in the New York Times  featuring more than a dozen pictures canspeak volumes And sure enough the lavish Nov  advertisement by the TurningPoint Project a coalition of activists opposed to globalization in general andthe World Trade Organization in particular said more than any merely verbalexposition about what really motivates those activists could Indeed itrevealed quite a bit more than its sponsors intended            The occasion for the adwas the upcoming WTO ministerial taking place in Seattle in a few days TheWTO has become to leftist mythology what the United Nations is to the militiamovement the center of a global conspiracy against all that is good anddecent According to the myth the ultrasecretive WTO has become a sort ofsupergovernmental body that forces nations to bow to the wishes ofmultinational corporations It destroys local cultures the headline on the adread Global Monoculture it despoils the environment and it rides roughshodover democracy forcing governments to remove laws that conflict with itssinister purposes            Like most successful urban legends this one is based on asliver of truth The gradual global progress toward free trade that began inthe s when Franklin Roosevelt introduced the Trade Agreements Program hasalways depended on international negotiations Ill reduce my tariffs if youreduce yours But there has always been the problem of governments that givewith one hand and take away with the other that dutifully remove tariffs andthen use other excuses to keep imports out  Certainement  there is freetrade within the European Union but those British cows they are not safe Tomake agreements work there has to be some kind of quasijudicial process thatdetermines when ostensibly domestic measures are de facto a reimposition oftrade barriers and hence a violation of treaty Under the preWTO system theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade this process was slow and cumbersomeIt has now become swifter and more decisive Inevitably some of its decisionscan be challenged Was the US ban on dolphinunsafe tuna really a tradebarrier in disguise But the muchfeared power of the WTO to overrule locallaws is strictly limited to enforcement of the spirit of existing agreementsIt cannot in any important way force countries that are skeptical about thebenefits of globalization to open themselves further to foreign trade andinvestment If most countries nonetheless are eager or at least willing toparticipate in globalization it is because they are convinced that it is intheir own interests            And by and large they areright The raw fact is that every successful example of economic developmentthis past centuryevery case of a poor nation that worked its way up to a moreor less decent or at least dramatically better standard of livinghas takenplace via globalization that is by producing for the world market rather thantrying for selfsufficiency Many of the workers who do that production for theglobal market are very badly paid by First World standards But to claim thatthey have been impoverished by globalization you have to carefully ignorecomparisons across time and spacenamely you have to forget that thoseworkers were even poorer before the new exporting jobs became available andignore the fact that those who do not have access to the global market are farworse off than those who do See my old                   Slate                piece   Thefinancial crisis of  temporarily gave those who claim that globalizationis bad for workers everywhere a bit of ammunition but the crisis did not go onforever and anyway the solution to future crises surely involves some policingof shortterm capital movements rather than a retreat from globalization as awhole Even the Malaysians continue to welcome longterm foreign investors andplace their faith on manufactured exports            What about the environment Certainly some forests havebeen cut down to feed global markets But nations that are heedless of theenvironment are quite capable of doing immense damage without the help ofmultinational corporationsjust ask the Eastern Europeans For what it isworth the most conspicuous examples of environmental pillage in the ThirdWorld today have nothing to do with the WTO The forest fires that envelopSoutheast Asia in an annual smoke cloud are set by landhungry locals thesubsidized destruction of Amazonian rain forests began as part of a Brazilianstrategy of inwardlooking development On the whole integration of the worldeconomy which puts national actions under international scrutiny is probablyon balance a force toward better not worse environmental policies            But anyway these are side issues because whatthat advertisement makes clearclearer I suspect than its sponsorsintendedis that the opposition to globalization actually has very little todo with wages or the environment After all leaving aside a photo of treestumps and another of an outfall pipe here are the horrors of globalizationthe Turning Point Project chose to illustrate            A highway interchange a parking lot filled withcars a traffic jam suburban tract housing an apartment building withnumerous satellite dishes an office with many computer screens office workerson a busy street highrise office buildings a factory farm with manychickens a supermarket aisle a McDonalds arch            Each picture wasaccompanied by a caption asking Is this Los Angeles or Cairo Is this Indiaor London etc            What is so horrible about these scenes Heres what the adsays A few decades ago it was still possible to leave home and go somewhereelse The architecture was different the landscape was different thelanguage dress and values were different That was a time when we could speakof cultural diversity But with economic globalization diversity is fastdisappearing            You cant argue with that lives there the touristwith soul so dead that he does not wish that he could visit rural France orMexico City or for that matter Kansas City the way they were rather than theway they are But the world is not run for the edification of tourists It isor should be run for the benefit of ordinary people in their daily lives Andthat is where the indignation of the Turning Point people starts to seem ratherstrange            For surely the moststriking thing about the horrors of globalization illustrated in those photosis that for most of the worlds people they represent aspirations things theywish they had rather than ominous threats Traffic jams and ugly interchangesare annoying but most people would gladly accept that annoyance in exchangefor the freedom that comes with owning a car and more to the point beingwealthy enough to afford one Tract housing and apartment buildings may beugly but they are paradise compared with village huts or urban shantiesWearing a suit and working at a computer in an office tower are believe it ornot preferable to backbreaking work in a rice paddy            Now of course what is good for the individual is notalways good if everyone else does it too Having a big house with a garden isnice but seeing the countryside covered by suburban sprawl is not and wemight all be better off if we could all agree or be convinced by taxincentives to take up a bit less space The same goes for cultural choicesBoston residents who indulge their taste for Canadian divas do undermine theprospects of local singersongwriters and might be collectively better off iflocal radio stations had some kind of cultural content rule But there is avery fine line between such arguments for collective action and superciliouspaternalism especially when cultural matters are concerned are we warningsocieties about unintended consequences or are we simply disagreeing withindividual tastes            And it is very clear from the advertisement in theTimes that the Turning Point Projectand the whole movement itrepresentsare on the supercilious side of that line Although they talk offreedom and democracy their key demand is that individuals be prevented fromgetting what they wantthat governments be free nay encouraged to denyindividuals the right to drive cars work in offices eat cheeseburgers andwatch satellite TV Why Presumably because people will really be happier ifthey retain their traditional language dress and values Thus Spaniardswould be happier if they still dressed in black and let narrowminded priestsrun their lives and residents of the American South would be happier ifplanters still sipped mint juleps wore white suits and accepted traditionaldeference from sharecroppers  instead of living in this dreary modernworld in which Madrid is just like Paris and Atlanta is just like New York            Well somehow I suspect that the residents ofMadrid and Atlanta while they may regret some loss of tradition prefermodernity And you know what I think the rest of the world has the right tomake the same choice
