                                 Downsizing the Mob            When after an absence ofseveral years Al Pacino returned to the screen in Sea of Love he looked like a human filament all dark burning eyes that never seemed toblink His intensity was startling but you couldnt be sure how to take himAlways an actor of moods his timing had become even more capricious He didntspeak his lines he distended them He never seemed to want to let them out ofhis mouth At once manic and zonedout Pacino acted in a hambone universe ofhis own and when he was rewarded with an Oscar for his grandstanding inScent of a Woman well as the gangsters in his new filmDonnie Brasco  might say Fuh get about it            InDonnie Brasco  Pacino has been cast as a sad little Mafia secondraternamed Lefty Ruggiero who boasts repeatedly of having clipped  guys yetis always passed over for promotions within the family With his gold chainsand fur collars Lefty is a howlingly tacky parody of a mobster and Pacinouses all his blowhard insecurities along with his patented air of electrifiedstupor to elicit from us an astounding degree of sympathy Nothing Lefty saysor does comes out rightespecially his adoption of a protg a young jewelthief called Donnie Brasco Johnny Depp who turns out of course to be anundercover FBI agent            The miracle of the film which is based on a memoir by thereal Brasco Joseph D Pistone in collaboration with Richard Woodley isthat with so many layers of irony its so emotionally pureand so wrenchingPartly this comes from the tension between the snappy driving screenplay byPaul Attanasio and the elegiac tone of the director Englishman Mike Newellalong with his magnificent composer Patrick Doyle And partly it comes fromPacino whose epic selfabsorption in this context makes Lefty seemheartbreakingly vulnerable even while hes blowing peoples heads off Itshard to think of another American film with this range of moods satiricalsometimes hilarious yet suffused with a sense of loss and riddled with thekind of violence that makes you recoil and lean forward simultaneously            I knew thescreenwriter Attanasio in college and later when he was the chief filmcritic of the Washington                Post  Watching Donnie               Brasco  I remembered that he loved to quote from a relatively obscurescene in The                Godfather  the one by the stove in the Corleonekitchen in which Clemenza Richard S Castellano discoursed on the art offrying sausages and peppers for young Michael Pacino Loose and giddy arelief from all the gore and gravitas the scene made even more explicit themovies theme of family both real and extended As nightmarish as theCorleones lives came to be there was still something seductive about beingtaken under the wings of expansive father figures with few uncertainties aboutwhat they were put on this earth to do What a kick to see Pacino  yearslater in the Clemenza role demonstrating for Donnie how to make coq auvin  This time though the scene has an undercurrent of shame Pistoneknows that hes exploiting the older mans best most fatherly instincts andit tears him up Later theres a tiny but significant moment when Leftywonders how Donnie could be a traitor when hes been a guest in Leftyshomewhen Lefty has cooked for him            Like The Godfather  Donnie Brascorevolves around families except that theyre now the source of guilt insteadof reassurance Lefty seems drawn to Donnie because he bears a physicalresemblance to the gangsters own son a junkie who keeps his distance SoLeftys exhortations on the subject of wiseguy etiquettecarry your money ina wad not a wallet lose the facial hairhave an unusual zeal Lefty islooking for another shot at fatherhood Pistone who dislikes the officioussuperiors in his FBI family boasts of having his hooks in Lefty but comesto dread and delay the moment when hell be pulled out of Operation DonnieBrasco and called upon to bring about his mentors demise Theres anothertortured family too Pistones wife and three daughters who languish in theabsence of a steady father            I wasntlooking forward to the scenes with Joes wife Maggie because thestickinthemud spouse has become such a clichalthough I was curious to seewhat the vivid young actress Anne Heche could do with a role in which shedidnt have to shed her clothes As written and played however Maggiesscenes are intrusions in the best sense They gnaw on Pistone from anotherangle they add a point to the films complex geometry Heche who played DemiMoores doomed doctor girlfriend in The Juror  brings a wounded poetryto Maggies bedragglement Sagging under the weight of running a householdandof her daughters unspoken but persistent disappointmentshe has no vocabularyto convey to her husband what shes going through She cant share his work orknow his daily sometimes weekly whereabouts and you can see how thepowerlessness eats at her When she finally takes actionchanging the familysphone number without informing himher justification has a scary force Now Iknow how it feels to be in control            On the evidence of his book Pistone was truly torn upabout having abandoned his family for the years it took him to infiltrate themob but he didnt lose as much sleep over what he was doing to his Mafiafamily Thats the screenwriters conceit And the actual Lefty seems to havehad much less stature The part Pacino plays is a fusion of that Lefty and thenobler aspects of gang leader Sonny Black Napolitanowhom the film reducesto a remorseless hothead played by the new king of movie bullies MichaelMadsen The story has been fictionalized but it hasnt been HollywoodizedDonnie Brasco gives us a novel perspective on gangstersas the bottomfeeders of

isnt a single element on whichAttanasio hasnt put a fresh spin            Nor is there a moment when Newell takes theeasy way out Ive always found his films  Dance With a Stranger  TheGood Father
