                                 The Sound of One Hand Talking            Last week John HopeFranklin the venerable Duke University historian and chair of the presidentsadvisory board on race told reporters that his panel would refuse to hear fromopponents of affirmative action in higher education This policy seems bothwrong in principle and politically foolish Why on earth have a panel dedicatedto racial reconciliation and exclude one of the two views that need to bereconciled on the most divisive racial issue What harm could come from lettingcritics have their say compared with the harm of seeming to censor themFranklins only explanation was an imperious Im not certain what Californiaaffirmativeaction critic Ward Connerly could contribute to thisdiscussion            A seniorofficial working with the panel is a bit less opaque The point of thecommittee is to help formulate White House policy So why should we appointpeople who disagree with the President Why hear testimony from people whovehemently disagree with him Another member of the panels staff said Thisis not the Kerner Commission referring to the panel appointed by PresidentJohnson after the urban riots of the s            President Clinton said the panels mission was to be agreat and unprecedented conversation about race But apparently the mainpurpose of convening the committees monthly meetings is to provide an occasionfor the administration to unveil installments of the Presidents RaceInitiativea yearlong parade of minipolicies Last week for instance theWhite House announced that  million would be divided among  differentnonprofit groups so they can bring more housingdiscrimination cases            The WhiteHouse concocts these policies without say from committee members Behind theinflated rhetoric the Franklin panel has only a slim mandate and little powerIt is not legally allowed to meet in private and cannot even write its ownfinal reportprerequisites for any selfrespecting commission            Another bit of the explanation concerns thepeople running the panel In theory John Hope Franklin is the perfect chairfor an anodyne exercise in racial reconciliation His public image is that ofan avuncular Southern gentleman Franklin is the Jackie Robinson of historiansthe first black chair of an integrated history department and the first blackpresident of the major American history associations His most important booksrewrote  years of wrongheaded often racist historiography ofReconstruction The black carpetbaggers who ruled parts of the Southfollowing the Civil War were sincere democrats he proved not venaldictators            But overthe last decade Franklins lectures and essays on race have acquired apessimistic angry edge He laments the permanence of racism which he feels isnow deeply entrenched in almost every American institution Franklin whoresearched briefs for Brown vs Board and marched in Selma expected thecivilrights revolution to remake society Instead of dramatic change he seesonly marginal improvement and enduring black urban poverty job discriminationand even Jim Crow attitudes And he says those who ignore the extent of thisracism are not only mistaken but also racist They have no interest inachieving a colorblind society and would be horrified if we even approachedit            Franklin is old The real power in the panel rests withHarvard law Professor Christopher Edley Jr Edley plans the committee strategyand will write the final report on race relations As a White House aide inClintons first term Edley was author of the administrationscharacteristically nuanced or if you prefer mushy and havingitbothwaysmend it dont end it policy for affirmative action But since leaving thegovernment Edley has become more shrill In a roundtable debate on theAtlantic Monthly s Web site he repeatedly calls opponents ofaffirmative action counterrevolutionaries He says Though their oppositionto these measures is framed as principle certainly their real goal is toprotect the current distribution of privilege and opportunity that has producedwhitemale elites in virtually every sector Most recently Edley has calledAmerica in Black and White  Abigail and Stephan Thernstromsantiaffirmativeaction tome a crime against humanity            Edley and Franklin areentitled to their views which may even be correct But should people with suchstrident opinions be responsible for a panel on racial reconciliation It seemsespecially stupid for the administration to spew platitudes about the panelsmission of healing if its intention was to push one side of a contentiousdebate
