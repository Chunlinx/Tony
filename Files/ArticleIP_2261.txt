                                 Lying All the Way to the Bank            By JacobWeisberg            On the last day of theDemocratic National Convention in Chicago I woke to the news that presidentialadviser Dick Morris was about to resign over reports that he had beenconsorting with a anhour prostitute I was of course amazed But then Ithought Why should anyone be surprised Morris is a anhourprostitute Things have changed since then Morris has raised his prices            Now anormal person would be offended by what Ive just written In Morris casethough Im afraid he may use it as a blurb for the paperback edition of hisbook Behind the Oval Office  The current version includes this blurbfrom a brutal demolition job in Vanity Fair  He never stops Somehoweach shocking thing he does tops the shocking thing he did last year or lastmonth or even last week Morris career has developed the curious quality ofa plea bargain in reverse If you say hes guilty of a misdemeanor he will tryto persuade you hes actually committed a felony            In reality hes not fit to stand trial Morris discussesright and wrong as if those concepts were as remote from his own experience aslunar geology I wanted to address the values agenda three or four times aweek he writes at one point in the book First though we had to identifythrough polls which values were important to Americans Blind people oftenhave highly developed powers of hearing and smell but in Morris case he doesnot seem to have compensated for an attenuated moral sense with any otherheightened abilitiesnot intelligence not political savvy and certainly notliterary acumen Despite being rotten to the core Dick Morris demonstrates inhis book that he has nothing else to offer            Morris casts himself ofcourse as the man who brought Bill Clinton back from calamity and got himreelected in  Most of the press fell for this hype during the campaignBut Morris own account undermines the myth By claiming credit for absolutelyeverything Morris leaves you wondering whether he deserves credit for anythingat all To call his recollections unreliable would be a massiveunderstatement There is hardly anything he says in the book that he does notcontradict at some other point in the book Usually the mutually contradictorystatements fall within a few pages of each other Here are just a few subjectswhere Morris leaves the reader absolutely mystified about his views and hisrole                           Negative advertisingOn page  Morris swears off it As Eileen Morris wife who is nowdivorcing him and my therapist Dr Elizabeth Hauser softened my rage andbrought me inner peace for the first time in my life I decided to abandonnegative advertising as a mtier On page  Morris boasts about an ad he hadproduced for Clinton attacking an opponent in the  Arkansas gubernatorialprimary Dont let McRae build a wall around Arkansas Five pages after thatMorris brags about his script for an ad in the general election of that yearIt culminated in this assertion You cant trust Sheffield Nelson                           Foreign interventionNoninvolvement in Bosnia had been a central element in my advice he writeson page  But just a few pages earlier Morris was taking credit forClintons brave decision to send troops to Bosnia And a few pages later hestelling the president to bomb the Serbs back to the Stone Age I dont meanthe current stuff  where NATO sends in only a few planes he counsels Imean an air strike that continues until they give up                           Press leaksThroughout my tenure at the White House I never leaked information unless Iwas told to Morris writes on page  On the same page I called DavidBroder of the Washington Post to give him background on the strategicimplications of the speech and he ran a story The call wasnt authorizedinfact Morris got in trouble for it he says                           Budgetcuts On page  Morris advises Clinton Medicare cuts are your singlebiggest weapon against the Republicans They are hated by the public old andyoung Three pages later he writes I argued that as long as we lined upwith the congressional Democrats and just sniped at cuts in school lunches andMedicare we would get nowhere            This last contradiction is central because it goes to theheart of Morris claim to have got Clinton reelected The conventionalunderstanding at the time was that it was Morris liberal enemiesGeorgeStephanopoulos Harold Ickes and Leon Panettawho were arguing in favor offiercely resisting Republican cuts in social spending while Morris was tellingClinton to distance himself from the intransigent congressional DemocratsAccording to my sources at the time Morris was desperately pushing for abudget deal and making the kind of hilariously precise electoral promises forwhich he was legendary If he compromised with Gingrich Clinton would win by apoint margin take back Congress and so forth            Inreality both plans were in play in the reelection effort Morristriangulation and the IckesPanettaStephanopoulos tactic of standing firmlyagainst Republican cuts in Medicare Medicaid education and the environmentBoth strategies were crucial Clinton recovered his lost popularity byresisting domestic budget cuts while his centrist values agenda helped tosolidify his electoral gains In retrospect Clinton appears to have shrewdlypitted the Ickes group against Morris as an exercise in the management styleFDR called creative tension Clinton needed Ickes to help him shore up hisliberal base and prevent a Democraticprimary challenge He used Morris to helphim move to the center Morris tries to take credit for both strategies But ifthere was a great political mind behind this synthesis it was that of thecandidate himself            Getting the president reelected is only one ofthe many many accomplishments claimed by Morris who plays both Boswell andJohnson in his memoirs You may not have known that it was Morris who hadsuggested Al Gore for vice president in  and that it was Morris who hadrecommended James Carville as strategist in that campaign Through secret backchannels to other political consultants Morris tells us that he managedrelations between Clinton and Boris Yeltsin It was none other than Morris whoplayed a pivotal role in the Dayton Peace Accords Richard Holbrooke toMorris Without those words of the presidents that you passed to me I wouldnever have been able to get it done And it was Morris ideas that keptClinton on track even after hisMorrisdownfall Clinton to Morris Werebasically following your game plan Its working well            But evenas he emulates the rooster that thinks the sun rises because it crows Morrisdemonstrates how right Panetta and the others were to be terrified about hisrunning amok in the White House Among the Morris microinitiatives that didntquite make it were a cent postage stamp with a penny going to your favoritecharity and a plan to force banks to meet new antimugging standards for ATMmachines Morris smallbore ideas as he calls them made the presidencylook somewhat ridiculous in  and  The ones that were killed in thecrib would have turned neoClintonism into a fullscale selfparody            Through it all Morris maintains that what he was doing wasreally very highminded I dont spin anything he writes huffily I put newsubstance and ideas before the voters Even as we see him fighting to reducegoverning to the most trivial micropandering Morris asserts the primacy ofprinciple Some reporters seem to think that the real story is never thecandidates idea but always the motivation to improve his or her politicalstatus he writes A few pages later of course hes explaining why Clintonhad to sign a welfare bill that no one liked in order to get reelected a vetowould have meant a threepoint loss            By the endof his book Morris has cast himself as a modest egomaniac a shy publicityhound a principled manipulator a loyal traitor and a truthful liar He isntjust confused hes the dialectic incarnate He aims for evil but only managesto look ridiculous
