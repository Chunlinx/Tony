United States General Accounting OfficeTestimonyGAOBefore the National Commission on the Public ServiceGAOTChairman Volcker and Members of the National Commission on thePublic ServiceI am pleased to be here today to discuss the essential actionsthat the federal government needs to take in order to manage itsmost important assetits people or human capital Anorganizations people define its culture drive its performanceembody its knowledge base and are the key to successful merger andtransformation efforts As such strategic human capital managementis the critical element to maximizing governments performance andassuring its accountability for the benefit of the AmericanpeopleThe early years of the st century are proving to be a periodof profound transition for our world our country and ourgovernment This transition is being driven by a number of keytrends including global interdependence diverse diffuse andasymmetrical security threats rapidly evolving science andtechnology dramatic shifts in the age and composition of thepopulation important quality of life issues the changing natureof our economy and evolving government structures and conceptsThese trends present a range of challenges that have no boundariesThese trends also contribute to a huge longerrange fiscal andbudgetary challenge facing the United States Given these trendsand longrange fiscal challenges the federal government needs toengage in a comprehensive review reassessment andreprioritization of what the government does how it does businessand who does the governments business We must reexamine a rangeof government policies programs and operations The status quo issimply unacceptable The longrange numbers do not add up We mustreexamine the base including our current human capital policiesand practices This reexamination will in turn require federalagencies to transform their cultures and shift their overallorientation fromprocesses to resultsstovepipes to matrixeshierarchical to flatter and more horizontalstructuresan inward focus to an external citizen customer andstakeholder focusmanagement control to employee empowermentreactive behavior to proactive approachesavoiding new technologies to embracing and leveragingthemhoarding knowledge to sharing knowledgeavoiding risk to managing risk andprotecting turf to forming partnershipsLeading public organizations here in the United States andabroad have found that strategic human capital management must bethe centerpiece of any serious change management initiative andefforts to transform the cultures of government agenciesUnfortunately as the Commission has made clear the federalgovernment is not well positioned to make the neededtransformation GAO designated strategic human capital managementas a governmentwide highrisk area in January  because of alongstanding lack of a consistent strategic approach tomarshaling managing and maintaining the human capital needed forgovernment to deliver on its promises We reported then and stillfind today that serious human capital shortfalls are eroding thecapacity of many agencies and threatening the ability of othersto economically efficiently and effectively perform theirmissions The federal governments human capital weaknesses didnot emerge overnight and will not be quickly or easily addressedThe enormous human capital and other transformation challenges thatneed to be addressed to transform the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation FBI and create a successful Department of HomelandSecurity are instructive of the critical and difficult task aheadCommitted sustained highly qualified and inspired leadershipand persistent attention by all key parties will be essential iflasting changes are to be made and the challenges we face acrossthe federal government successfully addressedFortunately we are now seeing increased attention to strategichuman capital management and a real and growing momentum for changeis now evident since we placed strategic human capital managementon our HighRisk listIn August  President Bush placed human capital atthe top of his management agendaUSGeneral Accounting Office HighRisk Series An

addition see the accompanying  reports numberedGAO through GAO on specific agenciesUSGeneral Accounting Office Homeland Security Proposalfor Cabinet Agency Has Merit But Implementation Will be Pivotal toSuccess GAOT Washington DC June   and FBIReorganization Initial Steps Encouraging but Broad TransformationNeeded GAOT Washington DC June  The Office of Management and Budget OMB is assessingagencies progress in addressing their individual human capitalchallenges as part of its management scorecard and midpoint reviewprocessAs one of its many efforts to help agencies with theseissues the Office of Personnel Management OPM released a humancapital scorecard last December to assist agencies in responding tothe OMB scorecardFinally Congress has underscored the consequences ofhuman capital weaknesses in federal agencies and pinpointedsolutions through the oversight process and a wide range ofhearings held over the last few yearsTherefore the key question today is how do we best seize theopportunity and build on the current momentum I have often notedthat the first step toward meeting the governments human capitalchallenges is for agency leaders to identify and make use of allthe appropriate administrative authorities available to them tomanage their people for results both effectively and equitablyMuch of the authority agency leaders need to manage human capitalstrategically is already available under current laws andregulations Agency leaders should not wait for comprehensive humancapital legislative reforms to happen The use of these authoritiesoften needs to be undertaken as part of and consistent withproven change management practices The second step is forpolicymakers to pursue incremental legislative reforms to giveagencies additional tools and flexibilities to hire manage andretain the human capital they need particularly in criticaloccupations Key provisions of legislative proposals underconsideration in Congress represent an important step to helpingagencies address their human capital management challenges Many ofthe provisions contained in the bills are consistent withauthorities we have been urging for other federal agencies Thethird step toward meeting the federal governments human capitalchallenges is for all interested parties to work together toidentify the kinds of comprehensive legislative reforms in thehuman capital area that should be enacted over time These reformsshould place greater emphasis on knowledge skills and performancein connection with federal employment promotion and compensationdecisions rather than on the passage of time the rate ofinflation or geographic location as is often the case todayShockingly over US General Accounting Office Managing for Results Buildingon the Momentum for

that the Commission may want to consider as its workmoves forward These broad opportunities include first aligningindividual and organizational performance second and directlyrelated to that implementing resultsoriented pay reform andthird sustaining agency transformation efforts I will concludewith some comments on how we in GAO are playing a constructive rolein helping the government address its human capital challengesincluding our efforts to lead by example in this criticallyimportant areaLeading organizations use their performance management systemsas a key tool for aligning institutional unit and employeeperformance achieving results accelerating change managing theorganization on a daytoday basis and facilitating communicationthroughout the year so that discussions about individual andorganizational performance are integrated and ongoing Performancemanagement systems in these leading organizations typically seek toachieve three key objectives First they strive to provide candidand constructive feedback to help individual employees maximizetheir potential in understanding and realizing the goals andobjectives of the agency Second they seek to provide managementwith the objective and factbased information it needs to rewardtop performers Third performance management systems provide thenecessary information and documentation to deal with poorperformers Most federal performance management systems fail toachieve these objectives In addition many federal agencies arejust beginning to recognize that their performance managementsystems can be strategic tools to achieve success In my opinionmodernizing agency performance appraisal and management systems andlinking them to agency strategic plans and desired outcomes shouldbe a top priorityResultsoriented performance agreements are one mechanism in aperformance management system that creates a line of sightshowingUS General Accounting Office Human Capital Key PrinciplesFrom Nine Private Sector Organizations GAOGGD WashingtonDC Jan  Page  GAOThow individual employees can contribute to overallorganizational goals  Agencies that effectively implement suchsystems must first align agency leaders performance expectationswith organizational goals and then cascade performance expectationsto other organizational levels These employees are then heldaccountable for their contributions to achieve desired results Ourwork has shown that agencies have benefited from their use ofresultsoriented performance agreements for political and seniorcareer executives The performance agreementsstrengthened alignment of resultsoriented goals withdaily operationsfostered collaboration across organizationalboundariesenhanced opportunities to discuss and routinely

evaluate themembers of the Senior Executive Service SES While agencies willneed to tailor their performance management systems to their uniqueorganizational requirements and climates they nonetheless are tohold executives accountable for results appraise executiveperformance on those results balanced against other dimensionsincluding customer satisfaction and employee perspective and usethose results as the basis for performance awards and otherpersonnel decisions Agencies were to implement the new policiesfor the SES appraisal cycles that began in Ultimately an effective performance management system must linkpay and incentive programs to individual knowledge skills andcontributions to achieving organizational results The affect ofpoor performers on agencies performance and morale can far exceedtheir small numbers Still while important dealing with poorperformers is only part of the challenge agencies need to createadditional incentives and rewards for valuable and highperformingemployees who represent the vast majority of the federal workforceCongress and the administration have repeatedly expressed acommitment to more fully link resources to results The Americanpeople expect and deserve this linkage as well However weUS General Accounting Office Managing for Results EmergingBenefits From Selected Agencies Use of Performance AgreementsGAO Washington DC Oct  Page  GAOTwill never achieve this linkage without modern and effectiveperformance management strategies Additional information on theperformance management programs in use in agencies and the relativestrengths and weaknesses of those programs along with bestpractice information would prove very helpful as agencies seek tolink pay to individual knowledge skills and performanceEfforts to link federal pay to knowledge skills andperformance should be part of a broader effort to align resourcedecisions to results As I noted fostered in part by theGovernment Performance and Results Act GPRA there has been anincreasing interest within the executive branch and the Congress inlinking performance and results to resource allocation and otherdecisions Consistent with that view we need to continue effortsto shift agency accountabilitywith appropriate safeguards andoversight to budgeted resources and results and away from otherinputs and processes The work of the recently completed CommercialActivities Panel which I had the privilege of chairing isillustrative in this regard One of the sourcing principlesadopted by the Panel was that the federal governments sourcingpolicy should avoid arbitrary fulltime equivalent FTE or othernumerical goals The principle is based on the unarguable pointthat the success of government programs should be measured by theresults achieved in terms of providing value to the taxpayer notthe size of the inhouse or contractor workforce I believe thatthe Panels principle should also apply to resource allocationgenerally We need to continue and even augmentefforts to shiftthe focus of management resource allocation and decisionmakingfrom inputs and process to a greater focus on results and outcomesand to provide management reasonable flexibility whileincorporating appropriate safeguards to prevent abuse In thisregard holding managers accountable for results based on aspecific dollar allocation versus FTE caps would be a major step inthe right directionAs youknow I believe that a greater emphasis should be placed onknowledge skills and performance in connection with federalOriented Approach to employment promotion and compensationdecisions at all levels ratherthan the passage of time the rate ofinflation or geographic location as so often is the case todayIn recent years widespread concern has beenCommercial Activities Panel Improving the Sourcing Decisions ofthe Government Final Report Washington DC April Page  GAOTEnsuring Leadership and Accountability forAgencies Transformation Effortsexpressed about the methodology and results of the procedures todetermine the federal pay gap These concerns are among the reasonsthat the pay gap has never been fully addressed I believe thatcareful study is needed to develop more realistic and workablemethodologies and solutions to federal pay issues Part of thatassessment should focus on options for moving away from acompensation system that contains governmentwide pay increases withlocality adjustments and toward a system that is based to agreater degree on the knowledge skills and performance of theindividuals involvedI fully appreciate that much work may be needed before agenciesrespective performance management systems are able to support amore direct link between pay and individual knowledge skills andperformance OPM certainly has a continuing and vital role to playin connection with these issues OPMs recently released whitepaper on federal pay provides a good foundation for theresultsoriented pay reform discussion that must now take placeThe greater use of broadbanding is one of the options thatdeserves to be discussed In the short term Congress may wish toexplore the benefits of  providing OPM with additionalflexibility that would enable it to grant governmentwide authorityfor all agencies ie class exemptions to use broadbanding forcertain critical occupations andor  allowing agencies to applyto OPM ie case exemptions for broadbanding authority for theirspecific critical occupations However agencies should be requiredto demonstrate to OPMs satisfaction that they have moderneffective and validated performance management systems before theyare allowed to use broadbandingThe nature and scope of the cultural transformation that needsto take place in many agencies across the federal government willtake years to accomplisheasily outrunning the tenures of mostpolitical appointees At the same time GAOs work over the yearsmost prominently in our HighRisk and Performance andAccountability Series has amply documented that many agenciessuffer

Modernization Washington DC AprilPage  GAOTrequiring concerted action and sustained toplevel attention ifthey are to be addressedOne option for addressing the issues agencies face is to createa Chief Operating Officer COO position for selected agencies thatwould provide the sustained management attention essential foraddressing key stewardship responsibilities in an integrated mannerwhile helping to facilitate the transformation process within anagency These longterm responsibilities are professional andnonpartisan in nature They cover a range of good governmentresponsibilities that are fundamental to effectively executing anyadministrations program agenda Statutory COOs would differfrombut hopefully complementthe roles often assumed by thecurrent Deputy Secretaries in assisting the

Washington DC Apr   andGAOTWhile various models for structuring such a position could beused one option would be to have a COO who is appointed subjectto Senate confirmation to a term of  to  years generallyconsidered to be the minimum time needed for major changeinitiatives to provide meaningful and sustainable results The COOshould be at an organizational level equivalent to the currentdeputies in major departments and agencies in order to help assurethe effectiveness of this position A term appointment would helpto provide continuity that spans the tenure of the politicalleadership to ensure that longterm stewardship issues areaddressed and change management initiatives are successfullycompleted The individual would be selected without regard topolitical affiliation based on  demonstrated leadership skillsin managing large and complex organizations and  experienceachieving results in connection with a number of the aboveresponsibilities To further clarify accountability the COO couldbe subject to a clearly defined resultsoriented performancecontract with appropriate incentive reward and accountabilitymechanismsIf Congress and the executive branch decide to move forward withthe COO approach it may make sense to use a pilot in a selectnumber of agencies using a value and riskbased approach Forexample an agency that is experiencing particularly significantchallenges in integrating disparate organizational cultures suchas the proposed Department of Homeland Security may be anespecially appropriate first phase candidate Agencies engaged inmajor transformation efforts like the FBI the Internal RevenueService IRS and the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration NASA could also benefit from such an approachSimilarly a challenged agencyone that has longstandingmanagement weaknesses and highrisk operations or functions suchas the Department of Defense DODmay also be a good first phasecandidate The point would be for the Congress executive branchleadership in OMB and OPM agencies and others to gain experiencewith the COO approach before deciding how and where it should beapplied across the governmentMore generally we need to comprehensively examine opportunitiesfor better using the federal governments career SES leadershipThis examination should focus on a number of issues that have beensuggestedUS General

HelpAgencies Address Their Human Capital Challengesto strengthen the SES and thereby improve federal performanceand foster transformation efforts These issues include forexample concerns over SES compensation and pay compression Ibelieve that the issue of whether and how much to increase SES paymust be discussed within the context of how to make any payincreases variable and performancebased rather thanacrosstheboard and fixed We also must carefully examine thecomposition of the SES It seems to me that in general currentmembers of the SES fill three broad roles executive leadershipprogram management and senior technical and specialists positionsWe need to look at the implications that these differing roles havefor a range of issues such as SES core competencies performancestandards recruitment sources mobility and training anddevelopment programs We also need to look at whether the number oflevels within the SES ie ES  through  are necessary andappropriateAs the federal governments leading accountability organizationwe have made a concerted effort to identify and encourage theimplementation of human capital practices that improve theefficiency effectiveness and accountability of the federalgovernment Over the last few years we have issued numerousreports with practical recommendations on the steps individualagencies can take to address their specific human

released A Model of Strategic HumanCapital Management the latest in a series of tools designed toassist agency leaders in effectively managing their people Ourmodel is designed to help agency leaders effectively lead andmanage their people and integrate human capital considerations intodaily decision making and the program results they seek to achieveIn so doing the model highlights the importance of a sustainedcommitment by agency leaders to maximize the value of theiragencies human capital and to manage related risks Accordinglyit raises the bar for all of usthose in positions of leadershipfederal managers employees unions and human capital executivesand their teamsConsistent with OPMs and OMBs views our model of strategichuman capital management embodies an approach that is factbasedfocused on strategic results and incorporates merit principles andother national goals As such the model reflects two principlescentral to the human capital ideaPeople are assets whose value can be enhanced throughinvestment As with any investment the goal is to maximize valuewhile managing riskAn organizations human capital approaches should bedesigned implemented and assessed by the standard of how wellthey help the organization pursue its mission and achieve desiredresults or outcomesThe model highlights the kinds of thinking that agencies shouldapply as well as some of the steps they can take to make progressin managing human capital strategically The concepts presented inthe model are arranged around eight critical success factors whichare organized in pairs to correspond with four cornerstones ofeffective strategic human capital management See Fig US General Accounting Office A Model of Strategic HumanCapital Management GAOSP Washington DC Mar Page  GAOTFigure  Critical Success Factors Organized by Human CapitalCornerstones Human CapitalCornerstones  Critical Success FactorsAs I noted before OPM and OMB also have developed tools thatare being used to assess human capital management efforts Weprovided drafts of our human capital model to OPM and OMB for theirreview prior to publication to help ensure that the three effortsare conceptually consistent We hope that the perspective andinformation provided in ourPage  GAOTGAOs Efforts to Lead by Examplemodel will help inform agencies efforts to respond to theadministrations management initiatives such as getting to greenon OMBs management scorecard and using the tools developed by OPMWhile we remain sensitive of the need to maintain our institutionalindependence we are working constructively with OPM OMB andothers to explore opportunities to develop a more fully integratedset of guidance and tools for agencies to address their humancapital challengesIn addition to providing tools to help agencies help themselveswe believe it is our responsibility to lead by example We are inthe vanguard of the federal governments efforts to modernizeexisting human capital strategies and we are committed to stayingin this position Our people are our most valuable asset and it isonly through their combined efforts that we can effectively serveour clients and our country By managing our workforcestrategically and focusing on results we are helping to maximizeour own performance and ensure our own accountability By doing sowe also hope to demonstrate to other federal agencies that they canmake similar improvements in the way they manage their peopleWe have identified and made use of a variety of tools andflexibilities some of which were made available to us through theGAO Personnel Act of  and our  legislation but most ofwhich are available to federal agenciesThe most prominent change in human capital management that weimplemented as a result of the GAO Personnel Act of  was abroadbanded payforperformance system The primary goal of thissystem is to base employee compensation primarily on the knowledgeskills and performance of individual employees It providesmanagers flexibility to assign employees in a manner that is moresuitable to multitasking and the full use of staff Under ourcurrent broadbanded system analyst and analystrelated staff inGrades  through  were placed in three bands We expect to modifyour banded system in the future based on our experience todateUS General Accounting Office Managing for Results Next Stepsto Improve the Federal Governments Management and PerformanceGAOT Washington DC Feb  Page  GAOTIn January  we implemented a new competencybasedperformance management system that is intended to create a clearlinkage between employee performance and our strategic plan andcore values It includes  competencies that our employeesoverwhelmingly validated as the keys to meaningful performance atGAO See Fig Figure  GAOs CompetencyBased ModelOur October  legislation gave us additional tools torealign our workforce in light of mission needs and overallbudgetary constraints correct skills imbalances and reducehighgrade managerial or supervisory positions without reducingthe overall number of GAO employees This legislation allowed us tocreate a technical and scientific career track at a compensationlevel consistent to the SES It also allowed us to give greaterconsideration to performance and employee skills and knowledge inany ReductioninForce actions We believe that other agenciescould benefit from these additional authoritiesSince the legislation was enacted we have established agencyregulations and conducted and completed our first offering ofvoluntary early retirement opportunities Once employees registeredtheir interest in participating in the program we considered anumber of factors including employee knowledge skillsperformance and competencies the organizational unit or subunitin which an employee worked an employees occupational seriesgrade or band level as appropriate and the geographic locationof the employee As authorized by the  legislation employeeperformance was just one of many factors we considered whendeciding which employees would be allowed to receive theincentives However let me assure you we did not use performanceto target certain individualsWe are also using many recruiting flexibilities that areavailable to most agencies including an extensive campaign toincrease our competitiveness on college campuses and extendingoffers of employment during the fall semester to prospectiveemployees who will come on board the following spring and summerWe are also using our internship program in a strategic fashion andwe often offer permanent positions to GAO interns with at least weeks of highly successful work experience Moreover we arebuilding and maintaining a strong presence of both seniorexecutives and recent graduates on targeted college campuses Wehave also taken steps to streamline and expedite our hiringprocess In this regard the current length of time that it takesto hire a person in most other federal agencies is much too longand must be addressedEven after we hire good people we need to take steps to retainthem We have taken a number of steps to empower and invest in ouremployees For example we have active employee feedback andsuggestion programs In addition we are in the midst ofimplementing our first student loan repayment assistance programfor about  employees who have indicated interest and are willingto make a threeyear commitment to staying with the agencyOverall we have implemented the following initiatives andtargeted investments some of which are relatively recent and someof which are longstandingPrepared a human capital profile and needs assessment tounderstand employee demographics and distributionConducted an employee survey in  and  tounderstand the status and progress of the agency and the areas inwhich we need to improveCompleted a knowledge and skills inventory for allemployeesConducted an employee preference survey so that employeescould be given the opportunity to work in the areas that interestand energize them in light of our institutional needsImplemented an Executive Candidate Development Program toprepare candidates for assignments

workinprogress for us asit is for others Our approaches are not the only way for agenciesto proceed but they can help others identify ways to address theirindividual human capital challenges In this regard we have sharedour lessons and experiences with others and are happy to doso For more information on these efforts see Human CapitalTaking Steps to Meet Current and Emerging Human Capital ChallengesGAOT Washington DC July  Page  GAOTIn summary Mr Chairman I believe that there is no moreimportant management reform than for agencies to transform theircultures to respond to the transition that is taking place in therole of government in the st century Strategic human capitalmanagement must be at the center of this transformation effort Weall need to seize the momentum that has recently emergedagenciesmust use existing authorities to strategically manage their peopleCongress needs to consider some statutory changes in the shortterm and all interested parties need to work together
