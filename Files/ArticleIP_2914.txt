                                 Dadas Girl            Although we think ofphotomontage primarily as a medium of the combative period of modernismDadaSurrealism Constructivismits use goes back well into the  thcentury and was routine in turnofthecentury pop culture in postcards andprints Hannah Hch said she discovered its possibilities when she saw a kitschtableau of German military glory the idealized soldier had her landlords facepasted on Hch and her then lover Raoul Hausmann formed one branch of theBerlin Dada group which came to appear the more aesthetic one asdistinguished from the more political wing represented by John Heartfield andGeorge Grosz All of them began to make montages around  and for a fewyears made works that are at least superficially very similar explosions ofnewspaper photographs and lines of type across a white field They were angryand wanted to break somethingthe state the banks the industriesbut had torestrict themselves to the materials of the print media that served andreflected those institutions            Hch haslong been best known for one of her first works Cut with a Kitchen KnifeDada through the last Weimar BeerBelly Cultural Epoch of Germany  You can see all the anger and exhilaration of the period in this large piecenearly  feet by  full of wheels and crowds and heads whose eyes have beenreplaced by other things its yellowed newsprint color jazzed by a patch ofblue in the upper left its improvisatorial speed of execution shown by how theglued surfaces have rippled Its drift is apparent right away Dada versus theantiDada of all the generals and exploiters Looking more closely howeveryou notice a subtler feminist subtheme Greta Garbo Kthe Kollwitz and otheremancipated women are significantly portrayed and at the lower right is a mapof Europe in which the countries that have given women the right to vote appearin white It is on the edge of this map that Hch has stuck a tiny portrait ofherself            Most surveys of photomontage reproduce this work andperhaps one or two others by Hch from the early s but she continuedworking in the medium into the s she died in  continually expandingher style and enlarging the terrain of the medium As Hausmanns work grew moreformal and Heartfield became the most effective agitprop artist in Europe Hchbecame more playful At the same time that she was engaging in her blisteringDada stuff for example she was making delicate work based on embroiderypatterns that is both unashamedly feminine and the perfect riposte to themasculine machinefixation of the time which in fact it resembles in itsdynamism It is also more purely abstract than anything anyone else was doingWhat is striking about the ensemble of her works on display more than pieces is her freedom Others from Heartfield to Max Ernst built theirmontages and collages on a classic stagelike ground with centralized figuresa place for them to stand and a backdrop behind them Hch pointedly orcavalierly toyed with this concept and eventually dispensed with it altogetherWhile others parodied she invented She flung scale gravity continuity andillusionism around at will Even her most laborintensive works manage to lookspontaneous and somehow carefree            She cutsup faces and bodies and fits together parts mismatched in size color andstyle like a Dr Frankenstein bent on demonstrating through surgery the follyof beauty culture In her Ethnographic Museum series she arranges mergers ofAfrican and Asian sculpture and Western body parts asking Whos theprimitive now Her politics are always present but always lowercase even herangriest works apparently suffused with insouciant fun So you might get theidea that her views on the Nazis were mutedshe did remain in an obscuresemirural corner of Berlin through the war after all But while her workwouldnt be anybodys idea of propaganda it is nevertheless acute Her NaziThe Little P  has slick hair and a prowlike nose over the openmouth of an infantthe bawling spittlewebbed orifice is convincingly that ofa partyrally orator Her German Girl  meanwhile has bangsinstead of brains and a cute little topknot like a pinheads            In the darkest years of the war though Hchwas plunging into a world of pure form and color As the decades pass itbecomes harder and harder to figure out what a given shape or texture in hermontages might originally have represented During the s she shed the lastbits of hardedged Weimar sensibility and enacted a version of Surrealismentirely her own dense with Ernstlike bugs and birds and creepy Mattaishplant forms But the following decade even this gave way to works of purenonrepresentational electricity so bursting and swooping they make you want touse words like painterly and gesturaloxymoronically they seem to be akind of Abstract Expressionism built from little carefully scissored bits ofmagazine photographs They can sometimes appear unfocused in their intensitylike too many sounds turning into white noise But then she could still turnout beautifully restrained work such as the significantly titled  GlueDrawing  a single s New Vision photograph of oil pools taken apartand reassembled with dramatic spaces The source is completely present and madegreater the violence done to it is in the service of its original intent anode to the ellipse            Some critics have said thatthis is a big show for a minor artist It is true that if you were editingthe show to make a point you could omit as much as twothirds of it It is alsotrue that montage is often considered a minor form lacking the heroism ofpainting and sculpture and even photography After all what is it butrecycling But the shows size is one of its greatest assetsit is seldom thatan exhibition so thoroughly documents the artists changes and leaps over thedecades like a timelapse film It is also striking how contemporary to usmuch of Hchs work feels in its sexual politics its humor its gleefulappropriation of anything and everything at handindeed in its refusal ofgrandeur Photomontage thumbs its nose at the pretension of the artist playingGod the blank canvas his world It is the art of making do of fashioningsomething personal from the incessant bombardment of images to which we aresubjected Hch in her modest way told the spectacle where to get off and setabout reconfiguring it with her scissors
