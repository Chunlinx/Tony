                                 Murdoch at the Bat            Were a month into the baseball season and Rupert Murdoch has yet to rename his newest acquisitionthe Melrose Place Dodgers Had he done so it would probably not have surprisedthe commentators who saw the  million purchase of the franchise byMurdochs News Corp as final evidence of the sacrifice of the national pastimeto the greed and disloyalty of players and owners One writer went so far as tosuggest that before the Dodgers were sold there was hope baseball could pullitself back from the brink But now even those hopes are being dashed            In theparticular case of the Dodgers of course these lamentations were particularlyinapposite since the team is only in Los Angeles because Walter OMalley madea coldblooded business decision in  to abandon Brooklyn in favor of thesunnier clime of Chavez Ravine But the larger indictment of the changingnature of team ownership is similarly misdirected If anything baseball needsmore corporate owners particularly those such as News Corp that have majorinvestments in the game as a whole rather than a stake in a singlefranchise            In the long run the more corporate owners the less likelythat baseballs current approach of limiting expansion and migration willendure Defending either the expansion of the number of baseball teams beyondthe current  or the movement of franchises to new cities is of courseenough to get you branded as an uncouth moneygrubber Defending both is enoughto get you shot Expansion its argued debases an already thin talent poollowering the overall quality of play The migration of franchises meanwhilebreaks the hearts of old fans and rips the hearts out of citiesgenerallynorthern industrial citiesthat cant afford to compete against the newmetropolises of the Sunbelt            Its nocoincidence of course that the main defenders of the status quo are always incities that already have baseball teams The unstated premise is that peoplein say Minneapolis deserve the chance to attend a major league game more thanpeople in Charlotte do Of course the Twins are only in Minneapolis becausethe Washington Senators moved there decades ago But you have to draw the linesomewhere            A less parochial view shows that change wouldbe good both for the sport and for cherished local teams Expansion wouldobviously expandduhthe sports fan base And it like migration wouldhelp eradicate baseballs most persistent problemthe division between smalland largemarket teams In essence baseball teams are able to reap what arecalled monopoly rents because they face little or no competition for the localfans dollar Other things being equal and new stadiums with highprofitluxury boxes can make a sizable difference teams in big markets are able toreap much larger rents because the pool of fans from which they draw attendanceand TV viewership is much larger Even with two teams in New York the Yankeesare far more profitable than the Pittsburgh Pirates because there are so manymore buyers for their productan advantage the Pirates unlike a regularcorporation cant overcome by marketing their goods in New York            Thereason this is a problem obviously is that the Yankees are much richer thanthe Pirates and can therefore afford to pay more for players which meanstheyll be able to lure the best players to New York But the revenues ofbaseball as a whole will be hurt if just a few teams dominate play so thegreater wealth of the Yankees leads to the longterm decline of the game            This dilemma has occasioned anguished breastbeating eversince the introduction of free agency into the player market  years ago Buteven when players could not freely sell their services on the open market therichest teams still got the best players They just did so by buying them fromthe poorer teams The Kansas City Athletics for example were essentially afarm team for the Yankees during the s and early s and notcoincidentally the Yankees won pennant after pennant What free agency has doneis transfer those payments that would have gone to smallmarket teams to theplayers themselves            But theanswer to this dilemma is not a return to the old system nor is it a salarycap The real answer would require allowing teams to move where theresunsatisfied demand for the game whether that be in New York itself or in someregion that has no team This might mean in the short term that cities suchas Pittsburgh or Montreal would lose franchises But if there were three orfour teams in New York the monopoly rents exacted by the Yankees woulddecline which means they wouldnt be able to pay so much for players whichmeans it would be easier to run a team successfully in a small market Theproblem in that sense is not that there are big and small markets but thatthere are too few teams in the big markets Supply is not being allowed tomatch demand            Of course existing owners dont want new teamsin their markets Similarly they dont want new teams in general because an important chunk of their current revenue comes from nationaltelevision and licensing contracts that are divided among the teams Moreteams fewer dollars per team though thats actually more complicated than itmay look since expansion might open up TV marketslike the Southwhereratings have been traditionally low Until baseballs antitrust exemption isremoved owners dont have to worry about intruders in their current marketsBut a mechanism already exists for making expansion mutually beneficialrevenue sharing of all local TV contracts and gate receipts Revenue sharingalone would solve many of the competitivebalance problems between small andlarge markets Green Bay has built a Super Bowl team despite playing in thesmallest market in the NFL in no small part because NFL teams share  percentof their total revenue            The point is that for alltheir rhetoric about looking out for the best interests of the game baseballowners have been interested only in looking out for themselves In an ordinarybusiness thats fine But in a business like baseball where the longtermhealth of any one franchise depends on the longterm popularity of the gamethe pursuit of shortterm selfinterestin the form of the protection of thebenefits of local monopoliesbrings about collective harm The exemption ofbaseball from antitrust law is predicated on the idea that Major LeagueBaseball is one company rather than an industry such as semiconductors orcomputers But owners dont act like competing vice presidents They act likecompeting CEOs each seeking to maximize their local profits            In that sense News Corp orDisneywhich owns the Angelscould hardly be more venal or shortterm infocus than the current crop of owners In fact it may well be that News Corpwhich is building a national competitor to ESPN by stringing together a seriesof local sports networks is more likely to work for the best interests of thegame as a whole Thats precisely because it has a stake through its TVchannels in baseball rather than just in the Dodgers One of the realities ofcorporations after all is that theyre somewhat isolated from local concernsTraditionally thats been seen as a vice But in the case of baseball theaddition of a globalor at least nationalperspective should be seen as avirtue
