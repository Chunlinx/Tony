                                 Kenneth Starr a quotWitty and Benign Companionquot            In aninterview Tuesday with Britains Daily Telegraph  Kenneth Starr accused President Clinton ofcontinuing to lie to the American people but reserved his harshest words forMonica Lewinsky The independent counsels only stated regret was that hedidnt do enough to stop Congress publishing the most salacious material in hisreport He deplored Congress decision to authorize publication of theunexpurgated evidence instead of screening and winnowing it first I wish Ihad done more to say to Congress be careful he said Some of the mostsensitive evidence he gathered has never been made public he said and hadthe President seen fit to tell the truth we would have been spared theintrusive nature of the details But he said that much of the informationpublished was vital to the credibility of Lewinskys testimony            Starrcomplained that even now a year later Clinton has admitted no offencesother than to have the inappropriate relationship which is not a matter ofinterest to federal law To the contrary he has very vigorously stated that heat no time committed any federal offences Starr said that in one of the mostunfortunate episodes of the entire drama Clinton made the decision when hisrelationship with Lewinsky came to light in January  that he was not goingto tell the truth He was advised by Dick Morris that the American peoplewould readily forgive an adulterous relationship but they would not beforgiving of offences against the justice system And the President informedhim Well we will just have to win then Thus instead of telling thetruth admitting the facts and seeking forgiveness of family and nation helaunched a campaign designed to erode confidence in the duly appointed systemof justice            Askedif he regretted the personal distress suffered by Lewinsky Starr repliedSheas an obviously highly intelligent young adult a professional a collegegraduatemade a most unfortunate judgment and that was that she would commitfederal crimes in order to obstruct the judicial process in the form of asexual harassment action the Paula Jones case Not only that she importunedanother person Linda Tripp to likewise engage in federal crimes That wasserious business She did it not on the spur of the moment she did it over aconsiderable period of time She knowingly went to one of the most powerfullawyers in the country who in turn guided her to another lawyer to preparewhat she knew to be a perjurious affidavit One should not blink at those kindsof offences Because of her decision not to be readily forthcoming Lewinskyhad put the nation through seven months of a wretched and miserable hournews cycle he said Miss Lewinsky did not cooperate until July  Thiscould have been over in January The enduring lesson of the whole affairStarr said was that we in the United States take the law seriously and thatwe are all accountable            TheTelegraph  a conservative paper that was vigorously antiClintonthroughout the scandal sponsored a lecture by Starr Tuesday His interviewerwas much taken with him The grimly bespectacled prosecutor is only the publicface he wrote In private he is a witty and benign companion He enjoys aMartini and is relaxed on the subject of sex by no means the prudishteetotaller portrayed by the White House One of the best legal minds of hisgeneration he speaks in perfectly grammatical sentences with the sameexhaustive precision as his celebrated report            In aneditorial Wednesday headlined Gores Burden the Times of London saidVice President Al Gores virtues are largely being ignored in the electioncampaign because of his intense and inevitable association with PresidentClintonto whom some  per cent of the electorate believe that Mr Gore istoo close for their comfort If he is to beat Bill Bradley for theDemocratic nomination he must emerge as something more than the Presidentsfavoured successor the paper said Mr Clinton secured the White House as thecandidate of change In this respect at least Mr Gore has lessons to learnfrom his President            Butthe main focus of the British press Wednesday was Prime Minister Tony Blairwhose speech at the annual Labor Party Conference promising to end the classwar create equality of opportunity and purge Britain forever of the forcesof conservatism generated many editorials His vision of a nation more likeAmerica than Britain is laudable the Times said but he will have topursue it with a passion and defend it with care The Daily Telegraph however called it a strangely nervewracked speech at oncebelligerent and insecure that seemed to reveal an inner uncertainty about whathis Government is trying to achieve and why The liberal Guardian said thespeech was as accomplished as any speech Mr Blair has given but theIndependentsaid real radicalism needs substance not just a collection of good tunesThe Financial Timespraised his radical rhetoric but also said he failed to explain how all thistranslates into hardedged policies            Another FT editorial said the ice is breaking in corporate Japan withcompanies changing in ways that would have seemed impossible only a few yearsago It concluded As Japans politicians continue to posture in much thesame old familiar ways the economy is at last beginning to be restructuredfrom the bottom up But in Tokyo AsahiShimbun dwelt on the human cost of this reporting a rapid rise in thenumber of Japanese businessmen diagnosed as
