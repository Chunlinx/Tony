                okay how do you get your news mostly   generally i get most of my news from uh the radio and then sometimes um if ive got time ill be reading the front page of the newspaper and just fall off on the articles that i like   umhum umhum umhum umhum   um also since my wife likes to watch TV sometimes uh  just having being just being there i get uh you know i have to watch the news late at night with TV   umhum umhum  well i can hardly wait for my morning paper to come   how about you umhum   so thats the first thing i want is the headlines its really funny because um uh my sister grabs the sports and i grab the headlines   uhhuh     but uh and then when five oclock comes around i just wanna get in the house and turn the TV on to watch the news   hm   its really weird uh i dont stay up late to watch late news because my eyes wont stay up that long but um  i love to watch the five oclock news and i makes me angry when my paper boys not there on time so i can read my paper   hm   uh i do have my radio going most of the day though so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too you know but   okay do you get what like one of the talk stations the news stations   no huhuh just i just have a channel that has music except for like every hour you know say eight oclock nine oclock they come on for just a little bit of the news   sure right   but as far as the actual news i get that from from the can you hold on just for a second just a minute   sure   hello sir  yes im sorry to keep you waiting  um i was calling from work so and that was a call waiting   yes okay right sounds it sounds like you uh you like the news a lot more than i do me i figure if its something really important somebody will tell me about it but uh you know i thing is if if i catch the news all the time it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news or thats what comes on first   yeah i get um thats true too   and uh you know it also late at night you know i dont want like watching the news late at night but my wifes usually up then and so you know i cant go to sleep with the TV on   umhum umhum umhum   i uh but you know i i wish i had uh more news on things like that i consider long range things like science and medicine um   umhum   im more i guess im more into science and science fiction and uh theres you know not that the news is science fiction but uh uh im more interested in that things like uh is NASA ready for another space shot uh you know how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer and uh um   umhum   you know a lot of the news isnt that interesting to me   yeah well youre right there is a lot of it thats thats just garbage as far as im concerned you know   umhum   but i just like the more or less the the daily news you know   yeah   just uh especially the weather i like that  although theyre usually wrong   me too yeah Georgia here theyre usually wrong too we have weird weather systems   uhhuh but uh  like i say as far as thats actually listening to the news its mostly TV five oclock to six thirty oh that seems like a long time for news but thats how long it is   yeah   and uh seems like they have the local news and they have the world news   umhum   and then uh my morning paper i can hardly wait for it to come   yeah im you know i i just uh i would i i im not a morning person so i would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news   and um     i get up just barely in time to get up get ready and get off to work and then at work i have no time to read the news   oh yeah right once you get to work i wouldnt either huhuh   yeah   but ive always been a morning person to get up you know   umhum   and but i cant stay up late at night to watch the late news so  i guess thats why i watch it at five oclock  but anyhow  well listen i guess thats about it then   yeah okay   its been nice talking to you Tony   nice talking to you ill probably talk to you again i had a friend who was in this and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes yeah   oh really oh well that hasnt happened to me yet so you never know it might this time  okay Tony umhum byebye   thats right take it easy byebye
