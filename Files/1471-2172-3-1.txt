                    Background        Tlymphocytes expressing the  Tcell antigen receptor        TCR consist of two major subsets T cells expressing the        CD surface glycoprotein which are restricted by the major        hystocompatibility complex MHC class II proteins and CD        T cells which interact with antigen presented by MHC        class I proteins     CD and CD molecules bind to        monomorphic regions on class II and class I MHC proteins        respectively thereby increasing the avidity in the        interaction of the TCR with antigen presenting cells            An intriguing question concerns to the mechanism by which        selection and tolerance to selfcomponents is mediated in        developing lymphocytes This is particularly relevant to T        Lymphocytes because of their ability to recognize antigen        only if this is associated with the class I or the class II        MHC molecules     and also because of the unique        selection process which operates within the thymus during T        cell development Early during Tcell development in the        thymic cortex thymocytes bear both of the T cell surface        glycoproteins CD and CD and express the  and         heterodimer of the TCR     Compelling data have        demonstrated that CD and CD molecules participate in the        selection of MHC class I or class II restricted T cells in        the thymus It is known that during clonal selection in the        thymus immature CD CD double positive cells develop        into single positive CD or CD cells according to the        relative affinity of their TCR to class II or class I        molecules respectively      These immature Tcells are        selected in the thymic epithelium on the basis of their TCR        interaction with either class I or class II MHC molecules             thus generating two mutually exclusive        subpopulations that are characterized by the expression of        either CD or CD glycoproteins     Earlier studies in        the murine system have demonstrated that PMA and cAMP can        modulate the expression CD and CD on developing        thymocytes        In keeping with these        findings ex vivo experiments with human thymocytes        previously reported by our group revealed that while        phorbol esters can coordinately regulate the transcription        of  and  TCR during intrathymic T cell differentiation            cAMP selectively affected the transcription of the         and TCR      Together the murine data and our own        findings support the hypothesis that in humans TCR        expression and CD CD commitment and selection may be        regulated by the same signaltransduction pathways Since        a it is generally accepted that CD or CD are physically        associated to the TCR in the course of T cell activation            and b it is well known that mitogen activated        protein MAP kinase signaling is involved in the selection        of the T cell repertoire      the present study        further proposes that the PKC and PKAmediated signaling        which regulates TCR expression can coordinately modulate        the selection of CD CD and CD CD T cells during        human intrathymic differentiation                    Results        The effect of the phorbol ester        tetradecanoylphorbol acetate PMA and exogenous cAMP        on the levels of mRNA encoding the CD and CD        glycoproteins was examined in human thymocytes Total        postFicoll unfractionated thymocytes were incubated in        the presence or the absence of  nM PMA andor  mM cAMP          mM of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor        isobutylemthylxnthine IBMX The fundamental reasons for        the design of our         exvivo experiments are threefold        a The need to evaluate intrathymic differentiation as        close as it could be physically possible to an         in vivo model b We sought to        perform the experiments on untouched cells with the least        of manipulations In purifying thymocyte subsets there is        a risk that the antibodies used for the selection of the DP        subset can stimulate cells through a TCRlike signaling        thus masking the readout of the experimental stimuli and        c At least  of thymocytes are double positive DP        cells Therefore the contribution of single positive SP        cannot be a concern After  h incubation RNA was        extracted and analyzed for CD and CD expression by        northern blot hybridizations As shown in Fig  PMA        caused a marked decrease in the levels of both CD and CD        mRNAs whose constitutive expression is high in developing        thymocytes In contrast cAMP selectively decreased CD        mRNA levels On the other hand apoptosis was ruled out as        a mechanism to explain the differential downregulation of        CD and CD by PMA and cAMP on the grounds of two        independent observations a After a maximum of  hr        incubation with either PMA or cAMP IBMX the cell viability        was the same as the untreated controls usually between         b Treatment with dexamethasone which is a known        proapoptotic molecule did not have any effects on the        expression of either CD or CD data not shown and c        As demonstrated earlier in the murine system TCR        engagement of CD CD induces positive selection but not        apoptosis           To further investigate whether the effect of PMA on CD        and CD expression is consistent with the activation of        protein kinase C PKC we examined structurally distinct        phorbol esters that either have or lack the capacity to        activate PKC for their effectiveness to modulate the        levels of CD and CD mRNAs As shown in Fig  the        configuration of the phorbol ester that lacks the ability        to activate PKC    had no effect on the expression of        CD and CD In contrast the configuration that has the        capacity to activate PKC    decreased the levels of CD        and CD mRNAs The watersoluble phorbol  dibutyrate        PDB had similar effects to those of PMA The specificity        of the signals driven by PMA was further stressed by the        upregulation of CD expression and by the unaltered mRNA        levels of the protooncogene cHaras        On the other hand it has been previously demonstrated        that direct activation of adenylate cyclase by Forskolin or        cholera toxin inhibition of cAMPspecific        phosphodiesterase and treatment with a cell permeable cAMP        analog induces a rise in intracellular cAMP                Since cAMP is known to modulate the expression of        CD in mice     we sought to determine whether        cAMPdependent protein kinase PKAmediated signaling        plays a role in modulating the mRNA levels of CD CD and        CD in ex vivo examined human thymocytes Fig shows that        the signal which regulates the expression of human CD is        cAMPmediated since direct activation of adenylate cyclase        by cholera toxin produced the same effects as the        dibutiryl cAMP analog The requirement of        phosphodiesterase inhibition by IBMX further supports this        statement As it can also be observed cAMP coordinately        regulated the expression of both the  and  chains of the        CD molecule CD remained unchanged and CD was minimally        affected thus stressing the selectivity of the        cAMPdependent downregulation of CD expression Fig         To further investigate whether PMA and cAMP regulate CD        and CD expression at the protein level surface detection        of the CD CD and CD was also assessed As observed in        Fig aPMA dropped the proportion of CD cells from  to        zero produced a slight decrease from  to  in CD        cells and did not affect the expression of CD cAMP on        the other hand had little effect on the surface expression        of the glycoproteins These findings are in contrast with        the drastic downregulation of CD transcript levels        exerted by cAMP However regulation gene expression is        complex and engages numerous checkpoints that include        transcription RNA processing nuclearcytosol transport        translation and RNA and Protein stability Since the        halflives of mRNA and protein can be dramatically        different we hypothesize that an increased CD protein        stability may result in a delay of CD surface        disappearance thus favoring its transient selection As        CD gene transcription has been turnedoff by cAMPmediated        signaling surface CD subsequently fades with the        concomitant emergence of CD cells In keeping with this        rationale the kinetics of the PMAmediated downregulation        of CD Fig b reveals a sharp and rapid decrease on CD        surface expression as early as  min of incubation with        PMA with a complete disappearance by  hr The        relatively short kinetics of surface CD downregulation        and the delayed CD surface disappearance can be        interpreted as a PKCmediated selection signaling in favor        of CD CD TCR cells that may operate during        intrathymic T cell differentiation Binding of specific        ligands to CD including phorbol esters results in        internalization of the molecule by endocytosis which in        turn is phosphorylated    and possibly immobilized It        is conceivable that a similar mechanism might be used by        extracellular signals in the thymic epithelium during        intrathymic differentiation                    Discussion        An accepted scheme of the T cell development program            has demonstrated that as immature cells enter the        thymus cycling CD CD precursors begin to rearrange         and  genes which generates CD CD  and   cells        CD CD on the other hand rearrange and express the        TCR heterodimer A few of these cells are selected        through the specificity of their antigen receptor and        mature into either CD CD  or CD CD T cells which        exit from the thymus        Much progress has been accomplished in determining the        molecular steps that lead to a better understanding of        murine T cell progenitor commitment and selection of the        functional repertoire which has gained important insights        into mechanisms of CDCD lineage commitment reviewed in         For instance changes in expression of CD TCR        Bcl RAG and TdT genes can be induced by in vitro TCR        engagement of DP thymocytes thus indicating that at least        some aspects in the T cell maturation program are directly        coupled to TCR signaling It is therefore accepted that        positive selection are directly coupled to TCR signaling        pathways in DP thymocytes However the signals that        promote selective down regulation of CD and CD remain        have not been that conclusive at least in humans Earlier        again murine studies reviewed in  have suggested that        a transitional phenotype of CD CD lowis not a signature        of commitment towards the CD lineage The confirmation of        such conclusion in the humans and the determination of the        signals that lead to the phenotype remain to be        assessed        We have previously shown that PMA strongly induces the        transcription of  and  TCR in human thymocytes whereas        cAMP exclusively affected the transcription of TCR             The data reported herein suggest that following        rearrangement protein kinase C activation mimicked by the        phorbol esters induces the expression of the  and TCR on        CD CD precursor T cells Since only a proportion of        developing thymocytes succeed in expressing the  TCR        heterodimer PKC activation also provides the signal to        turning off the CD and CD genes on cells that failed to        express the TCR which are nonfunctional and potentially        harmful On the other hand cAMP is known to participate in        the growth and differentiation of varied cell types        including thymocytes through the transcriptional        regulation of specific genes       The unique cAMP        signaling which specifically targets the expression of the        CD mRNAs  and  suggests that PKA activation may        result in the transduction of signals that determine the        selection of T lymphocytes in favor of the CD CD        lineage by downregulating and possibly turning off the        expression of the CD transcripts In keeping with this        notion regulatory elements within the CD and CD        promoters have been identified an characterized including        the presence of cAMP regulatory elements binding CREB        sites     However it is also likely that the control        of CD and CD expression and thus the selection of CD or        CD lineagecommitted cells may also be controlled by the        differences in mRNA and protein stability Lastly some of        the TCR signaling pathways involved in positive selection        have been identified in the mouse and there is some        evidence that these may be different from those involved in        negative selection It remains to be determined whether        same interpretation applies to human T cell selection                    Conclusion        In conclusion the results of the ex vivo experiments of        human thymocytes reported in the present study are in        complete agreement with the earlier studies in the murine        system and strongly support the conclusions We further        propose that the transduction of intracellular signals        initiated by the activation of PKC and PKA by phorbol        esters and cAMP respectively are not only critical for the        differential regulation of CD and CD gene expression but        more importantly in the commitment and selection of the        functional T cell repertoire                    Materials and Methods
