                                              Ibiza and Formentera         Ibiza offers a healthy slice of the Mediterranean        lifestyle infused with some of the spirit and architecture of North        Africa Although it is strictly a part of the Spanish archipelago known        as the Islas Pitiusas or pinecovered isles Ibiza in fact displays        many of the characteristics of the Islas Baleares or Balearic Islands        of neighbouring Mallorca and Menorca with which it is commonly        grouped In terms of government it is part of the Spanish province of        Baleares Here youll find all the resorts bars and discos you could        wish for but there are also traditional villages deserted beaches        secret coves and quiet walks for when all you want to do is escape the        fray        Formentera Ibizas diminutive neighbour just one hours        ferryboat ride or  minutes by hydrofoil to the south is an island        apartin some ways more like a desert island than a satellite or        outpost of Ibiza During the supremacy of the Barbary Coast pirates in        the th and th centuries Formentera was so vulnerable it had to be        abandoned and it wasnt resettled until the th century Now it        offers the perfect antidote to the stress of modernday living and is        the ideal place to recharge yourself before another evening of        exuberant nightlife back on mainland Ibiza Alternatively if you        prefer to find an even quieter stretch of beach the waters around        Ibiza are dotted with a host of minor islets most uninhabited but

by side with movie stars artists the        young and trendy ageing hippies and of course locals the total        residential population being over  Despite the onset of tourism        in many parts the islanders still adhere to old traditions living off        the fruits literally  of land and sea Ibiza small as it is is not        one of those barren Mediterranean rocks with an allure that begins and        ends at the beach and although its a part of Spain it is not the        usual bullfightandflamenco scene The people are a distinct race        they have a unique ancient heritage and a passionate folklore all        their own They also have their own language Ibicenco a dialect        related to the mallorqu Majorcan branch of the Catalan language        though Castilian is spoken

or twice Marthas        Vineyard in Massachusetts It may not be much of a speck on the globe        but it is big enough to contain a modest mountain verdant farms        andthat real Mediterranean

colour for the farmer theyre        cash crops So is the salt drying in the huge square pans at Las        Salinas in the south        The capital of Ibiza called simply Ibiza or Ibiza Town        has a population of almost  This is the islands main city and        financial governmental and administrative centre and its charms        match those of other Mediterranean jewels  It is also a major        entertainment spot with its own appeal from the whitewashed houses of        the ancient walled city clambering up the hillside to the hustle and        bustle of the harbour area with its bistros and boutiques Its        popularity is such that it has gained a reputation for being something        of a trendsetters havenpostmodern or New Age this is the place        to be        The busiest

essence of many delights If you head inland to the less populous        centre of the island youll find hamlets consisting of little more        than a whitewashed church a general store and a bar
