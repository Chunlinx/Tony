                                  The Litigation Lover            President Clinton has spent million on legal fees has been forced to answer repellent invasivequestions under oath has had every private embarrassment announced to theworld in the guise of court documents and has watched helplessly as hisclosest friends and aides have been barbecued and bankrupted by hostilelawyers Anyone who had been stretched on this legal rack for so long would doanything to prevent the next guy from being similarly tortured            So its not surprisingthat the Clinton administration just announced its opposition to the renewal ofthe independent counsel statute The administration believes that the presidentand his top advisers should not be subjected to the kind of endlessborderless remorseless investigation that Kenneth Starr has inflicted onClinton And indeed they should not be            Yet Clinton and his aides have said not one word about theendless borderless remorseless lawsuits that afflict everyone else Clinton has learned a selfish lesson from Flytrap I the presidentshould not have to suffer through a barrage of litigation and investigationBut he has missed the real lesson No one should have to endure what heendured The presidents defenders portray Flytrap as a parable of how the lawmisapplied can undermine the president In fact it is a parable of how thelaw properly applied can undermine anyone            The case with itsinvasive irrelevant discovery with its incredible legal fees with the way itdrew in innocent bystanders and ruined their lives is exactly typicalof the American legal system says Walter Olson a Manhattan Institute scholarand author of The Excuse Factory             Even so the president is not advocating any legal reformlarger than protecting himself He continues to act as though lawsuits aregovernment by other means From the beginning of his first term Clinton hasfavored policies that made litigation more invasive and expanded the right tosue And he still seems to believe that litigation is a substitute forregulation and legislation            There is as has beenwidely noted one pungent irony about Clintons policies In  he supportedthe Violence Against Women Act at the behest of womens groups The act permitsmuch more expansive discovery into the sexual history of defendants in sexualharassment and sex crimes cases Judges and legal scholars warned that the newrules would be intrusive and prejudicial but Clinton signed the bill into lawanyway Four years later he found himself a victim of the sort of voyeuristicnasty snooping that the law authorizes            In most other matters too Clinton has protected orexpanded the right to sue and the power of the plaintiff to make life miserablefor defendants He has presided over the enlargement of the Americans withDisabilities Act Last summer his Department of Justice successfullypetitioned the Supreme Court to designate asymptomatic HIVinfected people as aprotected class under the ADA In  he and congressional Democrats defeateda House Republican bill to penalize plaintiffs for frivolous lawsuits and toimpose loser pays rules Also that year the president delighted plaintiffslawyers by vetoing a bill to limit punitive damages in product liabilitycases            Since the scandal theadministration has been no less enthusiastic about lawsuits The administrationcontinues to push a patients bill of rights that would guarantee the rightto sue your HMO Clinton is also trying to use lawsuits to make public policyIn his State of the Union address he announced that the Department ofJustice would sue cigarette companies to recover Medicare costs of smokers abackdoor way to have the courts increase federal tobacco revenues without goingthrough Congress And the administration is lending tacit support to citiessuing gun manufacturers a backdoor way to have the courts make gun policywithout going through Congress            The result of this reliance on lawsuits by Clinton hispresidential predecessors and Congress is what Brookings Institution scholarJonathan Rauch calls microgovernment Politicians are abdicating their dutyto write welldefined laws leaving it to judges to make the rulescasebycase Judges end up deciding how bosses treat their employees howcorporations treat their customers etc Microgovernment makes easy populistpolitics The president and Congress can take credit for giving peoplerights then leave the actual work of making sense of those rights to thecourts The patients bill of rights for example would deliver a polltestedvictory to Clinton and Congress Then judges would absorb the responsibility ofhandling the lawsuits spawned by the new rights            Clintons support forbetter living through litigation is also based on interest group politicsTrial lawyers courted him and his party with tons of money Womens groupscivil rights groups and Naderitesall avid believers inlitigationconstitute a huge chunk of Clintons base The president may alsobe a true believer in government by lawsuit He came of age when the civilrights movement and the Naderites were using the courts to challenge unjuststate governments and arrogant corporations His intentions are honorableCorporations shouldnt discriminate in hiring HMOs shouldntdeny care to patients who need it But he never asks whether lawsuits andrights are the only way to prevent these bad things            Microgovernment does not seem to cost anythingno newbudget lines no new bureaucraciesbut of course it does Financially itshuffles expenses from government to someone else usually the person beingsued Politically its antidemocratic replacing congressional and executivebranch decisionmaking It is a kind of threecard monte says Olson Youshift the responsibility to the branch of government that citizens cant doanything about And it makes an already litigious society more so afflictingmore and more people with onerous discovery bottomless legal expenses andgrotesque but legal invasions of privacy The United States Olson notes hasfar laxer discovery rules than any other developed nation            The GOP is reluctant to challenge the laws tyrannyDuring Flytrap many Republicans conveniently abandoned their objections towideranging sex harassment litigation endorsing broad discovery in order tonail Clinton But even those who insist that the legal system is out of controlare afraid to challenge it Every time they have done so Clinton and theDemocrats have trounced them depicting them with some justice as shills forbig corporations that dont want to be accountable to employees andcustomers            Can anything change Clintons mind After all hehas suffered through legal hell once and has emerged unaffected Maybe justmaybe if he were sued again
