                    Background        Bridging or jumping PCR BPCR can convert DNA        backbone interruptions anywhere in the region of shared        sequence between primer binding sites into a single and        unique amplified band     The logic of BPCR is        illustrated in Figure  In principle BPCR can detect        backbone interruptions anywhere within a chosen sequence        region This manuscript reports a study in which BPCR is        used to detect a minority of interrupted molecules in the         lac operon of         Escherichia coli and describes a        system to measure noise in BPCR                    Results                  Signal and noise in bridging PCR          Bridging PCR BPCR is a combination of two processes          a recombination between two template sequences and an          amplification of the recombinant template Two parental          sequences share a homologous region a region in which          the sequence is identical and diverge in the          nonhomologous flanking sequences One side of the          nonhomologous flanking sequence of each of the two          parental molecules contains a different PCR          primerbinding site Neither parental template has both          primerbinding sites Therefore a chain reaction cannot          occur and only linear amplification is expected          However during the course of cycling recombination          can occur between the homologous regions via a copy          choice mechanism illustrated in Figure  A  end of          one template sequence if it is within the homologous          region can anneal to the other template During the next          extension cycle the invading strand will grow from its           end and newly synthesized DNA will cross the region of          sequence similarity and continue into sequences unique to          the second template including the second templates          primer binding site The result is a recombinant          sequence identical to the product of           in vivo homologous recombination          with one flank from the original strand and the other          flank from the second template Because the two primer          sites are now           in cis  the recombinant sequence          can be amplified exponentially          If the  end of either template is not within the          region of similar sequence then no  end will hybridize          to the other template and synthesis does not lead to          recombination The creation of recombinant sequences          during PCR reflects the presence of templates whose           ends are within the region of sequence similarity BPCR          ought to be utilizable to assay the proportion of input          templates with  ends in the region of sequence          similarity However the reaction itself can produce           ends which then lead to recombinant templates For          maximum sensitivity and SN ratio the PCR reaction          itself should not produce ends at any sites that did not          exist in the input DNA PCR itself generates new ends               In BPCR new ends yield recombinant products even          if the initial template was completely intact                          BPCR between plasmid pBS and Phagescript          Figure shows the map and sequence of templates and          primer sites used in BPCR between a portion of plasmid          pBS and Phagescript a derivative of the ssDNA M phage          This pair of substrates meets the requirement for BPCR          substrates because the region of shared sequence the           lac operator and the           lac operon are flanked by          sequences that are different between the two vectors The                    lac operon is one of the most          frequently used genes for the study of           in vivo mutagenesis                                          Determination of signal to noise SN          Two samples with known quantities of templates were          prepared one sample contained the pBS  sequence          template with a cut in the homologous region created by           Pvu II digestion cut template and          the intact ssDNA Phagescript DNA reference template In          the other sample both the pBS  intact template and          the Phagescript DNA reference template were intact The          molar ratio of reference template ssDNA to either          intact template dsDNA or to cut template dsDNA          considering only one of the two fragments was about                    The concentration of pBS  sequence template either          cut or intact was adjusted to be about  nM and to be          equal in the two samples The equality was confirmed by a           thermal cycle conventional PCR with primers b and M          revI The PCR outputs from serial dilutions  fold          dilution between each step were similar between the two          samples data not shown          Each of the two samples was serially diluted into BPCR          reactions the dilution involving only the cut and intact          template with everything else unchanged The highest          concentration of template was about  moleculesl          Typically dilution steps were  fold each and covered a          million fold range The PCRs were run in parallel same          concentrations same volume and running on the same          thermal block at the same time After the BPCR output          of recombinant DNA was assayed by electrophoresis For          each dilution one can obtain the concentration of output          R as a function of Ts the concentration of template          cut or intact depending on the sample For each sample          one defines Ts           off as a cutoff concentration below          which R is no longer saturated The signal to noise is          the ratio between Ts           off in the two samples                    For example if the cutoff concentration of the cut          sample is  times less than the intact cutoff          concentration then the SN is                           Preannealing and preextension          A preannealing and preextension regime improved the          SN In this regime templates in the reaction tube with            PCR buffer and dNTPs were heated to C for           minutes then gradually cooled by approximately          Cminute to C          Preextension was carried out by holding the          temperature at C and adding polymerase to the          preannealing tube The temperature was held at C for          three more minutes before it was dropped to room          temperature The rationale for preextension    was          that cut template molecules that are annealed to          reference molecules should be extended by the polymerase          to become full length There are no primers present in          the preextension cycle and therefore this cycle does not          generate the class of noise due to incomplete extension          from normal primers          Immediately following preextension ie without          storage at C the samples were serially diluted and PCR          amplified with the BPCR primers                          BPCR with Taq polymerase yielded SN of          approximately           Templates were prepared by  cycles of conventional          PCR with Taq polymerase    using primer b and Jp on          template plasmid pBS Phagescript phage particles          rather than purified DNA prepared from the particles by          phenol extraction were used as the reference template              The BPCR primer pair was b and M pI see figure          for primer locations which would give a  bp          recombination product The SN of BPCR with Taq          polymerase was approximately  see figure  lanes           This result is consistent with the report that Taq          polymerases nuclease activity     cuts in the           lac operator     The           lac operator cut site is within the          homologous region in this system BPCR was conducted for           cycles with Taq polymerase          Several variations of BPCR with Taq polymerase were          carried out data not shown including  cut and          intact templates were prepared with primers b and b           purified ssDNA instead of phage particles was used as a          reference template and  cut and intact templates were          prepared with the Stoffel fragment of Taq polymerase The          SN was about  in these variations Increase in the          number of PCR cycles andor a longer extension time           minutes were also tested and found to be not acceptable          because nonspecific output in the form of multiple gel          bands or smearing gel lanes frequently appeared          Combining Taq polymerase with a small quantity of Pfu          polymerase    had little effect on the SN                          Additives that improved Taq polymerase SN to          approximately           Some additives were found to enhance the SN ratio          Among the additives tested gp protein    or NH                        SO            improved the SN most efficiently          and the SN reached  See figure  Compare cut vs          intact rows in lanes  and  Combining gp and          NH                        SO            did not further improve SN See          figure  Compare cut vs intact rows in lanes                                    The Stoffel fragment of Taq polymerase gave a SN          of approximately           The Stoffel fragment of Taq polymerase is a truncated          portion of the enzyme which retains polymerase activity          but lacks the  exonuclease activity of Taq          polymerase     The Stoffel fragment does not cut at          the lac operator as does Taq polymerase     It might          therefore be a good choice of polymerase for jumping PCR          Consistent with the expectation results of using the          Stoffel fragment without additives such as gp NH                        SO            or detergent gave a SN of  See          figure  compare intact lanes     to cut lanes           Addition of any of the above additives did not          further improve the SN The source templates used were          also prepared by standard PCR with the Stoffel fragment          and the primer pair b and Jp on pBS see figure           BPCR primers b and M pV produced the expected           bp recombinant sequence In this size range the Stoffel          fragment of Taq polymerase yielded a better SN than Taq          polymerase However the Stoffel fragment had low output          in BPCR between primers b and M pI This is consistent          with the manufacturers description that the Stoffel          fragment is not optimal for the amplification of          sequences longer than  kb          Vent polymerase lacking nuclease activity    is          also expected to give a low noise level However it          yielded insufficient output data not shown                            Discussion                  Sources of noise in BPCR          PCR itself creates DNA damage and aberrant molecules          Taq polymerase harbors nuclease activities               Sites of stemloop structure are particularly vulnerable          to both degradation and to polymerase stalling               both of which generate noise in BPCR Gp an additive          that increased SN for Taq is a single stranded binding          protein that reduces the stemloop structures             associated with both cleavage and stalling by polymerases                    Templates are damaged by thermal          cycling    even in the absence of enzyme          The buffer for Taq polymerase including NH                        SO            and for the Stoffel fragment had a          low KCl concentration  mM Since the stemloop          structure of the template is less likely to form at low          KCl this low concentration could also contribute to the          increase of SN Because the Taq and Stoffel polymerase          both reached the same optimum SN of  it seems most          likely that template damage via heatingcooling cycles as          found by Gustafson et al    is limiting SN in this          system                          Applications and limitations of bridging PCR as an          assay for DNA damage          It is a basic aspect of materials science in any          system to study discontinuities This is especially the          case in materials that store information Several methods          are available to assay discontinuities in DNA and for          many applications one of the several current methods may          suffice             DNA backbone          interruptions are key intermediates in genetic metabolism                                       Chemotherapy     ionizing radiation    and          dietary mutagens    also cause distributed DNA strand          interruptions     Chemical modifications                  need not break the DNA backbone to impede the          progress of DNA polymerase Other modifications can be          converted into backbone interruptions For example it          has been proposed that alkalisensitive ribonucleotides          in DNA are a source of mutations              It is likely that the presently attained SN of           for BPCR is barely adequate for           in vivo studies Further          improvement of the SN by another factor of  or           would give greater assurance Even with the achieved SN          of  we are faced with a dilemma because of the lack          of other techniques that can detect a defect in less than           of the input DNA over a long region  bp in this          study Background breaks at any site in the region          contribute to noise therefore the background breakage at          any given site is apparently less than one in                             Conclusions        Breakcopy recombination       almost inevitably        occurs during PCR it has been called variously bridging        PCR jumping PCR recombinogenic PCR PCR sewing gene        shuffling and sexual PCR Sometimes this process is a        bug in the system leading to artifacts sometimes it is a        feature leading to diverse libraries of products        Bridging PCR is to a certain extent ca kb found in        this work unavoidable in PCR With a proper configuration        of markers BPCR can be used as a sensitive method for        detecting discontinuities in DNA In another context        fidelity of bridging synthesis is important for computing        with DNA For assay and computing applications it is        necessary to consider noise in BPCR In this work BPCR was        studied over a  base segment of the         lac operon and the noise level was        measured as approximately  when no special precautions        were taken with Taq polymerase With buffer modifications        or the addition of T gp the SN of Taq was improved to         The Stoffel fragment yielded a SN of  without        modifications of the standard protocol but was not further        improved by buffer modifications or gp In this system        with normal PCR using Taq polymerase the level of bridging        that occured was ca  per kilobase of amplifed sequence        It must be cautioned that our results have been obtained in        only one system with respect to the test sequence and the        primers Differences of the sequence and of reaction        conditions are expected to alter the proportion of bridging        that occurs in any particular system With respect to        sequence it is anticipated that regions of potential        secondary structure or other sites that are targets for the        nuclease activity of Taq may become hotspots for crossing        over during PCR                    Materials and Methods        The sources of
