               well do you watch much TV   well i watch in the evening with my kids   your kids how many kids do you have   i have four children   oh goodness i have got two       thats about all i want   well yeah it keeps you busy doesnt it   yeah they do theyre still babies   uh my children like to watch Sesame Street i watch with them every once in a while but that is not my favorite programs   oh well we have only get two channels we do not have cable but i am not crazy about TV much it just   uhhuh   well it kind of is an idiot box now Sesame Street is a good program because uh i do have that on videotape and i will let him watch that every once in a while and he has learned to count to twenty from that so   uhhuh yeah it can be very educational there are shows that that i like uh i like good family shows uh though uh i let my kids watch things like Little House On The Prairie   yeah uhhuh okay   and the Cosby Show is uh is uh kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money   right   i think that sometimes the things they show on there though uh the problems that their kids get into are are good to uh show that they do have problems anyway   right but they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do   uh yeah i mean like i said real life is not that easy   yeah   and uh i watch a show that i like it for entertainment uh it is called the Quantum Leap   oh i love Quantum Leap   i watch that show every time and uh   yes that is a good show   i i like uh how the how he has to help with the people that he that he becomes   uhhuh   um because it is not a show that he just becomes these people and then he lives there for a while and then he is gone he has to do something positive to help them   uhhuh right he always got to change history is what it is   so i yeah yeah   usually yeah that it is so good i was glad when they put that back on this channel because like i said we only get two channels because we do not get cable   it me too me too uhhuh   and still my little boy he watches videotapes he wont hum this is terrible i do not like him sitting in front of the TV all day   no thats not terrible i do not think thats terrible at all   well it but it is a not really a good baby sitter   well   its really not he needs to get outside and play and hes four years old and he just does not like to go out there by his self and ill let him watch the TV when i am wanting to get my house work done   uhhuh   but other than that i do not like him glued to the TV all the time   well i do not think its its healthy all the time either   huh   uh and my kids like to to go play with their friends and so i guess i do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit now i there are shows i do not have cable either and there are shows that i really put my foot down on if there starts to be a lot of violence i do not go for that   uhhuh   i will not let them watch that if there is a lot of language or   well we made the mistake right we made the mistake of getting Robocop and that is one of the worst oh i do not let him watch it anymore because just the pieces l   uhhuh   like especially where they kill somebody it is just not good i mean it is just real violent i mean   well it  you know today i watched and it is like they show bloody you know things and they show it in slow motion and   uhhuh uhhuh   and everything like that and before in a western or something in the in the olden days   you would see somebody get shot they would just fall down   yeah and they were gone  and and it wasnt uh not like today uh   yeah so graphic today its its really graphic they try to make it too realistic   uhhuh yeah too much realism i think sometimes   and yeah   i dont   now he is watching Honey I Shrunk The Kids right now   oh that is a fun show oh i really like that one   it is cute and that little Roger Rabbit on before that that is cute and they have got the He Man uh   uhhuh the cartoon or the   Masters Of The Universe the movie   oh uhhuh   that is a real cute show   that has good moral values too   He Man   uhhuh well uh i think uh   yeah good versus evil huh   yeah yeah   oh well it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway   yeah at least we have the same ideas   yeah     yeah language too and language and violence and sexual you you know things i i get kind of uh saying i am sorry kids this is and i i think it is important that i see   uhhuh yeah   what theyre watching   yeah they do have like those parental control things on the uh remote controls you know where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch   if you mean in cable oh i do not know because i do not have that but   uhhuh well my my uh stepfather and them have my stepfather my fatherinlaw and them have that   uhhuh   and uh they do not have any kids but they was told how to use that but still when the kids get older they learn how to break through that parental control   oh do they   huh   theyre too smart   i think all you have to do is push a couple buttons   uhhuh   so its its  im hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because now we have got a lot of western tapes Josey Wells now he loves to watch Josey Wells   uhhuh i think that is a good show too yeah uhhuh   yeah Clint Eastwood and like The Man From Showy River weve oh my husband likes westerns and he also likes Star Trek now Star Trek are good movies good shows   uhhuh   the uh series we have got a lot of those   uh i think not even the old one but the new one too i like both of those   uhhuh  The Next Generation yeah  my little boy is  crazy  about  Captain Kirk and my little girl has Mister Spocks ears   uhhuh yeah oh   and i told my husband he cursed my kids  they were both born with pointy ears   yeah oh well   not real pointy my little boy grew out of it   oh that is not a problem anyway but it is fun to you know seeing the show anyway uh now i like uh everything Michael oh no not Michael Douglas um   no uhhuh   oh i cant think of his name   Kirk Douglas   no the the man right now who is having uh who has done uh Bonanza and then he did Little House On The Prairie Michael Landon there you go Michael Landon i have always liked and thought he did good shows   oh Michael Landon oh now there yeah like Highway to Heaven   uhhuh   here are some cookies Kyle   yeah i liked Highway To Heaven and i and i thought that was kind of neat though but i loved Little House On The Prairie especially when Melissa Gilbert grew up she was kind of like my   yeah yeah   idol  when i was growing up because i am twenty seven so it is you know she is about the same age as i am i wanted to be just like her because she is so cute     uhhuh yeah i and i liked that show because it it portrayed i thought really well uh pioneer kind of days   yeah and well i liked it but there that is about the only uh   you know but   show i have seen where every time they sit down at the table they pray before they eat and i thought that was real neat   uhhuh yeah   because there is not a lot of shows that do that     i   and uh they have this little cartoon thats on Sunday mornings   now what is that   with Jot i remember him in school but i do not it is just this little dot with arms and feet and little eyes and his parents are there they have it like before one of the church things uh you know church that comes on   uhhuh   and it is a just this little dot and he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home and the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the Bible that will help him with that and it is just   oh i have not seen that   well its usually we go to church on Sundays but we will miss every once in a while and i will let Kyle watch that and he just well i even like Jot i mean i it is funny   uhhuh what channel is it on   it is on channel well let us see youre in Plano   uhhuh   uh its twelve or ten down here

then he has got a friend named Cat     well well look   and i think the dog is the only one thats not a a dot  but it is real cute and like i say they they       teach him stuff from the Bible and i think it is just a real cute show im trying to get my little boy into reading uh like church books and things we have got like Noahs Ark and   uhhuh   oh Lord is My Shepherd we have got about eight or twelve books for him just little Bible stories and theyre he is he is getting to where he likes them   uhhuh yeah   we got him a little Jesus doll uh about a year ago and he has always kept that he likes it   well i really like now we get channel fifty five although we do not have cable we do get channel fifty five and that is a uh like a   uhhuh   a song they sing songs on there but theyre uh
