                                 FDRs and ERs Sentimental Politics                        Dear Marjorie            I must have overcompressed my last letter because youve read as a singleargument what I meant as two  By Gingrichian I meant profiting offgovernmental power that is not really your property Maybe thats a problemmaybe not But Eleanors using the money she made to reward likemindedphilanthropists hence buy political support doesnt change the ethics of it For someone intent on remaking the social order Eleanor was working with acuriously narrow definition of privilege a definition that left her lifestylelargely untouched            Another thing I didnt say FDR was dictatorial but anyone who sent afriendly greeting to an American Nazi rally in Madison Square Garden in  adiscovery for which Cook deserves great credit was worth keeping an eye onThe most highhanded moment of his presidencythe attempt to pack the SupremeCourt in is made the worse by his almost insane assertion that theSupreme Court was one of the three horses pulling the New Deal plowWithout calling him undemocratic one can wonder what his idea of democracywas            The best point either of us made all week was your Monday one about thedivision of labor between presidents and their wives You asked                           Did the bifurcated Roosevelt White House do a disservice inproviding a model for later administrations in which poor folks and childrenand the lame and the halt were insidiously sentimentalized as womenswork                         My answer would be Yes were still stuck with that modelalthough Iwouldnt blame Eleanor for it And Im less bothered by the gender stereotypingit entails than by the good copbad cop tactics through which it gets playedout            Because sentimental politics can be a way to fob off rhetoricalsolutions on people demanding practical ones Sometimes this is a good way todefuse radicalism which would otherwise be hard to answer When the BonusMarchers came back to Washington FDR couldnt tell them to take a hike but hecouldnt cave in to them either without unleashing similar protests acrossthe country So he gave them threehotsandacot across the Potomac and sentEleanor out to sing Its a Long Way to Tipperary with them            But sometimes sentimental politics is merely a way to salve ones consciencewhen real action is possible and one would prefer to do nothing Cook feels FDRdid much less than he could have to help European refugees in the late sShes right But I would ask whether Eleanors public handwringing didntprovide him with cover for his inaction One note If I left the impressionyesterday that Eleanors pacifism extended to support for unilateraldisarmament  I should be clear thatparticularly as war approacheditdecidedly did not            Youre right that its race where the interplay between rhetorical andprogrammatic politics was most complex Cook snorts throughout at the demandsof FDRs advisers particularly Jubal Earlys grandson Steve that racialetiquette be respected But at some level she understands that it wasa matter of etiquette The guerrilla warfare of manners that Eleanorwagedshowing up in public with Mary McLeod Bethune and Walter White turningthe White House into a place where black people were routinely seen coming inand going out the front doormay have been the most effective way to strikeagainst racism at a time of severely limited options Of course it alonecould never carry the day Bull Connor advised FDR on Southern matters untilFDRs death ran Birmingham for almost three decades after Eleanors sitdownprotest and was even the Democratic National Committeeman for Alabama duringthe Kennedy administration            You also noted early on that some of the mixedness of Eleanorsrelationship with FDR was lost in Volume   I liked this book betterthan the first but I think youre right I never quite figured out forexample what the particular crisis was that left Hick worried that Eleanorwould ditch FDR on the eve of reelectionalthough its another tidbit to addto our ClintonRoosevelt Parallels file Poor Hick bereft of career living ina perpetual state of lowintensity jiltedness Miss you so much runs thetypical Eleanor letter but youd hate it here so dont come traveling the barrooms of the country as Eleanors eyes and ears remains forme the hero of the book            Marjorie its been a delight to correspond with you this week Best wishesuntil we meet againperhaps over Volume  of some future volumebiography of Rosalynn Carter            Yours            Chris
