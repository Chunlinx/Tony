              its about this rap crap     uh  yeah   uh it uh uh do you get it   um not really not really ive uh       i uh ive im forty years old now so ive  uh   oh so am i so were talking the same language   yeah we uh we we grew up with the same music and         i just uh i heard song i heard uh what they call around here they have a thing they call uh  oh what are they uh its a spoof on the song and the song was um you youve heard of the song Dance to the Music you remember that   oh yeah   okay well they did a uh a uh twisted tune they call it and the twisted tune was Rap Isnt Music   yeah indeed   and they they sang here Rap Isnt Music  to the tune of you know Dance to the Music  it was pretty funny         and to the music wow thats terrific well i just dont get you know like i remember when we were growing up how you know the Beatles and and and and and Presley uh you know how they were all condemned and rock and roll was the devils music and it wouldnt last and all that   yeah   i i you know i keep thinking that you know i i uh uh uh are are we doing the same thing with this rap stuff   im   i mean at at at least with rock and roll it took talent     thats true thats true now if you can just uh make a rhyme and sometimes not even a good one you know you   yeah yeah you know all you got to do  is is you know i it just amazes me   and you dont even need a band because you can just use that uh crazy little radio to uh keep the time for you     yes a scratchy record you know   oh God yes       i i mean i i can tolerate a lot of different things and i can you know i can tolerate a certain amount of of rap but if i have to listen to two songs in a row im ready to shoot somebody     yeah really its it it it i i just dont get it course i guess that dates us it means you are forty   yeah that that must be it       um my i get a real kick out of the uh these remakes of the old songs that we grew up with   oh yeah now that that i do enjoy i do uh yeah you know and ive been hearing a lot lot more of it lately too   yeah it makes you think that all the uh singer song writers are running out of you know things to write about   well you know you know uh uh i know that somewhere you know i mean we we were really fortunate because you know we we had a you know the times of the Beatles and and and and things like that i mean you know that music is i really think the Beatles music will probably last you know   umhum   yeah it it it theyre immortal but uh i i just really dont know if uh what is it RBQ or whatever that  i i dont even know run run run run run something uh   run D   Run DMC yes Run D i mean uh uh yeah   yeah itll never be elevator music lets put it that way   uh no exactly exactly you know it is it going to be picked up by a symphony you know and and and           yeah i know and you youll youll never hear it in the uh   no   in the restaurants and uh   no well i dont know maybe you will but uh you know uh it it it just doesnt translate there is no melody   yeah   you know it it its       you know just  give me shelter     ive ive found that as ive gotten older that that some of even the hard rock has started to to bother me and it   well uh the hard rock from your time from our time   uh no no from this this new hard rock   yeah yeah okay well okay i i i agree with you i dont have any trouble with you know uh uh with with with Zeppelin stuff i dont have any trouble with uh uh   umhum   you you you you know stuff that that  Santana or or or or Hendrix i dont have any trouble with that   yeah me either   but i have trouble with with this new crap uh well uh like i say well weve weve done nothing but but prove our age today           yeah but its fun to prove your age um i i get the biggest kick out of my i have uh two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old living at home and uh they       well   they hear one of these old remakes of a song and oh thats just a beautiful song and im like thats a remake they that that songs twenty years old   yeah really   oh no it just came out  thats called music     well then what you do is you go you know and you and and and you find the original and and and and you play it for them and luckily it it it it of course i i  i was i been divorced but uh my my my my first wife has that first collection of of songs  that that that you could probably prove them with you know   well weve got uh four cases of albums downstairs and then weve got another case of   oh im sure you probably have a lot of those then   oh yes we do weve got some songs that will that will totally blow my children away um  weve the problem weve been having is that we have a uh an old Fisher system and cant find a needle for it you know because theyre not pressing   oh yeah oh yeah oh wow i bet that really is a problem finding a stylus because turntables are     yeah   are going the way of the of the of of the   horse and buggy   yeah something   yeah so im im hoping th at we can locate one soon and once i do locate a source im going to buy about twelve of them     yeah i uh yeah i suggest you latch onto it you know uh i was just trying to think that uh i can suggest something to you you might look at are you familiar with Crutchfield   um ive heard of it   uh Crutchfield Electronics they also have a catalog and ive found ive got Beta machines and finding hifi beta tape has become almost impossible   umhum   well i found that i can get it through them they have a lot of you know stuff that that that that um that you may be able to order through them so if you have access to a computer or anything like that you might get one on them of one of them like Comp U Serve i think Comp U Serve has Crutchfield so you can get on with them and and uh and you know and get one of their catalogs   great ill try that out i really uh i really do want to dig out the old LPs   yeah if you if you if you have access to a computer and one of the information services uh i would suggest that thats the way you go   yeah because ive ive got everything from uh God back when ive got all of Bill Cosbys original comedy albums   youve got the real wow far out   and ive even got Old Silver Throat thats the one album that he sang on   oh really   yeah hes horrible he horrible singer  i listened to it one time that was it   didnt know that he sang on any of it uh all right   and ive ive got stuff   listen its been a pleasure im getting ready for Star Trek the Next Generation   ah   its coming on in two minutes so  ive enjoyed talking with you but i got to have my priorities     all right yeah i know well its been nice talking to you too   all right take care   all right you too byebye   byebye
