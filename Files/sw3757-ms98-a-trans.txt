                well Tom what do you think about our public school systems today   um well i have i have two kids in school and and in comparing it with people who live in other parts of the world one of the things that things wrong is that our our schools our kids seem to go to school less of of the year than than kids in other countries   umhum   um it seems like uh the long summer break is something that only uh only occurs in the United States   umhum   um do you have any kids in school   no i dont so im a little bit out of it i can look back to my  to when i was in school which is getting further and further away and also i have a niece and nephew that are in school out in California and i hear a little a bit about from my sister about   yeah yeah   things going on yeah   well some of the some of the uh schools are trying to go to more of a year around system   yeah theyre moving to that out there   and uh i guess theres pros and cons to that too i know if if if it happened here i would hope that uh you know i have uh two children that are two years a part i would just hope they were in the same system so   yeah   if you wanna take a vacation you could   uhhuh i hear that they that in at least in the system thats going out um  in California where that im familiar with that they do put families on the same schedule   yeah   so seems like that could get a little difficult to do that but   it could it could one of the other um things is that um uh theres been a lot of talk about uh American schools uh getting behind in science compared to uh lot of European schools and and Japan also   umhum   that their schools are teaching uh more of the science sciences and putting out better uh graduates when in math and science uh for the future you know technology in various countries   umhum yeah yeah   and thats not a favorite subject for either of my my kids its probably not   umhum   for anyone but it just seems like uh those are the criticisms criticisms you hear over and over about the the the American public school system and this is probably why a lot people  go to private schools instead   yeah yeah yeah well i hadnt thought about those things but those are problems um   some of the some of the  people that i work with uh theyre theyre some from various parts of the of the world and and uh course everybody likes to think their systems the best but the the ones in   umhum   England and and then Germany seem seem to uh have some logical points about you know why do why do kids need a three month break in the summer   umhum   and i i think that dates back to when America was agricultural and nature and and children needed to help on farms and its been quite a while since thats been the case for most part now   right yeah yeah theres no need for it anymore   and it seems though thats one of the things that ought to to change   umhum umhum   uh im not im not that happy to always be uh limited to just summers for most vacations and and uh Christmas time for the other you know the other one   umhum   and compete with all the crowds since all the other people with uh families going on vacation   right yeah   tends to make some crowds   umhum   did you go through the public school system   yeah i did   uh uh uh yeah i did too and everyone else in  my family but seems like uh uh if people can afford it the number of people go the private school route but thats of course not available to to the average person with   right i know a lot of people that are home schooling their children you know just teaching them at home and   yes uhhuh   and for lots of different reasons you know   that i have mixed feelings about that too i guess whether or not they miss the social interaction a part of it   yeah yeah i know that a lot of them um they hook up with like a home schooling system and they get together the kids get together for lots of activities and outings and stuff like that   yeah that that would help   yeah i think that helps yeah i wonder too i have mixed feelings about it but um i know that uh you know i spot when i thought of problems in the school system its not really the fault of the school system but theres a lot of you know its just uh   i dont know kids are exposed to a lot that you cant shelter them eventually eventually but its hard at a young age some of the pressures and   yeah uhhuh yeah the i i think thats why a lot of people go to the home schooling they they disagree with what theyre exposed to either for religious reasons or or other reasons   yeah yeah umhum   um the other thing thats happening now i guess is is   yeah
