                                 We Are All on Good Morning America                        Good Morning Andrew             I cant retrieve my email at the moment Could it be because I amtreasuring  messages in my inbox Anyway I will just send off into theblue my thoughts on seeing Peter Kurth brother of Barbara Kurth on GoodMorning America I think Youll remember that Barbara Kurth is the motherwhose daughters were kidnapped by her exhusband Stephen Fagan who changedhis name and lived in shadowy splendor in Palm Beach Florida raising thegirls as they are always called theyre now  and  having told themtheir mother died in a car crash Barbara Kurth got no help from FBI or legalsystem in tracking him down by the way because the kidnapping took place inl before parental kidnapping was covered by appropriate laws She spent allher money on private eyes to no avail            So of course since she is the mother Barbara Kurth has been attacked inthe media solely on the basis of allegations by Stephen Fagan who says shewas an alcoholic who neglected the children leaving him no choice She denieshis chargewhich was investigated by the court after all which found themuntrue and gave her custody He doesnt explain why he kept up the deceptionfor two decades long after his exwife had clearly overcome her problems ifshe ever had any and had gotten a PhD she is now a professor of cellbiology marriedbut no kids His whole family was in on it toohis parentsalso moved to Florida Its hard to imagine the cruelty involved here            Anyway I turn on the TV in my hotel room in Whittier California whichisas every single person I mentioned this place to reminded mewhere Nixonwent to college why do we all have this little fact so firmly implanted in ourbrains and there was Barbara Kurths brother Peter being interviewed byKatie Couric And what amazed me is that here was this ordinary American manwho had been suddenly plucked from obscurity by the hand of fate and he knewexactly what to do on television How to sit not too slumpy not too stiffwhat to do with his hands kept them quiet dont gesticulate or fiddle withyour ear or other body part how to arrange his expressions relaxed alertopen affable how to speak in sound bites dont digress dont get maddont talk too long It was as though hed been on TV every day foryears            Talk to you laterKatha
