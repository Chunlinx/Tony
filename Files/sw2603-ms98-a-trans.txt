                okay um i guess what i guess my my task  i usually ride my bike i have uh a stationary bike and uh a regular bike and when i can i like to ride my regular bike outside because its so much nicer  the stationary bike is is so um   boring   boring  but i have head phones and i plus i have it uh in the living room so i either watch TV or we have a fish tank so i watch the fish you know  whatever i can do to keep myself occupied if i like to have the TV on because that usually keeps me um more occupied it kind of takes the time away and i dont realize really thats really the only time i ever watch TV is when im on the bike but and then usually after im done riding the bike just to cool myself down i usually take a walk you know and that just kind of gets myself uh gets me you know to where im not quite as tired i guess  but its definitely a task i cant say that i really enjoy it  i wish that i did enjoy it more but i do it because i have to not because i want to   you think so i bought a stationary bike but i find that if i sit  on that seat too long it hurts   yeah yeah   and i havent figured how to get that soft and i tried even tying a pillow to it but two years ago i joined well its not quite two years its almost two years i joined the Cosmopolitan Lady here in Plano   uhhuh   and i love it i just love it   really so is it just women that go there   yeah its totally women   see i think thats whats my biggest problem with going to a place uh a a health club because i dont feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise  you know so i have tried to just do stuff at home and uh i just feel conscious about it i mean im not big you know or anything but i still dont like other people watching  me you know   i like to be able to sweat have my hair a mess   yeah   uh       feel that okay fine if my bathing suit slips a little bit i dont have to be conscious of   right   of it being a little bit too low and i my bathing suits just one piece so theres no big deal all the way around but i dont have to be conscious of what im doing or how im doing it   uhhuh   and its uh oh its just i dont know its a its a total free relaxation because hey you can do what you want youre a female and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing   thats what   and theyve got such fantastic equipment in there   really thats thats great how   oh yeah and i love the water aerobics i love the water aerobics   do they have a pool or what is   oh yeah theyve got a nice one   huh   they have two types of water aerobics they call it aqua exercise i guess is what they call it   ive heard that thats really good for you to do   it pushes you because youre pushing against the water in itself so it is like double strenuous but youre not   uhhuh   being double strenuous on your own body because youre pushing it yourself   uhhuh   so youre doing it yourself but   so you dont really feel like youre really working that hard do you when youre in the water   huhuh the only thing that i ever felt was every time i stop and start going again because i end up getting two jobs once in a while i end up having to quit for a while but i get blisters on my toes on the bottom because i really jump a lot   oh wow  well thats funny i never would have thought of that   but well a lot of people wear those little uh terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom especially around the pool so they just wear them right into the pool   like water are they water shoes is that   yeah theyre just little terry cloth things you wear for house slippers with rubber you know soles so that you know no big deal one way or the other   oh okay okay okay okay huh thats really funny   but i never think about it until after you go there for about a week  your toes you start getting blisters anyway so no big deal   huh   but its fun   thats so how often do find yourself going um on a if youre doing it on a regular basis how often do you go   i try to make it at least three times a week   yeah thats really   for a while i was doing it every day just   really   going uh five days a week   i wish that i could make myself exercise every day but i do force myself to do it at least three times a week which i dont feel like is enough but uh its its at least something  you know it it i just force i have to force myself to do it like i said because to me i really dont enjoy it but i know that i have to do it i mean its just its its not a question of whether i want  to you know   well   but   when i was working up at uh The Summit here in Plano id leave there   uhhuh   and id be at the swimming pool by four oclock   oh thats   oh actually about four thirty because they start at five to six so i was there by four thirty every night and the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet   uhhuh   because no matter what i did or how i did it i invariably got myself wet   uhhuh   but the water only comes up basically to your anywhere from your waist to your oh chest id say   yeah   so i mean its your choice where you want to go but   did you ever   i enjoyed it higher   well im sorry   thats okay     uh did you ever go to Texins at all when you were working for TI   i have a i have a bad back   did you ever try that   so im very limited what i do   oh okay   its like i can walk but if i walk for more than fifteen minutes its going to bother me   um   especially when youre on cement or anything thats hard it will bother me it will bother me   then that would yeah i guess then the water aerobics would be probably the best thing for you wouldnt it   well that what pushed me that way though was basically was the fact that when i w ent in there is wasnt for the water aerobics i went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles   oh   and uh she said hey go for the swimming pool she says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor she says in fact you get more   wow   i said okay because im not a swimmer   uhhuh   i like water im not scared of it but i couldnt i guess i could swim across the pool but im no swimmer per se   yeah   but i found that this worked really well and i came out of there and i saw my stomach going down well   oh   i dropped oh id say almost twenty pounds   wow   just by watching what i ate and they fix you up with a diet which worked real good   what if youre already on one i mean yeah i mean when you go in there they wouldnt make you do theirs would they   what a diet oh no they have nothing to do with that   okay   see i joined uh when this one down here opened up i joined as a VIP and the VIP gives you uh oh  gives you a diet a computerized diet and they go over all your health and all your history and they show you how everything to do and how to do it and the whole nine yards so it became part of the package so i went through it   but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program is that what youre saying   it worked out well oh yeah you can just go in there and join just like anywhere else too   i see okay   i just went and took the because they were offering it as an opening benefit so it was its less than what you pay now for going in there after all this time   um   after all this time so its like when i got laid off i went back in there and start all over again because it had been a while since id done it   um   so i get all the same treatment again so its kind of nice   wow thats   like i said i like it i like the heat i like the i jump out of the swimming pool and i go into the hot tub   oh   and i love it   yeah that would be really nice   because i have never i have never let me reword that i think i have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore but thats because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did   uhhuh   thats i knew i was pushing too far   uhhuh   but usually when i go into the hot tub before i go swimming or when i come out im totally relaxed when i go home its no big deal   so you really do enjoy your exercise then since your   its fun its fun uh ive gotten on the bike and theyve got uh the stepping bike where you step   uhhuh   and ive enjoyed that watching how well i can can walk up and down stairs   thats you know i wanted   but most of the others to me are very dull   i wanted to get one of those steppers when i bought the bike but i got talked into the bike instead and i dont know i really wanted a stepper im considering maybe even buying one of those too but im not sure if ill get benefit out of both of them i mean i dont know if it would really do any good having both of them which one do you feel is better since you use them both   um i get bored very easily uh the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit like you said you can sit and do it and watch the TV and not even really be conscious of what you are doing   uhhuh   with the stepper you are conscious of what you are doing because youre basically watching each step as it gets harder and down   huh   so you have a little you know little you can program the one at Cosmopolitan Lady so   uhhuh   to what your gear is uh i it would depend upon which one you want i think now that ive had the bicycle i would go to the stepper but if i were you i would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while because you can buy a months membership and see what you feel is best for you   oh really um   because it all depends you know for everyone their own what they want to do because i jump on the bike here at home mine has its see the handle bars go up and down so i can sit there and read and listen to music like what you said and it has no effect on me   uhhum   so i mean its boring   uhhuh
