                    Background        The rapid determination of microbial genomic sequences        poses a challenge in gene annotation and assignment of        transcriptional start sites Without experimental data        incorrect annotations can be made as well as erroneous        determination of gene start sites This is especially true        for genes that are evolutionarily and structurally related        such as the bacterial porin genes         ompF and         ompC  For example a BLAST search        using the         Salmonella typhimurium ompF gene        sequence identifies         Enterobacter cloacae ompC as well as         Salmonella minnesota        ompC unpublished However when gene promoter sites        transcript UTR sequences or signatures within genes from        reference organisms are used an accurate assignment of a        gene as well as a prediction of its start site can be made        by a comparative approach These regions serve specific        functions in molecular processes eg several  UTRs of        mRNA transcripts are mRNA stability determinants             Thus they can display sequence andor secondary structure        signatures and these defined segments can be more useful        than using entire gene sequences for annotations The use        of domains for annotation of genomic sequences originated        with analyses of protein coding regions       In this        paper alignment and comparative methods have been used to        annotate the small regulatory RNA gene         micF and its associated genes         ompF and         ompC in         Yersinia species  Transcriptional        start sites have also been assigned based on alignment        data        The         micF transcript is a small        nonprotein coding RNA found in         E coli and related bacteria                     micF regulates outer membrane protein        F OmpF synthesis in response to stress and other        environmental signals    and these signals induce the        transcription of         micF RNA         micF RNA functions by interacting        with the target         ompF mRNA  UTR to form an RNARNA        duplex The         micF transcript inhibits         ompF expression        posttranscriptionally by blocking translation and inducing        degradation of the         ompF message            With the use of newly determined         Yersinia genomic sequences           see also Accession no gnlSANGER         Yersinia enterocolitica          micF RNA         ompF mRNA  UTR duplex models have        been deduced These structures show a strong evolutionary        conservation of the RNARNA duplex structure but also        reveal additional interacting sites The new         Yersinia sequences further support a        phylogenetic conservation of the         micF regulatory system in        proteobacteria                    Results and Discussion                  Gene Annotation          BLAST searches were performed to find           micF and its target           ompF  as well as           ompC in genomic sequences available          on the GenBank site of the National Center for          Biotechnology Information NCBI Due to similarities in          sequence in protein coding regions of           ompF and           ompC  a BLAST search using known          gene sequences can provide erroneous results However the          mRNA  UTR transcript sequences of           ompF and           ompC differ significantly and the           ompF  UTR sequence provides a          basis for detection in a BLAST search since several           ompF  UTR sequence signatures are          conserved and are           ompF specific Additional markers          used were genomic positions relative to highly conserved          genes such as           asnS  the asparaginyltRNA          synthetase which is preceded by           ompF in the           E coli and           S typhimurium chromosomes by about           bp The           ompC and           micF genes are upstream of each          other in Gramnegative genomic sequences and in           E coli  they are separated by a           bp regulatory promoter region     Since these          genes share a transcriptional regulatory region          rearrangements where these genes may be repositioned and          separated on the chromosome are probably unlikely                    Y pestis and Y enterocolitica          ompF mRNA  UTR sequences were found by a BLAST          search on GenBank using the           Serratia marcescens ompF  UTR          sequence as a probe Position  of the           Y pestis genomic sequence and          position  of the           Y enterocolitica sequence were          pinpointed as the  starts          The           S marcescens ompC  UTR           regulatory promoter          regionmicF segment provided a suitable sequence for          determination of genomic positions of           Yersinia ompC and           micF  however these have been          partially annotated in           Y pestis Accession           NC Assignment of  start sites of           Yersinia species           micF            ompF and           ompC was based on sequence          alignment using  start sites of other organisms see          below Annotation of           ompF            ompC and           micF genes in           Yersinia species is shown in Table                                    Sequence Alignments and comparisons                      ompFand ompC UTR            Figure shows the alignment of DNA sequences            representing six             ompF  UTRs             opnP is the             ompF homolog in             Xenorhabdus nematophilus  an            organism which resides in a specific ecological nitch            but is phylogenetically related to the proteobacteria                  Assignment of  start sites of             Yersinia species mRNA transcripts            was based on alignment and similarity with the other             ompF  UTR sequences                        Y pestis and             Y enterocolitica ompF  UTRs            differ only by a T to A base substitution at position             Figure  In addition the nucleotide sequence            identity between             Yersinia species and other            proteobacteria is high Figure  Consistent with            bacterial evolutionary relatedness the percent            identity of             Yersinia species             ompF  UTRs appear to be closest            to             Serratia marcescens Figure                        High sequence conservation implies a functional role            for conserved elements The  UTRs of bacterial mRNAs            are important determinants of mRNA stability andor            translational regulation         In keeping            with a functional role the segment of             ompF  UTR that forms the major            RNARNA duplex pairing with             micF ie positions  is            highly conserved amongst the species analyzed            including             Yersinia species Figure  In            addition this region contains the ribosome binding            site ShineDalgarno SD sequence and initiation            codon ATG start site and these also contribute to            evolutionary sequence stability An additional            signature shared by the             Yersinia species is an Arich            region that precedes the SD domain The  end region            of             ompF mRNA  UTR contains a long            stemloop and evolutionary changes in this segment            consist primarily of compensatory basepair changes            that maintain a stemloop structure     However            the end region of the             ompF UTR also has a high sequence            conservation with the exception of a  nt deletion            that the             Yersinia species share with             S marcescens Figure             Putative  start sites of             Yersinia species             ompC transcripts were also            determined by sequence alignment Figure  High            similarity in the promoter regions also support start            site predictions of both             micF and ompC transcripts see            below             ompC mRNA  UTR sequences show            more sequence divergence than             ompF  UTR sequences eg the            percent identity between             Y pestis and             Y enterocolitica sequences is             and divergence between the two             Yersinia ompC  UTR segments is            greater than that of the closely related organisms             E coli and             S typhimurium Figure  As            with             ompF mRNA  UTR the SD            sequence GAGG and AT rich region between the SD site            and ATG start codon are highly conserved Figure             With exception of the ribosome binding site a            functional role for the             ompC mRNA  UTR is not            known                                micFsequence comparisons             ends of             Yersinia micF genes were deduced            by alignment with             micF sequences from related            species Figure  The independent termination motif            of the             micF transcript delineates the             end A comparison of             micF sequences from  bacterial            species reveals that the initial  nt from the  end            are invariant in addition the first  nt are highly            conserved Figure  This  nt region represents the            segment of the             micF transcript that forms the            major duplex interaction with the target             ompF mRNA in             E coli     Similar to target            sequences in             ompF mRNA  UTR positions             see Figure  this binding role may account            for the high evolutionary sequence conservation of the             nt segment at the  end of             micF             The variability of             micF nucleotide sequence in the            last two thirds of the gene may be due to several            factors For example the independent termination            stemloop transcript structure may function on            secondary and not primary structural features and can            tolerate compensatory basepair changes in the stem as            well as changes in loop sequences In addition            variation in the type of RNARNA base pairing occurs            with sequences in the highly variable middle section of                        micF RNA positions  Figure             For example nucleotide sequences within this            region allow for formation of intra and inter            molecular basepairings in RNARNA interactions in             Yersinia species These base            pairings are not seen in other species see below                        Yersinia micF sequences have            diverged more than the             S marcescens micF sequence            eg the percent identity between             S marcescens micF and             E coli micF is  it is             between             Y pestis and             E coli micF genes Figure             Evolutionary instability in sequence is consistent with            the high genetic flux found in the             Y              pestis genome                Interestingly the             Y enterocolitica micF sequence            has diverged somewhat more Figure  But of interest            also is the large difference in sequence between the            two             Yersinia micF RNA genes ie             base substitutions and a  base insertion at positions             in             Y enterocolitica Figure             These sequence differences actually reinforce the             Yersinia RNARNA duplex model            see below The reason for the evolutionary drift in             Y enterocolitica micF sequence            is not known            The             micF sequence identities differ            markedly from those of             ompF  UTR compare Figure and            Figure  These differences are also evident in the            phylogenetic trees Figure and Figure  Noteworthy            are the differences between             Yersinia species sequence             s  ie there are  base            changes between the two             Yersinia species             micF sequences Figure  and            only one base change at position  between             Yersinia ompF  UTR sequences            Figure  Thus this reveals a very unequal rate of            nucleotide sequence change between             Yersinia micF and             ompF  UTR sequences On the            other hand there appears to be a uniform rate of            nucleotide change between             S marcescens and             E coli sequences in             ompF mRNA  UTR              identity and             micF   identity compare            Figures and                                 Upstream regulatory region            In E             coli  the  nt upstream            sequence between             micF and             ompC contains promoters as well            as binding sites for several transcription factors                            micF is part of a global            regulatory network that responds to environmental            stress conditions in             E coli       It is thus            not surprising that this region has a complex set of            transcriptional regulatory sites These sites comprise            approximately one third of the upstream sequence            between             micF and             ompC in             E coli             A comparison of nucleotide sequences from related            bacteria shows that these binding sites are highly            conserved evolutionarily and that             Yersinia species sequences have            not appreciably diverged either between themselves or            in comparison to those in other bacterial sequences            Figure  OmpR the transcription factor that            activates transcription of both             micF and             ompC in response to osmolarity            increase binds at three sites in             E coli  C C and C                 These sites are highly conserved between all            bacterial species where  positions out of  are            totally conserved Figure  A high degree of sequence            conservation is also found for integration host factor            IHF a protein that participates in bending of DNA                           SoxS MarA and Rob are part of the family of            AraCXylS transcription regulators and share the same            DNA binding sites in             E coli     These factors            regulate             E coli micF transcription in            response to different environmental factors The            SoxSMarARob binding site upstream of             micF  termed the SoxSMarARob            box is not well conserved phylogenetically however            the major polymerase interaction site the A box is            almost totally conserved in bacterial sequences            analyzed including those of             Yersinia Figure  MarA and Rob            transcription regulators in             E coli have two helixturnhelix            HTH motifs that interact with A and B box sequences                 and one HTH element of Rob has been shown to            insert itself in the             micF promoter DNA at the major            groove of the A box region                An alignment of six different gene promoters in             E coli that contain a            SoxSMarARob box shows that they conform to a            conserved  bp distance between the SoxSMarARob            binding sequences and the  promoter      This            also holds true for             micF promoters in related            bacteria including promoters of the             Yersinia species but the            exception is the             S marcescens sequence which has            a  bp insertion between the  and              micF promoter sites and adjacent            to the B box of Figure  Thus this partially            conserved  bp distance may not be as relevant as            previously thought Although sites of interaction of            RNA polymerase RNAP with these transcription            regulators have not been determined      the             bp pair insertion does pose the question of how            putative             S marcescens SoxSMarARob            factors interact with RNAP to activate transcription in                        S marcescens             The leucine response protein Lrp a global            regulator of transcription    represses             micF     In             E coli the primary Lrp binding            site    overlaps much of the SoxSMarARob site            upstream of             micF Figure  The highest            sequence conservation is primarily in the            SoxSMarARobrelated A box sequence GCAC Since the            Lrp site overlaps the SoxSmarARob site a high            overall sequence conservation may be expected but the            degree of conservation is much less than that for            example of the OmpR sites The putative Lrp binding            site sequences between             Yersinia species are nearly            identical but differ almost uniformly from those of the            other bacteria            Some regions not pinpointed as sites for factor            binding have diverged appreciably eg the region            between integration host factor IHF and Lrp binding            sites positions  to  but the region between C            and IHF binding sites  to  has some partially            conserved sequences Figure  These may serve as            sites for other transcription factors where binding            sequences have not been defined For example in             E coli  HNS binds in an as yet            unspecified site in the             ompC              micF regulatory region                In addition             nfxB encodes a transcriptional            repressor and may act on             micF as an             nfxB mutant was found to reduce            OmpF levels posttranscriptionally in             E coli                 nfxB has also been found in             Pseudomonas aeruginosa                thus a putative             micF regulatory site for             nfxB may also be evolutionarily            conserved Evolutionary conservation of transcription            factor binding sites as seen in Figure implies that            these transcriptional regulators function in bacterial            species being analyzed here Some factors such as OmpR            have been found in related organisms                Although transcription factor binding sites display            a high uniformity in sequence a sequence comparison of            the entire upstream regulatory region shows that the             Yersinia species have diverged            significantly between each other and more than the             E coli              S typhimurium              K pneumoniae grouping has            diverged within itself data not shown It remains to            be seen if entire genome comparisons of             Y pestis and             Y enterocolitica will show this            evolutionary trend which has also been seen in             micF  or if this divergence            pattern is an anomaly                                    OmpFmRNA UTR micFRNA duplex structures          Secondary structure probing by enzymatic and chemical

contains imperfect basepairing      In          the present work           Yersinia ompF mRNA  UTR           micF RNA duplex structure modeling          was performed with the mfold program     Figure          and Figure  Sequences between           Yersinia micF RNA species differ in           out of  positions shown in blue in Figure           Interestingly these changes result in only minor          variations in           Yersinia RNARNA duplex structural          models For example base substitutions at positions           and  in           Y enterocolitica are in looped          regions

and  Base changes at positions              and  constitute compensatory changes that          maintain base pairs in stems Thus the large divergence          in           micF RNA sequence between           Y pestis and           Y enterocolitica does not          significantly alter the RNARNA duplex structure This          strengthens the rationale for the duplex model          Figure shows a diagrammatic representation of the           Yersinia RNARNA duplex models          along with models of           E coli and           S marcescens duplexes Both           Yersinia structures conform to a          generalized           ompF mRNA UTR            micF RNA structural model but the           Yersinia species form additional          intra and inter molecular base pairings ie stem          loop a and stem  Figure  Compensatory base pair          changes in stem loop a add strong phylogenetic support          for the presence of this structure in           Yersinia species The question is          does this stem loop have a function in regulation of           ompF expression in           Yersinia  Mfold modeling does not          predict formation of thermodynamically stable stem loop a          or stem  structures in           E coli or           S marcescens RNARNA duplexes          However structure probe data of the           E coli micF RNA           ompF mRNA  UTR duplex do not          necessarily support or preclude WatsonCrick pairings          that can form stem  in           E coli              In           E coli  stem  of the RNARNA          duplex is formed from regions that are largely          singlestranded in free uncomplexed RNAs      but          a minor stem loop in           ompF  UTR and a thermodynamically          weak stem loop in           micF RNA unfold to form the RNARNA          interaction     In the           E coli RNARNA duplex structure          probe data show that intramolecular stem loop c in           ompF  UTR and stem loop b in           micF RNA the independent          terminator which are present in uncomplexed RNAs are          unaltered in the RNARNA duplex     Mfold analyses of                    Yersinia species duplexes also          predict that these stem loops are maintained in RNARNA          duplex structures Perhaps evolutionary pressure to          maintain the stability of these intramolecular stem          loops is greater than a progression to unfolding that may          create more sites for RNARNA interactions However we          cannot rule out a functional role for stem loops b and c          in           ompF mRNA inactivation eg          protein factor binding during           micF RNAinduced           ompF mRNA destabilization                            Conclusions and Future Prospects        With rapid sequencing of bacterial genomes it is a        challenge to annotate the thousands of genes and especially        determine gene start sites  ends of RNA transcripts In        this work BLAST searches using segments of genes such as        the         ompF  UTR sequence resulted in the        annotation of         Yersinia genes This was achieved in        part because the         ompF mRNA  UTR sequence has        functional domains which are involved in translational        regulation Use of signatures to annotate genomic sequences        has been widely reported before This includes        PRINTSBLOCKSPfam data bases       and CDART            In these examples protein coding regions are employed to        search for sequences that display similar domains        In this work sequence alignment programs have provided        putative start sites as well as definition of transcription        factor binding sites in the upstream regulatory region of         micF  Additionally with these        sequences new         Yersinia ompF mRNA  UTR         micF RNA duplex structures have been        proposed These add strong phylogenetic support for        previously determined duplex structures        The approach used here to locate genes may also be        useful in additional annotations For example a sequence        has been located in         Desufovibrio desulfuricans that        displays  similarity to a putative mRNA  UTR sequence        from         K pneumoniae unpublished data        This is of particular of interest since         Desufovibrio desulfuricans is        phylogenetically in the subdivision of the proteobacteria                    E coli          K pneumoniae          S marcescens  and         Yersinia species  are part of the        proteobacteria         micF genes in distantly related        bacteria have not yet been found due to evolutionary        divergence of         micF          ompC mRNA  UTR and the upstream        sequences in spite of the presence of conserved elements        such as the invariant  nt at the  end of         micF and conserved putative        transcription factor binding sites in currently analyzed        organisms However a combination of sequence and secondary        structure motifs     will be utilized in future        studies for additional searches for         micF                     Methods        BLAST searches were performed to find         micF and target         ompF genes as well as         ompC in genomic sequences available        on GenBank sites of the National Center for Biotechnology        Information httpwwwncbinlmnihgov Genomic data were        scanned by alignment methods in GenBank To search for        particular genes a highly conserved gene was first located        and then alignment methods were used to locate the desire        gene in adjacent sequences mRNA signatures such as AUG        start the ShineDalgarno SD ribosome binding site and        other signatures were also used as a guide Where there        were questions of sequence errors in genes analyzed these        sequences were not used BLAST searches for sequences        homologous to         micF and         ompF also included sequences in         Haemophilus influenzae          Klebsiella pneumoniae Pasteurella        multocida          Desulfovibrio desulfricans  and         Schwanella oneidensis as well as        those from         Yersinia species        BLAST sequence similarity search programs also provided        in GenBank were used     Microbial genome searches        with BLASTN  and  using expect values of         with the Advanced BLAST program was used to find         micF and associated genes sequences        in         Yersinia species ref NC         Yersinia pestis strain CO complete        genome and gnlSANGER         Yersinia enterocolitica          Yersinia species         ompF and         ompC genes were located by BLAST        searches with         ompF or         ompC mRNA  UTR sequences        The  start sites of         micF and         ompF and         ompC UTRs were predicted by        nucleotide sequence alignment and similarity MegAlign        alignment programs were from DNASTAR Inc        httpwwwdnastarcom Parameters used were either that        of J Hein

sequences        When an alignment showed obvious discrepancies such a lack        of alignment of stretches of near perfect identity it was        discarded        Standard default parameters with
