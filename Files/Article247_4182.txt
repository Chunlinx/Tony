                                 The Beginning of Wisdom Is Disaggregation                        Dear David            Many questions Many methodological difficulties How can I sort theseout The old method in cheder  is to tell a drusha  to tell astory In my old age I regress to the methods of my youth            In  William Fielding Ogburn the leading sociologist of social changewrote a sober book The Social Effects of Aviation  in which he soughtto trace out the possible impact of airplanes for the remainder of the centuryHe looked to see how aviation might affect our lives in  different areassuch as population family cities religion health environment recreationcrime education marketing agriculture public administration internationalrelationsyou name it Quite an exhaustive list for effects from a singlecause            Ogburn began with population since those changes affect almost all thephenomena of social life and went on to say  Aviation will probably havethe effect of reducing the number of births slightly One rubs ones eyes inslight astonishment            Ogburn was reasoning from the economists model of the introduction of theautomobile since families postponed the expense of  rearing a child inorder to own an automobile  In a similar manner some families will besmaller than would otherwise be because of the expense of owning and operatingan aircraft            What What What as George III would say Yes at that time thegovernment had made that assumption Eugene Vidal the undersecretary ofcommerce and father of Gore Vidal had said that with the development ofhelicopters about  families out of  million in the United Stateswould have private airplanes the reason being that these were the ones withincomes of more than  a year A lot of people today fly a privateplaneI do not know the number But the initial assumption was flat wrong            A number of years ago Dennis Gabor won the Nobel Prize for inventing thehologram Many people thought that this would transform our lives Fifteenyears ago ATT predicted that we would all have picture phones in ourhouses What What What I do not mean to jeer but the point is thatbeginning with Future Schlock endorsed by Richard Nixon and later byNewt Gingrich every technological change is hailed with a whiz boom bangetc            You use the phrase the rate of technological change The only trouble isthat we do not know how to measure it Technology is a large globule of manydiverse components Rate is a metric but what is it Economists measuretechnology as part of total factor productivity but usually as a residualafter all the other factors capital labor have been measured Not veryglamorous And of limited use since it does not deal with institutional andorganizational changes            Some technologies can be predictedsome forecasters define it asenvelope curve projectionsif you can define the narrow parameters and thephysical constraints of particular items such as Moores Law on computerchipspeeds and size or more broadly the change from a propeller drive plane to ajet enginebut there the upper limits are  miles an hour for that isescape velocity and you are then not in cyberspace but real outer space            The beginning of wisdom I suppose is disaggregation and particularity andonce these have been carefully defined to begin to generalize throughtheory which brings me back to where I began yesterday            On primordial identities I dont believe in single identities butthere are root identities such as being a Basque a Catalan a Kurd oran Occitan especially when there is a need to assert such a root identityagainst a larger sometimes more smothering polity or culture But let mereserve that for another day            LoveDad
