                                 Has the Chinese Spy Story Fizzled                        For months there have been news stories suggesting that Wen HoLee a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico was a spy forChina Los Alamos the lab in which the first atomic bomb was developed in is still the main US center for nuclear weapon research anddevelopment There have been further suggestions that the Lee case exposes theClinton administration as cavalier about national securityor worse that ittraded national security for Chinese campaign contributions Recently thoughthere have been stories suggesting that Lee may not have been a spy after allWhat in brief is the state of play                         The investigation of Chinese espionage has actually been goingon for four years It is clearly established that China somehow obtained designspecifications for many of Americas nuclear warheads during the s andearly s But these secrets could have leaked from many places includingother government research labs and private defense contractors                         What is the evidence implicating Wen Ho Lee Mainly it seemshis apparent friendship with Chinese scientists He often attended scientificconferences in China and hosted Chinese counterparts on visits to Los AlamosHe was even once seen hugging one of them But these exchange visits andconferences were all part of his job as a US government employeeand indeedfriendship among Chinese and US scientists was part of their purpose Leealso downloaded secret files to an insecure computera clear violation of therules But there is no evidence the information ever went any further Lee sayshe was just making backup copies Other Los Alamos scientists have done thesame though on a smaller scale                         The thinness of the evidence against him has led some tosuggest that Lee who was born in Taiwan is being persecuted because of hisethnic heritage There is scant evidence for that too The FBI now concedesthat it is unlikely Lee will ever face charges of spying At most he may becharged with mishandling classified informationthe offense for which he losthis job in March However even this charge may never end up in court Lastweek former CIA Director John Deutch was stripped of his security clearancefor a similar offense but will not be prosecuted for his actions The FBIwould likely find it difficult to justify a different standard being applied toLee                         The Clinton administration is accused of compromising nationalsecurity by mishandling the investigation of Lee How Separate investigationslaunched by the Energy Department and the FBI in  were poorly coordinatedand Los Alamos officials did not act quickly on recommendations to improvesecurity and to revoke Lees access to sensitive information The president andCabinet officials were not fully informed of the security issues until late inthe investigation But there is no evidence of actual damage to nationalsecurity due to these lapses And there is no evidence tying any of this toClinton campaign contributions Experts agree that the most significantintelligence losses occurred in the swell before Lee was suspected of anywrongdoing and before Clinton was president                         Next question
