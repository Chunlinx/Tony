                 okay   so what is your opinion on on drug testing   well i can see it in certain cases where it might be uh somebodys in a position that uh perhaps a lot of lives are involved like maybe um pilots that um uh you you know fly jets and uh maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people i could certainly see it being done but in general um you know whether companies wanna do this and i know that companies do like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested i know a couple of corporations that are doing that um so you know they kind of have gotten into the idea that lets drug test them and lets put them through rehab but theres got to be like a limitation do we drug test everybody that comes in or do we kind of say well you can be drug tested and you look okay because you look this way youre youre very conservative and and theres just no way that we would think that you would use drugs but the guy that doesnt fit the stereotype of uh the conservative or whatever could be drug tested and uh you know whether legal rights and of that person i dont know theres certainly a lot of things to really consider uh when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless of course like i said they have a large responsibility over a mass of people uh thats about it   well yeah youre it its not just a companys youre talking about companys liability if if if uh if the company is liable for something that that a employee does while under the influence of   umhum umhum   of a drug you know then by all means they should have the right to to to   sure sure and i think thats what companies are doing uh more and more because there are products that are out there   to to minimize their liability and theres also the case about just uh um health health and welfare of the um employees   umhum   if a company has a healthy work force their insurance rates are low and not only are not only they low theres all sorts of a of a benefits   exactly sure sure   uh financial benefits associated with having you know having people file fewer claims being sick   sure exactly the only thing is   uh then theres theres theres the whole question that that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is gonna be more healthy i dont think anybody would argue with that   exactly exactly the only thing is uh the one issue that i would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive   right   if they have had like uh medications in the past lets say once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe um that week they take an Advil and the Advil will apparently come out positive as if they smoked marijuana   right   um and theres poppy seed type things i think everybodys aware of that but um wheres the line where you where you say to somebody im gonna drug test you tomorrow so please do not take these medications or wheres   well well the question   you know how can you how can you do it   right the question becomes what do you do about somebody who testses who test positive   exactly   thats thats where the real sticking point comes in its not i dont think theres any problem with testing people its what do you do with the information   umhum sure sure exactly and and the the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on lets say um youve taken medication of some sort even though they usually have you at the time list what medications youve taken uh lets say you do come out positive and youve taken Advil or any of the Ibuprofen products out there or youve had a cold and youve been on medication or whatever you come out positive is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well you know this is kind of iffy you know are they really on drugs or are they on thrugs you know what im saying where there might be in the back of the mind of the employer that this person   right   uh is on drugs or make up they may make up their mind that lets get rid of this employee you know what im saying   right well yeah i think clearly the person who is the line operator line manager of the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing that should go to an entirely different   umhum   um agency within the corporation um   exactly and its a they can that uh if it does come out positive the first time they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take you know what i mean it its kind of like uh i think most people are aware at least now common knowledge is that
