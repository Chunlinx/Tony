                                 Is Handwriting a Moral Issue                        Dear Peggy            I confess with embarrassment that I didnt do my homework that is I didntgo to the Cores Web site to see just how Bennetts lists are treated by theoriginator himself ED Hirsch I took Bennett at his word that his vast listsdid not mean that first graders were to make it all the way from Mesopotamia toancient Mexico to the American colonists but that they would study topicssuch as those By that I assumed he meant they would pick from among themAnd even Hirsch can be a little obscure on his Web site emphasizing that thelesson plans are not meant as recipesthough they certainly are presentedthat way I suppose I was misled by Bennetts own avowal that he did not havein mind a grand game of Trivial Pursuit And I was encouraged by the fewoccasions on which the authors elaborate and suggest projects such as analyzinga  newspaper report about the Yalta conference reading immigrant diariesstaging a reenactment of the surrender at Appomattox having a visitor come into talk about life in the Depression            All that sounded like plenty of pausing to do indepth interesting work Itsounded better than the fancy new textbook one of my kids used last year tostudy the Middle Ages which aspired to spend equal time on the nonWesternworldand so ended up spending much too little time on anything Similarly ithas struck me that my other child might benefit from more writing of paragraphsand less discussion of rubrics and hamburger model graphic organizers inher writing periods And some of the new new math in its handson emphasisdoes often seem to add up to busyworklots of cutting and pasting to takelast nights assignment even though the concept of square feet and yards hadsunk in after the first few snips I fear my reading of Bennetts lists wasclouded by a wishful vision of more purposefully directed but still active andinnovative learning Then again thats what makes books like thesebestsellers In a format as broad as this its possible to find some versionof what you want to find            But youre right my confusion and your criticism of Hirschs hectic pacepoint to the need for a serious discussion about a standardized curriculum andwhat it might look like which Bennett et al would prefer to avoid beingchampions of localism in education Hence their enthusiasm for reform bygrassroots parental agitation the problems of which you spelled out verywell And theres another one Even if constant parental lobbying at school andhounding at home could possibly be as conflictfree and effective as theysuggest what would the results look like It seems to me this is a recipe forwidening the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students Guess whichparents are going to be poking their noses into the classroom all the time tosay nothing of turning those garden chores into botany lessons The oneswhose kids hardly need a superdose of afterschool enrichment            As for character education Im all for it but not for preaching endlesslyabout it and calling it training as Bennett et al do in proudlyoldfashioned style I dont like values clarification any better in thetrendy therapeutic incarnation that also seems to be popular schoolwidediscussions of teasing one month being compassionate the next combattingmedia stereotypes the one after that As a contrived package of traditionalwholesomeness the more authoritarian values of respect order obedience andcleanliness can prove stultifying distracting Legible handwriting haspractical not moral virtue So can the progressive virtues of criticalthinking independence creativity and community solidarity when served up asthe only enlightened approach or as selfesteembuilding therapy            Religious schools have an easier job in this realm But Bennetts favoriteecumenical form of character instruction of course is moral stories AsBennett points out Herbert Kohl favors the same on the other side of thespectrum The problem both encounter in trying to script the lessons in toodidactic a wayrule out Babar as colonialist racist sexist Kohlrehabilitate Goody Two Shoes Bennettis that they often end up with dullerstories than children deserve tidily presented with trite interpretations Thehomiletic approach in my experience seems to work best in connection withsports where all the uplifting talktalent is what you have effort is whatyou give play by the rules practice makes perfect etcgoes along withreal action and often very obvious consequences For kids in school risingto academic challenges posed by admired teachers it seems to me offers thebest route to building the responsible committed attitude everybody hopes forin youthbetter surely than any special workshop is likely to People thinkthat making right choices is a consequence of having a strong wellintegratedpersonality Bruno Bettelheim once wrote Actually its the other wayaround it is making choicesright onesthat builds a strong personalitySchools should be one important place that children have the chance to makethose choices            Speaking of choices without launching into a debate on school choice Iwonder whether you see a growing gap between public and elite privateschoolsI dont mean in quality however one might define that but in thepedagogical culture that prevails Its a question raised by my ownobservations of pretty stark contrasts plenty of homework in the early primarygrades in public school vs next to none in private and by Bennetts book Isit increasingly a choice between backtobasics traditionalism in thetestconscious public school system and a considerably more progressive orconstructivist ethos in private schools Or am I making this up            Ann
