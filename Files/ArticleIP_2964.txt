                                 Lies the Doctor Told Us            We must live byfictionsnot just to find meaning in life but to make it bearable BrunoBettelheim once wrote That idea inspired his most famous book The Usesof                Enchantment  In it he celebrated the power of fairy talesto help children handle the inner conflicts that confront us all on the roadto achieving a unified personality Two biographies of Bettelheim have setout to prove that he practiced what he preached to a degree no one dreamedFirst Nina Sutton and now Richard Pollak expose the renowned psychoanalyst as acompulsive teller of tall tales about his own life            The taleof the untruthful therapist itself all but begs to be told as a didacticlegend and Sutton and Pollak have eagerly obliged Suttons version issympathetic In Bettelheim A Life and a Legacy  she follows aresourceful Hansel figure as he struggles to escape a dark Viennese forest andfind fame in America dropping little white pebbles along his path As Suttoncarefully gathers up the pebbles she explains how the trail of fabricationshelped Bettelheim along his arduous way Among the most important distortionsshe exposes are an invented psychology degree from the University of Viennapretended acquaintance with Freud guardianship of an autistic child whom hisfirst wife in fact tended unreliable accounts of his ordeals in Dachau andBuchenwald and exaggerated claims of success as a benevolent savior ofemotionally disturbed children at the Sonia Shankman Orthogenic School at theUniversity of Chicago None of these prevents Sutton from honoring Bettelheimas an unorthodox Freudian whose creative relationship to facts was inseparablefrom his intuitive genius and his great empathetic powers            Richard Pollaks tale is nastier more brutish andshorter He was inspired to write his book by troubled curiosity about hisbrothers experience under Bettelheims care at the Orthogenic School anexperience that came to an end when the boy died from a fall during summervacation Bettelheim claimed that it had been suicideWhat is it aboutthese Jewish mothers Mr Pollak he asked Pollak years laterand a cloudhung over the family thereafter Not surprisingly Pollak has a Big Bad Wolfhuffing and puffing from the moment The Creation of Dr B begins Pollakseizes on the same central fictions that Sutton does and itemizes every otherinaccuracy or hint of one that he is able to findand he certainly lookshard Dr Bs slapping punching beating and shaming of students receiveespecially thorough attention and Pollak even accuses him of sexually abusingseveral girls at the school Where the brutality was overt as it often wasthe evidence supports the charges but where Pollak relies on former studentsmemories of being fondled under the covers who knows what to thinkInterpretation is at a minimum throughout and Pollak soon reduces hisallpowerful beast to a broth of pernicious selfserving lies            BothSuttons and Pollaks Bettelheim allegoriesthe renegade from the narrowFreudian path and the total fraudhave obvious iconic appeal for ourpostpsychoanalytic era But both also miss his perplexing reality theambiguity of a man whose life and work refuse to add up to a simple objectlesson Again and again in his writings Bettelheim insisted that the dauntingtask of inner integration was a developmental ordeal that could be masteredwith great struggle and with the support of good stories Yet a unifiedpersonality whether admirable or despicable is precisely what eluded him Asfor his writings DW Winnicott once commented in some exasperation thatBettelheim is difficult to read simply because he says everything and there isnothing to be said that one could be certain has not been said by him            Bettelheims madeup stories seem moremysterious in their motivation than Pollak cares to acknowledge He believesthat each of Bettelheims enchantments had a selfaggrandizing public andprivate useas indeed many of them did But whats puzzling is how oftenBettelheims stories about his past and about the Orthogenic School look likesubtle acts of selfsabotage The wolf whom Pollak is so eager to cook had acurious way of landing himself in the soup            Thus forinstance Pollak views Bettelheims distorted Austrian credentials as amegalomaniacs forceful bid for authority in his new country But Bettelheimsbogus psychology degree neither did much to ingratiate him with the establishedpsychoanalytic community nor was it meant to secure him the Orthogenic Schooldirectorship which he at first refused And the dubious account given by thenewly arrived exprisoner about his concentrationcamp experiencesthe articlethat put him on the map in Americaenmeshed him in controversy andselfcontradiction            In Individual and Mass Behavior in Extreme Situationspublished in The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology in Bettelheim suggested that his fellow camp prisoners were soon reduced to typesof behavior which are characteristic of infancy or early youth playing intothe hands of the SS rather than standing up to them It was a sweepinggeneralization based on much less scientific observation than he claimed tohave done Pollak questions whether Bettelheim could have sampled as manyprisoners as he said he had and judges his anecdotes to be selective andwillfully misinterpreted Yet even before the factual distortions weresuggested Bettelheims argument was disconcerting on other grounds His grimmessage about a regressive human impulse to act childlike seemed to underminehis simultaneous call for resistanceespecially since he emphasized that anystruggle by the victims of the Nazis was pointless without outside help Asdebate about the Holocaust unfolded Bettelheims initial renown as a heroicwitness gave way to cloudier repute as a blamer of victims            WhenPollak turns to Bettelheims career at the Orthogenic School he indicts thepsychoanalyst for wholesale abuse of power and implies a facile symmetry Thiscamp victim identified with the aggressors and went on to become a Gestapofigure in his own wellbarricaded fortress Bettelheim had quite a differentparallel in mind which he outlined in Schizophrenia as a Reaction to ExtremeSituations  Severely disturbed children were like prisoners heproposed echoing his earlier article they were immured in mortal anxietyand overwhelmed by hostile circumstances above all by their rejecting mothersHe then assumed the mantle of the childrens savior In Love Is Not               Enough  Truants From Life  The EmptyFortress  and A Home for                the Heart  he painteda portrait of an intense therapeutic milieu in which superhumanly dedicatedcounselors used compassion and empathy to help such children rejoin the worldHe announced remarkable rates of success with autistic patients But as Pollakproves on the basis of school records reality didnt measure up There werefar fewer demonstrably autistic childrenor curesthan Bettelheimadvertised            Bettelheims penchant for heroic narrativecertainly did bolster his popular image though Pollak gives ample evidencethat his insistence on blaming mothers and claiming miracles also invitedskepticism from parents and psychiatrists As one of the counselors at theschool commented I felt like saying You dont have to exaggerate Dr B itwas dramatic enough  Inside the walls of the Orthogenic School the effectof Bettelheims mythomania was clearly destructive His fantasy of omnipotenceseems to have contributed to a loss of control The man who had been thecharismatically firm superego of the school as he called himself during itsearly years could beand often wasa brutal id by the end The outside worldgot a bewildering glimpse of the twosided Bettelheim too At the very momentThe Empty Fortress was clinching his reputation as a nonauthoritarianliberator of autistic childrenin other words during the Vietnam eraaranting Bettelheim seized the podium as an authoritarian castigator ofrebellious youth His fingerwagging surprised many especially his numerousleftleaning admirers in the academy            Bettelheim committed suicide in  evidently having found life unbearabledespite or because of his fictions But making sense of his active prolificcareer as a therapist and thinker was difficult as Winnicott pointed out evenbefore his career as a liar was uncovered Bettelheim was criticized forreductive psychoanalytic thinking and applauded for his resistance topsychoanalytic dogma He was accused of lacking a social psychology thatrecognized the powerful influence of the social environment in changing theindividual as Paul Marcus and Alan Rosenberg put it in an issue ofPsychoanalytic Review devoted to him and he was celebrated forintroducing just such a perspective He was attacked for being uniquelyunsystematic in his methods but he was praised for his oneofakind clinicalpowers He was hailed for his lifeaffirming approach to the traumas of the th century he was condemned and commended for his emphasis onmankinds destructive impulses In his insistent quest for meaning in lifeBettelheim was nearly impossible to pin down and the addition of so manyslippery stories certainly doesnt help            But one must read him because he can beexactly right or more nearly right than other writers Winnicott persistedand this lack of definitiveness seems fitting in summing up a man whose ownmost interesting verdicts resisted definitiveness about human dilemmasBettelheim had no overarching theory but he had an abiding preoccupationauthority and the ambivalence it inspires His humanistic intuitions about thedifficulties and possibilities inherent in therapists struggles with theirpatients parents struggles with their children a mass societys strugglewith its citizens and the selfs struggle with itself were perhaps notprofoundly original But they spoke to widespread social concerns and duringan era marked by its unthinking reliance on experts he made a point ofspeaking neither as an obfuscating specialist nor as a simplifying selfhelpguru Bettelheim believed grandiosely in being a guide but he hadfundamentally humble guidance to offer that in the end as in the beginningone of his favorite phrases one can hope to grow only by endeavoring to beones own guide He evidently found no wellmarked route to follow himself
