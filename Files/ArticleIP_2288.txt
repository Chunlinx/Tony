                                 Tax Evasion            Kickingoff the fall season of IRSbashing was a report on  Minutes lastmonth It featured the story of Johnnie Johnson a Galveston Texas insuranceexecutive who described his nightmarish battle with the agency in this way            Thisagent came in my office one morning  He said Mr Johnson you have torealize that the only good advertising the Internal Revenue Service gets iswhen they bring a big one down And your name is a household word to hundredsof people I said Do you mean to tell me you can take me to a court of lawand convict me of some wrongdoing on the basis of what you had He said NoI dont believe I can do that He said I can get your name in the paperThats what Im after            Now an IRS agent might have said these things but I doubtit Even powerdrunk bullies tend not to declare their own maliciousness Nordoes the victims account of his own actions ring true Why would a powerfulbusinessman succumb to extortion plead guilty to a criminal charge of taxevasion and pay a fine he did not owe Johnson also claims that he agreed toplead guilty on the condition that his identity be kept secret But criminalcharges cant be filed in secret And if the IRS told him it was onlyinterested in a big PR score why would it then make a promise ofconfidentiality and why would Johnson believe it On  Minutes however Johnsons version was presented as indisputable fact The reporterSteve Kroft stated that the IRS had declined requests for an interview            What Kroft did not explain isthat the IRS was not allowed to respond To do so the agency would need awaiver from Johnson giving it permission to discuss his case According to aproducer CBS did not request a waiver Nor did  Minutes explain thatthe million judgment Johnson won against the IRSsubsequently reversed onappealwas based on the IRSs disclosure of confidential information withoutsuch a waiver The program deceptively implied that the judgment was based onwrongful prosecution I asked Johnsons lawyer whether his client would bewilling to grant a waiver so that I could hear the IRSs side of the story aswell No way the lawyer said            Thelopsided  Minutes report was but one episode in a widerangingsuspension of skepticism about IRS misdeeds The Senate Finance Committeewhich fed CBS its story followed with hearings that were more show trial thanoversight investigation Disgruntled current and former agents testifiedanonymously from behind a screen There was no real effort to ascertain theirmotives or the truth of the generalizations they offered Republican senatorsseeking a quick populist fix have spent the past several weeks vilifying theagency Congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration sensing apolitical hazard have piled on with their own expressions of outrage and callsfor reform But is the IRS really a rogue agency Consider the weakness of themain charges                            The IRS commonly abuses taxpayers Thefinance committee heard testimony from four victims These people were culledaccording to a spokeswoman from approximately  who have contacted thecommittee There is no way of knowing how many of them have legitimate gripesBut even if all  were genuine victims it would not remotely approach thekind of systematic sadism alleged by Finance Chairman William Roth Jr and hisfellow Republicans There are more than  million tax returns filed eachyear There are approximately  auditors and collection agents who auditabout  million of them Fifteen hundred abject failures would mean an errorrate of  percent And thats not even per yearits per ever            Its alsoworth noting that the bipartisan KerreyPortman IRS commission recentlyconcluded that there was no systematic abuse of taxpayers The agency spendssignificant resources educating personnel to treat taxpayers fairly and thecommission found very few examples of the IRS personnel abusing power thereport noted This statement was signed by Sen Charles Grassley RIowa amongothers In the hearings Grassley changed his tune It is the managementculture mindless of the fact that they are servants of the people he saidIf allowed to persist such a mindset often leads to arroganceunresponsiveness disregard of ones rights and the very kinds of things thatwe have been hearing from our constituents                            The IRS uses revenue quotas To the extent thishappened it happened in response to pressure from Congress In  Sen Rothwas one of the supporters of a statute that demanded performance measuresfrom all agencies of government In  the newly elected Republican Congresspassed a budget bill that included a compliance initiative authorizing thehiring of  new IRS agents The House Appropriations report stated TheIRS is further instructed to report back to the Committee  with data on a categorical accounting of revenue received as a result of theseinvestigations                            The IRS persecutes the poor One ofthe disguised IRS agents said on  Minutes that the agency focuses onthe poor and ignores wealthy people because those people can bring in anaccountant or a tax attorney and fight this system According to the IRSs ownstatistics there has been a sharp decline in audits of taxpayers with incomesof more than  from  percent in  to  percent in  Forthose earning less than  the figure rose from  percent to  percentover the same period Sounds ominous But this accusation contradicts theprevious onethat agents are trying to meet quotas If the IRS asNewsweek put it in a ridiculous cover story last week needs to feedthe insatiable demands of Washington for revenue and more efficiency it wouldbe crazy to look to the poor as cash cows            In factthere are more innocentand more plausibleexplanations for the changes inaudit rates The number of lowincome audits also nearly doubled after when the IRS began categorizing nonfilers about whom it lacked information inthe andunder category It jumped again after Congress demanded thatthe IRS prevent cheating on the Earned Income Tax Credit Only people who earnless than  qualify for the EITC The IRS also points out thatupperincome audits dropped in response to the closing down of tax shelters inthe  Tax Reform Act            Its pretty obvious what conservative politicians aretrying to do here develop a winning issue for the  election In one recentmemo the pollster Frank Luntz wrote Rather than investigating Bill Clintonwhich no one in America wants we should be focusing our attention on aGovernment agency that has a negative impact on our daytoday lives Considerthe benefit of public hearings that highlight Americans who have been victimsof the IRS Thats what theyve done Luntz is now advising Republicans todecry the IRS at every opportunity Voters may have come to doubt taxcutrhetoric but they still dont like the people who collect taxes            GOP leaders have been runningwith the theme If you file a paper tax return the odds are better than onein  that you will be told you are wrong when you are right Newt Gingrichwarned in a speech playing off the hearings This is of course nonsense Only percent of returns get audited at all Trent Lott recently called the agencyintrusive abusive and out of control Not a bad sound bite But the IRSisnt out of control Its critics are
