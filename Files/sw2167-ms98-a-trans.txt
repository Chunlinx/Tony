              oh mostly we watch college basketball   oh do you   yeah and uh you know were from uh originally from Louisville Kentucky and theyve got a fairly decent ball club down there   uhhuh yeah its been around for a long time hadnt it   uh as long as i can remember   yeah whos the coachs name   Denny Crum   yeah that sounds familiar   yeah Denny Crums pretty good   yeah   he uh i dont know hes got a million dollar contract when he quits   and with pro ball you mean   uh no with uh uh when he quits theyll give him a million dollars   who will the opponents   Denny Crum uh uh Louisville University       the university gives him a million dollars when he quits   well why that doesnt make sense does it   because because hes good and its giving him an incentitive to stay around and uh hes been there for something twenty something years   uhhuh   and uh i really dont know the uh full reason why theyre doing it but theyve got confidence in the man   yeah yeah well to me id want to quit     oh he gets too much he gets you know he   oh that just shows how much he gets paid anyway   yeah   huh   hes got a TV show down there and everything   really where are yall living now   in Denison   Denison   Texas   yeah do you ever watch the Mavericks   sometimes   yeah   not a lot uh i i dont really care for pro basketball i like college basketball and pro football   hm   but i do watch some uh pro football basketball mostly its uh i watch certain players   yeah like who   oh Magic Johnson uh   uhhuh   Larry Bird   yeah   uh Michael Jordan   yeah hes good too   and i can name a few more i just cant think of their names right off hand       uh   i used to watch basketball in fact of of the pro sports i guess its my favorite its just that i havent watched many sports this year or in the past several years   yeah well the uh NC double A tournaments going on right now and uh i havent watched it this year because Louisvilles out of it this year   how come   oh they just uh they had three tall guys who had uh didnt meet the requirements you know uh   the uh academic requirements uhhuh     yeah yeah academically they didnt meet the requirements so they couldnt play this year so four of them they had four people   huh   my husbands sitting here putting four fingers in my face  four uh       but they werent very good but they was uh   four out of five hurts   huh   four out of five hurt   yeah well i think they got i think that was almost everyone of them that he recruited uh recruited for this year   huh   he didnt and none of them got to play   yeah well no wonder theyre out of it   uh sorry   i said no wonder theyre out of it   yeah well they put up a good show they did pretty good for uh   yes   you know having all short people and uh we only had   uhhuh   one we only had one senior on the team   so theyll be back   so next year theyll be back and back with a vengeance   uhhuh well do you agree with that requirement that they meet those uh academic   in some states yeah because its reasonable now uh you know me with me being from Louisville im going to say at Louisville is unfair because Louisvilles got the highest uh uh the line the line the line drawn i dont know the correct word for it  but Louisvilles is higher than most other universities and   uhhuh well i didnt realize it could vary from state to state or university   yeah yeah they they vary from university not just state to state university   huh   if theyd been anywhere else i dont you know i dont care where it was anywhere in the United States they could have played but beings they was in Louisville they couldnt play   how does that coach feel about that   oh hes highly upset he uh went on uh he was on uh Twenty Twenty or Sixty Minutes i cant remember which one and got blasted uh you know they uh thats where it all came about because he said a few remarks of uh on that uh talk show or   uhhuh   news show and then they uh next thing you know well theyre in violation if they dont uh if they stop if they keep playing theyre in violation   hm   so but uh Denny Crum ran his mouth a little bit too much   him   on national TV   on national TV he messed up but uh   yeah its all politics   probably thats probably what it mostly is i i cant say say that for sure but you know uh right now though Kentuckys just now getting off of a uh their   yeah   suspension from playing on uh TV and then games   umhum   next year theyll be uh playing and i know Memphis State was even in a few of them where they got uh couldnt play   huh   in uh games and stuff because of uh    uh Dana Kirk that was their coach down there uh or over there uh he he was uh we was living in Memphis for a while thats why i know about Memphis State   uhhuh   uh he was selling soda machines at the uh selling like CocaCola had given him   uhhuh   uh for this little uh this little uh kids a a basketball camp thats what it is these little kids would come here and uh CocaCola had sponsored the uh sodas you know just give them to him told him to give them to the boys well he sold them for something like fifty seventy five cents to these boys when hes supposed to given them to them   uhhuh uhhuh oh for heavens sake what a cheapskate   and uh yeah he was a hes uh we call him Dana Jerk   yeah oh   yeah and he blames all of his uh tax problems on his elementary school wife   his elementary school wife   yeah yeah she she never even got out of elementary school   oh really   um   well she might have been the cause of it   well no he was just a jerk he put uh he put the blame on everyone but himself he went out and you know bought uh bought recruits   yeah yeah   no im sure you know thats one thing you dont do   uh yeah   he went out and did that and he got caught and then he got caught with the taxes and then he got caught with the sodas and that soda really went over on the people in Memphis they really got hot about that   yeah i can imagine especially the kids that were buying them   yeah these were young kids too they couldnt have been out of middle school   yeah huh well that almighty dollar   yeah well thats uh yeah ill agree there   umhum   more powerful than you think   yeah it is well i think we met our time limit   yeah i think guess we did too all right well well you have a good day   so uhhuh thank you very much byebye   byebye
