        what do you think uh are we spending the right amount of money on AIDS research     well uh actually im i kind of uh well thats like between saying yes and no it uh i think that were uh spending about what we should but im not exactly sure if were spending it in the right right uh uh location   yeah i i do believe that there  i im like you im a little mixed up on the subject i think there are more people who die of heart disease in a year in this country than there are of AIDS is that true have you heard that   yes   and and i suppose really AIDS is you die from any number of things isnt that true true   right   so so i would suspect that you know pneumonia i think is one of them and and the cancers and whatnot so i think indirectly there there is extra AIDS research being done   right um but i think that a lot of people have the attitude that the more money you throw at something the uh better chance you have at at curing it and thats just not true   no i dont think so i  i i totally agree its just like education throwing more money into a grade school isnt necessarily going to make things better   right i think uh you know that that money needs to be spent on on research   but i i think uh you know it should be a a wide spectrum research of research and not just uh you know research on a cure and not not on a research on how to uh prolong life or or uh make the disease any any less traumatic know i think money i think one once somebody has contracted the disease thats thats uh you know thats unfortunate but lets try to concentrate on on you know lets put resources on making sure nobody else gets it   yeah so i youre thinking in terms of of an education on how to prevent it or youre thinking of maybe uh i dont know a vaccine or   uh right right well i think uh you know theres theres my opinion is theres theres a there is a limited number of resources medical resources available   oh absolutely   and i think it is foolish to to uh spend most of those uh a a large majority of those resources on people who have AIDS uh simply because they they uh they need attention right away or or need more attention than somebody who has heart disease or or slow cancer or something i think i dont know i think uh too much money is being spent on on uh on sophisticated medical treatment for for people for people who need to be in a hospice program   yeah yeah well do you think that one reason maybe that the the funding level is as high as it is is because AIDS perhaps strikes uh a vocal group of people   yes well that i mean that fits the country we live in the people   i mean thats right tell me about it i was in i was on a down in downtown Washington Sunday when half a million people were demonstrating   it oh okay yeah the i mean the the people with the loudest group voice get the money its not necessarily the people who uh who deserve it the most     yeah well i i agree that theres a limited it its almost like we have fixed number of dollars that you can spend on medical research and you have to kind of allocate it in certain directions   right although that sounds heartless thats thats   but good things have come of that i mean polio is just about a thing of the past   right   and and other diseases um   well i know just something local to you i remember i used to live in Dallas and so i have friends there and i know for example uh Parkland Hospital is spending or at least was when i was there spending a large portion of their budget their budget on on on basically warehousing AIDS victims   uhhuh i suspect thats true   and yeah thats you know i i you know my heart goes out to those people who who have the disease but i dont think that we should be spending uh   you know that the that a majority of the hospitals resources should not go for for uh indigent  AIDS patients   thats right well certainly if you have AIDS unless youre incredibly wealthy youre going to end up indigent   right   i think that i mean that goes along with it too you get to the point where you cant work and
