          okay   have you ever uh organized a family reunion   uh no i never organized one but were we have one uh were going to have one on Memorial Day i guess theyve had one the last two years   uhhuh   we go out to the my dads farm and uh and you know it is just a picnic and spend the night   umhum   go fishing and stuff like that   how many people usually show up   oh about ten   oh it is not that big   huhuh   because   it   um weve had sort of weekends like that too but i never thought of it really as a reunion   umhum   i sort of think of a reunion with my uh all the extended family   everybody yeah   yeah that would be hard for us because most of the family is out in California and some is in New York and North Carolina and it gets   uhhuh   kind of hard to get everybody get everybody organized uh is there someone do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there or   uh yes yeah my my uh dad has a house out there anyway and there is there is uh he keep us uh food down there yearround so   umhum so he doesnt live there though   uh no its its its like a country country home   vacation home   umhum   yeah it sounds nice um are there kids that are there too or mostly adults   yeah the grandchildren   uhhuh   just a few it just depends uh uh uh all my grandparents are dead so uh there is there are not you know  none of them are there and and uh then an uncle is dead so   umhum   the the big family is a lot smaller that it used to be   umhum are you all located in Texas   uh yeah were in we are all uh like they live up in Sherman it is near Lake Texoma   umhum but   and uh all of his children live in the Dallas area too so   yeah do it that to me is you know Dallas i know of Houston i know of and that is about it   uhhuh   in Texas the rest of it is sort of a big void to me   yeah   but uh you know we have uh well we all got together it was about two years ago for i was id graduated from college and um i was going to live in France for a year and so my parents invited it wasnt just family it was friends too but um we all got together for just a party and that was kind of fun   uhhuh   nice to have everybody be together at once and things like that   French reunion   well   yeah   not quite French but uh it was sort of a reunion before leaving it was fun it was on um New Years Day so it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time   umhum   that was kind of fun but um who was it a friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago and you know everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend and it really sounded like it was fun but i am not quite sure what i would do i think itd be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace and have everybody meet someplace where they do not really know   umhum   and have different areas to explore and things like that so thatd be kind of fun   yeah meet in the middle   yep   umhum   where nobody lives   right   but at least that way it is at nobodys house so nobody one no one person is responsible for everything   yeah and they dont have to clean up afterwards yeah   yep thats for sure the cleaning up can be a mess   umhum   but um do you have horses or anything at your dads farm   im im sorry   does your does your dad have horses there   uh no he doesnt really have any any uh uh domestic livestock anyway   uhhuh   the he leased uh to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on   i see so its so he really does use it as a vacation home it is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that   yeah pretty much he has a garden and uh a lot of fruit trees and blueberry bushes and things   umhum well that sounds nice do people actually pick the fruit and things   umhum and then there is wild blackberries there too   umhum   so he gets   yeah i used we used to go pick wild blackberries at my friends property but we never got enough i used to make jam but i never had enough to really make you know more than a jar or something   huh   so it wasnt so worth it   yeah it is kind of theyre kind of off and on it seems like   umhum   depends on the rain   that sounds is does he have a lot of land to go walking around and things there   um it is uh it is uh eighty acres   well that is pretty big   uhhuh   i do not know how they do scale down there you know here it would be a huge amount of land   yeah yeah   yeah because the persons house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres as opposed to tens of acres   yeah and and uh and most of it you know you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it   umhum   and uh because thats where the ponds are and where everybody fishes   umhum   we kind of have a an infor mal contest my uncle uh put some bass in uh his pond a few years ago well he put some crappie too but the bass we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet so   uhhuh   theyre in there but theyre real spooky   yeah i think my dad put some we have a little pond at ours at his vacation ho me too and yeah i mean really little and they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in and there were too many little goldfish and so the big ones never got bigger   uhhuh oh yeah   and uh somebody suggested to get a bass   umhum   and so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again   never saw the bass   no so we do not know if it is living or   oh oh it is probably in there just burping goldfish   yep   yeah   we still have lots of little goldfish they propagate pretty well those little fish   yeah they really do   this yeah because we started we have got hundreds in there now and we started with i think ten or twenty little feeder fish that i picked up for a dollar you know many no matter how many it was for a dollar   umhum   and and some of them are probably eight inches long but he wants your really big ones you know the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long   oh yeah   and   they have theres a uh   it   you might put some like some yellow catfish in there i do not know if theyd live very well up in New York but they get huge and uh they routinely use them for bait for uh goldfish for bait for yellow catfish   oh okay well we wed want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys the goldfish too  but yeah we could see i do not know if yellow catfish live up this way but catfish do i think   umhum yeah they live in the Mississippi River all the way through Minnesota and up into Canada   umhum so that you mean well we could try it that is a good idea   umhum   hes he was trying to catch them you know using little uh i forget theres little uh nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that minnow nets or something my father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish and it was really funny because uh   umhum uh   one time he left the net in the pond and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish   uhhuh   and uh he left it in the middle of the pond and that night he came out and the trap was gone and it was a raccoon that had taken it     right   so it was really funny and you could see that you know you could see where the trap the trap was dragged and things like that   umhum   and so   yeah thats what happens   but do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there   yeah  and uh we feed the catfish they feed the catfish like uh   uh   every couple of weeks and uh and sometimes thats the best time to catch them   when theyre feeding   yeah because theyll just they will just come after anything then   uhhuh   and you could catch a couple anyway during that time   what do you feed them   uh mixed Purina uh it is uh cat food uh catfish food   really   yeah but   i mean its especially made for catfish   yeah well i do not know how much different it is from dog food but you know its um it looks like Purina High Pro   uhhuh thats funny   but they come up to the top and it is the best time to take pictures because they come up to the top and you can see their whiskers come through the water and   umhum   and theyre the catfish the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water   uhhuh i have never seen catfish you know except in filleted  filleted on a plate i think maybe i think i have seen once or twice in like the museum   umhum   but ive never seen them just alive someplace that would be fun to see   well they are really funny fish when you catch them they make a kind of a a burping growling sound at you   umhum uhhuh   and they try to hit you with their tails   how big do they get   oh well the channel catfish get up to uh i think the world record is fifty something pounds   okay but how long in feet   um that that is only about three and a half feet long   do you know thats pretty big though   yeah they get real fat   yeah uhhuh   um from the time they they stay slender until they get to be uh eighteen inches long and then they start to widen out   umhum   uh my daughter we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing and i think that was when she was three and she caught a catfish by accident she was fishing for sunfish and she said here and she handed me her rod and reel   uhhuh   and and uh you know it it was just pulling drag out   umhum   and it swimmed wherever it wanted to   yeah that sounds amazing ill have to see them sometime but all righty   okay it was nice talking to you   nice talking to you too uh enjoy your uh weekend   okay byebye yeah have a nice Memorial weekend   okay you too byebye
