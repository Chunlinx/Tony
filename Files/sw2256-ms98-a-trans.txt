          um i think uh i like to listen to a program called Focus on the Family with Doctor James Dodson   uhhuh okay   and from what i understand its its a new thing good about families these days um especially spending time with one another i know if if i were to have children i would have trouble   yeah   because i work and uh i have my dogs and i have a hard enough time spending time with them you know     yeah i im im pretty busy myself im in graduate school at  State and i   uhhuh   i cant see even having time for a pet let alone children   yeah really   but um   theres a lot of single parents too that are trying   yeah i think day care seems to be uh   yeah   a real big issue   yeah and uh im not sure or i just wonder when well know what the effects of day care   yeah well actually theres been some studies that say it has some positive effects that the students the the kids get you know exposure to other kids their age at an earlier time   yeah   so they tend to be more cooperative with their peer group although they dont have real good uh role models   yeah ive heard that they they call them uh that they say that theyre more um creative that theyre really just more rebellious   umhum   from the day care   yeah   because uh the people dont have the time to give that oneonone attention   yeah   and and i just wonder if maybe day uh the home schooling is going to come into more and more uh homes   i can i can see that happening   yeah because really if you have a good curriculum   yeah   do you really need to have that certification   yeah   of a teacher i taught i taught school for a year and it was like whoops you know its not for me   no   because i i just dont have that discipline with children that uh you need for them to learn   right umhum   and uh i one day i was i like found myself uh telling them to write their spelling words a hundred times each and i just heard this comedian say that  you know something that thats how you know youre a bad teacher            um   and i was doing it just keep them occupied   yeah i think another problem with the families uh is is the role of television   yeah   um i dont know it seems theyre using it as a babysitter instead of a learning tool that really that really annoys me because i think i dont know i think my parents probably did that to me a little bit   yeah   um   using it as a baby a babysitter   yeah its just go watch TV you know leave us alone   yeah will numb you out   which   well ive ive heard some uh theres a book out now called The Saturday Morning Mind Control   umhum   and uh he raises some serious questions about why do they have these really a lot of money goes into the advertising for childrens programs   oh yeah   and yet uh children cant buy uh whats the deal   yeah but they can they can whine and squeal and complain   right   im watching Ninja Turtles     i know it   yeah   and boy the price of toys these days is ridiculous   yeah i could be   and they all have to have the same one you know       i can see having kids and not letting them watch TV and making them toys out of wood   say oh yeah     here kid this is this is all youre getting     i wonder how long that last   well i i used to babysit for this family that didnt have a TV and their their kids turned out fine   they didnt have a TV at all   they they had no TV   were they Pentecostal     no i mean they had a nice stereo they listen to stereo they were into Michael Jackson   yeah they just yeah   they just didnt watch him on TV   yeah   which i thought was pretty neat   yeah it is its very good i think TV has really had some bad effects on all of us   especially the the violence on it   ive yeah yeah and you cant control it you you know its the cable channels sometimes you can but   yeah   boy the cable TV theyll just show anything   yeah   and thats coming right into your homes   yeah   i think TV can be good if if the family watches it together on theyre watching good shows   uhhuh yeah   PBS or whatever i mean even some regular network TV is okay if the parents there and you know helps the students or help the the kids understand that yeah this that happened in the TV show but probably doesnt happen in real life   yeah yeah and theres a lot greater instance of uh children committing murders too isnt there   yeah   killing their parents and so forth they dont they see these things happening with no consequences   huh   you know   yeah you see it on TV The guy gets up and lives afterwards   yeah yeah like Double O Seven hes supposed to do it   yeah   and its okay   yeah   so i   you going to have kids in the future   huh   you going to have kids in the future   no huhuh because im like forty three   okay   and so its uh its too late   yeah   you know i wonder sometimes wonder if ill ever if i will regret it when im old but uh i just cant see myself as a parent   uhhuh yeah   you know its   im still pretty young im twenty five but i dont know i dont see it for for at least a few years   really are you married   no im single right now and im you know sorting things out which way im going to go with my life before i   yeah   have kids you know career to to much into my career you know   yeah well i wish you the best   okay well its good talking to you   its good talking to you byebye   all right byebye
