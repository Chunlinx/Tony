                    Background        Cellular events are based on specific inter and        intramolecular interactions of many molecules To        experimentally dissect such interactions it is important        to maintain as closely as possible the cytosolic        environment of the living cell Detergents are frequently        employed to disrupt cells for the demonstration and        isolation of functionally relevant protein complexes andor        to selectively extract certain proteins For example the        nonionic detergents Triton X Tween  or Brij have        been widely used for histochemical purposes or in        biochemical experiments to separate detergentsoluble from        a detergentresistant residue     The latter is        commonly referred to as the cytoskeleton or membrane        skeleton   During cell activation discrete signaling        molecules are known to associate with or to disassociate        from the plasma membrane and both the cytoskeleton and        membrane skeleton undergoes significant changes as well             For cytochemical purposes however detergents        cannot be used before cells have been fixed as nonionic        detergent treatment causes removal of the cells from their        supporting surface eg cover glass The choice of        fixative for a particular cytochemical study is often a        difficult task owing to the limited available information        about the effects of fixatives on cultured cells        Considering their effect on proteins fixatives in        general can be divided into two types coagulant or        noncoagulant Both groups of fixatives have advantages        and disadvantages The coagulant fixatives including        methanol    ethanol   acetone   and        trichloroacetic acid    denature and precipitate        proteins These fixatives stop biological reactions        instantaneously and presumably leave proteins in their        original locations Due to extraction of membrane        structures by such fixatives it is not necessary to add        detergents during staining with membrane impermeable probes        such as antibodies However the denaturation of proteins        seen with these fixatives has disadvantages for some probes           and for visualizing intact cell surfaces        Moreover it is not known if and to what extent proteins        are lost during specimen preparation for microscopic        observation eg during incubation or washing procedures        The noncoagulant fixatives are mainly chemical        crosslinkers that include glutaraldehyde formaldehyde        acrolein and dithiobis succinimidylpropionate They are        used to preserve surface morphology of cells and to        immobilize cellular components before extraction with        detergents     However excess crosslinking        frequently masks binding domains for probes while        inadequate fixation may not preserve structures to leave        them susceptible to mechanical forces during specimen        processing The latter is quite critical especially to        preserve fine and fragile cellular microextensions such as        filopodia or retraction fibers           We have been interested in the formation and function of        microextensions because of their dynamic and universal        nature and since moesin an actinbinding protein is        enriched in these structures    The Factinbinding        activity of moesin is regulated by both phosphorylation and        polyphosphoinositides PIPs  Interestingly PIPs could        be substituted for by a cationic detergent        dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride DOTMAC         in vitro   This result was        consistent with biochemical extraction studies since        phosphorylated moesin specifically cosedimented with        DOTMAC but not Triton Xresistant components most        likely because Triton X interfered with the interaction        between moesin and PIPs   This result also suggested        that Triton X extraction of cells may not preserve        moesinactin filament complexes        As expected we show here that some of microextensions        were fragmented by the standard Triton X        permeabilization method By contrast DOTMAC completely        extracted membrane lipids while maintaining the        cytoskeleton of microextensions        We also observed microextensions having a considerably        smaller diameter from those commonly seen  m vs          m Referred to here as ultramicroextensions these        extended from cell bodies and grew out from the tips of        other microextensions DOTMAC treatment exposed and        stabilized their cytoskeleton as well                    Results                  Examination of microextensions of NIHT fibroblast          by scanning electron microscopy          We used NIHT cells because their morphology and          localization of cytoskeletal proteins including actin          tubulin vinculin and moesin have been extensively          investigated using various fixatives When removed from          stock cultures with trypsin and inoculated into          coverslipcontaining dishes NIHT cells readily          attached to the serumcoated substrate began to spread          and flattened within one hour data not shown          Consistent with the report by Rajaraman et al  on          human diploid WI cells and AlbrechtBuehler and          Goldman   on T fibroblasts microextensions          appeared within  min after seeding Initially during          spreading the cells lost microvilli from their upper          cell surface and formed microextensions with a diameter          of about  m and a maximal length of about  m          Subsequently the cells continued to spread and to          randomly elongate microextensions up to  m However          closer examination of the fixed cells with a  tilt          angle showed numerous additional protrusions extending          from the cell body with a diameter of only about  m          Figure  These structures were not observed in cells          prior to  hours after inoculation At  hour about            of the cells had extended such structures that          usually were   m in length and rarely exceeded           m Because of these unique features we will use the          term ultramicroextensions Three days after reaching          confluency at about one week in culture about half of          the surface of the cells was covered with          ultramicroextensions Figure  DEF When cells were          inoculated at high density ultramicroextensions appeared          earlier but ultramicroextensions were rarely seen even          after incubation for prolonged periods in sparse cultures          or when the cells did not make contact data not shown          Ultramicroextensions originated either from          microextensions of neighboring cells or from tips of          other microextensions in a broomlike fashion Figure          G Ultramicroextensions also originated from the cell          surface similar to microvilli Figure H or as branches          from other microextensions and ultramicroextensions          Figure I Identical results were obtained when the          cells were grown on polyLlysinecoated coverslips data          not shown                          Exposure of cytoskeleton in microextensions and          ultramicroextensions by DOTMAC extraction          Fixation with formaldehyde followed by extraction with          Triton X is a fairly standard method for          immunofluorescence microscopy of cells but          microextensions were fragmented and sometimes even lost          during this treatment as shown in Figure  ABC an          alternative method we extracted cells also with DOTMAC          and discovered that fixation and extraction with            PFA  DOTMAC in PBS on ice for  min followed by          fixation with  PFA in PBS on ice for  min          DOTMACPFA method preserved not only micropodia white          arrow Figure  Eand F but also microvilli black          arrow Figure Eand F and ultramicroextensions white          arrowhead Figure F This treatment extracted lipids          data not shown and exposed cytoplasmic filaments giving          origin to ultramicroextensions Figure F At the cell          edge the ultramicroextensions are derived from a deeper          cytoskeletal meshwork white arrowhead Figure F rather          than from thick cytoskeletal filaments          We have performed ultrastructural analysis by SEM of          cells fixed andor extracted by the methods listed in          Table  When the cells were treated with coagulant          fixatives the cytoskeleton was apparently exposed but          the three dimensional structures at the edge of the cells          were not preserved as well as those prepared by the          DOTMACPFA method data not shown When the cells were          extracted with Triton X NP or saponin after          relatively weak fixation with formaldehyde the          cytoskeleton apparently was lost fragmented or scraped          off depending on the concentration of detergents and the          period of incubation Table  Too high a concentration          of glutaraldehyde or incubation for extended period of          time in formaldehyde on the other hand did not allow to          expose the cytoskeleton data not shown                          Comparison of different fixationextraction methods          for preservation and fluorescence labeling of          microextensions          We also compared the different fixation and extraction          procedures listed in Table  with respect to fluorescence          intensity and labeling of actin stress fibers and          microtubules and with respect to morphological          preservation of cells and microextensions Table  The          latter was also assessed from SEM micrographs before and          after preparation for fluorescence microscopy and these          results are summarized in Table  as well          Staining of actin and tubulin filaments differed          depending on the probe and on the fixative Among the          coagulant fixatives acetone produced the best results          with respect to preservation of microextensions staining          of actin with either phalloidin or with monoclonal          actin antibodies and staining of microtubules with a          monoclonal antitubulin reagent After methanol or          ethanol fixation some cells were partially detached and          changed their shape but this did not occur with other          coagulant fixatives Acetone also provided good          preservation of microextensions even after preparing the          cells for immunolabeling whereas some of the          microextensions were lost when cells were fixed with          other coagulant fixatives Table           Fixation with chemical crosslinkers followed by          extraction with detergents or organic solvents are          standard procedures for preparing cells for          immunofluorescence First we investigated effects on the          preservation of microextensions by variations in          detergent concentration and time of incubation with          formaldehyde As summarized in Table  with shorter time          periods of fixation and with higher detergent          concentrations more cells lost microextensions For          example when cells were fixed with  FA for  min          and extracted with  TX for  min Table  stress          fibers were stained well with phalloidin but          microextensions were lost Figure Aand B The SEM          observation before and after preparation for fluorescence          microscopy washing and incubation with probes indicated          that microextensions were lost during these steps of the          procedure On the other hand microextensions of cells          prefixed with glutaraldehyde or DSP prior to extraction          were very well preserved indeed Figure Eand I          However the cytoskeleton of glutaraldehydefixed cells          could not be exposed by the detergent and some structures          apparently were lost in DSPTsbfixed cells when analysed          by SEM data not shown Quick extraction with           Triton X in MTSB  seconds  times followed by          fixation with  glutaraldehyde also preserved          microextensions well indicating that fragmentation or          removal of microextensions by extraction with  Triton          X does not occur within  min The DOTMACPFA method          provided excellent morphological preservation and          immunolabeling with high fluorescence intensity of actin          stress fibers and microextensions Figure Qand S          Although phalloidin staining and immunolabeling of          tubulin were poor in cells prepared by the DOTMACPFA          method Figure Rand T this method provided the widest          spectrum of reactivity with the probes investigated here          Figure and Table  The monoclonal antibody reagent          specific for actin worked only in TCA or          DOTMACPFAtreated cells Figure Oand S          Next we compared the staining patterns of two          wellcharacterized cytoskeletal proteins vinculin and          moesin in cells prepared by DOTMACPFA and other          conventional fixation methods Figure  As expected          vinculin localized at focal contacts in cells prepared by          either PFATriton X or by DOTMACPFA Figure  B J          and M Moesin staining on the other hand was          primarily at the edge of cells and in microextensions          when cells were fixed with TCA or DOTMACPFA Figure          Gand K DOTMACPFA was superior to TCA and the          standard Triton X permeabilization procedure to          preserve microextensions and for moesin staining Figure           G K and NOP          TCA fixation was reported recently to be useful for          staining of phosphorylated moesin   Therefore we          tested our antiphosphomoesin antibodies with this          method and as shown in Figure H the fluorescence          intensity was too low to distinguish characteristic          structures probably because the amount of phosphorylated          moesin is low in unstimulated NIHT cells cf Figure           Figure demonstrates another example of NIHT cells          stained with actin monoclonal and moesin polyclonal          antibodies after DOTMACPFA fixation Many branched          microextensions were doublestained with these          antibodies but occasionally part of a microextension or          an entire microextension apparently lacked actin                                      Evaluation of crosslinked polypeptides after          fixation and extraction          Our results suggested that some of procedures listed          in Table  were inadequate for preserving fine structural          details Therefore we reevaluated the extent of          crosslinking of polypeptides by gel electrophoresis and          western blotting The polypeptide banding patterns of          extracts from unfixed and fixed cells with SDS sample          buffer are shown in Figure  Incubation in  Triton          X in PBS detached cells from the dish Figure A          lane  but addition of  mM magnesium and  mM calcium          ions in PBS prevented detachment to some extent Figure          A lane  Microtubule stabilizing buffer also          prevented detachment Figure A lane  On the other          hand most polypeptides were retained on the dish after          DOTMAC treatment Figure A lane  Although most of          actin was retained after  detergent extraction          moesin was not unless  paraformaldehyde was added          Figure A lanes  and  Under these conditions          moesin and actin migrated predominantly as monomeric          polypeptides at  and  kDa positions on the SDSPAGE          gels and only very small amounts of crosslinked moesin          and actin were detected by western blotting at higher          molecular weight positions data not shown          Crosslinking of polypeptides was also evaluated after          treatment with several other fixatives that preserved          microextensions well and that were found to be useful          previously for moesin staining Figure B Only a small          amount of polypeptides was extracted when cells were          fixed with glutaraldehyde or DSPTsb Figure B lane            and  and the cells were morphologically well          preserved by these fixatives as observed by SEM          indicating that most proteins were irreversibly          crosslinked On the other hand when cells were fixed          with PLP or LP and treated with  saponin in  BSA for          permeabilization most of the polypeptides were either          not crosslinked by these relatively mild fixatives or          crosslinks were reversed by the addition of SDS sample          buffer Figure B lanes  and  Similar results were          obtained when cells were fixed with  formalin or           PFA followed by permeabilization with  Triton X          Threoninephosphomoesin was not dephosphorylated in          these fixatives as determined by western blotting with          specific phosphomoesin antibodies Figure B We          examined the effect of incubation time and temperature          during fixation with  PFA in PBS since conditions          for irreversible crosslinking of polypeptides in cultured          cells with formaldehyde are unknown As shown in Figure          C fixation under the widely used conditions at room          temperature C for  min is not sufficient to          irreversibly crosslink actin moesin and many other          polypeptides At C the required time for incubation          can be shortened but most of the actin molecules were          not irreversibly crosslinked even after  min          Incubation with sodium borohydride after fixation in PFA          had no effect either data not shown suggesting that          reversible bridges may have formed that could not be          reduced                          Biochemical analysis of DOTMACinsoluble materials          of NIHT cells          NIHT cells suspended in PBS were treated with  M          staurosporine  M calyculin A or  M pervanadate and          fractionated with  Triton X or DOTMAC Similar to          results in platelets   the polypeptide patterns on          SDSPAGE gels differed for DOTMAC and Triton          Xextracted cells and more polypeptides were          recovered in the DOTMAC as compared to the Triton          Xinsoluble fraction Figure  Many signaling          molecules are known to be sequestered into the Triton          Xinsoluble fraction during activation andor          aggregation of human platelets and cytoskeletal          association has been inferred from this result While          this may be true for some proteins the postulated          cytoskeletal association of threoninephosphorylated          moesin was maintained only when platelets were extracted          with DOTMAC but not with Triton X   By          contrast phosphorylated moesin was found in the          insoluble material of NIHT cells after extraction with          both types of detergent Figure  When extracted with           detergent a larger amount of insoluble          phosphomoesin was detected with Triton X as compared          to DOTMAC Different concentrations of detergents            and  were tested and correlated with the amount of          moesin released from NIHT cells but the insoluble          fraction of moesin was always higher with Triton X          than with DOTMAC data not shown          We also analysed for tyrosinephosphorylated proteins          in the insoluble fraction of cells treated with          pervanadate PV a potent inhibitor of tyrosine          phosphatases extracted with  detergent A larger          fraction of tyrosinephosphorylated proteins were          recovered in the DOTMACinsoluble pellet unpublished          observation                          DOTMAC induces bundling of actin filaments and          microtubules          The excellent preservation of the cytoskeleton in          microextensions of cells fixed with PFADOTMAC could be          due to stabilization of the cytoskeleton in general or of          actin filaments selectively We therefore explored          whether DOTMAC has a direct effect in vitro on actin          filaments prepared from purified actin As shown in          Figure  actin filaments bundled in the presence of          DOTMAC Figure B suggesting that this might contribute          to the greater stability of the actin cytoskeleton that          we have observed in cells extracted with this detergent          This effect is relatively specific since DOTMAC disrupted          microtubules and they appeared as amorphous filaments          Figure D                            Discussion                  Detection and definition of micropodia and          ultramicroextensions          Extensions of the cell surface were first described as          fibrous projections of tissue culture cells by electron          microscopy in    Since then the terminology has          varied in the literature and extensions have been          designated as pseudopodia   microextensions            retraction fibers   microspikes   filopodia              often without a clear definition of these          terms Microvilli are light microscopically distinct from          filopodia and retraction fibers   Filopodia or          microspikes extend actively from the cell surface          whereas retraction fibers are extensions that have been          left behind by a retracting lamellipodium or that are          derived from an attached filopodium We use the term          micropodia here for morphologically describing          filopodia microspikes and retraction fibers and to          differentiate these structures from lamellipodia While          the transiently occurring filopodia and retraction fibers          can largely be distinguished only by timelapse video          microscopy   both micropodia and lamellipodia are          functionally related to movement of cells Micropodia          were reported to have diameters of about  m   or            m   and lengths ranging from  to  m            On the other hand microvilli are more permanent          discrete cylindrical projections about  m in diameter          and up to  m in length   that may serve different          purposes such as in brushborder membranes of the          intestinal epithelium or in lymphocytes Numerous slender          extensions running in parallel were observed previously          when rat epithelial parenchymal cells adhere to each          other   Similar structures also occur in primary          keratinocytes mediating intercellular adhesion            However these extensions appeared to be thicker          estimated as m in diameter although their apparent          diameter depended on conditions of coating with          metals          Our experiments were focused on the analysis of          microextensions and their cytoskeletal core by SEM and          confocal laser scanning microscopy by searching for a new          fixation protocol Here we clearly show that NIHT          cells not only extend microextensions of   m in          diameter and of up to   m in length but also slender          structures of less than  m diameter The latter were          previously described in the tumor cell lines KA          BalbT clone A transformed by murine sarcoma virus            and in A a malignant human lung melanoma line            In KA cells membranous strands with diameters          of less than  m extended away from and between cells          over distances of  m In A cells filopodia          had diameters of  m or less and were often branched          However details of these structures were not given and          not further discussed In the literature terms such as          slender filopodia    or slender microvilli             have been used All filopodia and microvilli are          morphologically slender and these descriptive terms in          general have not been used to refer to microextensions          having a particular dimension In order to distinguish          them from others and to avoid confusion we propose the          term ultramicroextensions for discrete cellular          extensions that are less than  m in diameter          Ultramicroextensions extend like micropodia from the cell          surface from the tips of micropodia from microvilli or          they branch out from micropodia or other          ultramicroextensions We strongly believe that these are          unique structures and not artificially created by our          sample preparation technique First unless cells          contacted each other they were rarely seen even after          incubation for prolonged periods suggesting that they          are not simply created by the collapse of parts of the          cell Secondly their shape is rather similar to the          generally larger microspikes or microvilli Future work          might show that they can be detected by differential          interferencecontrast microscopy and electronic image          processing or other techniques which would greatly          facilitate functional studies Ultramicroextensions may          be difficult to distinguish by immunofluorescence          microscopy from micropodia that also appear as small          fluorescent dots on the cell body or they may remain          undetected due to low fluorescence signal owing to their          small size The filopodia of spreading T cells were          extensively studied by AlbrechtBuehler et al              but ultramicroextensions were not described          presumably because these studies were carried out during          early spreading of T cells Cells that do not touch          other cells rarely display ultramicroextensions even          after long periods of incubation Ultramicroextensions          were quite frequent between cells and on the surface of          cells grown at confluency This suggests that their          formation is triggered by contact with other cells and          that they are not primarily related to cell movement                          Preservation and exposure of cytoskeleton in          microextensions and ultramicroextensions          We have successfully exposed the cytoskeleton of          microextensions and ultramicroextensions using a newly          developed fixative that contains DOTMAC In order to          study the structure of the cytoskeletal network it is          necessary to extract cells with a detergent to expose          cytoskeletal filaments for electron microscopic imaging          Several detergents were tested for their effects on          cytoskeletal structures by Schliwa et al   but the          cationic detergent DOTMAC was not included In addition          past studies on the cytoskeleton of detergentextracted          cells have mainly focused on the cell body and subcortex             but not on microextensions Although extraction          can be done before during or after fixation we used          simultaneous extraction and fixation because i          cytoskeletal molecules may be rearranged or altered          during fixation as irreversible crosslinking of          polypeptides is not complete even after  min incubation          with  PFA at C ii although actin was more          difficult to extract moesin and other polypeptides were          removed already with  DOTMAC in the absence of PFA          Addition of  PFA was a necessary compromise to          visualize the cytoskeleton and its associated molecules          no matter which detergent was being used          Although DOTMAC induced bundling of actin filaments          and microtubules which could have affected          ultrastructural features of the cytoskeleton          microextensions of DOTMACPFAextracted cells did not          differ from those of nontreated cells On the contrary          bundling of actin filaments by DOTMAC may have stabilized          these actincontaining structures In SEM micropodia          ultramicroextensions and microvilli were well preserved          but their lipid membranes apparently were lost This made          it possible to trace the origin of micropodia and          ultramicroextensions While the cytoskeleton of          micropodia appeared to connect to the cytoskeleton          located at the edge of the cells by contrast filaments          of ultramicroextensions seemed to extend from or connect          to cytoplasmic rather than subcortical structures          Triton X is the most widely used detergent to          expose the cytoskeleton for biochemical and          immunohistological studies but without prefixation it          caused a marked loss of cytoskeletal material             This method also has been criticized for loss of the          microtrabecular lattice    This loss is sometimes          advantageous to expose certain types of filaments            but this was not relevant to our study Triton X is          not useful and even inappropriate for exposing and          maintaining the cytoskeleton of microextensions The          fragmentation of microextensions and the amount of          material lost with this detergent were time temperature          and concentration dependent The cytoskeleton tended to          be unmasked at low temperatures and at low concentrations          of Triton X and the loss of material occurred          especially in lamellipodia   These earlier data are          consistent with our results concerning lamellipodia but          other microextensions were ignored Previous authors          preferred to use  Triton X a relatively high          concentration of detergent because it is critical for          rapid solubilization of the cell membrane and cessation          of cell activity However  Triton X destroyed          microextensions even in PEM buffer Another problems with          Triton X is that most of the cells detached from the          substrate and the remaining cells are usually quite          distorted in shape   We have seen similar shape          changes with Triton Xextracted cells after          relatively short prefixation with formaldehyde Table                    The composition of the extraction buffer is an          important factor   Although MTSB which is          essentially similar to PHEM PEM or MTPB was shown to          give the best preservation of the cytoskeleton no          morphological differences were seen between these buffers          and PBS when the cells were extracted with DOTMAC          data not shown Addition of phalloidin taxol or PEG          did not make a difference either data not shown In our          experience the divalent cations in PBS prevented the          cellular retraction seen within a few minutes with PBS          and are necessary to maintain interactions between          DOTMACresistant components and the substrate data not          shown DOTMAC on the other hand caused rapid cessation          of all cell activity          The type of fixative is another important determinant          for the analysis of cell shape and structural integrity          of the cytoskeleton Glutaraldehyde is considered the          best fixative to preserve these structures but there are          associated disadvantages Prefixation and postfixation          with glutaraldehyde precludes exposure of the          cytoskeleton and also quite frequently the binding of          antibody probes On the other hand formaldehyde is a          rather weak crosslinker A crosslink formed by          formaldehyde between two functional groups is          theoretically and experimentally a nonreducible          methylene bridge Such bridges are readily hydrolysed          during washing The only irreversible reaction would be          one that takes place slowly with the aromatic hydrogen            Our studies provide first systematic data that cells          should be kept in  PFA for at least  min at room          temperature or for  min at C to irreversibly          crosslink most of the polypeptides Figure  Thus          enzymatic reactions or rearrangement of components in the          cytosol could occur for some time during fixation In          fact dephosphorylation of moesin occurred in mouse          epithelial MTD cells during fixation in  or           paraformaldehyde at room temperature for  min   As          shown here however moesin apparently was not          dephosphorylated in PFAbased fixatives in NIHT cells          These conflicting results could be due to differences of          cell type andor antibody reactivity We have prepared          the formaldehyde solution by dissolving PFA in water          because it was pointed out that methanol included in          commercial formaldehyde as a preservative is enough to          cause retraction of ruffles and lamellipodia            However no morphological difference between PFA and          formaldehyde was apparent when cells were extracted with          DOTMAC data not shown                          Evaluation of DOTMACPFA method by fluorescent          microscopy          Amieva et al   pointed out that some          microextensions may be lost during fixation and washing          steps and Nobes and Hall   added glutaraldehyde to          the fixative in order to stain these delicate structures          with phalloidin but glutaraldehyde had to be omitted for          immunostaining Because the procedure developed here          resulted in a comparable preservation of microextensions          we systematically analysed these structures with various          probes by immunofluorescence microscopy The DOTMACPFA          method provided excellent morphological preservation of          actin stress fibers and microextensions and high          intensity immunolabeling of actin while phalloidin          staining was poor probably owing to partial denaturation          of actin filaments The DOTMACPFA method thus should be          considered the method of choice for the preservation and          immunostaining of microextensions or when cells fixed by          other methods cannot be stained with certain          antisera                          Functional significance of fractionation of          polypeptides into DOTMACresistant components in NIHT          cells          We have previously shown that purified          threoninephosphomoesin selectively cosedimented with          actin filaments in the presence of DOTMAC or PIPs but          excess Triton X disrupted the interaction of moesin          with PIPs   Furthermore the cytoskeletal          association of threoninephosphomoesin was maintained          when platelets were extracted with DOTMAC but not with          Triton X These results were consistent with a model          of an allosteric change induced by PIPs or DOTMAC that          exposed and maintained a cytoskeletonbinding site of          moesin In NIHT cells however unlike in platelets          most of threoninephosphomoesin was retained in the          Triton Xinsoluble but only   in the          DOTMACinsoluble fraction How can this difference be          reconciled One possibility is that moesin in NIHT          cells is modified differently For example moesin is          tyrosine phosphorylated in vsrctransfected MDCK cells            A second possibility is that          threoninephosphomoesin interacts with nonextractable          membrane constituents besides actin filaments in cells          other than platelets For example the Nterminal domain          of moesin lacking the Cterminal Factin binding domain          remained strongly associated with the NPinsoluble          material of NIHT cells   While this issue needs          further work it is clear that detergent extraction alone          cannot be used as the sole criterion for cytoskeletal          association of proteins such as moesin as stated          frequently in the recent literature

         retraction of cells were observed in a few minutes when          the cells were exposed to PBS even briefly Samples were          then washed with distilled water dehydrated in a graded

obtained from commercial sources but it has to be used          within a week and is more expensive than PFA powder            Although formaldehyde and PFA were used in papers as          listed in Table  and formaldehyde solutions may have          been obtained from commercial sources for our study a          formaldehyde aqueous stock solution was prepared by          dissolving  g of PFA

     and stored at C for not more than one week In earlier          work formaldehyde solutions may have been prepared from          formalin that contains  formaldehyde and            methanol Unless noted as formalin formaldehyde          solutions were solely prepared here as described above          Therefore formaldehyde and PFA are essentially          indistinguishable Buffers were prepared

detached from the dishes in the          presence of  M calyculin A but not staurosporine and          pervanadate In order to exclude the effect of attachment          on the extractability of

Lipid analysis of detergentresistant          components          When NIH T fibroblasts were treated with Triton          X lysis buffer most of the cells detached from the          culture dish This made it impossible to quantitatively          analyze lipids in the detergentinsoluble fraction of          attached growing cells Therefore the cells were          suspended using EDTA before lipid analysis and extracted          with detergent extraction buffer as described above The          lysates were centrifuged at   g for  min at C          The supernatant was discarded and the pellet was washed          with PBS The lipids were extracted with  ml of          chloroformmethanol  vv in an ultrasonic bath for           min at C from the pellet After centrifugation at
