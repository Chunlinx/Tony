posted overseas in Poland seem to do it Traveling with children in Poland is a matter of being flexible creative and putting together disparate activities to keep the kids interested when palaces

see chapels and figures including the Seven Dwarves entirely carved out of salt and finally zoom up to ground level via a fast and slightly shaky barebones elevator  is sure to be cool for kids Also near Krakw is one visit older children are sure not to forget though it may demand a lot of explaining and soulsearching on your and their parts A visit to the Auschwitz concentration camp may not exactly be fun but it certainly is a tremendous and moving learning experience for older children The administrators of Auschwitz in fact recommend that children under the age of  not visit the camp
