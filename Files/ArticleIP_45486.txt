                                  Party at JonBenets House            A friend recently pointed out that Keeping Tabs haspaid relatively scant attention to the JonBenet Ramsey story a failing ofwhich shes well aware Its not that the tabloid coverage of the yearoldbeauty queens murder has been anything less than scintillating A recenthighlight was the National Enquirer s astonishingly detailed painting ofthe poor childs lifeless body bloodied garrote and all But following thestorys backandforth arc can induce such a maddening case of whiplash thatits been hard to find the proper moment to pause and reflect The grand jurysrecent failure to return any indictments in the case seems an appropriatejuncture although any hopes that the story might fade away were dashed by thisweeks Globe cover which shows JonBenet with the words ITS NOT OVERprinted menacingly across her forehead            In recent weeks onecould almost hear the tabloids Ramsey machine kick into high gear as eachmagazine tried to make sure it would be on record as having outguessed thegrand jury Although after nearly three years on the case its probably safeto assume that theyve all accused the correct murderer at some point TheGlobe and the Enquirer forecast grand jury bombshells andpointed fingers in Patsy Ramseys general direction But more intriguing wasthe Globe s report on Patsys grooming habits With her marriagewrecked by the strain she reportedly slipped away to a aweek Georgiaspa where because she is always concerned about her upper lip gettinghairy she had a muchneeded lip wax to

house where the Ramseys once lived Loughrins insights run fromthe profound I realized how much Patsys frilly feminine decorative tasteclashed with that of the young college students to the truly anguished Ipassed a spiral staircase on my right shuddering as I realized these were thesame stairs where Patsy claimed to have found the ransom note that fatefulmorning after Christmas            Perhaps sensing thatLoughrin could use a little time away from the story the Star hiredformer New York City police detective Bo Dietl to investigate JonBenets deathIn Dietls first dispatch from Colorado the nononsense excop claimed to havealready zeroed in on the real killer claiming that the Boulder police hadbeen going after the wrong suspects since Day One And while Dietl stoppedshort of actually naming anyone a teaser assured us that the following weekthe Star would reveal who really killed JonBenet and why And sureenough the next week saw Dietl peeling away even more tantalizing layersJonBenet he stated definitively was not murdered by her parentsalthough he accused them of lying and hiding information that would solve thecrime And what of the promised revelation A breathless Keeping Tabs made itall the way to the end of the story only to have Dietl citing his lawyersadvice wimp out without naming a soula decision that instantly shot him tothe top of Keeping Tabs public enemies list            If they are indeed as close to a divorce as theStar claims the Ramseys might take comfort in the fact that theyre ingood company In fact wed be hard pressed to find a celebrity
