            uh all right i had to register us in there   okay   uh hopefully youre a basketball fan   excuse me   hopefully youre a basketball fan   yeah im from Indiana   great im glad you are im not i i i could care about any of it you know  but go ahead i i would like to talk about uh       maybe college basketball i i like to see it uh be more of an amateur sport id like to see it turn back to like the Southwest Conference down here i would like to see Texas and all the teams uh since were supposed to talk about specific teams i would like to see them turn back to where the college player plays for four years and theyre not theyre not semi pro and just go on and are stolen by the the NBA the the League you know in three years plus id like to see them to be true athletes where theyre theyre taking a regular   umhum   college course you know id like to see they didnt ask that but theyre talking about college teams i you know since youre being you can talk for hours go ahead you you you if you like sports go right ahead with this one   yeah yeah um well i know like what you just said um Purdue had to had to uh their best player this years you know averaged twenty points a game they had to make him sit the bench and actually kicked him off the team because um   yeah   his uh grades even though they passed Big Ten standings and they passed you know NC double A they werent they did not pass um Purdue requirements and so   now thats surprising that they uh that they have better requirements thats good   yeah   thats what i like to see go ahead im all for that   and see so he was treated like all the rest of students you know   thats great   and and so um you know their very best player they probably lost over half their games because you know by twenty twenty points was what he averaged um and so you know he had to sit you know he was kicked off the team and then theyve got three players top you know recruiting class this year that are going to have to be well the the prep school they go to before they can play because they arent smart enough you know its just sad because i mean Purdue even though theyre one of the few schools that really uh   oh yeah   stress academics theyre really suffering you know and   oh i i agree i i think that that theres a lot of inconsistencies uh uh when some conference uh players come from outside of Texas you know and and play us here uh theyre obviously plus practicing sixty hours a week you know and and theres no consistency seems to me   umhum   that like Purdue uh uh when theyre trying a student athlete is spending so many hours in class he only has twenty twenty five whatever hours he has to spend on practice he should be playing they all should be playing another team that that has about twenty hours to practice a week but uh you there are teams that practices sixty hours a week theyre not going to class at all   yeah like   i mean thats thats what i mean by semi pro theres too many semi pros in college and and i think they ought to get rid of that   yeah thats what happened to this guy i mean he was uh he didnt go to class and so they just said you know you cant make the grades youre going to have to see you later   well im all for im all for the oh baseball has a uh a uh minor league system and i think that the football and basketball they asked us to talk about basketball should you know let let them go have a semi pro team but i think id like to see college athletes lets talk about college basketball i like i like that if any basketball that i like i like that i i dont i dont like the pros at all   yeah i dont either its   uh the high scoring theres no defense it seems like and they just kind of score a hundred and twenty five points you know the other team scores hundred twenty two you know and i dont really        uh get much out of that   yeah um yeah it is fun to watch some real disciplined teams play in a in college   umhum   and i saw Princeton i think it was or Harvard play this year and theyre theyre like all white and their starting guard had SAT scores of fifteen hundred   oh it did umhum umhum   and it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams because it was like they played so much smarter and more disciplined i dont know if they won very many games but   yeah   i dont know their style of play was so much different from some of the teams that just run and gun   yeah yeah i like high school football which again again is is not the subject but thats so much fun to watch because theyre theyre the the pure amateurs you know and theres no money involved you go to college you dont really know it it loses it somewhere     yeah yeah   uh whatever sport it is if theyre really putting putting a lot of money in these players lets face it ninety percent are being paid so id like to see college basketball and all the other sports go back to being amateurs i i dont care about seeing the best players in the world play i like to see uh the people going to Texas just play and the ones that are in class and and like to see athletes uh   yeah   uh or students students fellow students like myself you know to to play the game i i in fact i like amateur sports i i dont i dont see it has to be i dont think that college football football and or or basketball should have to be semi pro you know   yeah yeah its   i wish itd return to the to good old days of the amateur and everybody play thats what i like everybody should play you know   im kind of racist i guess when i say uh i like to see the white guys do well you know  instead of the run and gun all the time   yeah well again id just like to see the the true athlete the student true true true student athlete play basketball you know i dont like to see the ones that arent have no intention of going to class uh     yeah yeah   you know and again just picking a school uh Texas uh is is usually not the best team you know because the other teams are im sure practice a lot more and uh SMU down here   in fact   in in footballs been trying to get back uh to having true student student student athletes and and thats what i think is a lot of fun   theres just so much pressure on the schools i think to win though you know that   to win and get and money yeah   yeah and you know if its like if they dont win they dont get any money so its and and the school suffers   umhum   which is kind of bad but thats just how it always is   yeah i always thought that college university was to to for an education and then sports sports of course is part of the education i dont think that sports has to make a lot of money or you do away with it i dont know why they dont keep fencing and all that you know and   yeah   and and they seem to be theres articles in the Time magazine and all that about whether it be basketball or anything else if its not making money then well do away with it well thats thats not i thought it was you know so that you give them an education of that particular discipline   yeah   and i and i i just think that amateur sports should stay in universities thats where its at and i im sure saddened to see i think it was Wisconsin or somewhere they were getting rid of fencing and a couple of other things i dont know what it was and it just seems so sad to have to only rely on   really   you know college football is that all theyre going to have to make money you know plus i didnt think that was the objective was to make money but it seems like it is   yeah huh it really is i know theres a lot of pressure on schools to have a winning program   yeah umhum   to get the best athletes so they can keep their seats full   umhum you went to Indiana University University oh Purdue okay   uh Purdue yeah   well good uh youre youre a TIer up in Sherman oh very good   so uhhuh are you from Dallas area   yeah yeah im in the facilities down here down here in Dallas   yeah i guess football is the big sport down here isnt it   uh certainly high school football and college football but again high high school football uh is just so much fun to watch because uh   uh   uh you know just not everybody plays of course but theyre still uh its good and its still you know the kids and theres absolutely no money involved whatsoever and you know theyre going to class you know   yeah you heard of Damon   it its just real amateur sports   have you heard of Damon Bailey   humum   the IU uh white guard that plays well last year when he was in high school uh   humum   they drew a crowd of like forty one thousand for the state finals when he played   is that right  thats uh i never has been in a basketball uh football game in high school that had that many   yeah yeah  so thats uh i mean thats pretty big like hes from Indiana and he plays for Indiana now   umhum   and uh Indiana State  seems to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there the Pacers dont really draw that big of a crowd but you know the college the high school games i mean that seems seems to be the big attraction and college     well my office mate here Earl he he goes to all the Maverick games and he loves that he he would be this would be great question for him uh to talk about basketball like hes got im looking at his calendar hes got all over the place uh       and he goes to a lot of the Maverick games and everything and but i i i cant get interested at all zero i i listen to him and occasionally ill watch them on channel eleven       but uh gee i cant uh more than five minutes of a basketball game just seems about thats it of uh uh pro anyway uh of   yeah seems like you could set the st the score at a hundred and then give them five minutes to play and then itd be the same result you know because they they start they shoot so much and then the last   yeah yeah   what five minutes they decide whos going to be the winner i guess   umhum yeah im surprised a little bit when youre talking about basketball how some players work and Mavericks had oh two players this year that they got rid of last year ill think of them in a minute Perkins Sam Perkins cant think of the other one theyre both   Tarpley is he one Tarpley   pardon me yeah Tarpley and they both left this past year and both of them were on were on playoff teams uh so they they benefitted tremendously by by leaving the Mavericks   yeah   and Sam Perkins here uh hes one guy i did follow from think he was in Virginia i cant think of what school he went to but from i guess hes been here about five six seven years in the pros and he was he never quite achieved the you know the super stardom that he had in in in college but uh   uhhuh   basketball they have a nice i dont know if youve been down to the sports for Reunion Arena its really a nice uh certainly the
