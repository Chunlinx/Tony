                                 The Vapid Center            By JacobWeisberg            Its deepthoughts time atthe White House Gearing up for his second Inaugural Address Bill Clinton hasbeen trying on themes and buzz phrases like an advertisingcopywritercumpopeLast month at the annual meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council thepresident spoke of occupying the vital dynamic center of American politicsMore recently at a White House prayer breakfast Clinton said he wanted tofoster a spirit of reconciliation and quoted the late Cardinal JosephBernardin to the effect that time is precious and should not be wasted onacrimony and division The truth is all of us just have a little bit of timeleft Clinton told the breakfasting clergymen            Onedoesnt wish to deny anyone his rightful share of grandiloquence but there isa hazard here Its that Clinton who has been showily contemplating hispresidency for the past two months will misconceive his second term If hethinks its about moral leadership or about standing above the hurlyburly ofpolitics hes kidding himself What is portentously called Clintons place inhistory will probably depend less on his sounding like Vclav Havel than on abunch of quotidian issueswhat he referred to dismissively in hisprayerbreakfast speech as balancing the budget and all that            This is partly a judgment on Clintons own strengths andweaknesses The president has yet to utter a truly memorable line if you dontcount I didnt inhale No one looks to him for moral example He doeshowever understand the fine points of public policy as well as any presidentweve had and is capable of putting the public welfare ahead of narrowpolitical considerations when it really matters A few such painful choicesrescued what might otherwise have been a disastrous first term The mostsignificant of these was his decision to press for deficit reduction instead ofnew spending programs in his first budget But there were others too Hisdecision to support NAFTA and his belated intervention in Bosnia These werenot the areas where he thought he would stake his claim to greatness Yet bymaking the right decisions on big issues he couldnt avoid Clinton salvaged arecord of accomplishment and earned his reelection            This timethe decisions are equally momentousand probably more difficult The amount ofcourage Clinton displays in acting to reform Medicare and Social Security willdetermine whether these successful and popular programs survive into the nextcentury in anything resembling their present forms But the stakes are evengreater than that Absent significant reform the escalating costs of theseprograms will in decades to come crowd out what remains of the federaldiscretionary budgetthe FBI NASA Yosemite and all the rest Asdiscretionary programs are trimmed back to pay for mounting entitlement coststhe possibility of Clinton or any other president deploying new programs toaddress national problems will become more and more remote Not acting toreform entitlements will mean Clinton leaving a dysfunctional federalgovernment behind him when he goes            The most urgent part of the entitlement problemis Medicare Perhaps more than any other single issue this won Clinton the election And it was not pure Medigoguery that did it The Republicanpush for Medical Savings Accounts threatened to undermine Medicare by removingthe healthiest and wealthiest beneficiaries from the common insurance pool Butat the same time that he resisted this irresponsible conservative positionClinton saddled himself with one of his own support for Medicare withouthigher payments by beneficiaries or structural reforms to ensure longtermsolvency Republicans badly burned by the issue say the ball is now inClintons court            Leadership on this issue will consist of calling the GOPs bluff by proposingboth shortterm cuts and longterm structural reform Unfortunately Clintonshows little sign of doing either He intends to make only minor adjustments inhis February budget proposal fixes that will purport to keep the systemsolvent for  years The administration is developing a plan that is likely tocombine reduced payments to doctors and hospitals with a proposal to shift thecosts for homehealth care out of the Medicare trustfund account This is anaccounting gimmick which would keep the trust fund technically solvent for atime without reducing costs overall Clinton might still address the longrangeproblem later But as elections get closerfor congressional Democrats in and for Al Gore in the attraction of defending Medicare will reassertitself            Social Security by contrast is a longrange emergencyThis program isnt going broke now but unless we do something about it soonthe longterm problem will become insoluble Conservatives many of whom do notbelieve in Social Security in the first place are hard at work devising plansto undermine it by shifting to a system of individual accounts As moremoderate solutions are deferred that kind of transformation becomesincreasingly likely If however Clinton forces difficult changes now we canavoid catastrophe later Among the most sensible options are a slight increasein the retirement age in keeping with growing life expectancy a mildmeanstest in keeping with principles of fairness and an adjustment in theConsumer Price Index in keeping with economic reality            Among these reformsadjusting the CPI is the most important Because it would reduce mandatedbenefits of various kinds in a reasonable way it would go a long way not justtoward fixing Social Security but also toward bringing the federal budget intostructural balance Its also a politically safe way to raise taxes since taxexemptions are like many benefit programs indexed for inflation Clintonprobably shouldnt appear to politicize the issue of how the CPI iscalculated by publicly supporting Sen Pat Moynihans bill to cut it in halfto  percent But he can surely finesse the result some other way RobShapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute suggests creating an entirely newindexa Cost of Living Indexto replace the CPI which would be one solutionThe problem falls to Clinton partly because Social Security is his partysgreatest achievement and partly because Republicans are rightly terrifiedabout raising the subject on their own If only Nixon could go to China onlyClinton can reform Social Security            Entitlements are not the onlything that matters In addition to all the things we cant foresee thehistorical verdict on Clinton will also hinge on such issues as whether hemanages to steer welfare reform back in the right direction whether he avoidsbeing drawn into a counterproductive tax cut and whether he overcomes his ownrecent history to lead campaignfinance reform But on all these the basicprinciple is the same The president needs to spurn the vital center defy thespirit of reconciliation and recognize he has only a little time left to tellthe public what it doesnt want to hear
