                            From a human perspective sexes seem a relatively simple thing to get ones head        aroundthere are females and there are males But our perspective seems biased and narrow        when applied to life as a whole says evolutionary biologist Laurence Hurst of the        University of Bath United KingdomIf you were a singlecelled alga sitting in a pond you        wouldnt see the world as splitting into males and females        In fact different species have evolved a bewildering number of ways to mix and match        the attributes of sexes Some do not have males and females but have adaptations that mean        each individual performs a specific role during sex There are other species of which every        member is sexually equivalent but individuals nevertheless divide into groups for the        purposes of mating And in some species individuals make both eggs and sperm Box  This        biological diversity has produced a semantic muddle among biologistseveryone who thinks        about the evolution of sexes seems to have a slightly different take on what a sex is The        literature is highly confusingwe need to clarify our terminology comments Rolf Hoekstra        a geneticist at the University of Waageningen in the Netherlands        As things stand there are three main aspects to the definition of a sex who you are        who you can mate with and who your parents are The third part of this trinityparental        numbershows the least variation in nature No known organism needs more than one mother        and one father But even this assumption is now starting to break down at the level of        biological systems In a recently discovered hybrid system within the harvester ant genus         Pogonomyrmex  queens must mate with two types of males to        produce both reproductive individuals and workers Figure  These ants are the first        species known which truly has more than two sexeswith colonies effectively having three        parents argues Joel Parker of the University of Lausanne Switzerland        Parkers ideas might reactivate evolutionary biologists interest in sexes which has        lain somewhat dormant since the s It could also provide a new route to experiments        something often lacking in the field Not everyone agrees that it makes sense to define the        ants genetic quirks as new sexes Each ant is still only a mix the genes from no more than        two parents after all But Parker believes that our current ideas about mating systems may        not be adequate to describe the ingenuity of evolution Until you see a threesex system        you dont know what itll look like he says                    Little and Large        To address whether these ants have more than two sexes we first need to look at other        candidates for sexes their numbers in different species and how these systems evolved        One thing biologists do agree on is that males and females count as different sexes And        they also agree that the main difference between the two is gamete size males make lots of        small gametessperm in animals pollen in plantsand females produce a few big eggs But        researchers also think that before males and females evolved sex occurred between        organisms with equalsized gametes a state called isogamy        Evolutionarily speaking an isogamous species faces two pressures Individuals can make        more smaller gametes thus increasing their potential number of offspring or they can make        fewer bigger gametes thus giving their offspring a better start in life by providing them        with more resources Theoretical analyses suggest that this pressure is particularly great        if being big carries large benefits making isogamy unstable The original identical        gametes will evolve towards the opposite ends of the size spectrum        In many species however one size of gamete still fits all The organisms that have        hung on to isogamy are found among the less complex branches of life such as fungi algae        and protozoa This might be because large gametes yielding wellfunded zygotes are likely        to be more strongly selected if the resulting offspring needs to grow into a large and        complex organism The benefits of large gametes in simple and unicellular organisms are not        so obvious Some support for this hypothesis comes from the algae belonging to the group        Volvocales The variation in gamete size within each species matches its degree of        complexity For example the unicellular species         Chlamydomonas rheinhardtii is isogamous while         Volvox rouseletti  which lives in balls of up to  cells        has large and small gametes Figure                     The Opposite of Sexes        The question of sexes and their number is complex in isogamous species Such species        still typically comprise different groups for mating purposes They have genes that allow        them to mate with everyone except those belonging to the same mating type this is        presumably to avoid inbreeding and to produce offspring that are genetically diverse to        cope with environmental change or biological enemies Species with mating types rather        than males and females arent limited to two interbreeding groups the ciliate protozoan         Tetrahymena thermophila has seven and the mushroom         Schizophyllum commune has more than  for example Some        biologists call these mating types sexes others think that in the absence of traits other        than sexual compatibility or the lack thereof it makes more sense to view species with        many mating types as having no sexes rather than lots        Yet most isogamous species have only two mating types This seems perverseit excludes        half the population as potential mates without gaining the benefits of specialization in        sexual biology With William Hamilton Hurst came up an explanation for this apparent        inefficiency        Twogroup mating systems they proposed evolved as a way for genes in the nucleus to        police the DNA in organelles Cellular structures with their own genomes such as        mitochondria and chloroplasts can divide more rapidly than the cells that house them If        the inheritance of organelles was biparental selfish mutations in their DNA could spread        rapidly Hurst and Hamilton showed A nuclear gene that enforces uniparental inheritance of        organelles along with a label that allows such cells to recognize each other so that their        nuclear genes can share the benefits of cytoplasmic policing should be favored        The mating biology of isogamous species offers considerable support for this idea The        aforementioned         C rheinhardtii  for example comes in two mating types called        plus and minus When the two fuse the plastid of the minus cell is detroyed Most        isogamous species that fuse cells have a similar mechanism Malekiller parasites such as         Wolbachia  a parasite of arthropods show the selection        pressure that intracellular passengers can exert see also the primer by Wernegreen in the        March issue of         PLoS Biology  And cellfusion experiments hint that biparental        inheritance of organelles does indeed cause problems says Hurst Hybrids are often        rubbish but they can be better if a drug is administered that inhibits the mitochondria of        one cell line        The species that have lots of mating types such as ciliate protozoa exchange nuclear        DNA but not cytoplasm and hence not intracellular organelles Since individuals are freed        from the need to police their organelles or keep out parasites selection favors the widest        assortment of possible mates and thus the evolution of a large number of mating types so        that ones own typewhich one cant mate withis a small subset of the population It is        possible to imagine species with cytoplasmic policing likewise having many mating types        but such a situation would be much more prone to break down and be invaded by selfish        agents than one with two clearly defined types which is what we usually see in nature        Some have argued that cytoplasmic policing might also be a selective force for        differentsized gametes Sperm could be small so that they do not import mitochondria into        the egg        More than a decade after he devised it Hursts is still the leading hypothesis        explaining the number of mating types in a species But experimental evidence remains        frustratingly elusive I wouldnt say I was entirely satisfied says Hurst Weve got        all these ideas and they turn out to be quite hard to testtheres no simple thing one can        do on a single species There are species where the uniparental inheritance of organelles        is not so strictly enforced says Hoekstra such as yeasts and plants Its not easy to        see if selection on organelles is strong enough he says                    Threes Company        Yet even in a species such as         S commune  with its thousands of mating types each sexual        encounter involves only two cells Nor are we likely to find a species that defies this        pattern The technical difficulties of combining more than two sets of genetic information        into one individual and of parceling out that information during meiosis must be vast        says Brian Charlesworth of the University of Edinburgh Weve reached the point of two        cells fusing and stuck with that two cells are probably just as good as three he        says        The ant colonies that Parker suggests have three parents are a hybrid of the species         Pogonomyrmex rugosus and         P barbatus  The hybrids have not yet been classed as a new        species but they are well established across the southwestern United States and there is        no evidence of contemporary gene flow between hybrids and their parent species        Each ant has one parent if it is male because male ants are produced from unfertilized        eggs or two if it is female But each sex also comes in two genetic strains If a queen        mates with a male of her own strain her offspring will be queens and if she mates with a        male from the other strain the sperm will give rise to workers So for a colony to        function fully itand the queens it produces because workers raise queensmust have two        fathers and one mother And if any one group were to disappear the population as a whole        would go extinctunlike fungal mating types where its easy to imagine that the species        would carry on if a few disappeared If you lose any one the whole thing collapses says        Parker Its really different from any other system        So Parker argues         Pogonomyrmex has four sexes the males and females of each        strain The idea is particularly potent if one views a social insect colony as a        superorganism with the workers equivalent to the cells of a body Its as if a female        mates with one male to produce her offsprings somatic cells and another to produce its        germ cells The ants form chaotic mating swarms so most queens have no problem mating        multiply and getting sperm from males of both strains although one would expect that males        would strongly favor mating with females of their own strain        Its not known how the system originated Separating the worker and reproductive castes        by geneticsother social insects do this by environment that is by rearing workers and        reproductives differentlymay allow selection to operate more efficiently on each lineage        and the workers may benefit from hybrid vigor field researchers report them as being        highly aggressive In an echo of Hursts hypothesis the system also mixes mitochondrial        and nuclear genes differently in queens and workers        Some evolutionary biologists such as Charlesworth do not consider         Pogonomyrmex         s mating types sexes arguing that to define sexes in yet another way        only confuses the picture further The ants are an interesting system but I wasnt        persuaded by Parkers interpretation Charlesworth says Im not a fan of the idea that        its useful to use the word sex to describe compatibility between mating typesit muddies        the waters Others are more positive towards Parkers interpretation It deserves to be        taken seriously says evolutionary biologist Ers Szathmry of the Collegium Budapest in        Hungary Hes thrown a stone in the waternow we need to see what kinds of ripples it        makes You cant falsify a definition in the way you can a hypothesis what determines        their fate is whether people find them useful or not        Species in which some individuals give up their reproductive opportunities to form part        of a breeding group such as slime molds might have a system similar to that of the ants        Parker believes There may be hidden mating incompatibilities he says Now that        people know to look were going to start seeing more of these systems
