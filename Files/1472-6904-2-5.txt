                    Background        The expression physiologically based pharmacokinetic        model PBPK describes an approach where the drug kinetics        are modeled using a realistic physiological description of        the animal This has now become a standard approach to        pharmacokinetics and has been applied to many different        compounds     Despite this most human drug studies        still rely on approximate compartmental pharmacokinetic        techniques and do not attempt a complete physiological        model One reason for this is that detailed kinetic        information for the different organs is not available in        humans to the same extent as it is in animal studies A        second reason is that PBPK models are still somewhat        difficult to use and remain a tool primarily of        specialists        This paper along with the accompanying papers              describes a new PBPK modeling program PKQuest that is        designed to overcome both of these problems The first        problem lack of information is avoided by preprogramming        a large set of data about kinetics in different organs that        can be called as default variables applicable to whatever        solute is being investigated The second problem ease of        use is overcome by using a simple interface and a        graphical and printed output that provides a complete        description of the pharmacokinetics Despite this ease of        use PKQuest provides a rigorously accurate PBPK applicable        to all the different physiological and biochemical        properties of the different compounds that are commonly        investigated        This first paper introduces the general features of the        program describes the mathematical details and explains        the simple interface that has been designed to use it        PKQuest has incorporated a large number of features some        of which have been developed and introduced for the first        time see below Some of these features are illustrated in        this paper by using PKQuest to obtain new information about        the human pharmacokinetics of propranolol This is an        intensively investigated area For example a search in        PubMed for the terms propranolol AND pharmacokinetics        yielded  references Despite this there are still        several important questions remaining about its behavior in        man In particular the rather peculiar effect of food        intake on plasma levels remains unexplained     Meals        decrease the plasma levels when propranolol is given        intravenously IV and increase the plasma levels when        propranolol is given orally PO Since it has been shown        that gastrointestinal absorption is complete     this        meal effect must result from a food induced change in the        metabolism distribution or rate of absorption Since liver        propranolol metabolism is partially limited by liver blood        flow     the meal induced decrease in the plasma level        of the IV administered propranolol can be explained by the        increase in liver blood flow that has been shown to be        associated with a meal        However this would        not explain the meal induced increase in plasma levels        following the oral propranolol PKQuest will be used to try        and provide an explanation of this behavior This analysis        is based primarily on the experimental data of Olanoff et        al    in which the plasma propranolol levels were        measured after simultaneous IV and PO administration        eliminating the effects of individual variation from these        measurements Requiring a single set of parameters to fit        both the simultaneous IV and PO plasma concentration data        imposes a strong limitation on the model Comparing the        PBPK parameter set for the fed and fasted case then        provides quantitative information about the effect of meals        on propranolol pharmacokinetics This analysis makes        extensive use of the novel PKQuest feature that uses the        blood levels following an oral dose to calculate the time        course of the intestinal PO absorption        In the last section PKQuest will be used to quantitate        the time course of intestinal absorption of a sustained        release form of propranolol        The modeling program along with the detailed        applications described in these papers is freely available        on the Web at wwwpkquestcom                    Methods                  Flow diagram          PKQuest uses the conventional PBPK flow diagram             shown in fig  Each box corresponds to a wellmixed          compartment and each arrow is an input or output to the          compartment determined by the blood flow The different          compartments are numbered from  vein to  lipid          Each compartment is described by the total organ blood          flow litersmin and the total weight Kg In PKQuest          the names shown in fig can be used in place of the          numbers For example the muscle blood flow can be          described either by F    or F muscle Table Ilists          the values of organ weight and the blood flow per organ          weight for each organ for the standard human  Kg          These organ weights are for the default value of  body          fat They are scaled depending on the value of Fat that          is input The portal compartment corresponds to all the          organs drained by the portal vein stomach small and          large intestine pancreas and spleen with a blood flow          equal to that in the portal vein The liver blood flow          corresponds to the hepatic artery The compartment          labeled other groups all the other organs with a flow          and weight adjusted to account for the total body weight           Kg and the total default cardiac output           litersmin For a complete listing of all parameters and          constants used in PKQuest download the file gensolvemws          from the PKQuest web site wwwpkquestcomand view the          routines standardman and defaultpar          A number of other properties are associated with each          compartment such as the water volume fraction of the          tissue wfract litersKg the fraction of the          compartment water that is extracelluar ecf the          capillary clearance flcear etc The critical variable          describing the kinetics is the free water concentration          ci for each compartment i This is the concentration          that determines the rate of exchange across the          capillary It is related to the experimental          concentration Ci amountKg by the parameter fwi          which is the fraction of the total solute in compartment          i that is free in the water phase c  fwCwfract The          parameter fw is determined by factors such as protein          binding and lipid solubility Although fw is the          parameter used in the actual calculations its value is          usually input in terms of other parameters such as the          lipidwater partition coefficient    or the protein          binding     For the propranolol calculations fwi          is related to the input parameters ktissi the ratio of          tissue to plasma concentration and freepl the fraction          free in plasma by the relation fwi           freeplwatfriwatfrplktissi where watfri and          watfrpl are the water fractions in tissue i and in the          plasma          Each compartment can have a metabolic component Q          described either by the MichaelisMenten parameters Vm          and Km Qi  VmiciKmici if the metabolism          saturates or by a metabolic clearance Tclr if the          metabolism is linear The kidney is a special case          removing solute either via filtered renal clearance          rclr or by tubule secretion described by Vmkidney          Kmkidney and Tclrkidney The default is no tubule          secretion or clearance Each compartment can also have          its own unique input from outside the body cinputi          The standard inputs are to the vein lung or GI tract It          is assumed that the PO absorption goes directly into the          liver via the portal vein This choice was made as          opposed to PO input into the portal compartment because          the solute absorbed by eg the small intestine is          picked up by the villous capillaries and removed in the          portal vein before it distributes in the entire small          intestine or even in the local intestinal submucosal          tissue compartment          It is assumed that the tissue region of each organ can          be modeled as a single wellstirred compartment This is          clearly an approximation and effects such as diffusion          gradients countercurrent exchange and heterogeneous          organ blood flows      will produce small          deviations from this assumption The exchange between the          vascular and tissue compartments results from diffusion          of the free solute between the blood and this well mixed          tissue region during the passage through the capillary          see Appendix fig  The rate of this exchange is          determined by the capillary permeabilitysurface area          product PS which can be related to the parameter          fclear see Appendix eq  which varies from           impermeable to  flow limited For flow limited          solutes eg propranolol the free water concentration          c in the vein leaving the tissue is equal to the free          tissue water concentration          The major limitation of this model is the          representation of the venous and arterial vascular spaces          as single compartments This means that PKQuest cannot          provide an accurate picture of the very early time course          of drug distribution less than a minute when a more          detailed model of the vascular compartments is required                                       Determination of physiological parameters          The most important feature of a PBPK is the accuracy          and validity of the physiological parameters organ          weight blood flow volume of distribution etc The          major advantage of a PBPK over a simpler  or           compartment model is that presumably it returns a          higher resolution view of the way the body handles the          drug This presumption depends on the assumption that the          physiological parameters in the model are correct A          large amount of effort has been expended on the choice of          these parameters in PKQuest Initially the parameters          were chosen using standard references such as the          Report on the Task Group on Reference Man    and          Reference values for resting blood flow to organs of          man    and by copying values used from previous PBPK          models      Then the parameters were adjusted to          insure that they were in agreement with such features as          total blood volume and cardiac output               extracellular space    and total body water               Finally certain parameters were adjusted to optimize          the fit to the pharmacokinetics of selected solutes For          example muscle blood flow was adjusted to fit the D            O kinetics     fat blood flow to          fit the enflurane kinetics     and total          extracellular space to fit the inulin kinetics              All of the human physiological parameters are listed in          the standardhuman procedure in the PKQuest program          Since muscle represents about  of the total water          volume the muscle blood flow and volume are the two most          important parameters in the PBPK The value of the muscle          blood flow would be expected to have large variations          depending on whether for example the subject is lying          on a couch with an IV catheter in his arm or is          ambulatory after an oral drug dose It is a gross          approximation to treat all the muscles as a single          compartment with a single blood flow and some PBPKs have          divided the muscle into a working and resting          compartment     However subdivision of the muscle          compartment increases the complexity of the model beyond          what is usually justified by the available data For this          reason the muscle blood flow is the parameter that is          most frequently varied for the different studies          described in these papers and will be regarded as an          adjustable parameter In PKQuest when the blood flow of          one organ is changed all the other organ flows remain          the same so that the total cardiac output is also          changed The default value for the muscle blood flow is          at the low end of most estimates  litersKg          representing  of the cardiac output In several of the          studies described in these papers the muscle blood flow          has been increased by up to a factor of two          The focus in this series of papers is on human          pharmacokinetics using the standardhuman parameter          set In addition a standardrat parameter set is          included in the current version of PKQuest The          physiological parameters for this rat data set have been          chosen and refined using the same approach that was          described here for the human data set                          Implementation          PKQuest is written using the Maple version   or           computer algebra system wwwmaplesoftcom This means          that the user must have Maple installed and running          before PKQuest can be used This limitation is outweighed          by the advantage of being able to use all of the features          that are preprogrammed in Maple such as the numerical          solution and graphical options Maple is available for          most operating systems PC Mac Linux and PKQuest          should run on any system that has Maple installed          The derivations and mathematic details of the modeling          program are described in the Appendix PKQuest is so          large and has so many optional features that not all of          them can be described here The Appendix focuses on the          features of the program that are new and have not          previously been incorporated into a PBPK model including          the features     and  listed below The          description of many other features is available using the          Maple help option that has been programmed into          PKQuest This allows the user to enter the name of a term          or parameter that is used in the program and view a          description of the feature and how it should be used As          a typical example entering the term fclear in the help          option pops up a help page that begins                      fcleari is measure of capillary

free in blood fw            artery times the classical permeability For cases            where fw artery is very small the solute can become            diffusion limited even for solutes with a large

on          to describe the different options for entering values of          fcleari and for varying and optimizing this parameter          Almost every parameter in PKQuest has a similar help          entry          PKQuest is a large program consisting of more than           separate Maple procedures and a number of Maple          worksheets Once the program has been installed the user          only needs to deal with two simple procedures each of          which is contained in one worksheet The first procedure          lists the values of the model parameters that differ from          the default values for the specific solute that is being          investigated This procedure is labeled with a name that          describes the compound being investigated The second          procedure calls the data in the first procedure runs the          program and determines the type of output that is          displayed In the remainder of this paper the use of          these two procedures will be illustrated by an          investigation of the human propranolol          pharmacokinetics                          Experimental data          Three sets of experimental data were used The first          set was from the paper of Fagan et al     It          described measurements of the plasma propranolol          concentration from  minute to  hours after a  mgKg          dose infused at a rate of  mgmin in  young normal          males weight  Kg The second set was the data of          Olanoff et al    for the simultaneous IV infusion of           mgKg infused at a rate of  mgmin of unlabeled          racemic propranolol and oral dose of  mg consisting of           mg of the hexadeuteriumlabeled propranolol          hydrochloride and  mg of the dideuteriumlabeled           propranolol hydrochloride The subjects were  healthy          males weighing  to  Kg The doses were given either          to fasting subjects or immediately after eating a high          protein breakfast The third set was the experimental          measurements of Takahashi et al    of the plasma          propranolol concentration after oral administration of           mg of either conventional or long acting propranolol          Inderal LA to  healthy subjects  females  males          average weight of  Kg          The mean plasma concentrations at each time point were          used for the PBPK fitting The experimental data points          were obtained by using UNSCANIT Silk Scientific          Corporation to read the data from the published          figures                            Results                  Summary of features          PKQuest has a number of novel features many of which          have never before been implemented in a PBPK           There is a large set of default parameters eg          organ volumes blood flows volume of distribution that          can be called upon For example all the values required          for human studies are setup simply by a call to          standardhuman The current version also implements a          standardrat The default case assumes that the solute          is lipid soluble distributes in all the body water has          a very high capillary permeability is flow limited and          is not volatile no pulmonary exchange Each of these          assumptions can be easily modified For example if the          drug distributes only in the extracellular space the          user need set only the parameter mecf equal to  and          PKQuest will now use the default set of extracellular          volumes for each organ     Or if the drug is not          flow limited but has a significant capillary permeability          limitation the user needs only to input a clearance          value for the muscle capillaries fclear muscle and          all the other organs will have their permeability set on          the basis of their blood flows and reference permeability          surface PS product values relative to muscle     As          a another example if the drug is volatile so that          pulmonary exchange is important the user need only input          values for the two parameters Kwair waterair partition          coefficient and Kfwat fatwater partition and all the          appropriate parameters necessary for a respiratory          compound are activated     Any or all of the default          values can be easily set to arbitrary user prescribed          values           The output is routinely displayed in graphical form          in addition to the standard numerical output No user          input is required to specify the routine graphical          output All of the figures shown in this paper are taken          directly from the output of PKQuest without any          modifications Experimental data can be either typed in          or read from a tabular file           A chosen set of parameters can be optimized to give          the best fit to the experimental data PKQuest uses a          rigorous nonlinear global simulated anealling               and local Powell     minimization routines that          have a simple interface For example if the user wanted          to find the best set of values for the Vmax and Km for          the liver metabolism and for the muscle blood flow          F it is only necessary to input adjustn   and          adjustvar  VmliverKmliverFmuscle Any          of the parameters used in the model can be optimized          using this type of call and there is no limit to the          number that can be simultaneously optimized although in          most cases simultaneous optimization of more than           parameters is not recommended given the limited          experimental data           The rate of intestinal absorption PO defined as          the rate of uptake by the portal vein of a drug can be          determined from the experimental venous blood levels          after an oral dose A new technique is used to invert the          model equations in order to obtain an accurate solution          for the PO absorption This is a useful new application          of PBPK providing the user with an accurate time course          and graphical output of the oral absorption rate or          optionally intramuscular intraperotineal or skin          absorption for any drug whose PBPK parameters have been          previously determined This is probably the single most          important original feature in PKQuest opening up a new          approach to a number of pharmacokinetic problems An          example of the potential of this tool is illustrated in          the application to propranolol discussed below           The first pass liver metabolism FPM and systemic          peripheral availability of a PO administered drug is          directly determined and plotted as output Systemic          availability is defined as the equivalent IV input that          would produce an identical venous concentration as a          function of time as the PO input This determination          uses a new definition of FPM that is applicable to the          case of nonlinear saturable liver metabolism As has          been discussed previously     the classical          definition of FPM breaks down for the nonlinear case and          this is the first rigorous approach to describing this          case This aspect of PKQuest is presented in more detail          in an accompanying paper that focuses on ethanol          pharmacokinetics               Plasma and extracellular protein binding is treated          rigorously Since the majority of drugs have some protein          binding an accurate modeling of this property is          essential The option of nonlinear saturable protein          binding is also included Because this saturation greatly          complicates the mathematics of the model it is rarely          included in PBPKs PKQuest also allows for a combination          of capillary permeability limited exchange and nonlinear          binding  the first time this case has been described and          implemented These features are described in more detail          in an accompanying paper that discusses the application          to antibiotics               Although it is well recognized that capillary          permeability may limit the bloodtissue exchange of a          drug most PBPK models deal only with the high capillary          permeability flow limited case PKQuest provides for a          rigorous modeling of capillary permeability limitations          It is shown in an accompanying paper    that solutes          that are normally assumed to be flow limited can have a          significant capillary permeability limitation if there is          a high degree of plasma protein binding           The model of the lung used in PKQuest for the          respiratory gases allows for the option of          ventilationperfusion mismatch The lung can be divided          into an arbitrary number of compartments determined by          the parameter Ndim with a log normal distribution of          flows and ventilation to each compartment determined by          the either the default or user input values of the log          standard deviation of ventilation sigv and perfusion          sigf This feature is described in more detail in an          accompanying paper that analyses the pharmacokinetics of          volatile solutes               PKQuest can be used to describe an arbitrary number          of simultaneously interacting solutes Two types of          interaction competitive or noncompetitive inhibition          are allowed Also the case where some solutes are          converted into other solutes can be modeled with a          separate Vm and Km for each substrateproduct pair                          PKQuest parameters for propranolol intravenous IV          input          Some of these features will be illustrated by          application of PKQuest to propranolol pharmacokinetics A          baseline set of physiological PBPK parameters will be          determined using the IV data of Fagen et al              This data was chosen because it represents one of the          most complete sets of propranolol data with plasma          values ranging from  minutes to  hours Shown below is          the listing for the procedure propivfagen which          inputs all of the unique parameters that are required          These values have been adjusted to provide a good fit to          the Fagen et al data

the procedure defaultpar calls          another procedure that sets up all the default          parameters The second line Wtot is the total body          weight It is the only parameter that must be set before          the call to standardhuman The weight is arbitrary for          this data because the dose was scaled for body weight          The value of  Kg was chosen because it is the average          value for the Olanoff et al data see below The forth          line is the fraction of body weight that is fat The          fifth line cunit sets the amount unit that is used to          micrograms In PKQuest the units of volume weight and          time are always liters Kg and minutes Thus for this          case the concentration units are microgramsliter The          parameter cunit is not needed for the actual          calculations but is used to label the printed output          data and the axis of the output plot Line  concunit          determines the units that are used for the experimental          input value In this case concunitvein   indicates          that the experimental input data corresponds to the          venous plasma concentration Line  rblpl is the          bloodplasma concentration ratio If this is not entered          then a default value will be used However in this case          the experimental value is known              The next  lines lines  are related to the lipid          binding of propranolol Propranolol blood and tissue          binding has been studied in great detail                 The propranolol tissue distribution seems to be          determined primarily by the phosphatidylserine          composition of the tissue     These studies indicate          that the factional binding is constant and does not          saturate over the pharmacological concentration range          Since drug binding is such a ubiquitous property of          kinetic studies PKQuest has incorporated a large number          of different ways that the data can be entered In this          case  sets of data are required freepl which is the          fraction free in plasma and is set in line  to the          experimental value    and ktissi the ratio of the          equilibrium tissueplasma concentration which is set in          lines  Lines  set ktiss   for all the          organs and lines  reset the ktiss for  organs that          are known to have distinct binding lung muscle and          lipid Tissue binding studies indicate that propranolol          binding in the lung is about  times higher and muscle          is about a third of that of most tissues Somewhat          surprisingly propranolol binding to fat tissue is less          than the rest of the body as indicated by a smaller          volume of distribution when normalized for body weight          in obese people     Although these values of          ktissi are similar to the experimental measurements in          the rat     they have been slightly adjusted to          improve the fit          It is well established that the liver is the major          site of propranolol clearance Line  Tclr liver is          the input data describing the liver metabolism Although          it has been shown that the liver metabolism is          nonlinear saturating at high blood levels this          nonlinearity only becomes significant at doses above           mgday     At lower doses both the liver metabolism          and PO absorption appear to be linear      All the          data that will be used here fall in this linear dose          range In PKQuest there are  options for entering the          metabolism of each organ i If metabolism is nonlinear          than the  parameters Vmaxi and Kmi are required and          the rate of metabolism of organ i is described by          VmaxiciKmi  ci where ci is the free          concentration in the water of organ i If the metabolism          is linear than metabolism is described by the parameter          Tclri rate of metabolism  Tclrici Since the          propranolol liver metabolism is linear it is described          by inputting a value of Tclr liver of  litersmin          This value was determined by using the Powel minimization          feature in PKQuest to optimize the fit to the          experimental data Tclr is the intrinsic clearance          litersmin of the liver relating the rate of          metabolism to the free water liver concentration This          intrinsic clearance differs significantly from the actual          liver clearance volume of plasma cleared in one pass          through the liver because the liver clearance is          partially flow limited and the free water concentration          is lower than the absolute concentration Although there          is some stereoselectivity in the propranolol metabolism          the effect is small and was neglected in this analysis                        Line  datafile is the name of the computer          tabular file where the data time concentration is          stored In line  pdata is the number of input files          and the data is read into data i            The last  lines specify the experimental input          functions The parameter ninput is the number of input          functions In this case there is only one  described by          the Maple table finput     The table parameter          organ is the compartment that the input entered  in          this case IV input the venous compartment The          parameter type specifies the mathematical form of the          input   bolus   constant infusion   exponential            Hill type In this case there was a constant          infusion at a rate of  microgramsmin starting at          tbeg   and ending at tend   minutes See below for          an example of multiple inputs          This completes the description of the data entry for          propranolol There are really only  sets of values that          are specific for propranolol the lipid binding          parameters freepl and ktissi and the liver clearance          Tclr liver All the rest of the entries body weight          concentration units data file etc are essentially          housekeeping The default parameters set up by the call          to defaultpar are for the case that the solute is flow          limited and distributes in all the body water Since this          is the case for propranolol the parameters describing          the volume of distribution and capillary permeability do          not need to be input                          PKQuest output for this set of model          parameters          Using this propranolol data PKQuest is ready to be          run A listing of the procedure pkquest is shown          below          pkquest proc          propivfagen

procedure calls the data listed          above in the procedure propivfagen The second line          calls for the standard graphical output In this case          PKQuest will output the plot of just

   be printed in addition to the graphical output The last          line calculate runs the program          The PKQuest graphical output is shown in fig  The          entire run took less than one second on a  Ghz PC The          solid line is the model plasma concentration and the open          squares are the experimental data The complete layout of          this figure axes labels etc is determined without          any user input Maple has a variety of export options          The figures shown here have been exported in jpg          format          PKQuest also prints out information pertinent to each          particular case such as in this case the rate of liver          metabolism portal and hepatic blood flow plasma and          tissue binding etc PKQuest also routinely outputs the          classical pharmacokinetic values for the experimental          data          Classical Phamacokinetics from Experimental Data          extrapolate to infinity AUC   AUMC

and its first moment and MIT the mean input          time                              Application of PKQuest to simultaneous PO and IV          input data          Olanoff et al    simultaneously administered          unlabeled propranolol intravenously IV and deuterium          labeled propranolol orally PO and measured the plasma          levels of the labeled and unlabeled drug Since the          propranolol pharmacokinetics are linear for this dose          these two inputs can be treated as completely independent          and noninteracting These experiments will be used to          quantitate the influence of food on propranolol plasma          levels          The approach that will be used is based on finding a          set of PBPK parameters that are consistent with the          simultaneous PO and IV input data The model parameters          must meet the following three criteria  Since the          measurements are simultaneous an identical set of          parameters must be used in the modeling of the IV and          oral input data  The PKQuest plasma levels for the IV          input must fit the observed plasma values  The PKQuest          total absorption for the oral input plasma data must be          equal to the total experimental oral dose of  mg These          are quite restrictive conditions This process will be          carried out for both the fasted fig  and meal case          fig  in order to determine the effect of the meal on          the propranolol pharmacokinetics          Figure shows the PKQuest output for the case where          the propranolol was given to fasted subjects          simultaneously by the IV fig A and PO fig B          route Figure Ashows a comparison of the experimental          plasma data and model predictions when the propranolol          was given IV  mgKg Figure Bshows the PKQuest          calculation of the time course of the intestinal          absorption open squares determined using the          experimental plasma values for the oral propranolol          administration Note that as required the predicted          total absorption equals  mg the experimental oral          dose The same set of parameters is used for both figs          Aand B All of the parameters are identical to those          used above fig  for the Fagen et al    data          except that it was necessary to reduce the portal blood          flow by  from the default value used in fig in order          to satisfy the three criteria stated above This strong          dependence on portal flow arises from the fact that the          liver clearance is limited by liver blood flow for an IV          dose while the first pass clearance of an oral dose is          relatively independent of liver flow This relationship          can be quantitated and Kornhauser et al    used          measurements of the AUC after an IV and oral dose to          estimate the total liver blood flow In addition the          muscle blood flow was doubled for the fit in fig in          order to slightly improve the fit It is not clear          whether this change in muscle flow has some physiological          significance or is basically a sort of fudge          factor          For the output shown in fig B the parameter          findabs was set   This tells PKQuest to use the          input blood levels to determine the intestinal absorption          rate see Appendix for details Setting findabs            will find the rate of input into the venous compartment          corresponding to IM IP or skin absorption Figure          Bshows the standard default PKQuest output format for          this option The open squares are the total predicted          absorption as a function of time The solid line is a          parameter approximation to the actual model total          absorption absorption at time t  A t Ht HT H          where A  total absorption H  Hill exponent T  half          time In most cases this provides a good approximation          to the PO absorption     However in this case the          approximation is poor because of the unusual long initial          delay in the propranolol absorption see below for          discussion The open triangles are the total amount of          systemically peripherally available propranolol          determined by finding the equivalent IV input that would          produce the same plasma levels see Appendix section          III for details The difference between the total          absorption squares and peripheral availability          diamonds is the first pass liver metabolism The time          dependence of the PO absorption has an initial delay of           to  minutes followed by a relatively rapid rate of          absorption that is nearly complete within about           hours          A test of the accuracy of this determination of PO          absorption using plasma concentration data that mimics          the experimental data for propranolol is described in the          Appendix section VI For this test case the total          predicted absorption differs from the actual total PO          input by less than           The next step is to repeat the above calculations but          this time using the simultaneous IV and oral data when          propranolol is administered at the same time as a          standard meal  calorie high protein breakfast              As before since the two sets of data are obtained          simultaneously exactly the same set of physiological          parameters must be used for the IV and oral calculations          Some of these parameters should differ from those used          for the above calculations fig  because of the          changes induced by the meal It is well established that          portal blood flow is increased during a meal Direct          measurements in humans of the time course of portal blood          flow after a meal show an increase of between  and           that peaks  to  minutes after the meal                Olfanoff et al    found an average meal induced          increase in total liver blood flow of about  using          indocyanine green     It has also been shown that the          serum propranolol binding is not affected by meal induced          variations in fatty acids    so that the model          parameters related to lipid binding freepl and ktissi          were not allowed to vary between the fasting and standard          meal experiments          As described above meals have a bidirectional effect          on blood levels decreasing the plasma concentration and          AUC when propranolol is given IV and increasing the          levels and AUC when given orally This bidirectional          meal effect could not be fit just by varying the portal          blood flow In order to quantitatively fit the meal data          it was necessary to increase the value used above for the          Olanoff et al fasting portal blood flow F portal by           and decrease the intrinsic liver propranolol          clearance Tclr liver by  The increased portal          flow is consistent with the indocyanine green          measurements of Olanoff et al     Figure shows the          PKQuest fit to the meal data using this modified          parameter set As before the requirements of a          successful fit to the simultaneous data is that the IV          input model curve fit the observed plasma concentration          fig A and the predicted total absorption for the PO          input case fig B equal the actual amount administered           mg                          Application of PKQuest to a slow release form of          propranolol          In this section PKQuest will be applied to the data          of Takahashi et al    in which the oral absorption          in fasting subjects of a sustained release form of          propranolol Inderal LA was compared with the standard          form in same set of subjects The PBPK parameters used          for these subjects were identical to those determined          above for the IV data of Fagen et al     except          that the value of Tclr liver was adjusted increased by           per Kg body weight so that the total absorption for          the standard propranolol equaled the total oral dose           mg Figure shows the predicted time course for the          experimental data for oral administration of the standard          form fig A and the long acting form fig B It can          be seen that the absorption rate is markedly slowed          There appears to be a significant absorption rate even          for the last data point at  hours It can also be          seen that only about  of the slow release form is          absorbed by  hours  mg absorption of the  mg          dose It is possible that a higher absorption faction          would have been seen if the plasma measurements were          carried out for longer times This result is consistent          with the absorption estimate of  of Takahashi et al              based on measurements of the  hour urinary          excretion of  metabolites of propranolol          Once the PBPK parameters have been determined PKQuest          can be used to predict the blood levels for an arbitrary          set of input functions For example using the above          analysis one can determine the blood levels after          different dosage regimens of the standard and long acting          forms of propranolol This will be illustrated by a          comparison of the blood levels of a daily dose of  mg          of the standard form given in  mg doses  times a day          at  hour intervals versus  mg of the sustained          release form Inderal LA given once a day According to          the Physicians Desk Reference these are roughly          equivalent therapeutic doses The PO absorption rate          Qt is described by the  parameter Hill equations          obtained from the PKQuest output shown in fig          Astandard and Blong acting where Qt  A t Ht          HT H and A  total absorption H  Hill exponent T           half time For the case of the

absorbed for the long          acting form was assumed to be  mg  of the total           mg dose          PKQuest has a simple interface for entering arbitrary          input doses The following input is for the case of           consecutive  mg doses of the standard form at  hour          intervals          ninput          finput          tableorganlivertyperatetbegtendhncsteadypadjust

rate tend and hn          respectively The parameter tbeg indicates the start time          in minutes of each input The parameters csteady and          padjust are not used for this case Figure shows the          predicted blood levels using the Takahashi et al PBPK          parameters for the  times per day standard propranolol          fig A and the once per day long acting form fig          B This calculation of blood levels for  hours          required  seconds on a  Mhz computer It can be seen          that the once per day  mg long acting dose has          significantly lower blood levels then the same daily          dosage of the standard form                            Discussion and Conclusions                  Overview of novel aspects of PKQuest          PKQuest differs from other PBPKs in that it has been          designed to be a complete generalpurpose modeling          program To this end it includes all the different          features that are required to model the commonly          investigated compounds In this and the accompanying          papers       examples of the application of PKQuest          to the human kinetics for D            O inulin propranolol ethanol          toluene anesthetic gases ceftriaxone and dicloxacillin          protein bound antibiotics are presented All of these          studies use the same set of basic physiological          parameters For most of these compounds these results          represent the first complete human PBPK These compounds          cover most of the range of chemical properties that one          would expect to encounter in a pharmacokinetic study The          pharmacokinetics of different solutes depends on          different sets of PBPK parameters For example the time          course of the distribution of D            O    has a strong dependence on          the cardiac output muscle blood flow and total body          water while the kinetics for inulin    have a strong          dependence on the extracellular volume and capillary          permeability Knowing that the same PBPK using the same          set of parameters is applicable to a large variety of          compounds increases ones confidence in the validity of          the parameters          The three accompanying papers illustrate other novel          features of PKQuest a quantitation of first pass          metabolism for nonlinear liver metabolism     b          measurement of capillary permeability     c          description of nonlinear plasma and tissue protein          binding     d pharmacokinetics of volatile solutes              and e importance of perfusionventilation mismatch              Each of these papers provides significant new          information about intensively investigated solutes          The most important of the new features is the option          that provides a quantitative measurement and graphical          output of the time course of the intestinal absorption          and peripheral or systemic availability Calculations          of intestinal absorption have been incorporated into          earlier PBPK calculations based on the assumption that          intestinal absorption could be described by either a          simple first order rate process       or by a          pseudo two    or N    multicompartment process          These intestinal compartmental parameters were then          adjusted to provide the optimal fit to the observed blood          time course In contrast in PKQuest the PBPK equations          are directly solved for the intestinal absorption time          course without any assumptions about the physical or          mathematical form of the absorption process          If the system is linear another method of estimating          the intestinal absorption or peripheral availability is          by the application of the deconvolution approach to the          blood levels after an IV and PO input in the same subject              For the peripheral availability this technique          provides a direct approach with a minimum of model          assumptions In contrast the intestinal absorption          cannot be directly determined by the deconvolution          approach without some additional assumptions    or by          using experimental measurements of the systemic blood          levels produced by portal vein input      Thus          the intestinal absorption feature of PKQuest should          provide a useful new application even for the linear          case          The use of PKQuest to determine the intestinal          absorption or peripheral availability requires that PBPK          parameters first be determined using the IV input          measurements However this does not mean that these          measurements must be made in the same individuals as is          a requirement for the strict deconvolution approach For          example in the above measurement of the rate of          intestinal absorption of the long acting form of          propranolol no IV input information was available for          these subjects The PBPK parameters for these subjects          were determined by using the previously determined          parameters inputting the body weight and fat fraction          for these subjects and by using the assumption that the          short acting form was completely absorbed to determine          the value of the intrinsic liver clearance for these          subjects          The term intestinal absorption used in PKQuest          refers to the total amount that enters the portal vein          Drug that is absorbed and then metabolized by the GI          tract before entering the portal vein will be treated as          if it was never absorbed For the special case of a drug          that is known to be completely absorbed eg ethanol          the difference between the total PKQuest absorption and          the total PO dose is a measure of the GI tract drug          metabolism          PKQuest provides the first rigorous operational          definition of peripheral availability and first pass          metabolism FPM for the nonlinear case As discussed in          detail in the application of PKQuest to ethanol          metabolism     confusion about the definition of FPM          has been the cause of a controversy regarding the          relative importance of gastric metabolism in the overall          ethanol metabolism          One of the most important applications of animal PBPKs          is to predict the time course of drug levels in different          tissues This feature must be used warily when applied to          humans because the tissue partition coefficients are in          most cases not directly measured but are extrapolated          from animal measurements The successful prediction of          the venous plasma concentrations eg figs             does not guarantee that the correct tissue partition          coefficients have been used especially in organs with          small volumes eg brain that have little influence on          the total body disposition The output of PKQuest allows          the simultaneous display of the concentrations in up to           different organs                          Effect of meals on propranolol          pharmacokinetics          The application of PKQuest to the simultaneous          measurements of Olanoff et al    indicates that a          meal has two actions on propranolol metabolism  An          increase in portal blood flow and  A decrease in the          intrinsic liver metabolism of propranolol This meal          induced increase in portal blood flow is a well          documented effect        In contrast the          decrease in metabolism has not been previously          quantitated and Olanoff et al    suggested that the          increase in portal blood flow might be the only change          required to explain the meal effect The decreased          intrinsic clearance presumably results from some          competition in the liver between the absorbed food          products and propranolol          There is another rather peculiar effect of meals on          propranolol kinetics that is not usually commented on A          close look and at the plasma blood level measurements of          Melander et al    and Walle et al    reveals          that the peak in the plasma concentration curve for the          meal case occurs at a slightly earlier time than for the          fasting case This is the opposite of what would be          expected because the meal will significantly delay the          rate of gastric emptying which should delay the peak in          the plasma concentration For example the peak in the          blood ethanol after an oral dose is delayed by about           minutes by a meal because of the delayed gastric emptying               The above PKQuest analysis provides an          explanation for this peculiar effect A comparison of          figs Band Bshows that in the fasting case fig B          there is a long delay about  minutes before any          significant PO absorption occurs This initial delay is          significantly reduced in the meal case fig B This           minute initial delay suggests that some sort of change in          the state of propranolol eg lipid binding or micelle          formation is required before it can be absorbed and that          this change is more rapid in the presence of a meal          Whatever the explanation this ability to obtain high          resolution information about the time course of PO drug          absorption is a useful feature of PKQuest          In addition to providing quantitative information          about the rate of PO drug absorption and peripheral          availability PKQuest also routinely provides a           parameter equation describing the rate of PO absorption          that can be used to predict blood levels for other dosage          regimens This was illustrated above in a comparison of          the same total daily propranolol dose given either           times per day using standard propranolol or once per day          as the long acting form This same approach can be used          to predict blood levels administered via IM IP or          skin                            Competing interests        None declared                    Appendix Details of PKQuest                  I Given a known input to the animal solve for the          venous arterial and organ concentrations as a function          of time          The derivation of the basic set of model equations is          described here This derivation takes pains to          distinguish clearly between weights and volumes of organs          and flows and between the total organ concentration and          the free water concentration In PKQuest volume weight          and time are always in units of liters Kg and minutes          The solute quantity unit moles gms etc is arbitrary          and is set by the user For illustrative purposes it has          been assumed below that the unit is moles The following          definitions are used          v           i  weight Kg of organ i          C           i  amountKg moleKg in organ          i          wfract           i  fraction of weight of

equations required for nonlinear binding will be          described in section IV The solution described in this          section uses the conventional approach that is routinely          used in PBPK models The only aspect that is novel is the          incorporation of a capillary permeability limitation          through the parameter fclear           i           Figure describes the exchange of solute between the          blood and tissue compartment across the capillary wall          It is assumed that the tissue consists of N          capillariesKg all with exactly the same geometry blood          flow permeability etc It will also be assumed that the          relation between the capillary and tissue concentration          is in a pseudo steady state The steady state          differential equation for the concentration in the          capillary as a function of position is                    where C and c are the total and free water          concentration subscript B and T refers to the blood and          tissue compartment P is the capillary permeability N is          the number of capillaries per Kg tissue and a is the          capillary radius The total concentration C           B can be related to the free          concentration c           B  using the definition of fw           b C           B  c           B wfract           b fw           b  Integrating eq  over the length          of the capillary and solving for the venous concentration          leaving the capillary                    where PS is the permeabilitysurface area product per          tissue weight litersminKg Equation  can then be          related to capillary clearance term fcleari for organ          i that is used in PKQuest                    where the dimensionless fclear is equal to the          fractional equilibration that occurs in one pass through          the capillary Note that physical capillary permeability          PS in eq  is multiplied by fw           b  the fraction free in the blood          Thus solutes that have a high intrinsic permeability may          become permeability limited if a large fraction is bound          This case is discussed in detail in the application of          PKQuest to protein bound antibiotics              Using eq  to relate the venous concentration c           V  to the tissue concentration c           T  and the definition of fw to relate          the free to total concentration the differential          equation for the free tissue concentration in organ i c           i  can be obtained from the mass          balance relation for organ i                    where Q is the metabolic utilization and cinput is the          input from outside the body In equation  c           B is the free concentration entering          the organ For the lung c           B corresponds to the venous          concentration and for all other organs c           B is the arterial concentration If          the solute can only distribute in the extracellular          space than the wfract           i term in eq  is replaced by the          product ecf           i  wfract           i where ecf           i is the fraction of extravascular          water in organ i that is extracellular          The mass balance equation for the lung must be          modified to take account of ventilatory exchange of          volatile solutes The total concentration of solute in          the lung C           L  is the sum of the solute in the          lung tissue compartment plus that in the alveolar gas          space                      C           L            ValvC           Alv            C           T            ValvC           Alv            wfract           L           c           L            fw           L           where Valv is the alveolar volume per unit weight          litersKg and C           T is the absolute tissue concentration          which can be related to the free concentration in lung          water c           L  via fw           L  It is assumed that the solute in          alveolar gas is in equilibrium with the lung tissue          water                      C           Alv            c           L            Kwair           where Kwair is the waterair partition coefficient          Thus                    Thus eq  can also be used for the lung with fw          substituted for fw The cinput term in eq  for the lung          can be written in terms of the alveolar ventilation          alvent litersminute                      cinput           L

   the case where there is one lung compartment The          modifications for the case of perfusionventilation          mismatch is described in section V          Equation  is the mass balance for each organ          compartment We still need to define the mass balance for          the arterial and venous compartments For the artery the          mass balance is described by                    where the subscript A indicates artery F           CO is the cardiac output and c L           v is the concentration in the venous          blood leaving the lung The concentration c L           v can be related to the venous          concentration entering the lung c           V  by the use of eq                    Finally substituting eq  into eq                     An equation similar to eq  is obtained for the          venous compartment except that it is necessary to sum          over the venous concentrations leaving each organ          multiplied by the organ blood flow                    where c i           V is the concentration in the vein          leaving organ i The sum is over all the organs that          empty in to the vein i   and  correspond to the          venous and arterial compartments The concentration c i           V can be related to the arterial          concentration entering organ i by the use of eq                    Finally substituting eq  into eq                     The set of differential equations for dc           i dt i   for each of the          organs i   and the venous i   and arterial i            compartments is then solved by a RungeKutta          numerical procedure for the values of c           i as a function of time The free          water concentration c           i is then converted to the          experimental concentration units and plotted along with          the experimental data This conversion depends on exactly          what is measured experimentally In PKQuest the user          inputs the parameter concuniti which characterizes what          experimental unit is used For example concunit            indicates total concentration in units of amountKg wet          weight concunit   corresponds to amountliter tissue          concunit   corresponds to plasma concentration          etc                          II Given the experimental venous concentration as          a function of time solve for rate of oral PO or          intramuscular IM absorption as a function of          time          The solution described above in I corresponds to the          case where the input to one or more of the compartments          is given cinputi and the concentration of the          different compartments as a function of time is solved          for This section describes the new procedure that was          developed to invert this solution and find the value of          cinputi as a function of time that would produce the          experimental venous concentration Although the approach          described below can be used for input into any          compartment the current version of PKQuest implements          only two different inputs  PO input in which the          solute is absorbed from the GI tract and goes directly          into the portal vein where it distributes in and is          metabolized by the liver before entering the systemic          vein and  IV input in which the solute directly enters          the systemic vein The IV input case is applicable to any          input where there is time dependent input directly to the          venous blood without significant distribution in another          organ  eg intramuscular IM intraperitoneal IP or          skin absorption          Since the venous concentration is known experimentally          at a set of time points this concentration can be used          as input to the set of equations described in section I          omitting the venous differential equation since its          concentration is known The solution to this set of          equations then yields the corresponding arterial and          organ concentrations as a function of time In the          implementation in PKQuest a cubic spline interpolation          is applied to the experimental data points to obtain a          continuous function c           v t that is used as input to the set          of equations For the case of IV input these organ          concentrations as a function of time should be equal to          the actual organ concentrations in the experimental case          since both cases have the same venous concentration          For the PO input case all the organs will have the          correct concentration except for the liver which receives          input from the GI tract in addition to the venous input          Another step is required to determine the liver          concentration for this case The differential equation          for the venous compartment eq  can be solved for the          liver concentration c           Liver t since the concentrations in          all the other organs and in the vein are known In eq           the cinput           v term is  since there is no venous          input and Q           V is zero because it is assumed for          this case that there is no metabolism in the venous          compartment The only factor in eq  that is not          directly available is the time derivative of the venous          concentration dc           v dt However this can be estimated          by taking the derivative of the cubic spline          interpolation to the experimental venous data This          solution for the liver concentration is then combined          with the previous solutions to obtain the concentrations          of all the body organs as a function of time for the PO          input case          Knowledge of the concentrations as a function of time          of all the body compartments is all that is needed to          determine the rate of input to the body The total body          input at time t is equal to the total amount in the body          at time t obtained by summing over all the body          compartments plus the total amount that has been          metabolized or excreted up to that time  which is          obtained by integrating over the rates of metabolism Q           i  in the different organs plus the          rate of renal clearance etc In the implementation of          PKQuest this calculated total amount input is plotted as          a function of time A test of this approach is described          below VI using data that is representative of what is          observed experimentally for propranolol It is shown that          the total predicted absorption differs from the actual          total PO input by only about                           III Direct calculation of the first pass          metabolism or peripheral availability for the case of PO          input          The procedure described above in section II for          determining the rate of PO absorption can be directly          used to determine the first pass metabolism In the          calculation in section II two different sets of liver          concentrations were obtained Case  Using just the          experimental venous concentration as input Case  Using          the direct calculation of the liver concentration via the          solution of eq  Case  corresponds to the liver and          other organ concentrations that would be obtained if the          input were intravenous IV and Case  is for a PO input          Both cases have exactly the same venous concentration          This means that both cases have the same peripheral          availability Thus the peripheral availability for the          PO input case can be obtained by solving for the IV input          as a function of time by summing over the amounts in          each organ plus the amount of metabolism using the organ          concentrations for Case  This is a direct measure of          what the time course of the IV input would have to be to          give exactly the same venous concentrations as occurred          for the PO input The first pass metabolism FPM is          directly related to the peripheral availability by the          following relation          First Pass Metabolism  Total Absorption  Peripheral          Availability          In the implementation of PKQuest for the PO absorption          case both the total amount of PO absorption and the          peripheral availability are routine plotted as a function          of time          This is a new definition of first pass metabolism It          provides the first rigorous operational definition of          FPM that is applicable to the nonlinear liver metabolism          case This case is discussed in more detail in the paper          describing the application of PKQuest to ethanol          pharmacokinetics                              IV Modifications of above equations for the case          where there is nonlinear saturable protein          binding          Allowing for nonlinear protein binding seriously          complicates the model It corresponds to the case where          the fw           i in the above equations becomes a          function of c           i t and it requires major          modifications of all of the equations The modifications          described below are similar to those used previously by          Tsuji et al     but with the new feature of          including the capillary permeability This is the first          description of a PBPK model that allows for both          nonlinear binding and capillary permeability          The modifications of the left and right hand sides of          eq  will be described separately The left hand side          described the change in the total bound  free          concentration in organ i                    where as previously defined c           i is the free water concentration and          c b           i is the concentration of the bound          solute in the organ water It will be assumed that there          is only one homogeneous binding site with the classical          Scatchard type binding described by                    where k is the binding constant for the protein and Pb                    i is the concentration of protein          binding sites in compartment i Pb must have the came          units as c eg molesliters and k has the inverse          units eg molesliters It is assumed that there          is only one type of binding protein with a unique k          that is distributed with different concentrations Pb           i  in the different compartments          Taking the derivative of c b           i eq  and substituting it in eq                              For the limiting case where binding does not saturate          kc           i              i in eq  becomes equal to fw           i and eq  becomes equal to the left          hand side of eq           The right hand side of eq  has a term that describes          the balance between the inflow and outflow of blood from          organ i                    where c           B and c i           v are the free concentration in the          blood water entering and leaving organ i and c b           B and c b           v are the bound concentrations          entering and leaving the organ As before c i           v can be related to c           B and the tissue concentration c           i using fclear           i                     Finally substituting eq  into eq  and equating          the right eq  and left hand sides eq  the          generalization of eq  to include nonlinear binding is          obtained                    where the new parameters            B             V and  are defined as follows For          the case where the binding is linear                    For the case of nonlinear binding saturation                    There is one other complication introduced by the          nonlinear binding As shown in eq  the fclear           i that enters eqs  depends on fw                    B which for the nonlinear case is a          function of c           B eq  To take this into account          eq  is solved for the value of fclear           i c           B                     where fclear           i is the clearance in the limit of           concentration and is the value the user inputs to          PKQuest This last expression for fclear           i c           B  is substituted for fclear           i in eqs                           V Modification of lung model to include          ventilationperfusion mismatch          The equation in section I for the lung assumed that          there was one lung compartment perfused by F           CO cardiac output with an alveolar          volume valv that was ventilated at a rate alvent This is          an idealized case and it is known that even in normal          humans the lung is heterogeneous with different regions          receiving different fractions of the cardiac output and          the alveolar ventilation In order to investigate the          significance of the ventilationperfusion mismatch this          feature was incorporated as in option in PKQuest This is          the first time this feature has been used in a PBPK          As was discussed in detail by Wilson and Beck             the standard measurement of the distribution does not          uniquely characterize the actual ventilation and          perfusion heterogeneities to the different regions of the          lung and some additional assumptions must be made The          following derivation closely follows the arguments of          Wilson and Beck     It is assumed that the          probability distribution of ventilation and perfusion can          be described as a bivariate uncorrelated lognormal          function                    where            v and            Q are the means and            v and            Q are the standard deviations of the          log normal distribution The function F returns the          fraction of the lung that has ventilation and blood flow          in the interval           d ln and           d ln centered about ln and ln  The          function can be normalized by the use of the normalized          variables v and q                    In the implementation in PKQuest the lung is divided          into N equal volume regions by finding the sequence          of v           i and q           i i  NN centered about  such          that all integrals of fvdv from v           i to v           i have the same value Then each of          the regions r           ij v           i v           i  q           j q           j  has equal area Each lung region          r           ij is assigned a fraction of the total          blood flow                        ij             defined by                    From the definition of q eq                     where in the second equality in eq  the relation          A of Beck and Wilson    has been substituted for          exp           q  Substituting eq  into eq           and integrating yields the blood flow to the ij region          A similar approach is used to find the ventilation to the          ij region          The overall result of this rather messy procedure can          be summarized as follows The lung is divided into N          equal volume regions each region having a ventilation          and blood flow based on the observed log normal          distributions Each region is defined to have the same          tissue and alveolar volume An important assumption that          has been used here is that the ventilation and perfusion          to each region is uncorrelated This assumption is          consistent with recent direct measurements of regional          perfusion and ventilation               In the implementation in PKQuest the number of lung          compartments Nlung is determined by the parameter Ndim          Nlung   Ndim  The default is Nlung            indicated by Ndim   Choosing Ndim   means that          the perfusion and ventilation is distributed over  lung          compartments which should be enough to provide a good          test of the importance of perfusionventilation mismatch          If Nlung then values are required for            v sigv in PKQuest and            q sigf Default values of sigv and          sigf are included in standardhuman These default values          were obtained using the relation of Wilson and Beck             that relates the standard deviation of the distribution          that is routinely measured            vq  to the values of            v and            q that are required in eqs                     where  is the correlation between perfusion and          ventilation The default values in PKQuest are for the          case of    and            v             q and            vq   the normal value for young          adult men     The user can input arbitrary values by          inputting sigv and sigf This perfusionventilation          mismatch feature is discussed and tested in the paper          describing the application of PKQuest to volatile solutes                                       V Tests of the accuracy of the find absorption          option of PKQuest          The find absorption option see II above for          details predicts the PO absorption as a function of time          based on the observation of plasma concentration at a set          of time points The following test of this calculation          was carried out It is assumed that the PO input is known          and can be described by the following parameter Hill          type equation similar to what was found experimentally          for propranolol in fig            Absorption at time t  A t Ht H T H          where A   micrograms H   T            Figure shows the plasma concentration curve generated          by PKQuest for this known input The solid line is the          model plasma concentration and the squares are the          values of the plasma concentration sampled at the same          time points as the experimental plasma concentration in          the measurements of Olanoff et al    described in          the text The test of the find absorption feature is to          see if PKQuest can reproduce the time dependent          absorption that was used to generate these points eq           just using these experimental points as inputs          Figure shows the output of PKQuest using the find          absorption option using the data points squares from          fig as input The value of the total predicted          absorption differs from the actual total input by only            versus actual  The time dependence of          the absorption is also quite close to the actual input          function eq  with the Hill exponent H differing          by   versus input  and the half time T          differing by   versus input  This agreement          is remarkable considering the coarse discrete samples of          the venous concentration that were used as input to          PKQuest
