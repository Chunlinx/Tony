                    Background        Cells of the innate immune system sense host invasion by        detecting structural determinants that are broadly        conserved among pathogens of a given phylogenetic group          The lipopolysaccharides LPS or endotoxin that        decorate the outer membrane of Gramnegative bacteria are        excellent examples of such determinants In response to        minute concentrations of LPS derived from certain        Gramnegative bacteria macrophages secrete cytokines such        as tumor necrosis factor TNF interleukin IL and        IL which contribute to the containment of infection and        help to initiate a specific immune response On the other        hand overstimulation of the innate immune system through        this channel can lead to acute systemic inflammation and        shock           Dramatic differences in LPS responses are apparent        between closely related species   and there are        substantial differences even among genetically        heterogeneous members of the same species   For        example whereas humans and chimpanzees are generally        considered to be very sensitive to LPS   baboons and        most other primates are highly resistant It is likely that        part of the difference in sensitivity may be explained at a        very proximal level although differences in responses to        cytokines for example TNF may also have a role Neither        interspecific differences nor interindividual differences        in LPS responses have until recently been accessible to        systematic genetic analysis Advances in understanding LPS        signal transduction now permit these issues to be        examined        Although LPS was once thought to exert its effects        through intercalation into biological membranes or to bind        to many different receptors on the cell surface it has        been clear for nearly three decades that there is in fact        a single biochemical pathway for LPS detection This was        indicated by the observation that allelic   mutations of        a single gene          Lps  in mice could entirely abrogate        the response to LPS and did so with great specificity        Mice of the strains CHHeJ   and CBLScCr   are        highly resistant to LPS showing none of the usual        biological effects yet respond normally to other bacterial        products and to most cytokines induced by LPS          We recently identified the         Lps locus through positional cloning          and showed that the LPSresistance phenotype was        caused by defects in the Tolllike receptor  gene          Tlr    In CHHeJ mice a        point mutation PH singleletter aminoacid notation        modifies the protein within the cytoplasmic domain        creating a codominant inhibitory effect on LPS signal        transduction In CBLScCr mice the gene is deleted        yielding a recessive abolition of the LPS response        Subsequently overexpression of the wildtype Tlr protein        was found to enhance LPS signal transduction in wildtype        macrophages lowering the effective concentration EC           for LPS by a factor of  whereas        overexpression of the Tlr Lpsdisoform represented in        CHHeJ mice almost completely suppresses signaling          Furthermore genetic complementation studies have        demonstrated that LPS and Tlr enter into close physical        proximity in the course of signal transduction  Tlr        appears to bind directly to LPS Hence the species origin        of Tlr is the sole determinant of species preference for a        given LPS structure          Mice of the CHHeJ and CBLScCr strains are        abnormally susceptible to infection by certain        Gramnegative bacteria suggesting that timely recognition        of LPS is essential for successful containment of infection           Because deleterious mutations of         Tlr have become fixed spontaneously        in two strains of mice we considered it possible that        other functionally important mutations might be identified        in mice and humans Moreover information on the degree of         Tlr polymorphism in these and other        species might allow inferences about the importance of        different Tlr domains Accordingly we decided to sequence        the entire Tlr gene of both humans and mice and to survey        genetic variation at the locus in each species We also        examined the         TLR sequence from two species of        subhuman primates that have dramatically different        responses to LPS                    Results                  Overall structure of TLRsand Tlr          The mouse           Tlr gene is somewhat longer than          its human counterpart           TLR  owing to the greater length          of intronic sequence   base pairs bp from          beginning to end of the transcribed sequence in the          mouse compared with  bp in the human There are          three exons in           Tlr and each corresponds to a          homologous sequence in the human gene Rock           et al   reported a human cDNA          sequence GenBank accession number U that includes          a fourth exon positioned between the normal first and          second introns When included in the processed          transcript however this exon specifies early          termination of the polypeptide chain Although it is          possible that translation is initiated distal to the          added stop codon and that a shorter product results in          the human than in the mouse this would be unusual given          the length of the  untranslated region UTR that would          then exist and the presence of multiple upstream          initiation codons Moreover there is no murine sequence          homologous to the alternative second exon of the human          gene The biological significance of this exon is          therefore unclear and in all likelihood its inclusion          in the mRNA leads to the formation of a nonfunctional          protein          Neither the human nor the mouse gene has a TATA          element or CAAT box in the proximal promoter region A          number of conserved promoter and enhancer motifs are          apparent on alignment of the murine and human  flanking          sequences and are described in detail elsewhere            Both           Tlr and           TLR lie amid repetitive sequences          of retroviral origin and no other genes are detected          close to either of them using homology searches or the          gene prediction algorithm GRAIL In Figure  the          grayscale images of the human and mouse genes call          attention to the repetitive elements in the region and          illustrate the relationship between exons and spacing in          the two species                          Genetic variation at the mouse Tlrlocus          Among  strains of           Mus musculus   different alleles          were identified on the basis of mutations at  sites          with respect to the reference sequence Of these           create aminoacid substitutions Table  Figure  The          most common murine allele was represented at a frequency          of only  The ancestry of different           Tlr alleles can be traced by          haplotype analysis as many deviations from the reference          allele occur in conjunction with one another A plausible          arrangement of strain relationships is presented in          Figure  Some strains have accumulated many more          mutations than others For example the PJ strain           Tlr gene exhibits  mutations the          distinguish it from the most common haplotype six of          them specifying changes in the Tlr aminoacid sequence          the SEAGnJ strain differs by nine mutations and the          strains NZWJ and VMDk which are identical to one          another differ from the most common haplotype at six          sites Shared mutations suggest that introgression took          place after mutational separation had occurred leading          to the introduction of groups of mutations by genetic          recombination Hence mice of the PJ NZWJ and VMDk          strains have several mutations that are observed in the          AJ and BALBc strains but also lack some of the          mutations of the latter strains and have unique mutations          of their own          Most of the murine mutations reside within exon  and          only two substitutions are noted that modify the          cytoplasmic domain Figure  Of these however one          mutation RH is fairly common among the strains          surveyed and the corresponding residue has been reported          as an H in the hamster A single conservative          substitution VI was noted within the transmembrane          domain of the PJ strain                          Anthropoid ape and lower primate TLRsequences and          their relationship to the human and rodent          sequences          The human and chimpanzee aminoacid sequences are          nearly identical over the interval studied distinguished          by only three substitutions The baboon sequence is           identical to the human in the extracellular domain          differs in the transmembrane domain by one substitution          out of  residues and differs in the proximal          cytoplasmic domain by only one residue in  At the          carboxyl terminus however homology is badly disrupted          so that  of the last  human residues are not          replicated in the baboon protein which is  amino acids          shorter than the human protein Similarly among rodents          the carboxyl terminus of the protein is the least          conserved Overall the order of conservation with          respect to domain is proximal cytoplasmic domain           transmembrane domain  extracellular domain           distal cytoplasmic domain Table  Figure                             Discussion        The pathway by which LPS activates host innate immune        defenses has been illuminated by the positional cloning of         Lps and establishment of its identity        with         Tlr   a mammalian        representative of an ancient family of receptors   that        serve both developmental and defensive functions The        function of Tlr as the LPS signal transducer became clear        when mapping   and sequencing   data revealed         Tlr as the only gene in a critical         megabase Mb region and furthermore showed that two        strains of LPSresistant mice are homozygous for mutations        of         Tlr that are absent in closely        related LPSsensitive strains        In         Drosophila  the prototypic homolog        of the mammalian Tolllike receptors Toll defends against        fungal infection   whereas the protein wheeler        defends against bacterial infection   In the case of        Toll there is no evidence of direct contact between the        receptor and the microbial pathogen or its components        Rather infection activates a proteolytic cascade that        leads to the production of an endogenous ligand Sptzle        which in turn engages Toll The situation is apparently        different in mammals in which Tlr is clearly a direct        interface with the microbial world As such the primary        structure of a Tlr molecule determines ligand specificity          accounting for the wellknown observation that mouse        cells can recognize tetraacyl lipid A as an agonist          whereas human cells recognize it as an antagonist                     As mice of the CHHeJ strain are highly susceptible to        infection by Gramnegative bacteria it would seem        plausible that among human patients with Gramnegative        sepsis some individuals may have been at risk by virtue of        mutations in         TLR  The first step in determining        whether different isoforms of Tlr confer added risk of or        protection against sepsis is the assessment of genetic        variability at this locus in the normal population        Whereas ablative mutations of         Tlr abolish the capacity to detect        LPS the question arises as to whether less severe mutation        might alter either the specificity of LPS detection as        discussed above or the magnitude of the LPS signal Our        present knowledge of Tlr structural variation in mice may        permit an answer to this question insofar as the mutations        might easily be recreated and measurements of        signaltransducing activity through the modified receptors        carried out in immortalized CHHeJ macrophages          Animals of the AJ and PJ strains have defective        tumoricidal capacity       although in        neither case is the         Lps locus implicated in the        defect        Deleterious mutations of         TLR might reasonably be sought in        individuals who have developed serious Gramnegative        infections on the premise that mice with deleterious        mutations of         Tlr are rendered susceptible to such        infections Similarly in birds a polymorphism at the         tenascin locus which lies a few        megabases proximal to         Tlr in mice predicts susceptibility        to Gramnegative infection   suggesting that it may        lie in linkage disequilibrium with a particular form of the        avian         Tlr gene Beyond this it may be        assumed given the powerful proinflammatory activity of        the receptor that germline or somatic mutations of         TLR could in some instances cause        constitutive signal transduction as observed with the         Drosophila Toll locus   such        mutations might in principle account for certain        inflammatory diseases In fact in the         Lpr model of systemic lupus        erythematosus the         Lps locus was believed a likely        modulator of phenotype   This would seem still more        likely at present given the paucity of other candidate        genes in the immediate vicinity of         Tlr          The evolutionary conservation of         Tlr is of particular interest in        that different species show preferential responses to some        LPS forms and not others       and have        particular set points for responses to toxic LPS        molecules An assessment of variability may be made through        comparison of different species but is complemented by the        study of a large number of individuals within species Both        approaches reveal that the extracellular domain of Tlr is        highly variable compared with the transmembrane domain and        proximal cytoplasmic domain of the protein Pooling the        number of mutable sites in the extracellular domain and        transmembrane domain of humans and mice  coding changes        are observed compared with two in the proximal cytoplasmic        domain Moreover variability does not seem confined to any        particular region of the extracellular domain but is        spread uniformly across its length        The extracellular domain of any receptor is concerned        principally with ligand recognition Given that the ligand        is an endogenous protein extracellular domain conservation        tends to be strict insofar as mutations affecting        extracellular domain structure are likely to diminish        specificity or affinity of binding Hence proteinbinding        receptors tend to be minimally polymorphic The presumed        ligand for Tlr is LPS itself presented alone or in        conjunction with another protein for example CD          and the relatively high frequency of polymorphism observed        in Tlr may be viewed as a consequence of the protective        effect rendered by LPS recognition and the variability of        LPS structure        The cytoplasmic domain of Tlr is far more stringently        conserved than the extracellular domain This is probably        due to the fact that the cytoplasmic domain of Tlr is not        required to cope with a ligand of variable structure        Rather when called upon to signal it must do so        utilizing transducing molecules with conserved structures        On the other hand the intensity of the LPS signal has        apparently been optimized for each species   perhaps        ensuring that the response to LPS is appropriately        integrated into the immune response as a whole Humans        ungulates and rabbits for example exhibit an intense        response to low concentrations of LPS whereas the lower        primates and most rodents are relatively more resistant          The highly variable carboxyterminal end of the Tlr        cytoplasmic domain may be seen as the embodiment of        interspecific differences in LPS sensitivity although the        poor conservation of this portion of the molecule might        alternatively be taken to indicate a neutral effect of        mutation It is also possible that this region of the        molecule is subject to a higher rate of mutation than that        applying to the rest of the protein Although most such        mutations might be removed by selection some might be        discovered in populations defined by the occurrence of        Gramnegative sepsis                    Materials and methods                  Determination of the complete mouse  Tlr and          human  TLR genomic sequences          The mouse bacterial artificial chromosome BAC C          from the J strain Research Genetics was previously          shown by us to contain the           Tlr gene in its entirety            and a small fraction of           Tlr was also found in the          overlapping BAC I   Human           TLR was identified in BAC P          Genome Systems by hybridization screening using a          PCRamplified human TLR cDNA sequence as a probe All          three BACs were fragmented by ultrasound shotgun cloned          into the vector pBluescriptKS and extensively sequenced          using ABI model  and  sequencers using Big Dye          terminators  reads were obtained from I           reads from P and  reads from C The          average read length was approximately  nucleotides To          concentrate data acquisition efforts on the           Tlr and           TLR genes themselves PCR primers          were fashioned to match regions flanking each gene A           kb fragment was amplified from the mouse BAC C and          a  kb fragment was amplified from the human BAC P          each containing all exons of the respective gene These          fragments were also shotgun cloned and extensively          sequenced so that the depth of sequence reached an          average of  reads over the area of greatest interest          Sequence assembly used the programs phred and Phrap          obtained from Brent Ewing and Phil Green University of          Washington Genome Center Interpretation of repetitive          elements was achieved with the program RepeatMasker          obtained from Arian Smit University of Washington          Genome Center A contiguous highquality sequence           bp in length containing           TLR  was obtained from the human          BAC and a contig  bp in length containing           Tlr  was obtained from the mouse          BAC Over these intervals the error rate was estimated          at  per  bp These sequences have been posted to          GenBank in annotated form accession number AF for          the murine sequence and AF for the human sequence          All data related to mutations are presented with          reference to these sequences                          Sequencing DNA from mouse chimpanzee and baboon          samples          Mouse DNA obtained from animals of            Mus musculus strains was ordered          from the Jackson Laboratories Chimpanzee and baboon DNA          were obtained from Kurt Benirschke University of          California San Diego and Gregory Delzoppo Scripps          Research Institute respectively          The three principal exons of           Tlr were amplified independently          from mouse genomic DNA samples leaving a margin of          approximately  bp to each side of the exons so as to          indentify intronic mutations that might alter splicing          All exons of the chimpanzee were amplified and sequenced          using the same primers used to amplify and sequence the          human exons For the baboon the first two exons were          also amplified using these same primers however the          third exon of the baboon was amplified with a substituted          primer at the  end          The PCR products were isolated by agarose gel          electrophoresis Exons  and  were sequenced using the          same primers that were used for amplification Exon  was          sequenced using the flanking primers as well as a          collection of eight internal primers In this manner the          entire coding region and all splice junctions of           Tlr could be covered with a total          of  sequencing reads All primers used for          amplification and sequencing are presented in Table           separate sets were used to amplify and sequence mouse and          the primate samples          Independent assembly of each sample was required as a          condition for further analysis and if such assembly          failed additional reads were executed using a secondary          collection of primers Thereafter mutations were          identified           en masse by pooling all of the          reads from  to  samples at a time and reassembling          with the program polyphred using the phredPhrapPoly          script obtained from Natalie Kolker University of          Washington Genome Center Consed            alpha obtained from David Gordon          University of Washington Genome Center was used to          visualize reads and mutations          The annotated chimpanzee exon sequences have been          submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers AF          AF and AF The baboon sequences have been          submitted with the accession numbers AF AF          and AF For genetic comparisons rat Genbank          AF and hamster AF           Tlr sequences were also used                          Genetic computation          A  MHz DECalpha system equipped with  Mbytes of          memory was used for direct analysis of sequence data as          described above In addition to the programs already          mentioned the GCG software version  was used for          alignment analysis with the program Pileup used in          multiple alignments of protein sequences The          windowsbased program Generunner  Hastings Software          was used for the design of oligonucleotide primers A          spline curve describing heterogeneity of the Tlr          polypeptide sequence from different species was produced          using the program Prism  Graphpad Software          Sequences were prepared for submission with the use of          the program Sequin  obtained from the National          Center for Biotechnological Information
