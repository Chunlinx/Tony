                so uh what do you wear to work   uh well uh traditionally i wear a pair of blue jeans and a dress shirt   all right   uh and and uh uh leather shoes its pretty casual   yeah well thats good where do you work   uh at the for the Navy i work in uh research right right   NTSC huh i used to work in that building right right before i worked at Honeywell i worked at ARI which is on the PM trade side     uhhuh right right   all right imagine that   theres all kinds of uh coincidences here um yeah thats thats a pretty good environment actually when i worked for ARI they made me wear uh well they didnt make make wear anything but they prefer that i wore something almost tieish   yeah real close there yes its uh it depends upon the interaction you have with the outside world and i have several suits that if im going to interact with the outside world or with upper management that i will dress accordingly   right right okay   but for day to day work uh its pretty casual   all right what kind of research do you do Kyle   uh flight simulation   get out are you kidding me   nope yeah thats what i do     im uh im working with flight controls and displays up here at Honeywell       um in fact my dissertation will involve uh auditory warnings   well thats interesting   eye cast things like that so uh yeah its amazing   uhhuh   um no up here at Honeywell we generally its real real laid back in terms of dress uh most people have never seen a tie i dont think unless theyre meeting with a with a customer   right i shouldve remembered that the last time i was up there   yeah and oh you were up at oh thats right you said youd spend some time up here at Honeywell   yeah i went up there its been four uh about three four years now   do you remember which department or which branch you were at   uh   probably not huh   uh Minneapolis whoever makes the   okay yeah im not real sure about that ive only been up here a little while so im still kind of getting the hang of it but actually ill be back down in May to finish my degree so uh thatll be good   hum   do you have much connection with the human factors people down there   uh in fact yes i do uh as soon as i get out of some work im doing right now ill be talking to them uh uh and getting some low cost uh uh equipment together to do some uh human factor studies   yeah all right great well ill probably be using some of it i hope when i get back give me a good vehicle to do my dissertation on maybe but uh yeah actually that its  and all those people     right ill be working with uh uh Carolyn Carolyn Prince   oh okay right great but uh no aside from that i dont think ive worn a tie more than about once here and thats uh   well its pretty casual here   yes they kind of had to twist my arm to do that because i wasnt meeting with a customer but you know how that works   umhum   but uh   oh the jeans are new i mean its not like theyre theyre bleached out or   well yeah  it sounds like you got all holes over the place now the guys that   no no no   the guys that im working with here the guy that i work directly with uh in my office he usually comes in in real ripped jeans hes pretty uh real casual in fact almost too casual     im not quite that bad   plus uh yeah i was kind of surprised to see that actually   hum   so uh where else did you work before that   ive been ive been working here for the center for uh uh nine years nine plus years now   yeah all right you like it   yeah it has its its its you know it had its had its good times and bad times but for the most part yeah i think its pretty good   yeah i i liked it too it its kind of weird that that environment is is different than a lot of other environments just because youre in in a little maze of cubicles you know and its kind of its just   yeah its kind of like being in a rat trap   yeah it is in a way and   and i keep on wondering where the cheese is     presumably thats supposed to be the paycheck right but whos to say   well thats awfully small cheese if you ask me then   yeah no kidding but uh now that the whole idea of them pumping white noise over the speakers to mask out the telephones and things like that its kind of interesting   yeah there was a lot of uh thought put into that because i i i because when i go to other new facilities whether it be uh uh uh uh McDonald Douglas some of the other new facilities ive been to theres   yeah   and little things that they point out to me when i was walking around well this was done because of this or this was done because of that   so theyre actually kind of thinking it through huh   yeah oh well the architect tries to throw it in but uh sometimes i wonder when they put back the people thats supposed to be monitoring the building   right   uh how much reins they got       but they give them an award   well thats i guess thats the important part for them but uh so what do you uh do you think youre going to stick around there for a while or do think   uh yeah yeah theres theres uh prospect job prospects with another company that i should know uh more weve been talking back and forth for about a year and a half now   yeah yeah ive actually im actually kind of looking for work when i get back
