        okay     well are you a fisher person are you   yes i love to fish   what kind great what kind of fishing do you do   well its mostly from the rivers and lakes   in California   and yes and from the banks i dont like to go out on boats   oh       well what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods   well it uh down here we usually catch catfish and bass stripped bass you know where i fish and trout up at uh Lake Shasta when i go up there   uhhuh oh   but i like it all except uh really i dont i dont really care that much for the trout i think i had rather have a catfish than i would a trout   well  i i dont blame you i grew up in Nebraska and uh grew up fish cat fishing in the Little Blue River and then uh we moved to uh South Dakota and uh did a lot of walleye fishing on the Missouri River   uhhuh   and uh now that we are down here i think a lot of people do some uh bass fishing and striped bass fishing but uh i still uh i am sort of a catfish man at heart   i see well uh like in uh Iowa and Nebraska those little bullheads they look just like catfish huh   yep yeah they do   you know thats what i mean cause i am from Iowa   oh   and uh you know we use to catch those little bullheads and thats they look just like baby catfish   yeah   you know uh did you get to go fishing very often   oh yeah i like to fish the only problem is i just moved to Texas so its been a little over a year now but uh   uhhuh   i i am not quite sure what residency is for a fishing license here and i so really i havent gone fishing for about two years now   uhhuh   and its driving me crazy but uh one of these days i will go over to uh Lake Louisville or uh  what is it uh Ray Hubbard Lake Ray Hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while   uhhuh well uh you like to eat them after you catch them     well yeah sure you bet   because theres are a lot of people that like to go fishing but they dont like to eat them   well most yeah most of the time uh if we catch something well take it home and eat it um   you know   and youre right i mean i like to fish for trout and they are really uh uh good fighters but uh if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldnt be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu   yeah i know if i go to a restaurant and order fish its usually either salmon or uh red snapper   yeah   you know     well uh so do you just uh uh skin your catfish or do you fillet them out how do you how do you   we skin skin them yeah yeah yeah just cut their heads off and skin them and then i just uh flour them salt and pepper them and cook them   do you okay yeah   i dont put that corn meal on them   no   you know uh thats the way my mother taught me to fry them so   well thats how we do it too uh although we uh use to set some uh trout lines out and weve caught you know         fourteen fifteen pound catfish and sometimes those are good to uh do on a barbecue grill   uhhuh uhhuh   and just uh leave the skin on and uh do it with uh butter on uh on on tin foil   uhhuh   and then the skin just basically scrapes right off and uh were and it really tastes pretty good   yeah well you know i dont think ive ever tried cooking those uh catfish quite that big uh most of them are just the small you know pan frying ones   there uh yeah   so uh   well i am hoping one of these days ill have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on uh a rod and reel but uh so far its just been on uh on the trout lines so   um       wouldnt that be something   yeah     its a thrill when you get a big fish though isnt it   yeah and uh well and up in uh South Dakota on the in the Missouri River there weve uh tied into a few northern pike and uh   you know   they really uh in in when the water is cold they are very slow moving fish but in the summer time theyll uh give you a run for your money   uhhuh so when you were when you did go fishing where did you go you moved there from where Nebraska   uhhuh yeah   so it was just like the rivers and uh and the lakes i suppose huh   in in Nebraska   yeah   uh yeah most of the time uh we just fished uh in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that that we could fish in   uhhuh uhhuh   and a lot of them ended up being close to the river so if the river ever uh flooded you know then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits   uhhuh   so wed do a lot of fishing there too but uh South Dakota didnt really have much for
