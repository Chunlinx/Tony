        oh no i hadnt heard about Bo Jackson though what happened   well Bo was uh playing football actually you know he plays both football and baseball and baseball and he was plays and during a tackle he ended up either damaging his hip or you know injuring his hip   yeah plays for the Raiders   and theres been arthritis and hes been out for a number of of seasons games and it just as of announced today the Kansas City Royals put him up on waivers made him a free agent so theyre saying now that Bo knows arthritis and it could be actually a career ending injury   uh i didnt know that   so they had uh theyre having actually a special on today and they were mentioning that and even though Kansas City may have dropped him some other teams may pick him up but the big thing was that Nike uh the athletic shoe company is still going to keep him on as one of there cross trainer sponsors and since that makes him more money anyhow   well yeah it does he has more money out of the uh ads than he does the game itself   yeah he does it its pretty amazing though how much he can get for endorsements anymore   i well i think uh Joe Montana got something like a million dollars for saying im going to Disneyland   i wouldnt be surprised whatsoever on the same program they had Michael Jordan they were saying that he gets about six million dollars for playing with the Chicago Bulls about i think two million dollars for endorsing McDonalds and fourteen million dollars for his endorsements with Nike and then of course hes got uh Wheaties also   outrageous prices yeah     and thats thats in a year thats uh what would you do with all that money   uh i i wouldnt know what to do with it       we just discussing what wed do with five thousand     yeah i could make that go a lot of places         its amazing anymore theres a also a program on this evening about the a very sports intensive evening it seems to be on TV about the business of college athletics   uh the uh achievement for the lets see how are they putting that uh the school lets see the academic report board review board uh the deans being it more involved with the athletes   uhhuh   yeah i was watching that   yeah it it talked about all SMU and their the death penalty and how theyre getting around all the regulations and rules and and things of that nature i guess anymore its just a big business   yeah well uh some of for most of the people i guess it is for some of them though they do it just for the love of it   uhhuh   uh   i think it also probably also more is more as you get into the the big schools the ones that the TVs are going to cover and things anyhow when you still have the the lower sides or the smaller schools theyre all doing it just for the for the love of the game because theyre not getting the big revenues from anyone   well thats not necessarily true though you know uh im an avid uh basketball fan of Bull   uhhuh   and i know that the coach there gets a million dollars when he quits   yeah   or you know and so you know hes doing it because he wants to   they actually mentioned a little on the fact that hes started to instigate a program where hes actually uh not necessary they say hes getting around the rules somewhat but its actually sounds like a pretty good idea where he goes out and recruits other students who dont meet the minimum academic requirements to get into the college and and then qualify for a student athlete position and he takes them and signs some contract or something with them but sends them then then to junior college   yeah i heard about that i havent heard much about it though   so at least thats uh some way that theyre you know i i guess the best part about it you cant just drop off all scholarship scholarships because it does i would imagine at least in its intentions help a lot of people who couldnt afford to go to school   yeah   but that seemed like it was actually uh you know if theres a good way to get around a rule that sounded like it was a pretty smart way   you dont think yeah i dont know if it would be dishonest or honest though   well uh at least its hopefully still helping the the student   yeah its yeah its helping the kids   youre not uh going to graduate somebody who still cant read and write   uh its happened too much   thats way too much yes it has   yeah well we veered from the subject     yeah but thats quite all right i think they just want to have some kind of normal conversation   i hope so         its happened to me more than once   does it   yeah almost all the time   really well theres been uh actually some pretty interesting interesting topics that ive had ive had things from uh tax reform to baseball to fishing those are the three ive participated in   i havent had anything on fishing ive had uh oh arts and crafts uh football basketball and baseball   uhhuh well heck you   child rearing or child day care   uhhuh   and couple other things i cant remember   wow sounds like you participated quite a bit   yeah well almost everyday the  the lines are open   uhhuh do you normally receive the calls or is it pretty much split   uh halfandhalf   is it well thats good   oh you know uh i had to start out doing it i done it about five times and then uh here lately they ive been letting them catch me   umhum well thats good well its been enjoyable speaking with you   all right well you take it easy bye   all righty goodbye
