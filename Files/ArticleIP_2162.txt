                                 Welcome to SLATE            Anintroduction and apologia            By MichaelKinsley            The name It meansnothing or practically nothing We chose it as an empty vessel into which wecan pour meaning We hope SLATE will come to mean good original journalism inthis new medium Beyond that who knows Good magazines are exercises inserendipity Creditor blamefor the name SLATE by the way goes to DavidWeld then of Microsoft now of Cognisoft Corp            A Seattle cyberwag saysthat the name SLATE is appropriate because whenever he asks anyone fromMicrosoft Hows your project coming along the answer he usually gets iss late SLATE  in fact has been reasonably prompt Less than sixmonths ago it was a fourpage memorandum and a single Internet naif SLATE isnot the first webzine but everyone in this nascent business is stillstruggling with some pretty basic issues Starting an online magazine is likestarting a traditional paper magazine by asking OK you chop down the treesThen what            To be honest we arerunning late on a few things For the readeryouthere is good news and badnews here The good news is that our billing system isnt ready yet We intendto charge  a year for SLATE That is far less than the cost of equivalentprint magazines because theres no paper printing or postage But  for two years is more than zero which is what Web readers are used topaying We believe that expecting readers to share the cost as they do inprint is the only way serious journalism on the Web can be selfsupportingDepending completely on advertisers would not be healthy even if it werepossible            And wewant to be selfsupporting Indeed one of SLATEs main goals is to demonstrateif we can that the economies of cyberspace make it easier for our kind ofjournalism to pay for itself Most magazines like SLATE depend on someonesgenerosity or vanity or misplaced optimism to pay the bills Butselfsupporting journalism is freer journalism As AJ Liebling said freedomof the press is for those who own one If the Web can make serious journalismmore easily selfsupporting that is a great gift from technology todemocracy            For the moment though SLATE is yours for free So enjoyWe expect to start requiring registration in a few weeks and to requirepayment beginning Nov             The bad news for readersis that some features arent quite ready yet Prime among them is The Frayour readerdiscussion forum Meanwhile though please email any comments youmay have to slatemsncom Well be publishing a traditional Letters to theEditor page until The

Have a Slant                        SLATE is owned byMicrosoft Corp and that bothers some people Can a giant software company putout a magazine that is free to think for itself All we can say is thatMicrosoft has made all the right noises on this subject and we look forward toputting the companys handsoff commitment to the test But the concern strikesme as misplaced In a day of media conglomerates with myriad daily conflicts ofinterestTime Warner Rupert Murdochs News Corp DisneyABChow can it be abad thing for a new company to begin competing in the media business Ajournalist who worries about Microsoft putting out a magazine is a journalistwith a steady job            Readers may also wonderwhether SLATE will have a particular political flavor The answer is that we donot set out with any ideological mission or agenda On the other hand we arenot committed to any artificial balance of views We will publish articles fromvarious perspectives but we will not agonize if the mix averages out to besomewhere other than dead center LINK TO TEXT EEE            A good magazine thoughdoes develop a personality an attitude LINK TO TEXT FFFand someprejudiceseven crotchets A few of SLATEs are already becoming clear Indiscussing current events we have a preference for policy over politics Wedrather discuss the effect of Bob Doles taxcut proposal on the economy thanits effect on Bill Clinton Within the policy arena we seem to have a specialfondness for economics This was not planned its one of those serendipitousdevelopments I mentioned Whether it reflects good luck or bad luck is a matterof taste yours            Finally we intend to takea fairly skeptical stance toward the romance and rapidly escalating vanity ofcyberspace We do not start out with the smug assumption that the Internetchanges the nature of human thought or that all the restraints that societyimposes on individuals in real life must melt away in cyberia There is adeadening conformity in the hipness of cyberspace culture in which we dontintend to participate Part of our mission at SLATE will be trying to bringcyberspace down to earth            Should be fun Thanks forjoining us

feature from Newsweek s Conventional WisdomWatch which is often an effort to set the spin rather than describe itAnyway the CW Watch was a ripoff of a similar feature in the NewRepublic when I was the editor there And TNR s feature itself waslifted from Washington DCs City Paper  which was edited at the timeof the theft by Jack Shafer now deputy editor of SLATE Go back            TEXT DDD Those dreadwords longer articles raise one of the big uncertainties about thisenterprise How long an article will people be willing to read on a computerscreen We have several answers to this question  We dont know Clearlyits less than on paper but how much less is uncertain  Were determined totest the outer limits  Well do our best graphically to make reading onscreen a more pleasant experience suggestions welcome  Well also makeSLATE as easy as possible to print out  This will become less of a problemas screens are developed that can be taken to bed or the bathroom  Twothousand words Or at least were startingoptimistically perhapswith thehope that  words or so is not too much By contrast a typicalprintmagazine feature or cover story might run anywhere from  to words            At least amongnoncyberheads the computerscreen problem seems to be everyones favoriteconversational thrust with regard to SLATE In recent months Ive been amazedto learn of the places and postures in which people like to read magazines Bedand bath are just the beginning At a Seattle dinner party a woman made theinteresting point that her problem isnt the screen Its the chair Evenergonomic computer chairs are designed for typing not for reading For thiswoman and for others who may feel the same way we have asked severalfurniture designers to sketch a real computer reading chairone you can curlup in with your mouse and your cup of Starbucks and read SLATE online Thatfeature will appear in a week or two Go back            TEXT EEE In this regardwe are more like the newsmagazines Time  Newsweek  US News World Report than the overtly political magazines such as the NewRepublic  National Review  or the Weekly Standard  Each ofthe newsmagazines may have an identifiable political tilt But pushing aparticular line is not what they are fundamentally about and knowing wherethey average out wont tell you what any individual article will say Goback            TEXT FFF This isdifferent from
