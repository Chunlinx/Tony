               yeah discuss funding for AIDS research um   yes   uh lets see i dont know obviously theyre not spending enough now so   yeah well i dont know i really am not sure what theyre spending on AIDS AIDS research i get the impression its a pretty sizeable chunk of money i was always uh uh gosh im trying to remember where it was but recently uh somebody on the news said that one of the problems with uh AIDS research was that each time they find somebody with you know about every fourth or fifth person theyve diagnosed with AIDS has got a new strain it seem to be mutating just like about about like the common cold   umhum   finding a cure for something like that could be several hundred years in the making   yeah um it just depends i mean i think you know theyll probably spend tons of money on it you know  under the AIDS name but its probably not just being directed in the right channels you know could   well  yeah the   who knows how much of its you know its actually going to that particular study where so so much money gets spent on useless stuff anyways i mean   yeah the general yeah the general human   on promotional campaigns and you know something like for every dollar that   yeah   that they get maybe eighty cents of it goes to you know awareness i mean thats twenty cents only twenty cents for left for actual research and i mean i dont know maybe the Magic Johnson thing   yeah   i know hes trying put put yeah i just   yeah that might help the it might help the awareness part but uh   you werent yet  well i dont know how much hes going to you know actually see im just a little skeptical on that because you know first week that you heard all about that you know it was always in the news and now its kind of just   yeah   you know you hear only time you hear about it now is when he showed up at a Laker game on the sidelines so   yeah i dont know it you know the uh funding situation seems to be the same for for so many of the major diseases so to speak the uh bulk of the money goes to administrative costs   umhum   which usually means high salaries for people running the show and a major name researchers involved with it you know who knows what actually gets done as far as true research seems   exactly um i dont know i just  better do something about it in the next few years its getting pretty ridiculous uh out of hand i mean   yeah it seems everywhere you turn somebodys coming up with it wild part about it nobody seems to want to suggest the idea that doing without is the only safe way of keeping from getting it   hm   they figured well you know we all want to be promiscuous so go running all over the place and   yeah i still dont know anybody personally thats had it i mean i say i guess once that happens and it you know its getting close you know that   yeah   but   no therere there are people who dont get it from promiscuity but theres the sorts who get it through blood transfusions   yeah thats just thats something   yeah thats the saddest cases of all of   thats so unfortunate the innocent bystandard   or that woman who died just recently the one who died just recently got it uh from her dentist something like twenty two twenty three years old died of AIDS she got it because her dentist had it and didnt use any precautions   umhum   i dont know but those are the sad cases   yeah is um is there big uh what what part of Mississippi do you live in   southern Mississippi   okay is there um do you all have a lot of um i know i i do know that like down here theres a lot um people complaining that because Dallas they um didnt like hardly give any money for the um AIDS uh programs out here in fact they had to cut back on it you know because the city budget and that was a big theres been a lot of people you know protesting that lately out here and   yeah   i didnt know i was just just you know since there something like that gone on down there or   um right now as far as the state budget concerning AIDS awareness im not even sure that there is i know there isnt any on the city level or on the county level im not sure if the states got much of anything on the AIDS awareness i think most of the AIDS awareness information is more or less coming through private sector um the uh   yeah i just know that you know that it was just some i mean hundred and forty thousand i think was all that you know for a years budget that they were providing i mean   either that or   i mean thatll get you a couple of things but i mean  it just   yeah   you know i dont know i mean   course then again most of the people who are protesting the cut in the budget would probably be just as upset if they raised the tax city taxes to cover the costs uhhuh   yeah and theyre just they had a little um stage thing where they all came in and started lying down on the city
