                    Background        Psoriasis is a common skin disorder affecting  to         percent of the worlds population     Treatment of the        disease results in costs that range between  to more        than  billion dollars annually in the US alone     One        of the most costeffective forms of potential treatment for        the disease is the use of antithyroid thioureylenes such a        propylthiouracil We previously reported the effectiveness        of thioureylene treatment in patients with plaque psoriasis               a finding since confirmed by others            The mechanism of action of antithyroid thioureylenes in        psoriasis remains unclear The drugs have been studied with        relation to their effect in Graves hyperthyroidism which        like psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder              Antithyroid thioureylenes of which propylthiouracil        methimazole and carbimazole are used in clinical practice        have known immunomodulatory properties     and in        the case of psoriasis also have antiproliferative effects        as demonstrated by their ability to produce a decline in        markers of cellular proliferation such as proliferative        cell nuclear antigen PCNA            Skin antigenpresenting cells Langerhans cells appear        to play an important role in the initiating events that        lead to the cytokine cascade that results in keratinocyte        proliferation and development of psoriatic lesions              Effective therapeutic approaches to psoriasis        treatment such as psoralen UVA therapy PUVA which        result in depletion of APCs in the skin      and        UVB     lead to one of the most sustained improvement        in psoriasis IL a product of Langerhans cells and skin        monocytes plays a pivotal role in Tcell activation that        leads to formation of the psoriatic plaque     IL        levels are also significantly raised in patients with        Graves hyperthyroidism and are reduced following treatment        with propylthiouracil            CDa is expressed in differentiated antigenpresenting        cells and monocytes and is used as a marker for the        presence of these cells in the skin       The CD        molecules are the products of five CD genes located on        chromosome  The genes are closely related to the mixed        histocompatibilty complex MHC genes indicating origin        from a common precursor     CD molecules however        have limited sequence homology to MHC class I and II        molecules and unlike the MHC molecules are also capable of        binding nonprotein antigens             The present study was performed to examine the effect of        propylthiouracil treatment of patients with plaque        psoriasis on CDa expression in their psoriatic lesions in        order to determine whether this form of therapy resulted in        depletion of APCs from affected skin that could account        for the therapeutic benefit of PTU in this disorder                    Methods                  Patients          Six patients M F with stable plaque psoriasis          were recruited for study The patients ranged in age from           to  years mean  SD    years None of the          patients was taking any form of topical or systemic          treatment other than emollients for psoriasis for at          least six weeks prior to entry into the study Pregnant          women and patients with thyroid dysfunction determined by          preenrollment screening thyroid function tests were          excluded from the study The Institutional Review Board          of the University of California Irvine approved the          study                          Clinical Scoring          Clinical evaluation was performed by the same          dermatologist VSN at the time of patient entry into the          study and monthly intervals until completion of the          study Scoring was based on the PASI scoring system                                       Biopsy Samples          Biopsy samples were taken from patients at the start          and after  months of PTU treatment from the same          psoriatic lesion Skin samples were obtained using a  mm          punch biopsy under aseptic conditions with local          anesthesia The biopsies were frozen and stored at C          until processed Indirect immunoperoxidase staining was          used to identify CDa                          Histological Scoring          Biopsy specimens were viewed by a dermatopathologist          RJB Histological scoring was made with a point          scoring system graded from  to    normal            slight   moderate   severe   very severe based          on criteria noted below after examination of four          consecutive highpower fields Histological scoring took          into account hypogranulosis parakeratosis and the          inflammatory infiltrate in the epidermis and superficial          dermis The total score reported was the sum of the          individual parameters Epidermal hyperplasia was measured          with an oculomicrometer from top of the epidermis to the          base of the ridges                          Laboratory Tests          Thyroid function tests were performed in all          volunteers prior to entry into the study and again at          monthly intervals until study completion at twelve weeks          The tests consisted of measurement of serum free T            FT             and thyroidstimulating hormone          TSH Complete blood counts CBC were also obtained at          the same time intervals                          Immunoperoxidase Staining          Tissue samples from biopsy specimens stored at C          were taken

 the treatment of plaque psoriasis is well established              The mechanism of action of these agents in psoriasis        remains unclear The drugs can potentially act by reducing        the cytokine signals that lead to keratinocyte        proliferation or by reducing keratinocyte proliferation A        key element in the generation of the cytokine signals        responsible for formation of a psoriatic plaque is the skin        antigenpresenting cell or Langerhans cell Therapeutic        modalities deplete such cells that often lead to        improvement in psoriasis The best example of such an        approach is treatment with UVA and psoralens as well as        UVB which result in depletion of APCs and produce one of        the most longlasting remissions of the disease which might        last in some instances for as long as  months     A        key antigenic marker of skin APCs is CDa Langerhans cell        precursors arise from CD positive monocytesmacrophages        in the marrow      They circulate in the blood        before localizing in the skin primarily in dermal        connective tissue In the dermis the Langerhans precursors        are strongly HLADR Ia positive and are relatively        nonphagocytic indeterminate cells CDa expression is        not pronounced in the precursors and is not significantly        expressed until the cells become differentiated              Differentiated cells localize to the midepidermis        demonstrate characteristic Birbeck granules and exhibit        dendritic appendages These differentiated cells although        usually stable sometime exhibit proliferative activity and        increase in many cutaneous immune response states              The inability of PTU to reduce CDa expression in        biopsy samples of patients with psoriasis suggests that the        mechanism of action of this drug is psoriasis is not due to        any effect on skin antigenpresenting cells or production        of IL a motive cytokine that is responsible for        initiation and maintenance of the cytokine stimulatory        cascade that leads to formation of the psoriatic plaque            In support of this argument is the fact that        circulating IL did not show any significant change with        PTU treatment submitted Additional studies are being        performed which address whether PTU treatment of patients        with plaque psoriasis leads to reduced         in situ IL expression alters        production of the IL or IL components of the IL        heterodimer as well as exerts an effect by enhancing        apoptosis in the proliferated keratinocytes that make up        the psoriatic plaque which would result in clinical        improvement
