        all righty okay have you recently had to return anything   yes i have   okay tell me about it   well i have a VCR and ive had to return it a couple of times because of the same part failure and uh its still not getting a real good picture   oh my goodness   and after about three hundred dollars i think its going to be worth it just to go ahead and get a new machine   you mean it the warranty wasnt on it or   so well i didnt get the extended warranty it was out of warranty just barely so uh   oh       gosh   so how about you   well i havent had to return anything recently but i you know i feel  im going to im on a portable phone im going to go closer to the station  here uh i i feel like things are are not made as well as they used to be i um just cause you for instance clothing i you know i have two children and um we we say they they like nice clothing and i spend a lot of money on it and it just doesnt last and i mean im very careful to follow the washing instructions and do exactly what it says and it still still it they still wear out very quickly uh i find things that are sewn very poorly uh they they come come unhemmed or unstitched so easily   well i will agree with that weve had some run ins especially with buttons as soon as you get them home the buttons fall off after the first time and uh the threads on the inside of the garments   right right umhum   seem like theyre just they dont cut threads off theyre just a wads of threads and stitching does come undone you know fairly soon and then the prices you pay for them are ridiculous   they never cut him off oh i know its really its silly and and my i have teenagers and they they think they want a certain brand or a certain item well when you buy a brand name thats popular youre paying for the brand name and   not only that but theyre no better than a lot of the the the   no   non name brand stuff so   exactly thats what i you know im saying that the you know if im paying for the name and im paying that much money itd better be a quality product now i do theres there are some that i think are a little bit better and i and ive been real pleased with them and my kids are have enjoyed wearing them and theyve lasted until theyve outgrown them but uh the majority of things um dont last and theyre just very inferior and you know i try i try to look at the labels and i try i try to to buy things that are made in the USA because i think thats important and yet i find a lot of the the the homemade goods are are inferior and also with cars i um i i bought a new car last summer and i shopped around for a long time i mean we went to a lot of different dealers and i wanted to buy an American car because i had had a Toyota and i really liked it but i felt like i needed to buy buy something that was American made because i felt i owed that well i just could not find an American made car that i felt was worthy of the price they wanted and um i ended up buying another i ended up buying a Nissan and i love it   well  the Americans just havent gotten the message yet thats one thing because im im the same way we i do own an American     huhuh   car well a truck but uh in trucks i think youre pretty safe but in cars ive not had an American car that ive been really pleased with   uhhuh oh i know   one for gas mileage and two uh the reliability things falling off the inside uh you know frequent tuneups every foreign car ive ever made i mean that ive ever bought ive ive loved it   exactly uhhuh yeah and theyre so much more solid they sound better when youre in them they feel you feel like youre in a car and not rattling around in something i you know i just  i just am real pleased with the Nissan i had and i had a Subaru before the Toyota and i loved that it was just the best car ive ever had in fact i wanted to buy another another one but i really it really what didnt have what i wanted they didnt have the the type of family car i wanted but that car i had for five years and i never had one thing go wrong with it and it um only thing i had to have replaced was the clutch and i had to do that twice because it was my fault because i ride it all the time and uh so you know it wore out   well clutches are something that you really cant judge i mean they they some go out faster than others and   yeah   you know thats those kind of items like that wear items theres no way you can judge   no   uh like brakes uh i we have a a Volvo and the brakes go out on it on about every fifteen thousand miles   yeah thats true is that right   its just inherent for that car but the the car is super   oh i know ive heard great things   id rather put the brakes on it and uh and have the the reliability in the car itself but uh   yeah oh yes and its a safe car too its a good made car   for the most part its been a good car weve had it for six years now   oh thats great well that the the Subaru i had when i sold it it still had the tires the factory tires on it and the factory battery one i mean thats how good it was i never had one trouble with the battery and which is amazing in five years i didnt have to get a new one and it worked perfectly and it was amazing the tires were um excellent and uh you know when i sold it it didnt have that many it was low mileage i didnt think i had like thirty seven thousand miles on it which is nowadays low but uh i got a good price on it its got good resale value and it was really a good car and you know it it kind of is frightening i think that youre right American uh manufacturers still havent got the the idea that that quality is important and that   well if you can see the transition what im beginning to see is that the Japanese cars and and even just foreign cars in as a whole are beginning to   uhhuh   get larger but theyre able to keep the gas mileage and the reliability whereas the US are beginning to scale down but the gas mileage doesnt improve drastically   yes right uhhuh youre right youre right   and that right there ought to tell them something   oh yeah   i know we have the technology but i think its the the glut of the oil companies and and uh big business and the government   umhum yes   in trying to control things that they shouldnt control and uh theyre not controlling the things they should control   exactly   so i think theres a theres a lot of things there to be said and uh i will continue to buy foreign cars if thats the most reliable product especially when im paying for it   thats right thats right because you   and i and i hate to have that attitude but i do   well the thing is when you have to take your car in continually because its not working and pay that much money in repair price bills its ridiculous i i had a Plymouth that was just the worst car in the world and i mean everything that could go wrong with it went wrong with it i had it in to the dealership more than i had it out it was terrible and i got rid of it as fast as i could it was the most it was a lemon is what it was and uh you know i will never buy a Plymouth again simply because of that   oh i know im the same way with GM i wont buy a GM car   is that right   yeah i like Ford trucks   umhum   and then i like the foreign cars especially Honda ive had a Honda   oh ive heard good things about a Honda   that i liked and uh i mean it was super car   yeah my niece has one and she loves it too yeah   so i think you know   but you really liked your Ford truck huh   well its been a good truck so far its only got a forty two thousand miles on it   uhhuh   and so far so good dont know whats going to happen when it gets another twenty or thirty thousand miles on it   yeah well im looking for a used truck for my son and its its really been hard because we i we just dont have that much money to spend to spend he just turned sixteen uh you know i dont i want to get an inexpensive truck a small one that um you know i only have to pay a couple of thousand or you know three thousand   oh boy well trucks trucks keep they hold their value   yeah   pretty much and and even used trucks are pretty expensive   yeah they are we did find a couple but um you know they just i wasnt real sure about them and uh so we we kind of passed them up um this one guy is not is trying to make up my his mind whether he wants to sell his its a Mitsubishi and its an eighty five and he wants to sell it for about two thousand but uh hes not sure he wants to give it up and start car payments again so were kind of waiting for him to make that decision but   oh i cant i can certainly understand that i dont want any car payments either in fact when mines paid off and   you know oh   our other ones paid off uh i dont want to get another car until they just both fall apart   yeah yeah theyre car payments are outrageous now   well its its just anymore they dont benefit you uh from the income tax stand point   oh thats right   and uh of course we just cant afford to trade cars like that so   humum humum   were just going to make it go as far as it can and then when were forced to get one we will   well thats why its important to find a car that you dont have to keep taking in for repairs because if youre gonna keep it a long time   thats right   are you i mean shoot you dont want to spend thousands of dollars on repairs   which can be easily done these days   yes easily easily and you know that another thing about not only about uh you know products but services  youre not real sure of anymore you you take a car in and you think its fixed or and and how do you know if they really even fixed it and and sometimes i wonder you know and its kind of scary you just youre not sure   where where are you from   im from im originally from Ohio   Ohio and where are you now   im in Texas   youre in Texas   umhum yeah   i was going to say because uh i was going to say if youre up in the in the northern countries the salt would be a big factor on i didnt know how much how they take care of the warranty items when it comes down to corrosion and that sort of thing   oh yeah yeah its uh bad up there but im ive been in Texas like thirteen years now so   yeah   what are what part of Texas are you from   uh from Coppell   Coppell im from Plano   Plano   were not yeah were not too far away   no   really   fact my brother lives in Plano   is that right oh well   uhhuh but   i dont  have much more to say about things i i feel the same way that you do though i think it things are you know need to get better and i think you need we need to have somehow more of a trust in in US made goods and its sad that we dont but uh   i would i would certainly like to And i hope that that before its too late they do get the message and i i dont know i think a lot of it has to do with uh you know just the attitude of the
