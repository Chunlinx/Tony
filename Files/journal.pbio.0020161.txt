                            Science looks set for a fundamentalist revival within the European Union Its leading        proponents are taking advantage of unprecedented political upheavalas ten new Member        States accede to the Unionto press their case for funding of basic research that is driven        solely and independently by investigators themselves in the pursuit of excellence        The broad thrust of their appeal calls for the setting up of a new agency most commonly        referred to as a European Research Council The ERC could be an entirely new organisation        or a new division within an established body run by a small staff able to draw on the best        expertise available It would administer a new fund from EU coffers tagged the European        Fund for Research Excellence that would be valued modestly initially at least at much        less than half of the EUs existing budget for research Most importantly dispersal of        that fund would reflect the wishes of eminent peer reviewers assessing competitive bids in        search of the best science rather than the judgements of Eurocrats looking for the most        politically and economically expedient solutions and operating on a lead time of two years        or more        Although the modus operandi of the proposed ERC has still to be worked out European        scientists have been looking to the United States and at the way that the National Science        Foundation and the National Institutes of Health operate as well as to private        institutions such as the Howard Hughes Medical Institute in the United States and the        Wellcome Trust in the United Kingdom In particular they seek the independence and        excellence achieved outside of the EU framework More to the point they are weary of the        bureaucratic formulations that determine how the EUs research budget currently known as        the Sixth Framework Programme  and worth around  billionyear or just over         of all public spending on nonmilitary research in the region is spent and distributed        The EUs guiding principle is often one of         juste retour  or fair reward in which Member States traditionally seek        to recover grants at least equal to their contributions to the EU pot see Box         Most of the AngloSaxon countries in Europethe Scandinavian countries the United        Kingdom the Netherlandsoperate a peer review process and a research funding council        process thats very similar to best practice in North America says Michael Morgan a        consultant to the Wellcome Trust on European issues and former chief executive of the        Trusts Genome Campus at Hinxton near Cambridge United Kingdom The French and Germans        and others have elements of that but they also have what you might call more statefunded        science scientists as civil servants and there is obviously much greater possibility of        science being funded for less than the best scientific reasons notes Morgan referring to        the opportunities for greater political influence on decisionmaking Im not suggesting        that that is the case but it is the possibility he adds        What we need in Europe is something that should strictly adhere to the international        standards of research funding and be evaluated by peer review says Peter Gruss professor        of molecular cell biology at the University of Gttingen and president of the Max Planck        Society in Munich Germany The sole criterion has to be quality not geographical        distribution not management capacity he adds alluding to the EU practice of         juste retour  We want to encourage excellence in Europe We want to        have as a benchmark a European standard that should be as high as the standard is in the        US        Gruss acknowledges the tensions that the ERC proposal has generated among Member States        Im not saying that there arent countries that have this standardlike the UK parts of        Germany Sweden and some other Nordic countriesbut of course this is not the general        European standard and in order to get one and the same the common standard we need a        common structure                    A Fund for Excellence        The European Commission now appears ready to accept the need for a common structure that        would have as the Commission puts it more open and less binding programmes of basic        research in contrast to the Framework Programme whose emphasis is on applied research        with commercial objectives The Commission expects to publish its endorsement of the ERC        proposal this month so that approval by the Council of the EU should follow later this        year On this timetable setting up of the ERC could begin in  when the next fiveyear        Framework Programme FP gets underway        Over the ERCs first five years its grant is expected to grow from around         millionyear to  billionyear and to derive from a reallocation of funds within the EUs        budget rather than from any topup contributions from Member States Furthermore Gruss        released a legal opinion in March that advised how an ERC need not be an executive agency        of the Commission as many scientists had feared it would have to be under the terms of the        EU Treaty but could be established as an independent and autonomous body The opinion is a        real coup for the ERC lobbyists                    Origins of the ERC        Moves to establish an ERC are founded in a new strategic goal for the EU that the        leaders of its  Member States set during their European Council in Lisbon in March         Over the first decade of the new millennium they urged the EU to become the most        competitive and dynamic knowledgebased economy in the world They enthusiastically        endorsed a notion floated by the European Commission of a European Research Area ERA        Research activities at national and European Union level must be better integrated and        coordinated to make them as efficient and innovative as possible and to ensure that        Europe offers attractive prospects to its best brains concluded the EU leaders eager to        reverse the flow of trained talent abroad notably to North America All appropriate means        they added must be fully exploited to achieve this objective in a flexible decentralised        and nonbureaucratic manner        Two years later at the European Council in Barcelona the EU leaders went one step        further by defining the target more precisely In order to close the gap between the EU        and its major competitors they said overall spending on R  D and innovation in the        Union should be increased with the aim of approaching  of GDP by  Twothirds of this        new investment should come from the private sector        The scale of the challenge is illustrated by the latest figures for R  D        expenditure published in February by the Statistical Office of the European Communities        Eurostat The EUs estimated R  D spending in  was  of GDP still far short        of the US  and Japan  in  and a long way from the target of         Emphasising the UKs uneasiness about the EUs escalating enthusiasm for a regional        science base the Royal Society the UK national academy of science poured scorn on the        ambitious GDP target by noting how the UK alone would have needed an extra  billion in         or more than  of total spending on R  D to lift its ratio of  to the         target The Royal Society also noted how public funding of R  D in the EU matches that        in the US and Japan with the disparity among GDP ratios reflecting the differentials in        private investment in R  D over which the EU has little control        Nevertheless the challenge could not be ignored According to Bob May professor of        mathematical biology at the University of Oxford president of the Royal Society and        former UK Chief Scientist such initiatives might be driven more by political expediency        than common sense but the moment you see that train beginning to roll theres a chance to        do something useful with it        Among the leading proponents of an ERC is Bernard Larrouturou director general of the        National Centre of Scientific Research CNRS in Paris France For Larrouturou a        biomathematician currently engaged in streamlining the organisation the changes at the        European level are a breath of fresh air However he is not convinced that funded        investigators should expect to exclude Commission strategists entirely from their lives        The scientific community should lead an ERC says Larrouturou but I do not like the idea        that this should be completely under the guidance and wisdom of the scientific community        with no strategy guidance You cannot ask for  or  billion Euros every year and say there        will not be any strategy and that it will be done solely on this basis of excellence        And Larrouturou distances himself from the idea that basic and applied research can be        treated separately because this suggests wrongly he says a conflict between the two        On these issues Larrouturou moves onto some common ground with John Taylor former        director general of Research Councils UK and now chairman of Roke Manor Research a UK        subsidiary of Siemens the German electronics group Research Councils UK oversees spending        of Britains national research councils currently just over  billion from its         Science Budget of nearly  billion Interactions across disciplines and between        scientists and technologists are not helped by making artificial distinctions between this        kind of research and that kind of research says Taylor The distinctions I make are much        more between topdown and bottomup        While Taylor is a joint architect of one proposal to create an ERC he remains        unconvinced that the research funding system is broken especially from the UKs        perspective and needs to be fixed Nor is he convinced that EU funds for an ERC will not        affect national R  D budgets Im middle of the road he says Much greater        collaboration is good It has to be a slow process with all the different cultures        involved Collaboration on various areas of science is an excellent way to go provided you        dont try to organise it from the top and legislate for it all to happen in a particular        way and to a particular timescale Excellence is key        Taylors cautions reflect his experience of the EUs Framework Programme and his        reservations that any initiative from Brussels can be free of red tape If you want to do        research then you cant lay out beforehand all the answers youre going to get he says        And if you try to get people to stick rigorously to a plan then you get a lot of silly        things going on If you try to form very complex bureaucratic organisations to do the        research you get a lot of delays and so on so things are not very timely        But the Framework Programmes failures need not spell disaster for the fledgling funding        council insists Lennart Philipson former director general of the European Molecular        Biology Laboratory EMBL in Heidelberg Germany and now an emeritus professor at the        Karolinska Institute in Stockholm Sweden Drawing on his  years as head of EMBL until         Philipson recalls how panEuropean peer review was the best method for distributing        the funds of EMBL and EMBO European Molecular Biology Organization The continuing high        status of the two organisations he says is testimony that the system works In fact EMBO        is mentioned as a possible incubator for an ERC in spite of its specialisation        Other proponents of the proposed research changes in the EU include  Nobel Laureates        from Europe or of European origin who headed a petition organised by EMBO The European        Life Scientists Organization ELSO organised another Its president Kai Simons also the        Director of the Max Planck Institute for Cell Biology and Genetics in Dresden Germany        says research funding in Europe is just not working Its not geared for basic researchit        has other aims he notes EU funds are not grants they are contracts with inbuilt        milestones that have nothing to do with basic research Basic research doesnt work like        that        The evaluation and peer review system is falling apart continues Simons He says that        the best people are not interested in peer reviewing a system that doesnt work Youre        not attracting the peer reviewers that you need to maintain quality But at last        acknowledges Simons someone in Brussels is listening In the past two years there has        been enormous progress                    Many Questions Remain        Within a month of the Barcelona Council in  the European Science Foundation ESF        which brings together the funding agencies of  countries and acts as a bridge to        Brussels had formed a High Level Working Group to review the case for an ERC and how it        might operate The group chaired by Sir Richard Sykes Rector of Imperial College London        United Kingdom reported a year later in April  It endorsed the creation of an ERC as        the cornerstone for the ERA and the key approach to developing a locus forlongterm        fundamental curiositydriven research judged on the basis of excellence and merit The        Sykes group also proposed controversially an enhanced ESF as the most effective medium        for establishing an ERC swiftly        Some people say that the ESF has no experience in funding large amounts for research        acknowledges Enric Banda director general of the Catalan Research Foundation in Barcelona        Spain who finished a fiveyear term as the ESFs chief executive at the end of  and is        credited with waking up the foundation But certainly if you create a new        organisation thats the same thing So the ESF is in a good position because its member        organisations are the funding agencies        Bertil Andersson who was a member of the Sykes Group before taking over from Banda at        the ESF in January also stakes the ESFs claim to nurture a fledgling ERC But he accepts        that any one of the respected national funding agencies such as the German Research        Foundation DFG or even a specialist body such as EMBO could do the job We dont need        a new skyscraper in Brussels but a lot of peer review and running of the ERC could be        done by existing bodies        Compared to soccer we have only the national leagueswe dont have the Champions        League the league of Europes best teams says Andersson There is no competition for        basic research grants across national boundaries in Europe he insists The Swedish league        is exciting but the Champions League is more exciting        In the meantime while the Sykes group was still deliberating the Council of the EU        appointed another group of experts to evaluate the case for an ERC Chaired by Federico        Mayor former director general of the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural        Organization UNESCO the ERC Expert Group also delivered its verdicta resounding        endorsementwithin  months        The first and main task for the ERC should be to support investigatordriven research        of the highest quality selected through European competition concluded the Mayor report        published in December  In doing so the ERC should create and support nodes of        excellence in European universities and research institutions strengthening the        knowledgebase that underpins economic industrial cultural and societal development and        thereby stimulating European competitiveness and innovative capacity at all levels        While few disagreed with the Mayor reports sentiments the absence of a detailed        analysis exposed underlying tensions over the rationale for an ERC In the UK in        particular some scientists seemed concerned that their mature and respected system for        funding research risked dilution        The British have always had doubts about what goes on in Europe notes Kai Simons        They always think that they can do it better But the big problem for the British is that        they are also too small to fund a new innovative area he says Of course we can do it        without Britain but they are an important part of Europe and it would be sad if theyre        not part of it        The agnostic John Taylor who was a member of the Mayor group recalls his early        reservations when the group convened Im way beyond the euphoria Im into practical        pragmatics he notes My major input into the whole thing has been to get them to get        real instead of just philosophising Theyve been using the sort of dare I say it Gallic        approach of thinking about the reasons why and the philosophy and not thinking about        what you would actually do        Taylor dismisses the notion that wariness of the ERC is representative of a general        antipathy in Britain towards European integration What were saying is that science in        the UK is not yet wellfunded enough to say we would rather do this the ERC instead of        the things that were already trying to get done in the UK scene        Anticipating the Mayor reports publication the Royal Society quickly pulled together a        detailed background paper late last year that identified a number of problems that need        resolution although not necessarily through the establishment of any major new        institutions within Europe An addendum followed in March in direct response to the Mayor        report That addendum highlighted what it saw as the paucity of solid evidence in the Mayor        report and in some cases the confusing data in the reports case for an ERC        On balance it looked as though the Royal Society and as such the British science        establishment as a whole had weighed the disadvantages of an ERC as greater than its        advantages but Bob May is quick to refute this charge My vision and the Royal Societys        vision of the ERC is that it will fund the very best science he insists The Mayor        committee itself was really good people whod produced basically a good report Im        basically in favour of this European Research Council provided it can be set up properly        which is by no means certain        For May and other scientists on the continent the ERC offers a real chance to redress        the balance of fortune in favour of young scientists The way to encourage science is to        get the best people and set them free to express their creativity while they are young        which means bring them into the best laboratoriesdont let them get entrained in        hierarchies of deference to secondrate people says May        The most important single thing to create one Europe in science is a flexible        postdoctoral programme that gets the best young people wherever they are and lets them go        to the best places enthuses May An ERC will then foster those collaborations he        forecasts It wont ask whether theyre         juste retour  whether theyre serving some industrial purpose it will        just try to fund the best science But I hope increasingly the best projects will involve        collaborations as they do in Britain collaborations among institutions within        Europe
