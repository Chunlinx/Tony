                                  The Wealth of Stein            A year ago I was living ina  apartment which I owned It was a small tworoom apartment Now Iam living in a  apartment which I own It is also a small tworoomapartment In fact it is the same apartment although a little shabbier Ayear ago I could have sold the apartment for  Now I can sell it for            Am I richer I wouldhave  more in cash if I sold today vs a year ago But money is asterile thing good only for what it will buy Todays  will buy packages of Product  whereas last years  would have bought only packages so I am richer in Product  I do not however live onProduct  alone            We are accustomed to the idea that we should convert alldollar amounts to real values by adjusting with the consumer price indexBecause the CPI rose by  percent in the past year January to January thevalue of my apartment rose by only  percent in terms of the goods andservices included in the CPI rather than the  percent by which it rose interms of dollars            But if I sell myapartment I probably wont use the proceeds to buy that months assortment ofstuff thats in the CPI I will probably want to buy some other asset that willyield a stream of income into the future I could for example buy yearTreasury bonds In March  the  from my apartment sale would havebought bonds with a total yield of  a year In March  with  Ican buy such bonds with a yield of  a year In those terms I have gotricher            But Treasury bonds are not what make everyone feel richerevery day I might want to be more venturesome in the hope of getting alargerthough riskierincome stream Suppose I buy shares in the SP Index The price of that index rose  percent in the past year to March Since the price of my apartment rose by only  percent I can buy only percent as much of the SP  as I could have bought a year ago Butwhat I care about is how much future income I will get If the future incomefrom the stocks in the SP  has risen by  percent per share I would begetting as much future income from buying in  as I would have got frombuying in  But I really dont know whether it has risen that much So Idont know whether the shares of the SP  I can buy for  inMarch  are worth more than the shares I could have bought in March            In March  I couldhave bought  shares of Microsoft for the  price of my apartmentIn March  I can buy  shares Am I richer or poorer in terms of theopportunity to earn income from Microsoft Possibly the probable income fromthe  shares is greater than the probable income from the  shares wasBut I dont know            So am I richer than I was The rise in the price tag of myapartment combined with the changes in prices of other things changes theopportunities I face I have an opportunity to get more cash more Product and more annual income from Treasury bonds In those terms I have becomericher In terms of opportunity to enjoy living in my apartment I am neitherricher nor poorer I have become poorer in terms of my opportunity to buy theSP  and even poorer in terms of my opportunity to buy MicrosoftWhether I have become richer or poorer in opportunity to earn income from theSP  or from Microsoft I dont know and neither does anyone else            I suppose we do knowsomething about who has got richer or poorer relative to others in the past twoyears The person who owned shares in Microsoft has got richer relative to theperson who owned the SP  and that person has got richer relative tome and I have got richer relative to the people who produced the stuff thatwent into the CPI and they have got richer relative to the people who hadcash I guess I am richer relative to the poor fellow who wants to earn thecost of my apartment by writing essays for  a word            The wealth of the nation is its future stream of nationalincome That stream is almost certainly a rising one Year by year and littleby little we are as a nationtaking us all togethergetting richer But thathas little to do with and is much less than the surge in asset prices in thepast two years Wealth is not wealth that alters when Greenspan speaks            And yet and yet despite these uncertainties Ifeel richer when the price tag on the apartment I live in goes up That may bean illusion but illusions are facts of life
