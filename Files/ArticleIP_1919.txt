                                 Earth in the Balance Sheet            Earth Day is upon us onceagain Like most people who think at all about how much burden their way oflife places on Spaceship Earth I feel a bit guilty But my conscience isclearer than usual this yearand so are those of  other economists            Let meexplain A few months ago an organization called Redefining Progress enlistedfive economiststhe Nobel laureates Robert Solow and Kenneth Arrow togetherwith Harvards Dale Jorgenson Yales William Nordhaus and myselftocirculate an Economists Statement on Climate Change calling for seriousmeasures to limit the emission of greenhouse gases To be honest I agreed tobe one of the original signatories mainly as a gesture of goodwill and neverexpected to hear any more about it but the statement ended up being signed byyes more than  economists Whatever else may come of the enterprise itwas an impressive demonstration of a littleknown fact Many economists arealso enthusiastic environmentalists            Partly this is just because of who economists are Being bydefinition welleducated and for the most part pretty welloff they have theusual prejudices of their classand most uppermiddleclass Americans aresentimental about the environment as long as protecting it does not impinge ontheir lifestyle Im happy to reuse my grocery bagsbut dont expect me towalk to the supermarket But my unscientific impression is that economists areon average more proenvironment than other people of similar incomes andbackgrounds Why Because standard economic theory automatically predisposesthose who believe in it to favor strong environmental protection            This isnot of course the popular image Everyone knows that economists are peoplewho know the price of everything and the value of nothing who think thatanything that increases gross domestic product is good and anything else isworthless and who believe that whatever free markets do must be right Arecent example of how this stereotype gets perpetuated is the article bygardenshop entrepreneur Paul Hawken in the current Mother Jones  Imsorry to say that some of the people at Redefining Progress published animpressively illinformed diatribe along the same lines in the Atlanticback in             But the reality is that even the mostconventional economic doctrine is a lot more subtle than that True economistsgenerally believe that a system of free markets is a pretty efficient way torun an economy as long as the prices are right as long in particularas people pay the true social cost of their actions Environmental issueshowever more or less by definition involve situations in which the price iswrongin which the private costs of an activity fail to reflect its truesocial costs Let me quote from the textbook by William Baumol and AlanBlinder that I assigned when I taught Economics  last year When a firmpollutes a river it uses some of societys resources just as surely as when itburns coal However if the firm pays for coal but not for the use of cleanwater it is to be expected that management will be economical in its use ofcoal and wasteful in its use of water In other words when it comes to theenvironment we do not expect the free market to get it right            So whatshould be done Going all the way back to Paul Samuelsons first edition in every economics textbook I know of has argued that the government shouldintervene in the market to discourage activities that damage the environmentThe usual recommendation is to do so either by charging fees for the right toengage in such nasty activitiesa k a pollution taxesor by auctioning offrights to pollute Indeed as the extraordinary response to the climatechangestatement reminds us the idea of pollution taxes is one of those iconicpositions like free trade that commands the assent of virtually everycardcarrying economist Yet while pollution and related negativeexternalities such as traffic congestion are obvious problems in practiceefforts to make markets take environmental costs into account are few and farbetween So economists who actually believe the things they teach generallysupport a much more aggressive program of environmental protection than the onewe actually have True they tend to oppose detailed regulations that tellpeople exactly how they must reduce pollution preferring schemes that providea financial incentive to pollute less but leave the details up to the privatesector But I would be hard pressed to think of a single economist not actuallyemployed by an antienvironmental lobbying operation who believes that theUnited States should protect the environment less not more than it currentlydoes The signers of the climatechange statement incidentally included economists from the University of Chicago            But wont protecting the environment reduce the grossdomestic product Not necessarilyand anyway so what            At firstsight it might seem obvious that pollution taxes will reduce GDP After allany tax reduces the incentives to work save and invest Thus a tax on exhaustemissions from cars will induce people to drive cleaner cars or avoid drivingaltogether But since it will also in effect lower the payoff to earning extramoney since you wouldnt end up driving the second car you could buy with thatmoney anyway people will not work as hard as they would have without the taxThe result is that taxes on pollution or anything else will other thingsbeing equal tend to reduce overall monetary output in the economywhich is tosay GDP            But things need not be equal because there isalready a whole lot of taxing and spending going on Even in the United Stateswhere the government is smaller than in any other advanced country about athird of GDP passes through its hands So existing taxes already discouragepeople from engaging in taxable activities like working or investing            What thismeans is that the revenue from any new taxes on pollution could be used toreduce other taxes such as Social Security contributions or the income taxbut not of course the capitalgains tax While the pollution taxes woulddiscourage some activities that are counted in the GDP the reduction in othertaxes would encourage other such activities So measured GDP might well fallvery little or even rise            Does this constitute an independent argument for taxingpollution quite aside from its environmental payoff Would we want to havesay a carbon tax even if we werent worried about global warming Well therehas been an excruciatingly technical argument about this mysteriously known asthe double dividend debate the general consensus seems to be no and that onbalance pollution taxes would be more likely to reduce GDP slightly than toincrease it            But sowhat Gross domestic product is not a measure of the nations economicwellbeingso declares the textbook as soon as it introduces the concept Ifgetting the price of the environment right means a rise in consumption ofnonmarket goods like clean air and leisure time at the expense of marketedconsumption so be it            Isnt this amazing Not only do thousands ofeconomists agree on something but what they agree on is the warm and cuddlyidea that we should do more to protect the environment Can  economists bewrong Well yesbut this time they arent The Great Green Tax Shifta shiftaway from taxes on employment and income toward taxes on pollution and othernegative externalitieshas everything going for it It is supported by goodscience and good economics as well as by good intentions            Inevitably then it appears at the moment to be a complete politicalnonstarter The problem as with many good policy ideas is that the GreatGreen Tax Shift runs up against the three Is            First there is Ignorance Only last year Congress rushedto cut gasoline taxes to offset a temporary price rise Not many voters stoppedto ask where the money was coming from So what politician will be foolishenough to take the first step in trying to institute new taxes on allAmericanpollution even with the assurance that other taxes will be lowered at the sametime My friends in the administration tell me that the word taxes has beenbanned even from internal discussions about environmental policy            Then there are Interests Itis hard to think of a way to limit global warming that will not graduallyreduce the number of coalmining jobs As labormarket adjustment problems gothis is a pretty small one But the coal miners and the energy companies areactively opposed to green taxes while the broader public that would benefitfrom them is not actively in support            Finally there is IdeologyIt used to be that the big problem in formulating a sensible environmentalpolicy came from the leftfrom people who insisted that since pollution isevil it is immoral to put a price on it These days however the main problemcomes from the rightfrom conservatives who unlike most economists really dothink that the free market is always rightto such an extent that they refuseto believe even the most overwhelming scientific evidence if it seems tosuggest a justification for government action            So I do not realisticallyexpect the Economists Statement to change the world But then I didnt expectit to go as far as it has Certainly those of us who signed it did the rightthing and maybe just maybe we did our bit toward saving the planet
