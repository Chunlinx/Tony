                    Background        Normal spermatogenesis represents a precisely regulated        balance between continuous cell proliferation and        concomitant programmed cell death apoptosis               More than  of the germ cells die during their normal        developmental process      Apoptosis in the testis of        rodents is detected as early as the  thembryonic day            After birth an early apoptotic wave of germ cells        during a critical prepubertal period around  weeks           may be required for determining the subsequent normal        pattern of spermatogenesis            Androgen binding protein ABP is produced by Sertoli        cells of the testis secreted into the lumen of        seminiferous tubules and transported with tubular fluid to        the epididymis where it is internalized and degraded by        the epithelial cells of the initial segment and the caput        it binds testosterone T dihydrotestosterone and        estradiol with high affinity       The functions of        ABP have been the subject of many reviews eg                It is thought to regulate spermatogenesis and        sperm maturation by maintaining high androgen levels in the        testis and epididymis     and has been proposed as a        biochemical marker for Sertoli cell function and formation        of bloodtestis barrier      More recently cell        surface receptors for ABP and its liverderived homolog sex        hormonebinding globulin SHBG were identified in several        androgen target tissues suggesting that these        extracellular steroidbinding proteins may have a much        broader hormonelike function              In order to study ABPs functions         in vivo  Reventos         et al    developed transgenic        TG mice overexpressing rat ABP These TG mice showed        progressive structural and functional abnormalities in        their testes leading eventually to infertility              In our recent paper we described an altered pattern of        germ cell proliferation throughout postnatal life in the        ABPTG mice resulting in a progressive reduction in total        germ cell numbers with increasing age     However it        was not clear whether the reduction in germ cell numbers        was the result of a reduced rate of proliferation an        increased rate of apoptosis or a combination of the        two        The present study was performed to provide quantitative        data on germ cell apoptosis in control and in ABPTG mice        aged from  to  days Apoptotic cells were identified by        the TdTmediated dUTPbiotin nick end labeling TUNEL        method and detected either by flow cytometry    or by        light microscopy in histological sections     The        results indicate that transgenic ABP alters the rate of        testicular germ cell apoptosis throughout life but it is        most likely to cause its germcell depleting effect by        promoting germ cell apoptosis during the critical        prepubertal period puberty in laboratory rodents occurs        at  days of life and is defined as the first        appearance of spermatozoa in the tail

Figure Fis a negative control                            Discussion        It is well established that TG mice overexpressing rat        ABP    develop a testicular impairment             leading gradually to a reduced number of germ cells and        infertility     Various theories were proposed to        explain the possible mechanisms behind this testicular        impairment seen in the ABPTG mice overexpressing rat ABP        The first theory invokes the indirect involvement of ABP        The increased concentration of ABP present in the testes of        TG mice see Joseph         et al      will chronically        reduce the concentration of intratesticular free T        available for interaction with androgen receptor AR and        other molecular targets This is supported by the         in vitro study of Roberts and Zirkin           demonstrating that ABP can actually inhibit Ts        action at the level of the AR Our earlier findings        including a reduced number of elongated spermatids in the        ABPTG mice    also support the notion that higher than        physiological concentrations of ABP affect spermatogenesis        indirectly through sequestration of androgens the        transformation of round spermatids to elongated spermatids        is known to be the main androgendependent step in        spermatogenesis              The second theory suggests the possible direct        involvement of ABP in spermatogenesis Specific cell        surface receptors for ABP have been detected in several        cell types including germ cells        Gerard         et al    reported that ABP was        bound and internalized by germ cells and it also modified        protein synthesis in germ cells in a manner dependent on        the presence or absence of sex steroids The presence of        increased numbers of ABPcontaining germ cells in the        testes of ABPTG mice    and immunocytochemical        observations of intense ABP immunoreactivity found in and        around all types of germ cells in ABPTG mice           support a possible direct involvement of ABP in the        testicular impairment seen in the ABPTG mice The late        stages of spermatogenesis spermiogenesis were extensively        studied for the possible direct effects of ABP                 In these studies however ABP at least at        physiological concentrations appeared to be supportive        rather than detrimental to spermatogenesis Thus        available evidence does not seem to indicate a direct        inhibitory or damaging role of ABP in        spermatogenesis        Although optimal and highly regulated rates of        spontaneous germ cell apoptosis are essential for normal        spermatogenesis         there is evidence to        link the increased or decreased apoptosis of germ cells        with abnormal spermatogenesis and male infertility                     In the ABPTG mice an overall reduction in the number        of spermatids was reported    and suggested as one of        the reasons for the reduced fertility seen in these        animals Our finding of an increased rate of germ cell        apoptosis in  and  days old ABPTG mice as compared to        controls is consistent with the possibility that the        reduced fertility reduced germ cell number seen in the        ABPTG mice during adulthood may be due to increased        apoptosis of germ cells during the first wave of        spermatogenesis in the pubertal period In a recent paper        Selva         et al    described meiotic        arrest and an increased occurrence of apoptosis of        testicular germ cells primarily pachytene spermatocytes        and cells in metaphase in   and month old ABPTG        mice and suggested that these events were the cause of the        fertility impairment seen in these animals However in the        study of Selva et al     apoptosis was not analyzed        by flow cytometry but was detected by TUNEL reaction in        histological sections only from a small number of        homozygous animals  each of  and month old and  of        month old and no statistical analysis of the results        was provided        The present study is the first to describe the detailed        quantitative pattern of testicular germ cell apoptosis        throughout life in normal as well as in ABPTG mice Flow        cytometry detects TUNELpositive cells in four populations        of germ cells in adult mice Figure  The greater numbers        of TUNELpositive cells detected in the four populations of        germ cells highest in C primary spermatocytes from        MAAtreated mice than controls confirm the reliability of        the methods we used in this study Selective targeting of        spermatocytes by MAA has been reported earlier                      In  days old control mice    and in ABPTG        mice    of all germ cells are apoptotic        Analysis within each population reveals that in control        mice    of C    of Sphase           of C and    of C cells were apoptotic        In ABPTG mice the percentage of C    and C           cells undergoing apoptosis was significantly        higher than in controls        Though the total number of germ cells undergoing        apoptosis in control mice increased gradually from Day  to         the total number of germ cells also increased in        general see Jeyaraj         et al     the percentage of        germ cells undergoing apoptosis was at its peak on Day         Table  These findings are consistent with the        morphological analysis of Russel         et al     reporting higher        incidence of degenerative cells in the seminiferous tubules        of  and  days old normal animals and lower levels found        in adults        In ABPTG mice the total number of germ cells        undergoing apoptosis also increased from Day  and peaked        on Days  and  After a decline by Day  the number of        germ cells undergoing apoptosis leveled off in ABPTG mice        From Day  onwards in terms of total number of germ cells        undergoing apoptosis there is a clear and consistent        reduction in ABPTG mice compared to controls However        since the total number of germ cells in ABPTG mice of        these age groups day  to day  is also reduced            the actual proportion or percentage of germ cells        undergoing apoptosis remains similar in the two groups        The presence of increased numbers of apoptotic germ        cells in ABPTG mice compared to WT controls on Days          and  suggests that this age group is more vulnerable than        adult animals to increased levels of intratesticular ABP        This suggestion is supported by many of our observations         the percentage of germ cells undergoing apoptosis at        these age groups days   and  was higher in ABPTG        mice than in WT controls  The absolute numbers of germ        cells undergoing apoptosis in  and  days old ABPTG        mice were significantly higher than in WT controls albeit        the total number of germ cells present in the testes of         and  days of ABPTG mice was similar to that in        WTcontrols      On day  even though the total        number of germ cells present in the ABPTG mice was        significantly lower than in agematched WT controls            the number of germ cells undergoing apoptosis was        nevertheless higher Thus at Days   and  the        changes observed must be directly related to the increased        levels of testicular ABP present in these TG animals        Our data indicate that the presence of greater than        physiological concentration of ABP in the mouse testis has        a biphasic effect on the frequency of apoptosis in germ        cells The initial increase seen in germ cell apoptosis        especially at  and  days is likely to result from a        direct or indirect action of ABP and may affect the        subsequent lifedeath balance of germ cell populations in        TG mice The subsequent reduction is most likely due to        maturation depletion reduced germ cell numbers Taken        together the presence of increased levels of        intratesticular ABP in the TG mice after  days of age            and a wave of germ cell apoptosis seen in normal        mice at  and  days of age in this study and by        Rodriguez         et al     suggest that the        heightened apoptotic wave found in our TG mice during the        prepubertal period may be regulated by ABP However at        this point it is not clear whether ABP regulates this        apoptotic wave by direct action on germ cells or        indirectly by reducing the intratesticular concentrations        of free bioavailable T The known biochemical properties        and actions of ABP make the second mechanism more likely        see Jeyaraj         et al     This would also        indicate that the prepubertal wave of apoptosis is        regulated at least in part by T Indeed it has been        reported that experimental reduction in the levels of        intratesticular T leads to the activation of caspase           and thereby to an increase in germ cell apoptosis             The roles of other apoptosisregulating proteins        such as the FasFas ligand system       the Bcl        family of proteins      and several inhibitor of        apoptosis proteins IAP are also likely to play a role in        germ cell death and survival                          Conclusions        In conclusion our data suggest that the presence of        high concentrations of ABP in the mouse seminiferous        tubules results in a dramatically increased wave of germ        cell apoptosis during the prepubertal period Since the        most likely mechanism of this effect of ABP is androgen        sequestration androgens are likely to play an important        role in regulating the wave of germ cell apoptosis in mice        The altered rate of apoptosis at this time may in part be        responsible for the subsequent progressive spermatogenetic        defect seen in the ABPTG mice An analysis of androgen        levels and ABP and androgenregulated gene expression        within the seminiferous tubules may reveal the precise        molecular mechanisms of these complex regulatory        processes
