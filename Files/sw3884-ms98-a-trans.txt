                okay i work with uh a lot of students and uh in my uh occupation talking to them about college and going to colleges i think uh   umhum   the advice that i give to would give to uh parents ive had four sons five sons that have gone to college uh to uh college i think uh one of the main things is that they they choose a local college that uh  or university that will go along with their goals as far as what degrees they want to go into and they if theyre in the local area they dont have to pay out of state tuition and all of those things and uh   yeah thats certainly helpful   and go ahead   say your last suggestion there about staying within state i realize that there are a lot of schools unless uh uh the student has a real specialty and there oh maybe are one or two universities that are highly respected in that field they really ought to try to stay within their state i mean   uhhuh   financing in universities now is getting a very very high   yes it is   and they cant help themselves on that either so it certainly is an advantage to stay within your own state   umhum uh that thats uh kind of the the advice that i give and then uh they need to take a look at the uh courses uh the courses of study and uh how it would go into their their major minor field uh   yeah   what kind of placement uh they have in the particular area you know i had one son who uh went to a smaller college uh to uh went out in the uh premed area     umhum   but they had an excellent record of placing uh their students in medical schools after they finished the program and he was   thats very important   right he got early acceptance to a to medical school after he finished and uh if he wouldve gone to uh say the state uh it would be the University of Utah if he wouldve gone there uh i dont know whether hed got accepted to medical school there or not   well that was certainly uh good advice to get him to go to a school who follows up and has such a reputation that others are happy to get their students that   umhum   that means that the quality of what he was taught must be  very very high   yes uh   and thats good for him too regardless of where he works he has uh a top level of information that will last him the rest of his life basically   umhum and you you can do this for any of the uh any uh university or or for any of the students that are planning uh take a look at uh their final goals at least hopefully theyve got a goal of what area they want to go out in and then uh if its law school or if its uh medical or whatever there are different uh colleges and universities usually within the state that uh have a little little better placement record or or getting them into into those higher degree or higher areas of education   umhum well we have that  same situation here im im a retired professor at Penn State   i see uhhuh   and uh the field i worked in was acoustics and we have an acoustics department here and we have lots of students several hundred i guess in in acoustics and they have an excellent opportunity to follow through on their fields because our university is well known for its research in addition to uh teaching obviously if we can do   umhum you bet   high class research we must be well trained and and uh available to teach the students well   umhum  and uh that would be school a school that the parents uh should seek out for their uh students if theyre interested in that that field and   yes   and where its well known uh the word gets out and that that might be a a case where even if it was out of state and they had to pay a little higher tuition then it would be well worth the the uh to to go to to Penn State   yes yes because Penn Penn State is very well known in uh many of its uh many of its fields and uh we we get a lot we do we only we get our sort of say we get state uh students not only from out of state but from all over the world   umhum yes   i mean they they they really come here we have a very high uh percentage of foreign students because Penn State is pretty well tops in many of its fields   umhum you bet   and we have doubled in size in the last fifteen twenty years i guess   umhum  well thats very important in in a choice of a college or university that they look at those aspects uh wherever they might be   umhum   and if its uh financially if they can do that thats thats great   yes thats true   but they they need to know about the the costs and uh how theyre going to be able to pay for this whether they can get students loans or  are their parents are able to help or whatever but uh uh the bottom line is uh the the college or university thats gonna give them the best training prepare them for life   yes and then the basic thing is that you started out earlier to say the the bottom line is to give your
