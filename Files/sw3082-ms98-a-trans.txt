          okay   yes     well this is a very timely topic in as much as were going to a family reunion this weekend yes   oh are you really where is it going to be   down at Lake Texoma lodge yes this is one thats uh the Baker family reunion   oh uhhuh   and this has been going on at least uh i would say at least twenty five years or thirty something like that maybe longer than that im going to get back into the fifties sometime   oh thats marvelous umhum   first time i got i married into the family and the first time i went was about fifty seven i think   uhhuh   but uh this one has been uh been well organized and in fact it used to be at Lake Brownwood and now its Lake Texoma because thats more central location for people from Oklahoma and Texas to come to   umhum im sure location is really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be   very important because uh youll start losing people if its too far to go   umhum we have factions when its one part we i have one reunion on my mothers side and we found that if its in a certain part of Texas some people come and if its elsewhere other people come we never get them at both of them it seems like so i think we need to find a new place   yeah yeah never get them at both places right       listen theyve uh theyve had this one well it just of course over the years it has uh built up as far as the organization is concerned but now they uh have a golf tournament on the Saturday   umhum um   and then they have generally a show or an auction or something on Saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such   oh thats a neat idea   yeah and uh everyone uh they get the community building there at Lake Texoma lodge and everyone brings in food   umhum   and then for the Saturday night dinner they bring in like Kentucky Fried Chicken from Durant and uh it really uh has worked out   umhum how many people Jim are involved   uh generally uh i think its been as high as about a hundred and twenty people i think normal is about sixty or seventy   wow yeah well i guess um ours probably isnt that big our family is dwindling for one thing   oh   and i often feel funny because im in a branch thats all but died i just have one aunt and my family   oh   so sometimes when these other families get together theyre really pulling in aunts and uncles and grandkids and were kind of off on the sidelines   yeah   but it does remind us that we have family and roots so we keep going even though were not a real big part of it   right yeah well our family started reunion started out my wife and i were the kids the newlyweds so to speak   umhum   and now we go our children go and our grandchildren are going now so its uh wound up that uh were the old folks now   oh thats great umhum umhum     but um they have various organized they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes uh to pitch and they organize a baseball game for the kids   umhum   and several people bring boats and theres a place they they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon so it its a full day some of the people come down on Friday afternoon and spend the whole weekend and some just come in for Saturday   so theres lots to do umhum uhhuh   so it uh has worked out quite well and its a chance to see some of the relatives you dont see all year long except that once a year   umhum thats true well thats neat i i think theyre really fun we go to mine regularly and then we go to my husbands occasionally down in Temple and he has a large family so its its fun when we go to that one   yeah my side of the family is from back in Ohio and West Virginia and i think weve been to one in thirty five years  or something like that so   oh   thats just too far away   oh it would be more yeah yeah that that is a problem with the distance the people that we have that dont come are out El Paso way and its just too much for all of them   yeah its an all day drive just to get to this area   all of that group to travel right but then we have the same attitude when its out there although this year were going out theyre going to have it at Fort Davis and we thought that would be     yeah   fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time as well as reunion   yeah yeah we have uh each year of course they elect officers of the family reunion and a number of years ago back in the early eighties my wife was president we discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together and it takes a lot of planning and   umhum umhum and choose some place that everybodys going to like   assembling of stuff right   as far as food and all that   thats correct       so   thats a heavy burden   yes it is  i i i dont really care for her to be president again     no     but that is uh its its a lot of work but its a lot of fun   umhum   weve enjoyed it and   well i think   the grandkids really enjoy it because its the only time of the year they see all their cousins from Oklahoma   yeah and its its good for kids to know that they have other family   yeah and this year theyre all excited The show this weekend this weekend is going to be a rock and roll show my two grandsons and one of their cousins are are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song you know in jeans and Tshirts and such   oh boy oh what fun uhhuh   so its uh its going to be exciting for them and for us too   umhum probably lots of laughs   oh yes       there have been some really wild shows put on there they uh really get uh into it   umhum well it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along ours ours is still kind of loosely organized and the same people usually get stuck with doing it and   yeah well oh that generally happens   they do it as a labor of love so the officer idea is a good idea   yes yeah well weve uh had various things over the years uh to raise funds for it   umhum   and again its not its not cheap to rent the lodge up there or the meeting meeting room down in the cabins and such but uh theyve come up with theyve tried passing the hat and theyve had auctions and various things to raise funds and uh   yeah umhum   umhum   some people do and some people dont   yeah and its not fair that everybody not contribute     excuse me but um anyway thats the family reunion story   umhum     okay   well thanks a lot i enjoyed talking to you   been nice talking to you   bye   bye
