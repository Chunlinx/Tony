get through   okay   all right here we go   okay     Susan what kind of fishing do you like   lets see uh the only kinds ive ever done are just regular you know fishing in the lake or i have actually fished for Brook Trout in Colorado but   umhum oh   ive always wanted to go deep sea fishing but ive never i cant ever get anybody to to go with me   yeah you almost need to get several to go it its so expensive to rent those boats   yeah yeah i thats i thats what i hear is you know that you its not too bad if you can put uh like eight people on a boat then it comes down to not being so expensive   yeah umhum   but i also found out some more about it and im not sure i would enjoy it i dont know that i would really like you know fighting with a fish for   for umpteen hours yeah that you know takes a lot of strength for that   hours you yeah i i   i like the kind where i sit on the bank and watch my bobber and when it goes down i pull a fish in   yeah yeah   thats the kind i like   in fact thats the most successful i have ever i mean as far as ever ever catching a big fish thats how i caught one with   um what did you catch   um a a bass it was a well see i cant remember if it weighed three and a half pounds or five   um   five pounds or   well thats a big fish   i mean it was you know big i mean it was biggest fish ive ever caught in my life you know   thats wonderful   i was so excited you know i was like screaming my father was running you know he saw the fish go flying through the air and   ive never caught one yeah oh     that part of it was kind of i dont know   exciting yeah   i was fishing with a little light reight weight rod and wed been fishing down behind theres a place on the back side of this dam of this little lake that we its a little private lake that we water ski on a lot and   umhum umhum   and they have have the water they let water drain off the back side of the dam through just kind of a   umhum   i dont know its some kind of a little drain shaft or something and and it makes a pool and then it goes on down the little creek that they dammed up to make the lake in the first place and they were theres a little pond kind of a   yeah um   pool of water there that is pretty turbulent and its usually pretty good fishing and mom and dad were fishing in there and something kept eating my minnows you know and i was getting real ticked off because i couldnt you know i wasnt catching anything   yeah i know umhum umhum   so i crossed the little road that crosses the stream and went stomping down through the woods and where the creek runs on out theres a big old tree uprooted and laid over lengthwise in the water and i   umhum yeah   thought to myself you know i mean this creek is about five feet across max and i thought you know   umhum   i bet you at the end of those roots there might be something and so i had my little you know i couldnt cast because the trees hanging over and brush and everything so i just kind of   umhum oh yeah   held the bobber in my hand and flipped it out there in in and amongst the tree roots and it kind of went around in a circle and then it kind of went right below the water and then it went around and then it just went whom altogether out of sight altogether so i started reeling you know and it was stripping my line   umhum um   as i started going i realized i had something bigger than than i was equipped for because i had one of these little ultra light you know kind of casting rods and i was like oh man so i was reeling for all i was worth and pulling you know pulling on the line with   yeah yeah um
