 DearPrudence                                                      Your recent columnabout emboldens me to ask perhaps a rude question Is it bad manners for aguest to excuse himself from the dinner table go to the small bathroom off thedining room and attempt to participate in the conversation Our friend Jacobdoes just that Do you think he should wander upstairs and if not at least besilent                                       Just Wondering                        Dear Just            Prudie too hates tomiss a minute of good dinner party talk but your friend Jacob goes too farHollering from the loo is not acceptable When you issue the next invitationtell him youd like it if he would take a timeout from the badinage whenhe needs to leave the table Tell him its a little idiosyncrasy of yours thatyou think people conversing at the table should  be at the table            Prudie conversationally                                             DearPrudence                                                      My matron of honor is unexpectedly moving awayShe is a good friend and I will be sorry to see her leave Now I need to askanother person to be in the wedding which is two months away The person Iwant to ask is actually my best friend and she lives in another state Shealready knows that I had asked someone else to stand up for me so my questionis How do I now ask her to be my matron of honor She is really the person Iwanted anywayshe just lives far away                                       Help                                       AG                        Dear A            There are a few loose ends to your problem Firstis the reigning matron of honor moving to Bangladesh People travel to weddingsall the time Your best friendreplacement matron of honor herself lives outof state It is not immediately obvious why she wouldnt have been asked in thefirst place  being your best friend            If however travelingback for the festivities is for some reason impossible for the current M ofH Prudie suggests you garland the truth with sentiment when you ask your bestfriend Simply tell her she was your first choice but you were trying to spareher the expense  her living far away etc and you would be thrilled ifshe were able to stand up for you If she is a real friend and can spare thetime and money she will understand and accept If not Prudie recommends youfigure out your third choice Perhaps someone local            Prudie matrimonially                                             DearPrudence                                                      At a small gatheringwith outoftown friends in the Shenandoah recently the discussion turned topolitics I dont wish to be specific but a prominent national figure wascompared to the Antichrist I am reluctant to identify the targetspecifically because I allow for honest differences of opinion My disclaimernotwithstanding does one have to be a Christian to comment on the Antichristcomparison One part of me says the allusion is nonreligious having to do withan assessment of evil  fair game for anyone Yet another voice whispers thatI should shy away from discussing the hagiography or whatever of a differentfaith Please let me know how Prudence would have reacted                                       From Gods Country WV                CAK                        Dear From            The historical Jesus issuch a part of ancient and modern thought that reference to him has little todo with whether one is a believer or not That particular phrase has becomepart of the language Prudie in fact refers to her starter husband thatway As for the whispering voice thats telling you one should shy away fromdiscussing faiths to which one does not belong tell it that there is even acollege course dealing with this subject It is called Comparative Religion Inan ecumenical spirit Prudie wanted to answer you in Islamic pentameter butshe is fluent only in limericks            Prudie permissively                                             DearPrudence                                                      I have seen many people drive haphazardlythrough parking lots I have even seen one or two flip me the bird because Ihappened to obey the law even stopping at the stop signs which annoyinglyslows them down Believe me it takes great willpower to not chase after themand shake them until their teeth rattle Yes you have people who takehandicapped spots when they have no right to be parking there but even worseare these crazies who think that parking lots are just enclosedhighways                                       My grandmother wasin a serious accident in a parking lot several years ago because of one ofthese crazies He slammed into her then had the nerve to get out of his carlie down on the ground and say he had whiplash He blamed her She had to goto court as a defendant  all because he was trying to get out of the lotfirst by speeding around her The point is that some young jerk almost killedher in a parking lot because he didnt want to wait How do we deal with theseimpatient asinine automotive airheads                                       Aggravated                        Dear Ag            Calm yourself This isone of those irritants that is very difficult to redress Our whole societynot just drivers has become increasingly impatient and always in a hurry Roadrage is one byproduct of the behavior you are concerned about Defensivedriving is probably the most constructive thing you can do Whenever you see aperson driving erratically reduce your own speed and try to get out of theway If you think someone is breaking a law take down the license plate numberand call the police It would be nice if all parking lots would put in thosebumps to make slower speeds mandatory but that is not going to happen Alasvehicular rodeos are here to stay so just count to  Well maybe             Prudie pragmatically                                             DearPrudie                                                      After manydiscussions among my friends we still have not come to any conclusion aboutwhether we would live with someone before we married them Do you think thatliving with someone before marriage gives the marriage a more stable foundationon which to build or is cohabitation better left until after marriage We wereconsidering the divorce rate these days and whether this is a significantvariable in the increase or has society changed its values                                       Yourssincerely                                       Mellie                        Dear Mel            Your question is a kindof hybrid of To be or not to be and Which came first the chicken or theegg There are so many variables that Prudie would not consider offering arule or an opinion This is one of those decisions that two people must makebased on their values circumstances upbringing and beliefs Living togetherwithout benefit of clergy can be destructive instructive useful a mess or ablessing Hows that for waffling            Prudie unknowingly
