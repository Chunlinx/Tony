        play     yeah i uh consider myself a hacker how about you   oh yeah well im into it uh   yeah uh im not as good as id like to be but its a   is anybody   no i dont think so um i started playing when i was in elementary school actually we lived really close to a par three golf course and id go up there with friends after school a couple times every week and then     really oh wow   for uh for years i dont know after elementary school all through junior high and stuff i didnt play because i think i just got so frustrated when i was little id my body wasnt you know physically developed and all that kind of stuff and then id started started started picking it up again a couple of years back and ive really been enjoying it   right super yeah thats kind of the way i did it too actually i i played uh just a tiny bit when i was real young and then uh i went i got on to a team in high school but wasnt very good still   uhhuh   but and then quit for awhile and recently i picked it up like you say about a couple years ago and uh ive been playing you know off and on when i can up in Minneapolis its not too easy to play in the winter of course but   right uhhuh   i actually live in Florida so uh uh ill be going back down there in May and hopefully be picking it up a little more regularly   uhhuh right the the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of playing golf   i was going to say   i mean its a great game but i mean to play a really nice course youve got to have a really big wallet  i mean   yeah thats thats true all too many times   yeah   fortunately uh down where i live in Florida theres some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look   uhhuh   um one of them is the University of Florida golf course which is open to the public and thats pretty pretty good   right yeah i uh attend Indiana University and its the same way here they have a really nice championship style course that   yeah   is fairly reasonable to play on   can you get like a a student discount type of thing or   uh a little bit but not a whole lot i mean i youd think you would but uh you dont so i   yeah what uh what uh what are greens fees run there   uh well they range from anywhere from about five bucks for uh your basic city type course up to fifty sixty dollars for a really really nice course   okay thats yeah thats about the same i guess as it is in Florida but   uhhuh my dad is a member of a golf club over in my home town and i can play for free there and its a pretty nice course   really oh thats super   yeah and i guess it well its free for me  yeah somebodys paying but   yeah uhhuh   not me   well thats the way to do it though thats the way to get in to some good practice without having to pay for it all the time   yeah yeah definitely as far as watching golf i mean i can watch it on TV but its kind of boring its nice to see those who guys they have such good style that uh its uh  its pretty fun to watch   yeah yeah they need to get a new photography method because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball  thats thats a little difficult i mean it they do they do a generally okay job but like you said its its kind of boring actually   right yeah uhhuh what i really uh i uh had a chance they had the PGA tournament up in Indianapolis last year i was able to go and see one of the rounds of that and that was really fun   oh yeah yeah i bet that would be great   i mean you knew it yeah i never really thought it was would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch but man it was it was something else just to follow those guys around and actually watch them play   yeah yeah ive never been to a tournament uh you know looking at it on TV you you thinking man  what a boring thing you know   right   but uh thats thats wild though ill have to see if i cant get a a chance to go   you got i mean its uh its a lot more exciting than actually watching watching than watching it on TV and if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around i mean its just watching them the whole time instead of like on TV you get to see them make a tee shot and then they go off to some other hole and they come back when theyre putting but you know its really something else   right   yeah i can imagine  what do you do for a living   uh im a student right now   oh you are which uh which university   yeah at uh Indiana University   okay all right great what are you going into   uh i dont really know im a math computer science major right now   okay definitely not golf right   no i wish itd be nice to be a pro golfer i mean it seems like that that would be an okay life just to hang out and   yeah if youre good you can really rake in the bucks what was that what was that movie that they had out   yeah   there there was a movie about a professional golfer and i i cant remember it was on network TV a couple times   huh oh yeah   yeah   well you know you it seems like well you go to work every weekend play maybe one two tournaments a month and come in about tenth youd still be doing pretty well   thats right you got to take it easy   yeah thats a good thing   so yeah   but uh yeah i guess when i get back im going to school in Florida actually um and fortunately ive been able to to play some golf on a student budget which is real helpful you know but   uhhuh   its its unfortunate you know you hear about Japan i guess you know its its like   right   two hundred and fifty dollar minimum or three hundred dollar minimum just to like to practice even insane   yeah and those fees to join a club like a million dollars or whatever is just that is out of control   yeah     i mean youd really want to really be liking your golf   yeah i guess they have those uh driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of each other   yeah i saw one of those on TV that is pretty wild   they do yeah yeah i yeah i played uh uh eighteen holes with some Japanese guys in in Gainesville as a matter of fact and it was really wild they were into it you know they kicked our butt all the way to   yeah
