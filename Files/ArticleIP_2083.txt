                                 Child Abuse Threat or Menace            With a new governmentfundedstudy in hand Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala diagnosed arising epidemic of child abuse last month She reported that child abuse andneglect nearly doubled in the United States between  and and thatwas only the beginning of the ugly news The number of serious cases hadquadrupled and the percentage of cases being investigated by the authoritieshad actually declined by  percent trends that she called shamefuland startling            IsShalala right Is an unheeded childabuse epidemic raging in America Or as Ithink is more likely is the methodology behind the study and theinterpretation of its numbers flawed And if Shalala overstated the childabuseperil is she undermining public interest in the problem by making it appeartoo big and difficult to fix at a reasonable cost                           A Look at the Numbers                        The secretary drew herstatistics from the National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect whichwas conducted by Westat Inc a consulting firm that conducted similar studiesin  and  In the new study about  professionals a representativesample were asked by Westat whether the children they had served appeared tohave suffered specified harms or to be living under specified conditionsWestat then determined if the reported harms and conditions met the studysdefinitions of abuse and neglect and generated estimates of incidence            The oddthing about Shalalas claim that the number of children abused and neglecteddoubled from  million in  to  million in  is that no other signspoint to such a dramatic increase in child abuse and neglect Fatalitiesarising from child abuse have held roughly steady ranging from  in to  in  according to the National Committee to Prevent ChildAbuse            Of the  million additional cases reportedalmost  percent fall into three suspect categories Anywhere from  percentto  percent of the  million children suffered more than one type of abuseor neglect Unfortunately the study did not unduplicate these reportsNevertheless the proportions I describe below provide a general picture ofwhat is happening                                             Endangeredchildren                account for  percent of the increase These are cases wherethe child was not actually harmed by parental abuse or neglect but was indanger of being harmed according to the views of community professionals orchildprotective service agencies emphasis added See Figure                                              Emotionalabuse                and neglect account for another  percent of the increase Thegreat majority of emotionalabuse cases according to the  Westat studyinvolved verbal assaults and more than half of the emotionalneglect casesinvolved the refusal or delay of psychological care                                             Educational neglect               the chronic failure to send a child toschooladded another  percent to the total of new cases                           Definitional Creep                        All these cases warrantattention but the explosion of numbers may be caused by the growingreportorial sensitivity of professionals that is definitional creepProfessionals who become more sensitive to possible abuse or more adept atnoticing it would make more reports to Westateven if the actual incidencehad not risen In endangerment cases at least the study seems to accept thisexplanation            Accordingto Shalala the number of serious cases increased between  and  fromabout  to nearly  Her comments left the impression that thecases involved lifethreatening assaults but the study defines serious casesas any in which the child suffered longterm impairment of physical mentalor emotional capacities or required professional treatment aimed at preventingsuch longterm impairment Emotional maltreatment accounted for fully half ofthe increase in serious cases See Figure                            I n cases labeled as serious physical abuse the reported injurycould be mental or emotional            Even in these seriouscases the study seems affected by definitional creep For example in threecategories sexual abuse physical neglect and emotional neglect the numberof cases described as moderate declined even as the number of serious onesincreasedstrongly suggesting that cases once viewed as only moderatelythreatening have now been upgraded to the most dire category                           Uninvestigated Cases                        Shalalas assertion thatinvestigations of child abuse and neglect cases have dropped by  percentdeserves closer scrutiny In producing the number of uninvestigated cases thestudy compared the number of cases identified by professionals with those knownto local agencies Of the cases not investigated  percent involvededucational neglect See Figure             The main flaw here is thatmost educationalneglect cases are handled by the schools reports are made toprotective agencies only when all else fails            Another  percent ofuninvestigated cases involved emotional abuse and neglect But childprotectiveagencies usually avoid these cases because they tend to involve subjectivejudgments and there is little that a quasilawenforcement agency can do aboutthem            Definitional creep is clearly at play here too Professionals who areincreasingly willing to identify situations as harmful arent necessarily readyto equate them with the sort of abuse and neglect they are legally obliged toreport And even if they did report these instances childprotective agencieswould still be expected to screen them out                           Does Shalala Believe Her Own Hype                        Probably not Radical actionwould be required if Shalalas figures were even roughly correct But insteadof proposing radical action when she released the report she outlined modeststeps that had long been planned and budgeted            Having worked in the fieldfor  years I can testify firsthand that the problem of child abuse andneglect is real But however well meant exaggerating the severity of abuseendangers children In the late s for example the nation was told that drugexposed babies were born each year Washington policymakers wereimmobilized by estimates that tens of billions of dollars were needed toprotect these children In fact the true number was closer to  and adecade later the government has yet to mount a meaningful program for thechildren of addicts            Overstatement may alsoobscure genuinely worrisome findings Some of the increases in sexual abusephysical abuse and physical neglect uncovered by Westat may well reflect atrue deterioration of conditions in disorganized povertystricken householdsBut Shalala paid scant attention to this possibility            And to claim recklessly thattoo few cases are investigated is to play with fire Childprotective agenciesare already overwhelmed investigating about  million reports a yeartwothirds of which are dismissed as unfounded or inappropriate For many inthe field the most pressing need is to discourage inappropriate reportingnotto blithely call for more                           Figuresfor specific types of maltreatment exclude endangerment cases
