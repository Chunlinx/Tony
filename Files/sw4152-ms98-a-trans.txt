        oh well       anyway i uh i uh oh i i did forget to ask you what is your name by the way   um im Ann   oh youre Ann hi but um anyway i uh lot of lot of stuff interesting procedural things i think we could we could change if were going to talking about the subject tonight tonight which is some i guess criminal courts the   criminal courts yes   yeah the  the one of which was uh something something thats been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town and that is uh and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race uh yeah yeah well the the uh the the people that   oh really   the the the uh the jury thats trying uh the officers in that case is is an all white panel and theres been a lot made in the local papers of that fact   right how is it i cant im a little surprised they didnt get a change of venue on that one   they have they have they moved it up to the county north of here   oh   um its in Ventura and theres theres still quite a bit of publicity obviously and its kind of its kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that uh that   well that videotape was just horrible   yeah it was everywhere   yeah   so you know and i i think it would be very difficult to find someone uh find a panel that would be not have seen it and and known of what was going on   oh i agree with you but i cant imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of of discrimination or or you know uh appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff   exactly you know um the you know i im kind of torn on this issue its like theyre saying well on the one hand theyre not hes not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true but on the other hand is its also saying that white jurors are not going to are not going to convict   right   uh you know theyre not going to do their job which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that theres enough   exactly based on fact right how interesting ooh so whats the prevailing thought within the community   i um   i mean you know what the news medias gonna make of it but what about the community   they well i guess it depends on who you talk to i havent talked to uh i havent talked to a whole lot of black people on it but i i rather imagine theres  theres some snickering about it and a lot of the usually fatalistic oh here we go again folks kind of stuff   uhhuh oh my goodness that cant be good for Los Angeles either   no no i you know on on on one hand you on the one hand you almost hope that they convict them because its they they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing these people beating the heck out of this guy   oh exactly   um   unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to uh a big city like Los Angeles youre going to have it just about anywhere   umhum   there but thats thats interesting   well yeah um   what about the judge whos hearing the case is he gonna be impartial is he going to be a good a good adjudicator     i dont know you know and and again theres something else that you know there was a uh it something else along those lines there was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins i dont know if this this got this got as much notoriety but its rather almost as infamous here as it was as it was with uh the Rodney King problem um girl walked into a Korean owned store  and uh they she had a dispute black girl   uhhuh   she she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the with the owner of the store the owner of the store popped her   oh really   yeah and and well of course the you know the criminal case went up and  and the judge gave the woman who shot her shot the girl a uh uh practically a suspended sentence i mean it was   oh my goodness   it was just she gave her no time in jail and and you know all of these things and then oh theres uh we have these we have people wandering around to with petitions trying to get the judge   to get that judge recalled i would think     yeah yeah   hm thats almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized standardized sentences   yeah it would make it would make life easier yeah but   it would uh you would know the whole world would know what you were facing   umhum   and then its a matter of of deciding guilt
