            well Hal whats uh whats crime like in Dallas   well it depends where in Dallas you are there are certainly parts of town   uhhuh   i would not want to  live in   yeah   because its a situation it is very location dependent   uhhuh   and there are parts of town here where when they talk about the nightly gunfire   oh yeah yeah in Baltimore we have similar i live on the outskirts of Baltimore and uh we live right outside the city and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people though im in graduate school uh i live here because its close to the university but you know we have uh it its really funny the only crime we really see   uhhuh   is uh just the kids being malicious   uhhuh   you know and i think most of that is because their parents arent around that make sense   yeah that uh the what they call the latchkey children   yeah yeah something like that no ones you know or or fathers are just missing you know so theres no uh no consistency there in the home or whatever theres no one to tell them whats right and whats wrong you know   you know the suburb im in is more of the upper middle class so i think our uh not that we dont have a certain amount of local problems but on the other hand   uhhuh uhhuh   uh we get the uh affect of the the city and   uhhuh   uh the main crimes within the suburb here are the the theft crimes   yeah   a small number of assaults uh well if we have one murder a year   yeah   thats probably as many but then you know you go into Dallas and they are unfortunately   umhum   uh having murders at a rate greater than one a day   yeah yeah i think thats were about the same in Baltimore though um Washington i think is uh close by and you know they experience a lot more i think they definitely have more problems that uh   uhhuh   in in the area what what do you think can prevent crime   well uh the thing is i dont its one of those things where if youre a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on unfortunately there are often these correlations that are   uhhuh   inverse of what they should be like uh wherever there are more uh criminals there are more policemen but thats which came first   yeah  yeah   but on the other side of it is its its basically the the problem is within the in the society and the societys views   uhhuh   and uh well since now im in my mid forties when i was in grad school or when i was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area i thought you know crime was was reasonably unknown and just the situation thats developed with the   uhhuh yeah   the drug aspect of uh   yeah i think uhhuh   uh the pushers the dealers and the addicts um   yeah i i i think i agree with you there yeah   because it just was not uh something back in the sixties that   uhhuh   uh i even had to worry about but i think you know that there is a lot in the society where things have changed uh so its effected all of us   uhhuh yeah i think they the drug culture definitely has uh is one of the main problems yeah our uh our mayor in uh Baltimore is one of the people that goes on national television and says they should uh legalize drugs   uhhuh   because it would eliminate the uh the violence and the uh the under the the market i guess the the hidden market of the drugs and everything that goes along with it that make sense hes one of the big proponents of that he gets on national television and and says that you know so its um   uhhuh   and he was a District Attorney before and a prosecutor before becoming becoming mayor so thats a really stranger you know its a different viewpoint i uh   you know in a sense i dont im not i have real mixed feelings on that because it comes a bit from the angle that the uh   yeah   uh it would certainly be an interesting test   uhhuh   but the other side of it to me   what happens if we lose worse   uh you well the other side is that unfortunately   yeah   some of the down side and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years id say you know back then there were the opium dens but the thing is if somebody ruined their life   right   uh society didnt try to then save themselves from it they let this person   umhum   who had ruined it uh become well die or whatever i mean they probably became weakened physically and other things to the point that   right yeah   their life expectancy was real short but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise we need to take care of people even if they have you know physically ruined themselves   yeah they have induced it themselves yeah thats true   and so to me thats i uh i would certainly like to see a real test of of making drugs real cheap to see if when you make them available people then dont use them   uhhuh uhhuh well i think you know they did that in Alaska   uh   that that actually Alaska just recently legalized marijuana   uhhuh   but i never i never heard results or anything like that so i never you know plus thats such a thats not a true um you know it really couldnt be a good test because Alaskas so different than every other part of the country   uhhuh   you know so that but that was interesting you know i i dont crime is one of those things thats uh i i dont know you know the drug culture the uh the um you know i i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things not thinking anything wrong with it   yeah well the some of that and of course im a baby of the old school but it it bothers me from the fifties on not that id remember that much from the fifties but but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality   yeah uhhuh yeah thats true thats true we worked hard for everything thats very true   and so you know in the there were the sixty four thousand dollar question shows in the fifties but nowadays theres so much on TV where   uhhuh   where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing of course   uhhuh   uh i work with lawyers a lot and i see unfortunately we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and you know theres a million dollars you can have   uhhuh   uh for mental duress or whatever   yeah   but you know the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the uh in Europe they seem to have mentality and drunk driving is a good one is that people are well indoctrinated their society that drunken driving is unacceptable   right   and yeah if youre going to drink and you may drink you better have your designated driver in this country and for example with alcohol or with drugs is   uhhuh   we dont seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay it is okay under these circumstances but if you step outside these bounds the punishment is extreme and we mean it   yeah yeah that i think that uh the drunk driving has just actually just caught on uh uh and i i i really uh my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school and um   uhhuh uhhuh   that was a very uh that that was an awful three years afterwards you know of recovery and the difficulties   uhhuh   and uh everything we did and you know the guy went free because this was twelve years ago thirteen years ago there was no his father was even the uh police chief of the town   uhhuh   so there was no repercussion at all   uhhuh   you know other than insurance but he was uninsured so uh our insurance paid for everything but it was a very difficult time and and then later this was actually funny my brother and i were picked up by the police for questioning because this fellow had bought a a new car and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it   yeah   and broke all his windows and his lights and his dented it everywhere and they came and questioned us   uhhuh yeah   you know and   but that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking and driving   right   was uh misplaced for years that you know   uhhuh yep   it was an acceptable social behavior   uhhuh yeah very much so yeah that those are some important points yeah i thats those are   what are what does your city have for gun control if anything   well see Maryland is one of the most we just voted in uh gun control strong gun control here in the state of Maryland i i think
