                    Background                Staphylococcus aureus is the most        common cause of osteomyelitis a disease often refractory        to treatment and subject to recurrence Traditional        treatment for osteomyelitis involves surgical debridement        of infected tissue coupled with systemic antibiotic        therapy Only a few decades ago the majority of         S aureus strains associated with        osteomyelitis were susceptible to antibiotics including        methicillin However the emergence of antibiotic        resistance among strains of         S aureus has rendered methicillin        and many other antibiotics less effective against this        organism Consequently there is an urgent need for the        development of novel therapies for the treatment of        osteomyelitis                S aureus is a capable bone pathogen        in part because it possesses several cell surface adhesion        molecules that facilitate its binding to bone matrix        Binding involves a family of adhesins that interact with        extracellular matrix components and these adhesins have        been termed microbial surface components recognizing        adhesive matrix molecules MSCRAMMs     Specific        MSCRAMMs are responsible for localization of         S aureus to particular tissues and        include fibronectinbinding proteins FnBPs             fibrinogenbinding proteins       elastinbinding        adhesin    collagenbinding adhesion     and a        broadspecificity adhesin MAP that facilitates        lowaffinity binding of         S aureus to several proteins        including osteopontin collagen bone sialoprotein        fibronectin fibrinogen and vitronectin             S aureus can utilize MSCRAMMs to        adhere directly to cells or can attach to cells through the        use of bridging ligands such as Hsp which has an affinity        for both MSCRAMMs and the           integrin host cell receptor             Interaction of         S aureus with host cells via        MSCRAMMs can induce signal transduction tyrosine kinase        activity and cytoskeletal rearrangement            Compared to other bacteria         S aureus is generally not considered        a significant intracellular pathogen Staphylococci have        typically been regarded as noninvasive extracellular        pathogens that damage host cells after adhering to the        extracellular matrix however there is growing evidence        that         S aureus has the ability to invade        and persist within eukaryotic cells         S aureus has been shown to be        ingested by nonprofessional phagocytes such as mouse        fibroblasts     mouse renal cells     and bovine        mammary epithelial cells              S aureus also has the ability to        invade mouse and human osteoblast cell lines      as        well as normal mouse and human osteoblasts            Finally         S aureus has been shown to invade        normal chick osteoblasts both in vitro and in vivo                     S aureus cells were found in        approximately  of calvarial osteoblasts after        subcutaneous injection of chick embryos and in  of        calvarial and tibial osteoblasts following intraallantoic        injection Similar to most in vitro studies the majority        of intracellular bacteria are eventually free in the        osteoblast cytoplasm in vivo         S aureus cells in calvariae and        tibiae were also observed in the cytoplasm of approximately         of the osteocytes in mineralized bone matrix Therefore        osteoblasts containing internalized         S aureus cells continue        differentiating into osteocytes In addition         S aureus invasion of osteoblasts        stimulates the secretion of interleukin IL IL and        colonystimulating factors       These cytokines        can potentially exacerbate the bone destruction already        characteristic of infection by activation of osteoclasts        In addition to osteoclast activation         S aureus inhibits bonematrix        synthesis further compounding bone loss observed with        osteomyelitis            The ability of         S aureus to survive in the        eukaryotic intracellular environment could explain several        aspects of chronic staphylococcal diseases and longterm        colonization Internalization may provide a means of        protection against host defenses and certain classes of        antibiotics Many staphylococcal infections which tend to        become chronic eg osteomyelitis and mastitis are        associated with multiple recurrences and do not resolve        even in the presence of what seems to be an adequate        humoral immune response        For example        patients can have recurrent attacks of osteomyelitis after        completion of treatment even when causative organisms        cannot be isolated            Staphylococcal infections are typically associated with        death of tissue and evidence suggests intracellular        bacteria are capable of inducing apoptosis         S aureus mediated apoptosis has        been reported in epithelial cells              keratinocytes     endothelial cells      and        osteoblasts     The two global gene regulatory loci         agr and         sar have been demonstrated to play a        role in the induction of apoptosis in epithelial cells by         S aureus     Mutants in the         agr or         sar loci are internalized but do not        induce apoptosis     Another study demonstrated        induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells by        staphylococcal alpha toxin            Wesson et al    demonstrated host caspases and         to play a role in         S aureus induced apoptosis and        caspase is known to be associated with apoptosis        triggered by engagement of death receptors     Several        recent studies have associated microbial induction of        apoptosis with the production of tumor necrosis        factorrelated apoptosisinducing ligand TRAIL Measles        virus was the first infectious agent shown to induce TRAIL        production     Other studies have demonstrated        induction of TRAIL by Theilers murine encephalomyelitis        virus TMEV in MD cells a myelomonocytic precursor cell        line     reovirus infection in fibroblasts            HIV infection in CD T cells     and adenovirus in        T cells     The demonstration of caspase        involvement in         S aureus induced apoptosis is        complemented by a recent report from our laboratory that         S aureus induces expression of TRAIL        by infected osteoblasts     We reported that         S aureus strongly induces TRAIL        expression by both normal mouse and normal human        osteoblasts while mRNAs encoding the        deathdomaincontaining TRAIL receptors are constitutively        expressed in the same cells         S aureus caused a rapid and        sustained upregulation of TRAIL mRNA and TRAIL protein        expression TRAIL is also secreted by         S aureus infected osteoblasts        suggesting that TRAIL could influence cells outside the        environment of a localized bacterial infection        In the present study we examined the ability of        purified bacterial surface structures and extracellular        products to induce TRAIL expression in osteoblasts The        ability of TRAIL produced by         S aureus infected osteoblasts to        mediate osteoblast apoptosis was also examined Results        demonstrate that purified bacterial surface structures and         S aureus extracellular products        present outside osteoblasts are not a sufficient stimulus        for TRAIL induction and that physical contact between        bacteria and osteoblasts is required for optimal induction        of TRAIL expression TRAIL produced by         S aureus infected osteoblasts does        induce caspase activation and apoptosis Collectively        these results reveal TRAIL induction and caspase        activation as a mechanism whereby         S aureus mediates apoptosis in        osteoblasts                    Results                  Purified bacterial products in the osteoblast          extracellular environment do not induce TRAIL          expression          In order to determine the role of           S aureus derived peptidoglycan          and teichoic acid in the expression of TRAIL by           S aureus infected osteoblasts          cultured normal human osteoblasts were incubated with          various concentrations of these purified cell wall          structures  ngml  ngml or  gml          Additionally osteoblasts were incubated with various          concentrations of staphylococcal enterotoxin A SEA           ngml  ngml or  gml used here as a          representative superantigen from           S aureus  or with a purified          component of gramnegative bacteria specifically          lipopolysaccharide LPS  ngml  ngml or           gml The concentrations of staphylococcal          peptidoglycan teichoic acid SEA and LPS tested did not          induce TRAIL expression in osteoblasts Fig  Results          for the lower concentrations of teichoic acid and SEA           ngml and  ngml are not shown As previously          reported     TRAIL protein was induced in          osteoblasts infected with           S aureus Fig  These results          demonstrate that major surface components from these          bacteria in a purified form present in the osteoblast          extracellular environment are not sufficient to induce          TRAIL expression in normal human osteoblasts                          Induction of TRAIL by S aureusrequires physical          contact between bacteria and osteoblasts          Studies indicate that the invasion ability of bacteria          are most relevant to the magnitude of the osteoblast          response      In previous experiments examining          the production of TRAIL by           S aureus infected osteoblasts          bacteria were in direct contact with the cells              such that the potential of           S aureus extracellular products to          induce osteoblast expression and secretion of TRAIL could          not be addressed To determine if           S aureus extracellular products          induce TRAIL expression in osteoblasts normal mouse          osteoblasts were grown in well cluster plates           S aureus strain UAMS at a MOI of            or  was then added separately to          Transwell cell culture chamber inserts The inserts were          placed into the well plates containing osteoblasts          followed by incubation for  minutes The polycarbonate          membrane at the base of each chamber insert contains          pores  m in size and precludes direct interaction          between the bacteria and osteoblasts However the          inserts allow for the exchange of extracellular products          Direct physical contact between           S aureus and osteoblasts at a MOI          of  induced osteoblast TRAIL protein expression          Fig  TRAIL protein was not expressed in osteoblast          cultures coincubated with           S aureus at various MOIs where          physical contact between the bacteria and osteoblasts was          prevented Fig  These results demonstrate that          physical contact between the host and pathogen is          required for optimal TRAIL induction The importance of          bacterial internalization however could not be          addressed in these experiments                          TRAIL induces apoptosis in osteoblasts          TRAIL may mediate a number of physiological responses          therefore in order to determine if TRAIL expressed by           S aureus infected osteoblasts          mediates osteoblast apoptosis cultured normal mouse          osteoblasts were infected with           S aureus strain UAMS at various          MOIs in the presence and absence of an antihuman TRAIL          polyclonal antibody Osteoblasts were stained with          annexin V and propidium iodide PI Redistribution of          phosphotidylserine from the inner leaflet to the outer          leaflet of the plasma membrane occurs early and is a          hallmark of the apoptotic process Annexin V has a high          affinity for phosphatidylserine and was used to detect          apoptotic cells Propidium iodide can be used to          distinguish early apoptotic cells from late apoptotic          cells Early apoptotic cells stain positive for annexin V          and negative for PI where as late apoptotic cells stain          positive for both annexin V and PI     After          staining osteoblasts were analyzed using FACS Fig           Approximately  of the cells from uninfected          osteoblast cultures were annexin V positive The          percentage of annexin Vpositive cells increased to           following infection with           S aureus at a MOI of           corresponding to a greater than fold increase over that          of uninfected control osteoblast cultures A           reduction in annexin Vpositive cells was observed in the          presence of  gml of antihuman TRAIL antibody A           gml concentration of antiTRAIL antibody further          reduced the population of annexin Vpositive cells to           of total osteoblasts corresponding to an          approximately  decrease in the level of annexin          Vpositive cells in           S aureus infected cultures A          dosedependent decrease in annexin Vpositive cells was          observed by the addition of increasing amounts of the          antihuman TRAIL antibody These results strongly suggest          TRAIL production induces osteoblast apoptosis in           S aureus infected osteoblast          cultures The role of TRAIL in           S aureus induced apoptosis is          likely more significant than what is revealed by these          experiments since an antihuman TRAIL antibody was used          to neutralize mouse TRAIL protein Utilization of an          antimouse TRAIL antibody would be predicted to further          reduce the level of           S aureus induced apoptosis in          infected mouse osteoblast cultures                          S aureusinduces caspase activation in          osteoblasts                    S aureus mediated apoptosis has          been reported for a variety of cells including          osteoblasts A recent report demonstrated that           S aureus induced apoptosis of          epithelial cells involves activation of caspases and              To determine whether caspase is activated in           S aureus infected osteoblasts          cultured normal mouse osteoblasts were infected with           S aureus strain UAMS at various          MOIs As a positive control osteoblasts were stimulated          with cycloheximide CHX a compound known to induce          caspase activation     At various times          postinfection endogenous caspase activity was          quantified          Activated caspase was detected in uninfected control          osteoblast cultures Fig  and is attributable to          apoptosis and cell turnover in the in vitro osteoblast          tissue culture system Osteoblasts infected with           S aureus at a MOI of           demonstrated a fold increase in activated caspase           min postinfection which was significantly higher than          the level of activated caspase in the uninfected          control p   Fig  This early activation of          caspase in           S aureus infected osteoblasts          coincides with previous observations in other systems          For example caspase is activated in HeLa cells within           h following the administration of TRAIL     The          level of caspase activation in osteoblasts exposed to          CHX a known activator of caspase     was          significantly higher than the level of activity in          uninfected cells and was equivalent to the level in           S aureus infected osteoblasts          Fig            S aureus induced caspase          activation was sustained for  h following infection          data not shown In fact the levels of activated          caspase were significantly higher at  h than at  min          postinfection in           S aureus infected          osteoblasts          Caspase has been identified as an initiator caspase          activated in death receptormediated apoptosis              Therefore we investigated whether blockade of TRAIL          expressed by           S aureus infected osteoblasts had          any effect on the levels of caspase enzymatic activity          Mouse osteoblasts were infected with           S aureus in the presence of          increasing concentrations of antihumanTRAIL antibody          Figure demonstrates that antiTRAIL antibody interferes          with caspase activation A clear doseresponse was          observed in the levels of caspase enzymatic activity          As the concentrations of the antiTRAIL antibody          increase the levels of caspase specific activity          decrease The highest concentration of antiTRAIL          antibody utilized significantly reduced the level of          caspase enzymatic activity in           S aureus infected osteoblast          cultures at  min and  h postinfection p            Fig and data not shown These results suggest that          caspase activation is mediated by TRAIL and that          induction of apoptosis by TRAIL utilizes an intracellular          mechanism involving caspase activation                            Discussion        TRAIL is a member of the TNF gene superfamily of        receptors and ligands and was discovered based on sequence        homology to other members of the superfamily using an EST        database     Among other family members TRAIL is most        similar to Fas ligand sharing  homology TRAIL can be        expressed as a membranebound protein or solubilized by        metalloendoproteinase cleavage The bioactive form of TRAIL        is as a homotrimer     There are five known human        TRAIL receptors including R R R R and        osteoprotegerin OPG however R and R are the only        TRAIL receptors known to contain complete death domains        The signaling pathways of TRAIL and its receptors are not        fully known     however recent studies suggest TRAIL        activates pathways similar to those activated by TNF and        its receptors     Binding of TRAIL to deathdomain        containing receptors can cause apoptosis via activation of        caspase in Jurkat and HeLa cells             We have previously demonstrated that         S aureus induces TRAIL expression in        normal human and mouse osteoblasts     Messenger RNA        encoding TRAIL is rapidly and dramatically upregulated        following exposure of osteoblasts to         S aureus  TRAIL mRNA expression is        absent in uninfected cultures and shows a dosedependent        response to         S aureus  In contrast to the        inducible nature of TRAIL mRNA the messages encoding        deathdomaincontaining TRAIL receptors are constitutively        expressed in human and mouse osteoblasts            Additionally TRAIL protein is expressed and secreted        following infection of osteoblasts with         S aureus  In contrast uninfected        osteoblasts do not express significant amounts of TRAIL        protein        The current study examined possible mechanisms whereby         S aureus induces TRAIL expression in        osteoblasts Osteoblasts were incubated with various        concentrations of major surface components of         S aureus  peptidoglycan and        teichoic acid as well as LPS of gramnegative bacteria to        determine if these were potential inducers of TRAIL        expression These bacterial components were chosen based on        their ability to induce inflammatory responses The two        major components of the staphylococcal cell wall        peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid have been reported to        produce inflammation     and specifically to induce        arthritis     Bacterial peptidoglycan is also known to        stimulate the boneresorbing activity of macrophages            Furthermore staphylococci produce an array of secreted        products capable of inducing or sustaining inflammation        For example the staphylococcal superantigens induce        prolonged inflammatory responses associated with arthritis        and destruction of bone connective tissue            Our results demonstrate that peptidoglycan teichoic        acid LPS and the staphylococcal superantigen        staphylococcal enterotoxin A SEA when present in the        osteoblast extracellular environment do not induce TRAIL        expression Fig  These findings do not eliminate the        possibility that these bacterial structures contribute to        TRAIL induction They are nevertheless insufficient by        themselves to elicit such a response in osteoblasts exposed        extracellularly to the molecules at the concentrations        analyzed The concentrations of bacterial products chosen        were based on previous reports suggesting these amounts are        appropriate and sufficient to elicit cytokine responses        from human cells      It is possible that one or        more of the purified products analyzed contribute to TRAIL        induction but only if expressed inside osteoblasts        While intracellular         S aureus is known to induce TRAIL        expression in osteoblasts     the ability of        extracellular staphylococcal products to induce TRAIL        expression has not been previously investigated Results        from the Transwell coculture experiments Fig         demonstrate that extracellular bacterial products do not        induce TRAIL expression         S aureus at a MOI of   or         was unable to induce TRAIL expression when direct        contact between bacteria and osteoblasts was precluded        Even at the highest MOI used no TRAIL was detected in        response to the coincubation with         S aureus  The bacteria must be in        physical contact and potentially internalized by the        osteoblasts before TRAIL expression is induced These        findings could indicate that attachment of         S aureus to osteoblasts initiates a        cascade ultimately inducing TRAIL expression        Alternatively intracellular bacteria may be the only         S aureus cells capable of inducing        TRAIL expression by osteoblasts        TRAIL clearly mediates cell death in other tissues but        also has the potential to mediate a variety of other        physiological responses in bone Osteoblasts are known to        secrete tumor necrosis factorrelated activationinduced        cytokine TRANCE RANKL which acts on the TRANCE        receptor TRANCER RANK found on osteoclast precursors        Binding of TRANCE to TRANCER induces osteoclastogenesis        and therefore bone resorption Osteoblasts are also known        to secrete osteoprotegerin OPG which binds TRANCE thus        inhibiting osteoclastogenesis Because OPG is a soluble        receptor for TRAIL             S aureus induced TRAIL secretion        could have a profound effect on both osteoblasts and        osteoclasts Therefore the ability of TRAIL expressed by         S aureus infected osteoblasts to        mediate osteoblast apoptosis was examined                S aureus induces osteoblast        apoptosis     When osteoblasts were exposed to         S aureus at a MOI of  the        percentages of annexin Vpositive cells increased from         to  of cells in culture Fig  Numbers of        annexin Vpositive cells were reduced  by the addition        of antiTRAIL antibody  gml to         S aureus infected osteoblast        cultures While the antibodies did not completely inhibit         S aureus induced apoptosis these        results demonstrate that TRAIL contributes to apoptosis in         S aureus infected cultures        TRAILmediated apoptosis of         S aureus infected osteoblasts        suggests a mechanism whereby         S aureus induces the bone loss and        destruction associated with osteomyelitis The inability of        the antiTRAIL antibodies to completely block apoptosis        induced by         S aureus may be attributable to the        specificity of the antibody used for these experiments or        the dosage used since an antihuman TRAIL antibody was        used to neutralize mouse TRAIL protein The role of TRAIL        in         S aureus induced apoptosis is        therefore likely to be more significant than what is        revealed by these experiments Utilization of an antimouse        TRAIL antibody would be predicted to be more effective in        reducing the level of         S aureus induced apoptosis in        infected mouse osteoblast cultures In addition         S aureus may also induce apoptosis        by a mechanism distinct from TRAIL It is known for        example that         S aureus toxin induces apoptosis        in Jurkat cells via the Bclcontrolled mitochondrial        death pathway     therefore neutralization of TRAIL        would not be expected to interfere with this mechanism of        apoptosis induction        TRAILinduced apoptosis involves activation of caspase        in other systems Earlier studies have shown that blockade        of caspase activation in HeLa cells and deletion of        caspase in Jurkat cells prevented activation of        downstream signaling resulting in a failure of the cells        to undergo apoptosis in response to TRAIL            Similarly another group has demonstrated that apoptosis        induced by         S aureus in bovine mammary        epithelial MACT cells utilizes a mechanism involving        caspases and  which are two key components of the        proteolytic cascade that leads to apoptosis            Results from the current study demonstrate a twofold        increase in caspase activation upon infection with         S aureus Fig  Active caspase        was detected in uninfected control osteoblast cultures        Fig  and is attributable to apoptosis and cell        turnover in the in vitro osteoblast tissue culture systems        The level of activated caspase in         S aureus infected osteoblasts was        significantly higher than the level of activated caspase        in uninfected osteoblast control cultures p          Caspase activation in osteoblasts exposed to CHX was also        higher than the level of activity in uninfected cells but        equivalent to the level in infected osteoblasts Fig         These results demonstrate that         S aureus is a potent inducer of        caspase activation in osteoblasts equivalent to a known        inducer of caspase     Overall the levels of        caspase enzymatic activity at  h were significantly        higher compared to the ones obtained  min postinfection        data not shown Neutralization of TRAIL by the addition        of the antiTRAIL antibody interfered with caspase        activation demonstrating a dosedependent response As the        concentrations of the antiTRAIL antibody increased the        levels of caspase activation decreased The highest        concentration of antibodies used significantly reduced the        level of caspase activation in         S aureus infected osteoblast        cultures p   These findings demonstrate that        activation of caspase in         S aureus infected osteoblasts is at        least in part TRAILdependent                    Conclusions        Collectively these findings reveal that         S aureus induces apoptosis in        osteoblasts via a mechanism involving TRAIL induction and        caspase activation Induction of TRAIL by         S aureus requires the bacteria to be        in contact with and potentially internalized by the        osteoblasts Although the exact mechanism whereby         S aureus induces TRAIL expression        remains to be determined this study suggests that major        bacterial surface structures present in the osteoblast        extracellular environment do not induce TRAIL Since TRAIL        mediates a number of physiological responses the impact of                S aureus induced TRAIL expression        on normal bone physiology should be explored The role of         S aureus induced TRAIL in apoptosis        and osteoclastogenesis in vivo is currently being        examined                    Methods                  Normal mouse osteoblast cell culture          Normal osteoblast cell cultures were
