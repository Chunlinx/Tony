                    Background        Conditional gene expression systems such as promoters        regulated by tetracycline or doxycycline DOX have several        advantages for testing the effects of genes on aging and        lifespan     In the teton system feeding DOX to                Drosophila melanogaster causes high        levels of transgene expression in all tissues By waiting        until the young adult stage to administer DOX all of        preadult development is identical between control and        experimental groups and any difference in lifespan must be        due to changes in the adult Subtle differences in the        genetic background of         Drosophila strains can have        significant effects on lifespan     With the teton        system control and experimental animals have identical        genetic backgrounds and therefore any differences in        lifespan must be due to DOX administration and transgene        expression DOX itself and overexpression of control genes        such as         Escherichia coli lacZ have no        detectable effects on lifespan   In contrast several        genes have been identified for which DOXregulated        overexpression has negative effects on lifespan and        overexpression of the         dGMII gene encoding mannosidase        II was associated with slightly increased lifespan                 Expression of antisense RNA has long been known to be        able to inhibit gene expression in         Drosophila and other organisms              Doublestrand RNA dsRNA formed by        hybridization of sense and antisense sequences is thought        to initiate a pathway in which homologous RNA sequences are        destroyed This phenomenon has been referred to as post        transcriptional gene silencing PTGS or RNA interference        RNAi Expression of invertedrepeat constructs where the        transcript is expected to fold into a dsRNA hairpin has        been shown to be an efficient initiator of RNAi            In experiments reported here the teton system was        used to drive expression of invertedrepeat constructs in         Drosophila to determine if a        conditional system for RNAi could be created        In natural populations lifespan and reproductive period        are thought to coevolve   The duration of the        reproductive period is subject to natural selection and        lifespan is altered as a consequence Significant        experimental support for this model has come from        laboratory selection experiments with         D melanogaster              Genetically heterogeneous         Drosophila populations have been        selected over hundreds of generations for latelife        reproduction Such selection results in strains with        increased lifespan relative to controls Selection is        thought to function by altering the frequency of gene        alleles present in the starting population Selected        strains exhibit a number of correlated phenotypes The        correlated phenotypes can vary somewhat depending on the        starting strains used however increased stressresistance        appears to be common to all or most longlived strains              In one well studied set of five        replicate control B and longlived O strains lifespan        was doubled and was correlated with increased        stressresistance and increased glycogen and lipid stores                  Starchgel electrophoresis has been used to assay for        changes in the frequency of enzyme electrophoretic alleles        in the O and B lines A change in the frequency of        CuZnsuperoxide dismutase CuZnSOD alleles was observed        with the more active allele enriched in the longlived O        strains   Consistent with this observation        overexpression of CuZnSOD in transgenic         Drosophila has been shown to be        sufficient to cause significant increases in lifespan           The most dramatic change in allele frequency in the O        and B lines was observed for the gene for         phosphogluconate mutase          Pgm            Pgm exists in three electrophoretic        forms fast          Pgm F medium          Pgm M and slow          Pgm S         Pgm Mpredominates in the B strains        whereas         Pgm Sallele frequency is on average        tenfold higher in the longlived O strains relative to the        B controls When O strains were taken off selection for        several generations backselection lifespan decreased        and         Pgm Sallele frequency was reduced to        levels more like those in B strains These results suggest        that         Pgm or a closely linked gene is        responding to selection and make         Pgm Sa candidate lifespan        regulator                Pgm encodes the enzyme        phosphoglucomutase which interconverts glucose        phosphate and glucose phosphate Its activity is        therefore important for both glycolysis and glycogen        synthesis and the altered         Pgm allele frequency might therefore        be relevant to the increased glycogen and lipid stores of        the O strains If the increased         Pgm Sallele frequency is contributing        to the unique phenotypes of the longlived O strains this        might be because         Pgm Shas increased or decreased        enzyme activity or enzyme activity has been altered in        some way perhaps by a change in its regulation One way        to begin to test these models experimentally is to engineer        transgenic flies with increased or decreased         Pgm expression and assay for effects        on lifespan                    Results        Multiple strains were generated that were homozygous for        each of the F M and S electrophoretic alleles of         Pgm by appropriate crosses to a        third chromosome balancer stock         Pgm enzyme activity and lifespan        varied greatly across the strains with no correlation with         Pgm allele data not shown This        result was expected as differences in genetic background        between such purified chromosome strains has profound        effects on lifespan and the activities of various enzymes            The         Pgm codingregion sequences were        cloned and sequenced from the         Pgm F         Pgm Mand         Pgm Shomozygous strains and from the        CantonS wildtype strain Aminoacid substitutions were        identified that predicted pI values for the alleles that        correlated with their mobility on starch gels Figure         The substitution of T for A in         Pgm Screates the aminoacid sequence        TTK in the singleletter aminoacid code which is a        potential phosphorylation site for protein kinase C PKC        that is absent in         Pgm Mand         Pgm F        If         Pgm Scontributes to the increased        lifespan of the O lines this might be due to increased        enzyme activity decreased enzyme activity or alteration        in enzyme activity in some other way such as in its        regulation or subcellular localization The teton system        was used to test whether simply increasing or decreasing         Pgm expression would be sufficient to        alter lifespan A Pelement transformation vector called        USC was generated which had unique         Eco RI and         Pst I sites downstream of the teton        doxycyclineregulated promoter Figure a USC also        contains the mini         white transformation marker gene        The         Pgm ScDNA sequences were cloned into        USC to create the PGMsense construct Figure b which        should allow overexpression of the PGM Senzyme A fragment        of         Pgm Scoding region of approximately         kilobase kb from  to  was cloned into USC        in an invertedrepeat orientation to create construct        PGMinvrpt Figure c which should potentially cause        conditional RNAi For each PGM construct five independent        transgenic lines were generated using standard methods As        a control two trangenic lines were generated containing        the USC vector in which no transgene is expressed        Expression of the transgenic constructs and the        endogenous         Pgm gene was assayed by northern        blot with or without DOX Figure a The         Pgm invertedrepeat sequences were        used as probes and should hybridize to both transgenes and        the endogenous         Pgm transcript In the        senseconstruct lines feeding DOX resulted in efficient        expression of the transgene at levels five to tenfold        greater than the endogenous transcript DOXinduced        expression of the invertedrepeat construct had two effects        detected by northern blot First DOX produced a smear of        hybridization resulting from the invertedrepeat transcript        Figure a The smear pattern may have resulted from        incomplete denaturation of the hairpin structure andor        instability of the invertedrepeat transcript Second the        level of the endogenous         Pgm transcript was found to be        reduced by DOX feeding        The northern blots were also hybridized with a         Pgm specific probe corresponding to         Pgm codingregion sequences  to         located outside the region used to create the        inverted repeat This probe is therefore specific for the        endogenous         Pgm transcript Using this probe the        smear of hybridization derived from the invertedrepeat        construct was no longer detected and the endogenous         Pgm RNA levels were more readily        observed and quantitated Figure b DOX induced        expression of the invertedrepeat construct was found to        cause a reduction of endogenous         Pgm RNA levels The decrease varied        across the five transgenic lines with reductions ranging        from  to fold The invertedrepeat construct        therefore appears to function as expected to induce RNAi        and cause decreased expression of the endogenous         Pgm gene In the control strains        where no transgene is expressed DOX administration was        found to have no effect on         Pgm transcript levels Figure        c        The indirect PGM activity assay was used to assay for        changes in         Pgm gene expression at the protein        level The sense construct yielded conditional        overexpression of PGM activity in each transgenic line        with increases ranging from two to fivefold Table         Potential reductions in PGM activity were more difficult to        assay because of the inherent limitations of the assay The        PGM activity assay is indirect and is coupled to the        conversion of NADP to NADPH The extract will contain        other activities capable of converting NADP to NADPH        thereby creating a significant background activity        Decreases in PGM activity could not be reliably measured        because of this unavoidable background The PGMinvrpt        construct yielded decreases in PGM activity of as much as         however the effect was quite variable from experiment        to experiment Table  In the control strains where no        transgene is expressed DOX administration was found to        have no consistent effect on PGM levels Table         To determine whether altered         Pgm gene expression could affect        lifespan mean lifespan was assayed in multiple PGMsense        and PGMinvrpt transgenic lines with or without DOX        treatment The percentage change in mean lifespan caused by        DOX and transgene expression is presented for each line        Lifespan was observed to vary across transgenic lines and        replicate experiments with changes ranging from  to         with one outlier at  Table  However no change in        lifespan was observed that was consistent across the sense        or invertedrepeat lines or in multiple experiments The        lifespan assays were repeated at C and again no        consistent changes were observed Table  We conclude        that under these conditions altered         Pgm expression does not have a        detectable effect on adult         Drosophila lifespan                    Discussion        The phenomenon of RNAi or PTGS is of great interest        for two reasons      First it represents an        evolutionarily conserved pathway that probably has        important functions in the regulation of gene expression        and the control of transposable elements Second it        provides a means for researchers to test gene functions by        experimentally downregulating expression of specific genes        under well controlled conditions In         Drosophila RNAi can be initiated by        injection of dsRNA into embryos and this has allowed        identification of novel phenotypes for genes during        development   However injection has limited potential        application in the adult as it is unlikely that the RNAi        could be targeted to all tissues or to specific tissues        and the trauma of injection is likely to have negative        effects on phenotypes such as lifespan Transgenic        constructs have been used to cause RNAi in         Drosophila by using various        promoters to drive expression of invertedrepeat fragments        of gene coding regions    Using the conditional        teton promoter system to drive expression of an        invertedrepeat provided conditional RNAi of the         Pgm gene This conditional system        should have many applications both in the study of the        RNAi pathway itself and in the design of experiments where        RNAi is used a research tool Conditional RNAi should be        particularly useful to study phenotypes in the adult such        as aging and lifespan Conditional geneexpression systems        have previously been used to identify positive regulators        of lifespan such as         CuZnSOD and         dGMII    In addition        mutations have been used to identify several genes in         Drosophila that act as negative        regulators of lifespan such as         mth INDY InR and         chico      For         mth and         InR the null phenotype of the genes        is lethality Therefore it is only rare hypomorphic alleles        or allele combinations that allow the animals to survive to        adult stage where increased lifespan can be observed        Conditional RNAi should provide a powerful means to study        these genes and other negative regulators of aging and        lifespan Inactivation or downregulation of the genes        specifically in the adult using teton RNAi may allow        increased lifespan without confounding effects on        development Lam and Thummel have recently reported the use        of a heatshock gene promoter to drive expression of dsRNA        and the efficient conditional inhibition of gene expression        during larval and pupal stages of         Drosophila development          Genetic selection of         Drosophila populations for latelife        reproduction caused the correlated phenotype of increased        lifespan and increased the frequency of the slow        electrophoretic allele         Pgm S of the         Pgm gene If         Pgm Scontributes to the increased        lifespan phenotype of the selected strains it might be        because         Pgm Shas increased activity        decreased activity or activity that is altered in some way        such as through its regulation or subcellular localization        The         Pgm alleles were cloned and sequenced        and were found to differ by aminoacid substitutions        consistent with the relative electrophoretic mobilities of        the encoded enzymes        A recent study reported the sequencing of several fast        medium and slow electrophoretic alleles of         Pgm from a wild population of         D melanogaster   The sequences        reported in that study Verrelli alleles are comparable to        those reported here Ives alleles as follows the medium        Verrelli allele used for alignment is identical in        aminoacid sequence to the Ives medium allele The Verrelli        fast alleles are identical to the Ives fast allele in each        of the three aminoacid positions at which the Ives fast        differs from the Ives medium wildtype allele There are        a number of differences between the Verrelli slow alleles        and the Ives slow allele The Verrelli slow alleles are not        all identical to each other The Ives slow allele differs        from the Ives medium wildtype aminoacid sequence at two        positions aminoacid positions  E  G and  A  T        The aminoacid change in the Ives slow allele at position         E  G is not reflected in any of the Verrelli slow        alleles The second aminoacid change in the Ives slow        allele at position  is shared by two of the Verrelli        slow alleles In addition the Verrelli slow alleles have        ammoacid substitutions that are not shared by the Ives        slow allele The data are consistent with the conclusion        that         Pgm is highly polymorphic and subject        to selection in natural populations    Consistent        with this idea         Pgm haplotypes and glycogen content        have been found to vary among flies at different latitudes                 The teton promoter system allowed a test of the        hypothesis that increasing or decreasing         Pgm gene expression would affect        lifespan PGM enzyme levels were increased two to        fivefold using a sense transgenic construct and         Pgm RNA levels were decreased  to        fold by driving expression of an invertedrepeat        construct No changes in lifespan were detected that were        consistent across multiple transgenic lines or replicate        experiments The results indicate that simply increasing or        decreasing         Pgm gene expression does not        significantly affect the lifespan of adult         Drosophila at least under the        conditions tested        The         Pgm Sallele used in these experiments        was cloned from the Ives strain which is the progenitor of        the longlived selected strains and their controls The        high degree of polymorphism of         Pgm makes it possible that the slow        electrophoretic allele in the Ives strain could consist of        multiple DNA sequence forms The failure to observe effects        on lifespan could therefore conceivably have resulted from        overexpression of the wrong DNA sequence form of         Pgm S However         Pgm Swas cloned and sequenced from        four independent lines derived from the Ives strain and the        clones had the same DNA sequence The data therefore        suggest that most if not all of the         Pgm Salleles in these strains have        the same sequence making sequence heterogeneity an        unlikely explanation of the present results        The results suggest several possibilities for the        relationship of         Pgm allele frequency to the increased        lifespan of the selected strains The first is that         Pgm Smight in fact contribute to the        increased lifespan of the selected strains as a result of        an increased or decreased activity but that the effect on        lifespan is too small to be detected in these assays The        lifespan assay appears to have a variability with control        strains of approximately  to  as seen in the data        presented here and elsewhere GL D Bhole and JT        unpublished results It is therefore unlikely that an        effect much smaller than  could be identified The        second possibility is that         Pgm allele frequencies are altered        because of selection for an unknown linked gene and this        possibility cannot be ruled out at this time The        experiments presented here suggest that teton regulated        overexpression and RNAi of genes near         Pgm may be a promising approach        Third an interesting model is that         Pgm Scontributes to increased        lifespan of the selected strains because of an alteration        in its regulation andor subcellular localization The        sequence analysis of the         Pgm alleles reveals a novel potential        site in         Pgm Sfor phosphorylation by PKC        however the potential significance of this change is        unknown The         Pgm Sallele was used for the        overexpression experiments presented here and presumably        the overexpressed enzyme should be subject to any        regulation or localization characteristic of         Pgm S However the         Pgm Senzyme was overexpressed in a        wildtype         Pgm Mbackground and it may be that        any phenotypic consequences of         Pgm Sallele function are not apparent        when         Pgm Mis also present Finally        another possible explanation for the absence of an effect        on longevity is the method of assay The selected O stocks        were handled and assayed with males and females together        repeatedly mating during adult life The present assay used        segregated sexes which is a different environment This        was done because the segregatedsexes assay is sensitive to        even small changes in lifespan and has been used        successfully in the past to detect the effects of other        genes on lifespan It is possible that an effect of PGM on        lifespan might be identified with different lifespan assay        conditions However even if this explanation were to be        true the data still indicate that PGM does not have a        simple strong effect on longevity Further experiments will        be required to distinguish between these interesting        possibilities for the link between         Pgm allele frequency and        lifespan                    Materials and methods                  Drosophilastocks and culture          All transgenic           Drosophila stocks were generated by          Pelement germline transformation   using a modified          microinjection technique   Transgenic lines are          named as the construct followed by the chromosome of          insertion in parentheses followed by a unique line          designation For example PGMinvrpt is PGMinvrpt          construct inserted on chromosome  independent          transgenic line  Cytological sites of insertion were          not determined Multiple strains homozygous for each of          the           Pgm F           Pgm Mand           Pgm Salleles were generated by          purifying third chromosomes from the Ives stock which is          the precursor to the O and B selection stocks            Homozygosity for a particular           Pgm allele was confirmed by          starchgel electrophoresis assay as previously described            and data not shown Other           Drosophila strains are as described            All stocks were grown on standard cornmealagar          medium   and were cultured at C                          Lifespan assays          Strains homozygous for the transgenic constructs were          crossed to rtTAE strain homozygous for the rtTA          transactivator construct to generate progeny          heterozygous for both constructs   Control flies were          rtTAE that is lacking a target construct To          obtain adult flies of defined age the crosses were          cultured at C in urine specimen bottles Before          eclosion of the majority of pupae bottles were cleared          of adults and newly eclosed flies were allowed to emerge          over the next  h Most of the males will have mated          during this time The males only were then removed and          were designated one day old and were maintained at C          at  per vial in culture vials with food and passaged          to new vials every  h For certain experiments the          adult males were maintained at C as indicated For          certain experiments female flies were used as          indicated Those flies being fed DOX were kept on food          vials supplemented with  gml DOX                          DNA sequencing          All DNA sequencing reactions were done using the          dideoxy chaintermination protocol and T Sequenase v          Amersham Multiple clones were sequenced for each of          the           Pgm F           Pgm Mand           Pgm Salleles The clones were          obtained by polymerase chain reaction PCR amplification          of each allele using genomic DNA template isolated from          strains homozygous for each allele The primers used in          each amplification are as follows The primer locations          were assigned on the basis of their relative distance          from the A in the ATG start codon which was defined as          position                     Pgm end  to           AGCCAGCAGCCGGAAAACTCCAGT           Pgm end  to           GGATGGGTTGGTAATCTCAGTG Each PCR product was          gelpurified and cloned into the           Eco RV site of pBluescript KS          Stratagene Predicted protein motifs were identified          using Prosite software                            Phosphogluconate mutase enzyme activity          assays          The activity assay was carried out essentially as          described   Briefly ten male flies were          anesthetized with CO            and placed in  l icecold  M          Tris buffer solution pH  The flies were homogenized          using a motorized mortar and pestle An additional  l          Tris buffer was added for a total volume of  l The          sample was centrifuged for  min at            g at C Approximately  l          supernatant was removed taking care to avoid a top layer          of oil and debris For the assay  l of this          supernatant was used in a  ml assay mixture that          contained  mM MgCl              mM histidine solution pH            M glucosediphosphate  Uml          glucosephosphate dehydrogenase and  mM NADP This          solution was mixed at room temperature and then  mM          glucose phosphate was added The solution was mixed          again and placed in a spectrophotometer To insure that          readings were being taken in the linear range of the          enzyme activity standard curves were generated with          respect to both time and amount of protein added          Readings were taken at           t   min at OD            and were expressed as ODgmin          Protein concentrations were determined using the BioRad          protein concentration solution using BSA as standard All          extracts were assayed in triplicate and the averages and          standard deviations are presented Means were compared          using unpaired twoside           t tests and           p values are presented The enzyme          assay measures the conversion of NADP to NADPH rather          than a direct measure of phosphoglucomutase itself In          other words it is measuring a secondary coupled          reaction                          DNA constructs          All inserts for microinjection were cloned into a          derivative of the T construct   called USC          USC was generated as follows First T was digested          with           Eco RI thus liberating the Hsp          polyadenylation signal sequence The construct was then          religated and transformed Next the           Pst I site in polylinker  was          destroyed by partial           Pst I digestion followed by T DNA          polymerase fillin and ligation Clones were screened for          destruction of the correct           Pst I site to generate USC          Figure a All inserts were cloned into the unique           Pst I to           Eco RI sites of USC          The           Pgm sense construct was made as          follows The reverse transcription was carried out on          total RNA isolated from a strain of flies homozygous for          the           Pgm Sallele using the following          primer dTB           I B           O           TAACCCGGGTCTACAAAGTGATACTGCGTAACTGACTATATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT          A nested PCR strategy was then used to amplify the           Pgm ScDNA using the following          primers First primer set B           I  TAACCCGGGTCTACAAAGTG           Pgm end  to           AGCCAGCAGCCGGAAAACTCCAGT Second nested primer          set B           O  ATACTGCGTAACTGACTATA B           to  CTGGAAGCTCGGGAG The resulting          PCR product was cloned into the           Eco RV site of pBluescript KS and          clones were screened for the correct orientation The           Pgm ScDNA was then liberated by           Eco RI complete digest followed by           Pst I partial digest and cloned          into the           Eco RI to           Pst I sites of USC to generate          construct PGMsense Figure b          The PGMinvrpt construct was made as follows because          the final insert would be a large inverted repeat           Pgm Swas PCRamplified in two          pieces in opposite orientations The two sets of primers          used for the amplifications were First set           Pgm sense   to           AGCTGAATTCCACAAACTTTAATAAATCCGAAAC           Pgm anti Not  to          AGCTGCGGCCGCCCTGAACCGGTTGGGTGCCAC Second          set           Pgm anti Not  to

site of pBluescript KS and          then restriction digested with           Eco RI and           Not I firstset fragment or           Not I and           Pst I secondset fragment Each          of the liberated fragments was gel purified and          tripleligated into the           Pst I to           Eco RI sites of USC to generate          construct PGMinvrpt Figure c                          Northern analyses          RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent Gibco BRL and          the amount of RNA was quantitated by UV          spectrophotometry Approximately  g RNA per lane was          resolved on a  agarose gel RNA markers Gibco BRL          were used to determine the sizes of bands After          blotting the RNA was fixed to Genescreen nylon membrane          Dupont using a UV crosslinker Stratagene Probes were          Plabeled using the PrimeIt II kit Stratagene To          determine fold increasesdecreases northern blots were          exposed onto a phosphor screen and
