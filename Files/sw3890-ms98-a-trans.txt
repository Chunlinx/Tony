                as Texas El Paso uh they were undefeated until uh Thursday night when they played the University of Utah here in Salt Lake City and uh   oh really hum   they were beaten by uh a last minute three point shot   oh my gosh   and uh so it kind of opened things up a little bit they play uh Brigham Young University tonight   uhhuh   and uh i im pretty sure uh they really got a good team this year and i think   do do they do they traditionally have a good team or is this sort of an unusually thing   uh yes they do uh they usually uh theyre usually the one or two in the in the WAC conference and theyre the only team from Texas   huh huh huh yeah see were its theyre actually in the University of Texas system and i dont i dont even know anything about them im here in Austin we have uh University UT Austin     uhhuh   right which is  which i mean i just generally go to the University of Texas right the the Longhorns um   uhhuh   and uh   yeah whos doing the whos leading the conference   actually actually i dont know right now Longhorns arent having quite the year that they had hoped um they they had a a star forward that that was disqualified because of   uh i see oh   of something i guess as he was leaving his junior college they uh some supporter gave him a car or something and uh   oh  oh i see that kind of fouled things up plus maybe   yeah it sure did because they were they had a real good start and then and then and then ended up you know they theyre theyre holding on but its not its not gonna be a  a season like they had last year when they went to the NCAA   umhum right well last year the University of Utah went and uh they had two of their stars uh   uhhuh   got hurt the beginning of the season this year and thats why uh uh Texas El Paso is uh is in the University of Utah went to the NC Double As last year and they got into the final sixteen i guess but   umhum yeah   uh UTEP like i say is doing real well and its its too bad that they have something like that did they restrict the uh the Longhorns as far as uh being able to play in any of the   no it it it something had happened outside of that you know and and it happened as as part of his junior college career   junior college so it didnt affect their program other than loosing him yeah right thats too bad   but no but they pulled him out of the out of the lineup you know and it was something he he reported himself or i mean they  it wasnt a and and the NCAA uh immediately suspended him and then and then actually UT on his behalf filed a an injunction in the court system to allow him to continue to play which worked for a few games and then they then they pulled him in so   yeah but oh thats too bad   yeah but theyve been having uh i mean last last last year they had a real good team they had every they had a new coach Tom Penders come in um about i guess about three years ago   umhum   and and the the program had been in a long a long decline you know for for years they i guess back when Abe Lemons was here they built quite a quite a tradition   i see umhum   and then it it kind of went downhill for about for a couple of coaches and Penders has done a good job of getting it back on its feet and doing some you know playing some good basketball but   good i know uh i was in Montana this last week and i saw the uh huh the womens team from uh Texas was playing uh Penn State   yeah uhhuh   and uh Penn State was ranked number eight i believe in the womens basketball and i i got to watch the half and then i had to leave on a flight uh back to Utah and i uh Texas was leading   umhum hum   i dont know how they came out i dont know if you heard or not but uh   i dont know yeah uh the womens program is quite interesting down here the the womens program here in in Austin um actually for a while it was was drawing bigger crowds than the mens program if you could imagine that they but they you know they just have have traditionally been a dominant a dominant basketball team i mean theyve theyve always been in the top   oh yeah   top eight in the country um and actually had a couple of years that they havent been quite as strong but but uh   umhum   the the Southwestern Conference uh theyve been undefeated in the Southwestern they were no they arent now but they had been undefeated in the Southwestern Conference for something like a five year streak or something   i wish them well   and had won the conference title for ten years in a row or something   thats great   and so that is theyve theyve thats thats quite a tradition here in in Texas but   ill say yeah uh thats uh last year the University of Utah that was the best season theyd had and uh the well the the coach had come in this Rick Majerus hed come in uh hed only been there a couple years and uh   umhum oh yeah umhum   really built the program and they were supposed to well they were rated up in the the first uh uh top ten this year until they lost their two of their their star players and uh through injuries   uhhuh right   and now they are uh they they did beat uh Texas El Paso and uh  that was kind of strange i guess Texas El Paso was just werent werent uh   up to speed yeah   hitting and uh
