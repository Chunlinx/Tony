                    Background        Renal transplant recipients are at high risk for        posttransplant diabetes mellitus However information on        the incidence and risk factors for diabetic ketoacidosis        diabetic ketoacidosis after solid organ transplantation        has been limited to singlecenter reports              There are even fewer reports on hyperglycemic hyperosmolar        syndrome hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome previously        called nonketotic hyperosomolar coma after renal        transplantation     Recently posttransplant diabetes        mellitus has been associated with tacrolimus use in renal        transplant recipients with hepatitis C antibody positivity           although this experience is not universal    Only        one report of diabetic ketoacidosis associated with        tacrolimus use in a patient without a prior history of        diabetes has so far been reported    Tacrolimus was        approved by the FDA for use in kidney transplantation in         We therefore performed a historical cohort study of        the United States Renal Data System USRDS Renal        transplant population Our objectives were to determine the        incidence risk factors and mortality associated with        hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis primary        hospitalization discharge ICD code x and        hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome ICD code x        occurring after renal transplantation                    Methods                  Patient Population          This study used data from the United States Renal Data          System USRDS using standard analysis files SAFs as          of May  The USRDS indirectly mandated by federal          law incorporates baseline and followup demographic and          clinical data on all patients receiving end stage renal          disease ESRD therapy in the United States ESRD therapy          includes hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis and renal          transplantation Because patient entry into the USRDS is          linked to Medicare reimbursement and ESRD services are          expensive very few transplant patients are not          represented in the database The variables included in          the USRDS standard analysis files SAF as well as data          collection methods and validation studies are listed at          the USRDS website under Researchers Guide to the USRDS          Database Section E Contents of all the SAFs          httpwwwusrdsorgand published in the USRDS The          demographics of the renal transplant population have been          previously described  USRDS report SAFTXUNOS was          used as the primary dataset and merged with variables          from SAFHOSP for hospitalization data and SAFPATIENTS          for dates and causes of death as well as causes of renal          disease as previously reported      Patient          characteristics and treatment factors were those at the          date of transplant Recipients of organs other than          kidneys were excluded                          Outcome Definition          We conducted a historical cohort study of the          incidence risk factors and associated patient survival          for hospitalized cases of diabetic ketoacidosis based on          International Classification of Diseasesth Modification          Diagnosis Codes ICD at hospital discharge for diabetic          ketoacidosis x and hyperosmotic hyperosmolar          syndrome also known as nonketotic hyperosmolar coma          ICD code x as a primary discharge diagnosis in          renal transplant recipients The first hospitalization          for diabetic ketoacidosis after the first solitary renal          transplant thus excluding kidneypancreas or other          multiple transplants for a given individual occurring on          or after  July  and before  July  which          included repeat transplants with followup time          truncated at three years was counted in analysis          Hospitalizations were chosen because they were more          accessible in the database and less subject to          interpretation than outpatient cases of diabetic          ketoacidosis especially since the USRDS database has no          information on confirmatory studies Hospitalization data          for transplant recipients may be unreliable after the          patient has survived   years post transplant when          hospitalization reporting to Medicare for patients           years or younger is no longer required However Medicare          reporting starts immediately after transplant regardless          of preceding dialysis status All hospitalizations with a          primary discharge diagnosis for diabetic ketoacidosis          were extracted from SAFHOSP merged with the transplant          file using unique identifiers and hospitalizations          outside the range of the study period were excluded          Hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis occurring at          any time after renal transplant including after graft          failure censored for patient death were counted in          analysis                          Variables used in analysis          The independent associations between patient factors          and hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis were          examined using multivariate analysis with stepwise Cox          Regression including recipient and donor age recipient          race gender weight pretransplant dialysis yesno          duration of dialysis prior to transplantation total          followup time recipient hepatitis C serology donor          cytomegalovirus serology pretransplant dialysis          yesno rejection either treatment or diagnosis          occurring at any time in the study period induction          antibody therapy maintenance immunosuppressive          medications at time of discharge after transplant          surgery graft loss and cause of end stage renal disease          ESRD either diabetes or other causes The USRDS does          not reliably distinguish between type I and type II          diabetes Previous investigators have used the occurrence          of diabetes in patients younger than age  as a          surrogate for type I diabetes  However given the          growing frequency of type II diabetes in younger          patients  we did not think this assumption would be          valid in more recent years of the database We therefore          chose to group all patients with ESRD due to diabetes          together Diabetes as a comorbid condition at the time of          listing for transplant was also used as a variable          although information on this variable was missing or          unknown for  of patients Tables             Information on insulin dependence was missing for  of          patients however and was not considered reliable for          analysis Episodes of rejection were not restricted to          those occurring in the first year in contrast to studies          of allograft function since there is no evidence that          late vs early rejection has a different impact on          diabetic ketoacidosis However only episodes of diabetic          ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome          occurring after the approximate date of rejection were          used in assessing the association of rejection with          diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar          syndrome The total cumulative dose of prednisone was not          available in the USRDS UNOS tracks the numbers of days          of prednisone administered prior to initial hospital          discharge however values were missing for  of          patients in both databases and could not be used as a          covariate in the above analyses Maintenance          immunosuppressive medication use in particular          cyclosporine and tacrolimus at the time of discharge          after transplantation was also analyzed as a preexisting          covariate Information on use of medications other than          immunosuppressive medications alcohol tobacco or          radiologic procedures was not available Dialysis          modality was obtained from the file Sdiabetic          ketoacidosisRXHIST The initial dialysis modality a          patient used for at least  days after presentation to          end stage renal disease and prior to renal          transplantation was utilized in intention to treat          fashion                          Survival Times          For time to diabetic ketoacidosis survival time was          defined as the time from first renal transplant until          hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis with patients          censored at death loss to followup or end of the          study Since the most recent hospitalization date was           December  this was considered the end of the study          period for this measurement Survival time was defined as          the time from the date of transplant until the date of          death censored for loss to followup or the end of the          study The end of the study period was considered April           for this measurement The patient survival          probabilities were estimated by using the Life Tables and          Kaplan Meier method                          Statistical Analysis          All analyses were performed using SPSS  TM SPSS          Inc Chicago IL Files were merged and converted to          SPSS files using DBMSCopy Conceptual Software Houston          TX Univariate analysis was performed with Chisquare          testing for categorical variables Fishers exact test          was used for violations of Cochrans assumptions and          Students twosided ttest for continuous variables the          Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for variables without          a Gaussian distribution Linear regression analysis was          used to assess trends over time with adjusted residuals          inspected to verify the appropriateness of the regression          technique Variables with p   in univariate          analysis for a relationship with development of          hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis were entered          into multivariate analysis as covariates KaplanMeier          analysis was used to construct survival plots of time to          hospitalized diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic          hyperosmolar syndrome after renal transplantation          Loglog plots were inspected to assess for          proportionality of hazards over time at the mean of each          significant covariate Because the majority of patients          were censored did not experience the primary outcome          during the study period stepwise Cox Regression          likelihood ratio method was used to model factors          associated with time to hospitalized diabetic          ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome          controlling for covariates listed above For all risk          factor analysis reported in the present study only the          first hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis or          hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome respectively          occurring during the study period was analyzed one          hospitalization per patient The association of          hospitalized diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic          hyperosmolar syndrome was assessed using Cox          nonproportional hazards regression with times after          hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis coded as  and          all other times as  as previously reported             Tacrolimus was introduced into clinical practice more          recently than cyclosporine This could have resulted in          bias due to the shorter potential followup for patients          taking cyclosporine leading to unequal counting of more          recent hospitalizations for diabetic ketoacidosis in          patients who used tacrolimus In addition since the rate          of diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar          syndrome may have changed in more recent years of the          study temporal bias could have arisen despite adjustment          for year of transplant Therefore additional analysis          was performed limited to patients who were transplanted          on or after  January                             Results        There were  solitary renal transplant recipients        in the United States Renal Data System transplanted from         July  to  June  of whom  had data complete        enough to calculate survival times The most recent        hospitalization date was December   The most recent        date of death was April  Mean followup was           years median  years Of these  recipients        were hospitalized with a primary discharge diagnosis of        diabetic ketoacidosis with  total hospitalizations         recipients were hospitalized with a primary discharge        diagnosis of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome with         total hospitalizations The most common secondary discharge        diagnosis for both diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic        hyperosmolar syndrome was kidney replaced by transplant        and secondary diagnoses did not reveal a preponderance of        conditions suggesting an underlying condition leading to        hospitalization Rates of diabetic ketoacidosis by history        of diabetes at the time of listing are shown in Table         Characteristics of the study population as well as risk        factors for diabetic ketoacidosis for the entire cohort and        for recipients without a history of diabetes at the time of        listing are shown in Table  As previously reported the        use of tacrolimus rose steadily during the study period        accounting for  of all calcineurin inhibitor use in          in   in   in  and         in  The threeyear incidence of de novo diabetic        ketoacidosis was  in patients using tacrolimus vs         in patients using cyclosporine However there were        noteworthy temporal trends during the time of the study        although none were statistically significant As shown in        Figure  there was an increase in the rate of both all        cases of diabetic ketoacidosis and de novo diabetic        ketoacidosis during the years of the study However an        opposite trend was seen in de novo diabetic ketoacidosis in        tacrolimus users Figure  As shown the rate of de novo        diabetic ketoacidosis decreased sharply among tacrolimus        users while the rate of total diabetic ketoacidosis did        not change Similar data for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar        syndrome are shown in figures   In contrast there were        no clear trends over time although rates for the year         appeared disproportionately high        The mean age of patients hospitalized for diabetic

positively        associated with total rates of hospitalized diabetic        ketoacidosis were younger age graft loss African American        race more recent year of transplant lower body mass        index and female gender There were no significant        interactions between race gender hepatitis C status or        tacrolimus use For de novo diabetic ketoacidosis gender        and graft loss were not significant and cadaver donor was        significant Recipients who used maintenance tacrolimus        adjusted hazard ratio   confidence interval         p   had a higher risk of de novo

   hazard ratio for tacrolimus   confidence interval         p   However the pattern of risk over        time violated the proportional hazards assumption since        there was a substantially greater risk of de novo diabetic        ketoacidosis among tacrolimus users starting at two years        after transplant coinciding with the introduction of        tacrolimus into clinical practice Therefore analysis was        also performed limited to patients transplanted on or after         July  limited to two years of followup In this        analysis tacrolimus was not significantly

significance of        recipient hepatitis C positive serology and the lack of        significance of female gender Table  There was no        significant interaction between recipient hepatitis C        serology and tacrolimus use There was no association        between hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome and BMI either        as a continuous or as a categorical variable No        independent risk factors for de novo hyperglycemic        hyperosmolar syndrome were identified and are therefore        not presented in tabular form        Inhospital mortality was  for patients with        diabetic ketoacidosis and  for patients with        hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome Mortality after        diabetic ketoacidosis is shown in Figure  The risk of        mortality after hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis        was fairly constant over time Hospitalized diabetic        ketoacidosis was independently associated with increased        mortality in Cox nonproportional hazards

ketoacidosis the risk of mortality after hyperglycemic        hyperosmolar syndrome was constant over time Figure         Hospitalization for hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome was

     cardiac arrest of unknown cause  and sepsis                            Discussion        The present study showed that renal transplant        recipients had a rate of diabetic ketoacidosis of         person years in recipients a history of diabetes as a        comorbid condition and  person years in patients        without a prior history of diabetes measured as total        hospitalizations for comparison with other reports In        contrast the estimated annual incidence of diabetic        ketoacidosis in the general population was  episodes        per  diabetic subjects    In the general        population the rate of diabetic ketoacidosis episodes as a        primary hospitalization diagnosis was  patients        and the rate of hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome        episodes was  in  rates stratified for        patients with diabetes were not available    Although        statistical comparison could not be performed due to the        much higher rate of diabetes among renal transplant        recipients than in the general population the rates of        diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar        syndrome in renal transplant recipients appear to be        substantially higher than for either diabetic patients or        for the general population after excluding patients with        combined kidneypancreas transplants        Certain risk factors were common to both the total risk        of diabetic ketoacidosis and the risk of de novo diabetic        ketoacidosis diabetic ketoacidosis occurring in patients        without a prior known history of diabetes Consistent with        the general population African Americans were at higher        risk of diabetic ketoacidosis than nonAfrican Americans        Hispanic race was only introduced into the database        recently       The higher risk of African        Americans was independent of other factors in the database        such as body mass index graft loss rejection episodes or        employment status Despite adjustment for these factors        socioeconomic factors could certainly not be excluded and        have been implicated in prior studies Similarly low body        mass index was associated with diabetic ketoacidosis in        either situation in contrast to the association of high        body mass with the increased risk of type II diabetes           However differences in gender and graft loss were not        associated with de novo diabetic ketoacidosis Each of        these may reflect risk factors for diabetes in the general        population Conversely donor type and use of maintenance        tacrolimus were only associated with de novo diabetic        ketoacidosis The increased risk of cadaver donor type        could be related to medication use The relatively high        rate of de novo diabetic ketoacidosis diabetic        ketoacidosis occurring in patients who did not have a known        diagnosis of diabetes at the time of transplant could        represent drugassociated diabetic ketoacidosis which has        infrequently been reported with the use of both tacrolimus        and cyclosporine    Previous case series did not have        sufficient sample size to determine competing risks between        calcineurin inhibitors but the present study would suggest        the risk is greater with tacrolimus Because of rapid        changes in the use of tacrolimus during the study period        as indicated above conclusions should be limited We would        certainly caution any interpretation of tacrolimus use        since there were substantial temporal trends during the        study and tacrolimus was not approved by the FDA for use        in kidney transplantation until  As indicated in our        analysis limited to that time span tacrolimus was not        significantly associated with increased risk of diabetic        ketoacidosis        Almost all reports of posttransplant diabetes mellitus        in the medical literature have either concerned type II        diabetes or have not specified by type Therefore reported        risk factors such as obesity cumulative prednisone use        and hepatitis C status would not be expected to affect the        risk of diabetic ketoacidosis consistent with reports in        the general population This is in contrast to        hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome which would be        expected to occur disproportionately in patients with type        II diabetes While older age and higher BMI were        significant in univariate analysis they were not        significant in multivariate analysis while the        significance of positive recipient hepatitis C serology        persisted Use of diabetes as an aggregate outcome        combining either both type I and type II diabetes or        combining diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic        hyperosmolar syndrome might obscure the relationship with        certain risk factors if the associations were in different        directions as is the case with body mass index for        example low body mass index being associated with type I        diabetes and high body mass being associated with type II        diabetes Use of such aggregate outcomes might also have        missed an association between hyperglycemic hyperosmolar        syndrome and hepatitis C The present study thus provides        more indirect evidence that the posttransplant diabetes        associated with hepatitis C infection is predominantly type        II diabetes as suggested in other reports     This        is in contrast to a lack of association between hepatitis C        seropositivity and diabetes as a cause of renal failure as        we have previously reported           Nevertheless the increasing rate of diabetic        ketoacidosis noted during the study period Figure  more        marked for total diabetic ketoacidosis than de novo        diabetic ketoacidosis is in contrast to the decreasing        rate of de novo diabetic ketoacidosis and stable rate of        total diabetic ketoacidosis noted for users of tacrolimus        Figure  While this information is necessarily        preliminary it suggests the possibility that factors other        than tacrolimus use may be responsible for the increasing        rate of diabetic ketoacidosis noted during the study which        was independent of all other factors assessed We did not        find an association between diabetic ketoacidosis and viral        infections other than hepatitis C notably cytomegalovirus        nor did we find an association between diabetic        ketoacidosis and antibody induction therapy which would be        expected to decrease immunity but might also allow for a        greater propensity to viral infections We can only point        to another recent report by Bhalla et al    which        found that de novo posttransplant diabetes mellitus        confirmed by renal biopsy was much more common and much        more rapid in onset than previously suspected and could        not be explained by usual clinical predictors which is        quite similar to our findings The authors implicated        novel mechanisms as the reason for this rapid increase        Whether this represents a relationship with newly        appreciated viral infections such as polyomavirus or        other factors is presently unknown        Both diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic        hyperosmolar syndrome were associated with an increased        risk of mortality among renal transplant recipients        consistent with reports in the general population            If anything the relative risk associated with diabetic        ketoacidosis was greater than that for hyperglycemic        hyperosmolar syndrome somewhat in contrast to the general        population However previous population based reports have        not adjusted for the difference in age of presentation for        this differing conditions Given the limitations of the        database causes of death were primarily cardiovascular and        not infectious also consistent with the general        population           There are several limitations to this retrospective        study Findings are associative not causative and risk        cannot be assigned without the ability to control for other        variables prospectively during the course of the study We        could not assess the causes for hospitalization for        diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperglycemic hyperosmolar        syndrome or how they were treated including the use of        insulin This study could not independently verify the type        of diabetes We could not assess certain important risk        factors such as nutritional status the use of alcohol or        infection with hospitalized diabetic ketoacidosis or        hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome However ICD coding        for determining rates of medical conditions has been used        in other published studies    as well as the National        Center for Health Statistics httpwwwcdcgovnchsThe        current studys limitation to hospitalized cases of        diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar        syndrome would tend to underestimate the frequency of these        conditions in this population However these conditions        are almost universally managed by hospitalization in the        United States Another limitation of the study is the        inability to track whether the patients were subsequently        switched from tacrolimus or cyclosporine during the course        of the present study However reports of conversion from        cyclosporine to tacrolimus     which are most        commonly employed as a rescue agent for refractory acute or        chronic rejection or cyclosporine toxicity suggest that        this number is very small Similarly conversion from        tacrolimus to cyclosporine most commonly due to tacrolimus        induced diabetes by published report appears to be even        rarer    The short followup duration of the study may        also be a limitation Strengths of the present analysis        include its large size and populationbased character and        relatively complete capture and followup        In conclusion rates of diabetic ketoacidosis and        hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome after renal        transplantation were substantially higher than reported for        the general population whether in diabetic or nondiabetic        populations These rates appear to be increasing        significantly over time particularly for diabetic        ketoacidosis even as the risk for diabetic ketoacidosis in        patients treated with tacrolimus is decreasing        significantly In addition we identified highrisk groups        for diabetic ketoacidosis de novo diabetic ketoacidosis        and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome after renal        transplantation and confirmed the association of both        diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar        syndrome with increased mortality after renal        transplantation
