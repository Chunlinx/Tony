                                 From Disco to HipHop                        Dear Chris            Hmm  Feedbag for Morons Isnt that a Dead Kennedys album I dont knowmaybe the great big arenarocking songs are massesopiating tools of socialcontrol but I really cant believe that everything in the popmarketplace is just numbly imbibed by a passive audience Also isnt pinningtodays celebrity culture on rock letting the tabloids glossies talk showsHollywood etc etc off a bit easy Maybe Elvis was the first modernsuperstarriding the emergent nexus of TV film and records to a new level ofglobal acclaimbut I hardly blame American Bandstand for OJ andPrincess Di            As someone who routinely got his head pounded into school lockers by LedZeppelin fans Im pretty aware of rocks role in fostering unthinkingconformism Still I think Millers somewhat overheated Dionysian riff doesmake an important point that even a music with the crassest commercial aimscan have liberating transformative effects in the world            At least on other musicians Had you heard Millers anecdote about Dylanmishearing the Beatles before I really liked that one where he thought theline I cant hide I cant hide was I get high I get high and concludedit was a song about dope Not exactly Das Kapital  I realize but thetale is suggestive of rocks power as charged volatile as they say opentext If Dylans ears werent caught up by the Beatles sound first henever would have imbued the song with such possibilitieswhich I have tobelieve were pretty subversive back in             Whether or not rock still has such possibilities depends I think on yourdefinitions of rock One thing that makes a popular music rock  as averb is its ability to take private but common feelings and put them into ashared public language This phenomenon gets more interesting as the culturesplinters and technology creates new languageswhich is one of my mainproblems with Millers critique As a critical theorist himself Miller mustknow how subjective his rock narrative is even the jumpcut structure suggestsit yet he still seems to present pop music as the product of the same sharedsingle history Id say that construct breaks down near the end of hisbook            While I dont mean to make too great a claim for disco I do think itrepresents a moment in which cultural forces that Miller doesnt account forrealigned in a way that changed rock The polarizing Disco Sucks movementrevealed a mass audience not just splintering but clashing along certaindemographic lines Meanwhile the musics sound and technology was providingthe sonic space and public rituals for hiphopas electrifying a pop form asIve ever heard Id say NWAs Fuck Tha Police was every bit the protest songthat The Times They Are AChanging was and way more fun Id also saysimilar if less broadly significant upheavals are happening in the worlds ofhouse techno and other electronic music even now Musics that emphasizerhythm and texture over melody and lyrics arent necessarily apolitical orcontentfree but they do tend to occur on narrower bandwidths            Some smart guyCocteau I thinksaid that style is a way of sayingcomplicated things simply No I dont think Smashmouth is saying anything toocomplicated But others well within pops debased commercialized yearoldlandscapeNas say or Beck or Pavement Radiohead PJ Harveyoften areNowadays you just have to work a little harder to hear it            Which Miller by his own admission stopped doing over a decade ago Thisraises a question weve both evaded Is this book really necessary Is Millersstyle or his point of view compelling enough to merit another goround on therockhistory tour bus            YoursChris            PS I dont think your sentiments are fogeyish or undiscriminating I musthowever give you kudos for being the first writer Ive ever seen limn BecksGodley Creme influence
