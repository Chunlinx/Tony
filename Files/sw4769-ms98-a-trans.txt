                okay what do you think about our politicians   oh my i i wish there was a way to to pick uh people who werent um       i i think politics you have to be real interested in power   yeah i do too uh of course   and and power corrupts   yeah youre right   so   i just uh i think all politicians are really a bunch of crooks  i shouldnt say that but i bet you that ninety five percent of them are theyre all just for themselves mostly   well i i do believe there are people that are truly concerned about um society and making a better a better world and go in it   umhum   for honest uh reasons and honest maybe wanting to improve improve the community or country or whatever   umhum umhum   but um to get elected you have to um sell your soul it seems like to   yeah really and then it seems like they bring out  all the dirt that they can bring out about a person you know stuff oh stuff that happened many years ago in their lives i think thats awful   uh it it its absolutely irrelevant uh the only thing people should be talking about are what are your ideas uh for   yeah   about education about health insurance about foreign affairs or whatever   right right   and none of this other stuff should and what are and how do you plan to implement uh programs   umhum umhum   um and you dont hear any of that   no right       all you hear is the bad things about them uh         but um itd be hard uh i dont know       what to say really about politicians like i say i just i just cant believe too many of them at all and i read you know about them and everything about different ideas they they all seem to have something wrong with them   well i really liked uh the meyer of San Francisco i used to live there and voted for him uh   oh the one that just got out of Agnus uhhuh umhum   yes Agnus and for example he had a really good plan for the homeless   umhum   which is a huge problem here   oh i know its  all over isnt it   and it just got some award a national sort of recognition as being uh a program that really looks at the roots of problems   umhum   but the problem was that it wasnt quickly implemented uh or that it wasnt the band aid   umhum umhum   so it didnt look good immediately immediately   umhum   it really if you go to to uh to solve root problems they take a while   umhum   and i think they public wants uh quick fixes   umhum   and they dont want thoughtful longterm planning and uh   umhum   so we we get disgusted if its not glitzy   yeah yeah he wasnt in office very long was he   four years   you know       oh oh well what did this uh marriage youve got now over there what did he what was he going to do that was different       one of his one of his ideas was to ship them all out to another city         i mean hes the police chief and was just going to you know round them all up and and and put them out on a farm or something     that sounds funny doesnt it         tell him to send him down here to Patterson         so what do you think about Oaklands mayor   oh dear i dont   i dont know and i dont know   i mean Oakland seems like they have an awful lot of problems there   oh God we certainly do   you know have you lived there long   uh i last three years three and a half years   uhhuh umhum umhum       yeah i know that that should i say have a lot of in fact more mortgage and every thing this year than they they did   oh its terrible uh its just   yeah           thats a whole other topic   umhum   uh but i think he has been trying to um you know curve some of the you know  address some of the problems   umhum umhum   um   yeah   and uh
