                    Background        Polymerization of ribonucleoside triphosphates NTPs        which is central to a variety of crucial biological        processes including transcription primer synthesis during        DNA replication addition of polyA tails to mRNA addition        of CCA to tRNA uridylation in RNA editing replication of        RNA viruses amplification of RNA in eukaryotic        posttranscriptional gene silencing PTGS and        oligoadenylate synthesis during interferon signaling is        catalyzed by a broad variety of distinct enzymes               These polymerases belong to two major mechanistic        categories those that copy a nucleic acid template and        those that are independent of a template The DNAdependent        RNA polymerases DDRPs involved in the transcription of        cellular and DNA viral genes primases and RNAdependent        RNA polymerases RDRPs of RNA viruses and cellular PTGS        systems are templatedependent polymerases        Templateindependent RNA polymerases        nucleotidyltransferases include CCAadding enzymes polyA        polymerases uridylyl transferases and oligoAsynthetases        Some of the RNA polymerases function as singlesubunit        proteins whereas others form large complexes that consist        of multiple distinct subunits however in all known        cases the basic catalytic activity maps to a single        polypeptide containing a characteristic metalchelating        active site       Typically active sites of        polymerases contain acidic or polar residues which        coordinate divalent metal cations most often Mg  The        metal cations direct a  nucleoside triphosphate to form a        phosphoester bond with the  hydroxyl of the preceding        nucleotide the terminal nucleotide of a growing        polynucleotide chain with the elimination of        pyrophosphate            Despite the basic biochemical similarity among all RNA        polymerases sequence and structure comparisons indicate        that these enzymes belong to at least five evolutionarily        unrelated folds The RDRPs of RNA viruses define one major        lineage of nucleic acid polymerases which additionally        includes reverse transcriptases archaeoeukaryotic DNA        polymerases and nucleotide cyclases                 The DNAdependent RNA polymerase of certain bacteriophages        such as T and the archaeoeukaryotic primase also        detected in some bacteria are divergent derivatives of the        same fold      The core catalytic domain of all        these enzymes the socalled palm domain has an        RNArecognition motif RRMlike fold with strategically        placed metalcoordinating residues which form the active        site       In contrast bacterial DnaGtype        primases also present in archaea and some eukaryotes        contain a polymerase domain of the Rossmannlike TOPRIM        fold which is shared with topoisomerases and OLDfamily        nucleases       The recently solved structures of        the DDRPs from yeast and the thermophilic bacterium Thermus        thermophilus indicate that the  subunit according to the        subunit nomenclature of Escherichia coli DDRP which we        hereinafter employ to designate all orthologs of the        respective E coli subunits of these enzymes defines        another distinct catalytic scaffold which is unrelated to        any of the above templatedependent RNA polymerases                Additionally the structural and evolutionary        affinities of two other templatedependent RNA polymerases        namely RDRPs involved in PTGS      and primases of        herpesviruses     remain obscure In contrast to the        templatedependent RNA polymerases which have several        distinct scaffolds of the catalytic domains all        templateindependent RNA polymerases have the same fold of        the principal catalytic domain and belong to the pol         superfamily of nucleotidyl transferases             Thus RNA polymerase activity apparently has been        independently invented on several occasions        Nevertheless DDRP is one of the most conserved enzymes        which is represented without exception in all cellular        life forms      The DDRP complex from most organisms        consists of  to  polypeptides Of these four subunits        which correspond to the bacterial    and  are        universally present in all cellular DDRPs and constitute        the conserved DDRP core     Orthologs of the  and         subunits are also encoded in the genomes of several        families of large eukaryotic DNA viruses              Biochemical studies have shown that the catalytic site of        DDRP resides in the  subunit and contains three invariant        aspartates that coordinate a Mg cation               Recent structural analyses demonstrated that the core of        DDRP is assembled around the  and  subunits which        interact with each other to form a positively charged        nucleicacidbinding cleft The  subunit further        stabilizes this cleft whereas the  subunit interacts with        the  subunit     Given their ubiquitous presence in        all cellular life forms and high level of sequence        conservation it seems evident that the core subunits of        this complex RNA synthesis machine were already present in        the last universal common ancestor LUCA of the extant        cellular life forms and performed functions mechanistically        similar to those of modern DDRP        In contrast to the ubiquitous DDRP cellular RDRPs that        are involved in PTGS so far have been detected only in        eukaryotes      The PTGS phenomenon covers a variety        of complementaritydependent silencing pathways such as        RNA interference RNAi in animals and slime mold        cosuppression silencing of transgene and the        corresponding endogenous genes and virus gene resistance        in plants and quelling in fungi all of which share a        common mechanism of RNA turnover                Essentially doublestranded ds RNA which is formed in        these processes triggers the activation of a        sequencespecific RNA degradation system which targets        homologous RNAs      The dsRNA is broken down by the        Dicer enzyme into  nucleotide nt fragments called        small interfering RNA or siRNAs       The siRNAs        subsequently associate with a complex of proteins called        RISC and target homologous RNA by serving as guides for        multiple rounds of RNA cleavage             The RDRP is a component of the PTGS system that has been        initially described in plants as a cellular RNA polymerase        activity induced upon viral infection that synthesized        antisense RNA in a primerdependent or independent manner                Subsequent genetic studies showed that        mutations in RDRP genes impaired PTGS in a variety of        systems        Experimental studies in         C elegans and in plants suggested        that the RDRP is involved in production and amplification        of dsRNA using the target RNA as template and siRNAs as        primers or guides and resulting in amplification of the RNA        silencing response               The RDRP is present in one or more copies in a wide        range of eukaryotes from earlybranching parabasalids        such as         Giardia  to multicellular forms        including fungi plants and animals      This broad        representation in eukaryotes including organisms that are        considered primitive suggests that RDRP might have been        encoded in the genome of the common ancestor of all modern        eukaryotes However this gene has been subsequently lost        in several eukaryotic lineages such as the yeast         Saccharomyces cerevisiae  insects        and vertebrates Although RDRPs display some diversity in        domain architecture and the level of sequence conservation        they form a tight wellconserved family of large proteins        with no detectable prokaryotic or viral homologs        Here we investigate the evolutionary history of RDRPs        and DDRPs in an attempt to unveil the origin of the RDRP        We identify the first homologs of the cellular RDRP outside        the eukaryotic clade in bacteriophages and show that        RDRPs and DDRPs share a homologous catalytic core which        comprises a sixstranded doublepsibarrel DPBB domain        Evidence is presented that the ultimate ancestor of RNA        polymerases might have been a RNAbinding DPBB domain        which functioned as a cofactor for a polymerase ribozyme        and that subsequent evolution of DDRPs and RDRPs proceeded        via accretion of various simple modules such as the        sandwichbarrel hybrid motif domain around this conserved        core                    Results and discussion                  Bacteriophage homologs of the eukaryotic RDRPs and          prediction of their active site          To investigate the evolutionary affinities of the          RDRPs we carefully examined the results of BLAST          searches of the nonredundant NR protein sequence          database National Center for Biotechnology Information          NIH Bethesda for various RDRP sequences These searches          identified a large region of  residues as the          conserved module shared by all RDRPs This region was          further examined by searches of NR using the PSIBLAST          program which was iterated to convergence with a profile          inclusion threshold of E   These searches eg the          search initiated with the core RDRP module from           Petunia residues  readily          retrieved RDRPs from plants           C elegans            Dictyostelium discoideum  several          fungi and           Giardia lamblia with statistically          highly significant expectation E values Interestingly          the second iteration of this search retrieved the YonO          protein from the           Bacillus subtilis phage Spc with          a significant Evalue     YonO was also detected          with significant Evalues in searches initiated with          other eukaryotic RDRP modules eg that of           Schizosaccharomyces pombe           Reciprocal searches started with the YonO protein          sequence retrieved closely related proteins encoded by          prophages in the genome of           Clostridium          acetobutylicum CAC and           Clostridium perfringens CPE          Hereinafter we refer to these bacteriophage proteins as          the YonOlike RDRP homologs YRHs          The Gibbs sampling alignment procedure detected           statistically significant motifs that are conserved          across the entire set of RdRps and YRHs with a          probability of occurrence by chance in this set of          protein sequences estimated as   A multiple          alignment of the RDRPs and YRHs was constructed using the          TCoffee program and adjusted using the alignments          reported by PSIBLAST and secondary structure prediction          Secondary structure prediction which was produced using          the multiple alignment as the query included           helices and  strands which are conserved in RDRPs          and YRHs Fig  Conserved sequence motifs are          distributed throughout the aligned region two motifs          with the highest density of conserved residues are          located between strands  and  and strands  and           Fig  Twelve residues are conserved in all sequences          from the two families of which nine are charged and one          is polar serine Fig  The conserved charged and          polar residues conceivably might be involved in catalysis          and substratebinding The most notable signature shared          by the RDRPs and the YRH proteins is the DbDGD b is a          bulky residue motif located between strands  and           Fig  Closely spaced acidic residues that coordinate          divalent cations are characteristic of the active sites          of most nucleic acid polymerases in spite of the fact          that they belong to several unrelated structural folds                    Given that the DbDGD motif is the          only set of closely spaced acidic residues shared by the          RDRPs and the YRHs it is likely to form part of the          nucleotidyltransferase active site of these enzymes          Thus these comparisons identify previously undetected          prokaryotic homologs of the eukaryotic RDRPs the YRH          proteins which probably also have RNAdependent RNA          polymerase activity                          Structural and evolutionary relationship between          the catalytic domains of the RDRPs and the DDRPs          Interestingly the PSIBLAST searches started with the          sequences of the RDRP module of the RDRPs and the YRH          proteins consistently retrieved the  subunits of DDRPs          albeit at statistically not significant Evalues The          highscoring segment pairs HSPs detected in these          searches aligned the highly conserved region of the RDRPs          between the predicted strands  and  including the          DbDGD motif with the portion of the DDRP  subunit          sequence which contains the metalchelating active site          with a similar conserved motif DxDGD Additionally a          search of the NR database with a positionspecific          scoring matrix PSSM that included all unique RDRP and          YRH sequences detected with borderline Evalues a large          protein from Corynebacterium glutamicum Cgl which          also contained a DXDGD motif Reciprocal searches showed          that this protein contained two regions of statistically          significant similarity to the DDRPs The Nterminal          region of similarity corresponded to the conserved          portion of the  subunits and the Cterminal region          corresponded to the core of the  subunit and included          the DXDGD motif see discussion below Despite the low          statistical significance of the similarity between RDRPs          and DDRPs the presence of the same signature motif in          the experimentally identified or predicted active sites          of the two classes of enzymes prompted us to perform a          detailed comparison of the catalytic domains of these two          classes of RNA polymerases          Among nucleic acid polymerases a DxDxD motif is          conserved only in the RDRPs the DDRP  subunits and the          euryarchaeaspecific DNA polymerase subunit II However          in the latter polymerase the motif has the signature          DGDED as opposed to the DxDGD pattern shared by the          RDRPs and DDRPs To investigate the distribution of this          motif in the entire protein database we conducted          pattern searches using the GREF program of the SEALS          package with queries corresponding to the residue          conservation profile in the predicted active sites of the          RDRPs All these queries contained the DxDGD motif with          additional flanking conserved residues The only proteins          with evolutionarily conserved DxDGD motifs that were          detected in these searches were the RDRPs the  subunit          of DDRPs the integrin calciumbinding module and the          EFhand domain data not shown Among these domains the          motif was embedded in the context of conserved          predicted strands only in the RDRPs and DDRPs          Moreover in searches conducted with extended queries          such as DbDGDxhxh or DGDxhxh patterns h is a hydrophobic          residue the RDRPs and the  subunits of DDRPs were          identified as the only protein families in which these          motifs were conserved We also ran database searches          using the PHIBLAST program that combines a regular BLAST          search with a pattern search     In these searches          the active site motif was used as the pattern query and          various RDRP sequences as the sequence queries All these          searches retrieved the YonO proteins with significant          Evalues and some of the DDRP  subunits with borderline          Evalues For example searches seeded with the RDRP          RrpB gene product sequence from           Dictyostelium gi and the          pattern GASD FLYMQND GDX ACLIVMFYX          ACLIVMFY detected the rice DDRP catalytic subunit with          an Evalue of           Examination of the recently solved structures of the          DDRP showed that although  subunit is a large protein          the active site containing the DxDGD motif mapped to a          small compact barrel domain A search of the PDB          database using the DALI program     with this          barrel from           Thermus thermophilus  subunit          submitted as a query pdb iw chain D region           retrieved the Nterminal domain of the          CDClike AAA ATPases formate dehydrogenases aspartate          decarboxylases and Barwin The reported structural          alignments span  residues with significant Zscores           and root mean square deviations RMSD between          the C backbones in the range of   which is          characteristic of homologous domains The region of          structural similarity shared by the catalytic domain of          the  subunit of the DDRPs and the above proteins          corresponds to a distinct globular fold known as the          doublepsi betabarrel DPBB       The SCOP          database included the RNA polymerase subunits in the          multidomain protein class but mentions the presence of a          DPBB domain in each of the  and  subunits               see below          The region of sequence similarity between the RDRPs          and the  subunits of DDRPs that was detected in the          searches described above almost precisely mapped to the          DPBBfold catalytic domain of DDRP The          multiplealignmentbased secondary structure prediction          for the RDRPs and the YRHs indicated that like the          similar region of the  subunit this region was          enriched in strands Fig  Multiple alignment          constructed on the basis of sequence alignments produced          in the PSIBLAST and PHIBLAST searches and superposition          of the predicted secondary structure elements of RDRP and          the experimentally determined structure of DDRP revealed          considerable concordance between the RDRP and DDRP          families In addition to the DbDGD motif which is          located in the loop between strands  and  several          residues are conserved between these polymerase families          Fig  These include hydrophobic residues in the          strands a conserved proline after strand  a small          typically glycine and polar typically aspartate          residues before strand  small residues that typically          mark the boundaries of secondary structure elements and          several charged and polar residues Fig  A comparison          of the RDRP and DDRP sequences using the Gibbs sampling          method identified two conserved blocks which were highly          statistically significant E    within the          analyzed sequence set One of these blocks centered at          the DbDGD motif whereas the other one encompassed          strands  and  which contain several partially          conserved hydrophobic and polar positions Fig           Importantly approximately  conserved residues that          are detected in the structurebased alignments of the          DPBB domains are also conserved in the RDRPs Fig           These include a doublet comprised of a small and a polar          residues preceding each of strands  and  a small          residue after strand  proline in the DDRP  subunit          and RDRP bulky and polar residues in strand  a small          residue immediately downstream of strand  a bulky          residue in the loop between strands  and  and two          hydrophobic residues in strand  Fig  The predicted          DPBB domains of the RDRPs differ from most of the DPBB          domains of DDRP  subunits in that the former lack a          long and variable in both length and sequence insert          between strands  and  that is characteristic of the          latter Fig  However the DPBB from the RNA          polymerases of yeast killer plasmids and the divergent          predicted corynebacterial polymerase Cgl also lack          this insert Fig  Taken together these observations          suggest that although RDRPs and the  subunits of DDRPs          show limited sequence similarity these two RNA          polymerase families share a homologous catalytic domain          which consists of a doublepsibarrel containing the          metalcoordinating DbDGD motif                          The DPBB domains and early evolution of the          catalytic domain of RNA polymerases          The SCOP database while classifying the DDRP subunits          in the multidomain category recognizes two DPBBs in the          DDRP complex One of these corresponds to the catalytic          metalcoordinating domain containing the DbDGD motif in          the  subunit residues  of pdb idiw chain          D whereas the other one corresponds to the conserved          core domain of the  subunit residues of pdb id          iw chain C The DPBB domains of the  and  subunits          interact to form the catalytic cleft of the RNA          polymerases with two conserved lysines in the  subunit          protruding into the cleft and interacting with the          substrate Fig  However the DPBB domain in the           subunit is distorted by two large inserts Fig and see          below and shows no detectable sequence similarity to the           subunit DPBB Because of these inserts and the          resulting distortion the DPBB of the  subunit does not          show similarity to any domains in structure database          searches Nevertheless a structural alignment based on          visual inspection confirms the presence of all the           bona fide features of the DPBB          domain in the  subunit Fig  The Cgl protein          from           Corynebacterium  which we          identified as one of the most divergent members of the          DDRP clade showed similarity to the other DDRPs only in          two regions which corresponded to the DPBBs from the           and the  subunit This observation taken together with          the spatial proximity of the two DPBBs in the catalytic          cleft of the DDRP Fig  indicates that these domains          comprise the ancestral conserved core of the RNA          polymerases The arrangement of the two DPBBs in the           and  subunits suggests that in the primordial ancestor          of the DDRPs the two DPBBs formed a headtotail          homodimer that bound RNA at the domain interface          Although the cores of the two DDRP subunits are          homologous and are likely to have evolved from a common          ancestor see discussion below they have completely          different sets of conserved residues and contribute          distinct moieties to the catalytic cleft Figs            Thus these specific active residues apparently emerged          after the divergence of the  and  subunit DPBBs          whereas the ancestral DPBB homodimer probably did not          have catalytic activity and merely bound a ribozyme that          originally catalyzed the RNA polymerization          Subsequently the two subunits diverged from each other          with one  acquiring a divalent cationbinding site in          the insert between the two terminal strands of the DPBB          whereas the DPBB in the other  subunit acquired two          basic residues that interacted with the nucleic acid At          this stage which might be considered the emergence of          moderntype RNA polymerases the catalytic activity          probably was taken over by the protein          The basic DPBB fold consists of six strands and two          variable regions which are located after strand  and          strand  and at least in some case adopt a helical          conformation       The domain can be further          split into two symmetrical structural units each with          three core strands These two units are combined into a          barrel with a complex topology with strand  wedged          between strands  and  and strand  wedged between          strands  and  yielding two psi loop structures Fig           The psiloops between strands  and  and between          strands  and  often harbor the active site or          substrateinteraction residues of the respective DPBBs          Sequence comparisons and identification of specific          conserved motifs showed that the DPBB fold includes five          major superfamilies These superfamilies are typified by          the formate dehydrogenase Cterminal FDHC domain          Barwin endoglucanase aspartyl protease and the DPBB          domains from the  and  subunits of DDRP Two of these          superfamilies show a restricted phyletic distribution          Barwinlike endoglucanases are present only in plants and          fungi whereas aspartyl proteases are found in          eukaryotes retroviruses and a minority of bacteria The          latter superfamily also has a circular permutation which          suggests secondary derivation Thus none of these          superfamilies are likely to have been present in the last          universal common ancestor LUCA of extant life forms In          contrast the DPBBs detected in DDRP subunits are          universally present in all modern life forms and hence          are traceable to LUCA The FDHC superfamily includes          several distinct families The Nterminal domain of the          CDClike AAA ATPases is present largely in eukaryotes          and archaea and the Nterminal domain of thymidine          phosphorylases is archaeaspecific In contrast the          FDHClike DPBB domain associated with oxidoreductases          such as formate dehydrogenase and          molybdopterincontaining dehydrogenases is widespread in          archaea and all major lineages of freeliving bacteria          Thus at least one DPBB domain of the FHDC superfamily          probably was present in LUCA          The above analysis shows that LUCA probably encoded          three distinct DPBB domains Although the DPBB domain in          the RNA polymerase  subunit is distorted by inserts and          shows extreme sequence divergence its role in the          formation of the catalytic cleft and the spatial          arrangement with respect to the more canonical DPBB of          the  subunit Fig  are compatible with the          hypothesis that the two DPBB domains of DDRP shared a          common ancestor to the exclusion of the other ancient          FDHClike DPBB A structurebased sequence alignment          shows that the DPBB domains of the RNA polymerases share          several conserved residues with other DPBB domains These          include  hydrophobic residues two sets of symmetrically          positioned small mostly glycine and polar mostly          aspartate residues preceding strands  and           respectively and at least three other small residues          two polar residues and two bulky residues Fig  Of          these the small residues preceding strands  and           contribute a positive  angle which results in turning          of the C backbone to stabilize the barrel              These shared features notwithstanding the ancient DPBBs          have no conserved residues in their catalytic or          substratebinding sites This is best compatible with the          notion that the common ancestor of the DPBB domains was a          generic binding domain devoid of high specificity or          catalytic activity see also discussion above          The same threestranded structural units that          interlock to give rise to DPBB also form another type of          barrel via terminal dimerization This is the           E longation factor           I somerase EIbarrel found in          ribosomal proteins such as L GTPase translation          factors ferredoxin reductase and Lfucose isomerase               It seems likely that the EIbarrel and the DPBB          evolved from ancient threestranded ancestral units          which were stabilized via the formation of different          barrel structures through homodimerization          Several versions of the DPBB eg those in RNA          polymerases and of the EIB such as those in translation          elongation factors and ribosomal protein L are parts of          ribonucleoprotein complexes Other ancient forms          especially those that occur as accessory domains in          enzymes appear to bind small molecules Hence the          primordial threestrand unit might have formed          barrelshaped dimers that nonspecifically associated          with RNA or with small molecules These generic barrel          domains subsequently diverged to occupy different          functional niches in ribonucleoproteins and metabolic          enzymes These considerations together with the inferred          relationships between the different versions of the DPBB          domain lead to the scenario of early evolution outlined          in Figure  Only the last bifurcation of the DPBB          domains in the proposed tree yielded the distinct forms          present in the  and  subunits of DDRP which          apparently acquired catalytic activity Substantial          divergence of the barrels seems to have occurred at a          stage of evolution when the actual RNA polymerase          activity resided in a ribozyme whose functioning was          facilitated by a nonspecific RNAbinding protein          cofactor                          Ancient conserved domains and evolution of          DNAdependent RNA polymerases          While all bacteria archaea and eukaryotes encode          orthologs of at least four distinct subunits of DDRP the          divergent RNA polymerases of baculoviruses and yeast          killer plasmids and the           Corynebacterium Cgl protein          only contain counterparts to the  and  subunits The          minimal RNA polymerase seems to be represented by the          predicted catalytic core of Cgl which appears to          consist entirely of the type and type DPBBs in this          case juxtaposed in the same polypeptide These          observations are not particularly surprising given that           and  subunits form the catalytic cleft of the DDRP          Fig  whereas the other subunits occupy peripheral          positions in the complex In an attempt to gain further          insight into the early evolution of the catalytic core of          RNA polymerases we sought to identify additional          globular domains in  and  subunits          Using the experimentally determined structure as a          guide we split the  and  subunits of the           Thermus thermophilus DDRP and the          largest two subunits of the yeast DDRP into individual          globular domains and investigated them by visual          inspection of the topology structural searches of the          PDB database using the DALI program and iterative          searches of the NR database using PSIBLAST An obvious          ancient conserved domain thus detected was a          rubredoxinlike Znribbon The Znribbons are widespread          small domains that are comprised of two hairpins          bounded by consecutive extended regions stabilized by          metalcoordinating residues in the hairpin loops                 Znribbons are present in a variety of          nucleicacidbinding proteins including several          ribosomal proteins translation factors aminoacyltRNA          synthetases RNA polymerase cofactors in archaea and          eukaryotes and several transcription factors These          domains are also present in other contexts where they          function as structural scaffolds and as regulators of          redox reactions The  subunit of bacterial DDRPs          contains a single Znribbon at the Nterminus region           of           Thermus  subunit Fig  The          orthologous largest subunits of the archaeal and          eukaryotic DDRPs have two Znribbons in the Nterminal          portion of the protein regions  and  in the          yeast protein The distal ribbon is distorted by a large          insert between the two core halves of the domain and a          substitution of asparagine for one of the          metalcoordinating cysteines          Although the sequences of the Znribbons of bacterial          and archaeoeukaryotic DDRP subunits have diverged          considerably their similar location in the orthologous          polypeptides from different kingdoms suggests that           subunit of LUCA already contained a Znribbon Based on          the crystal structure it has been proposed that the          region containing the Zn ribbon may interact with the          promoter during transcription initiation in bacteria              Hence it is plausible that a nucleicacidbinding          Znribbon had been recruited to the ancestral polymerase          core which consisted of the DPBB domains and          contributed to nonspecific interactions with the          template Consistent with this the Znribbon had been          subsequently reused in several basal archaeoeukaryotic          transcription factors such as TFIIB TFIIE and TFIIS                           A potential additional nucleicacidbinding moiety          that is conserved in all subunits is the AThook like          module Fig  The AThook is a simple small protein          module that consists of a flaplike structure with a          positively charged surface that is inserted into the          minor groove of DNA     The two AThooklike modules          residues  of IW chain D in the DDRP  subunit          are inserted within the helix that is located          immediately upstream of the DPBB domain Fig           Previously AThooks have been detected primarily in          eukaryotic chromatinassociated proteins particularly          transcription factors where they function as accessory          DNAbinding domains     The ubiquity of the          AThooklike modules in the  subunits of DDRPs suggests          that they were recruited for nucleic acid recognition in          LUCA if not earlier          Analysis of a strandrich insert between strands           and  of the  subunit DPBB Figs   led to the          identification of another ancient conserved domain that          could be traced back to ancestral RNA polymerases Visual          examination of the structure of this insert domain          revealed a topology with elements of both a sandwich and          a barrel and two waistlike structures that are          characteristic of the sandwichbarrel hybrid motif SBHM          fold     see also the SCOP database     The          SBHM fold is present in biotinlipoate carrier domains          and their homologs found in a variety of enzymes and          transporters     A DALI search with this insert          domain from the  subunit of           Thermus DDRP showed similarity to          the SBHMs from various biotinlipoatebinding enzymes          such as acetylCoA carboxylase bdo or dihydrolipoamide          acetyltransferase iyu with Z scores of  and RMSD            in the aligned regions spanning approximately           residues An alignment of the SBHM domains from the DDRP           subunit with the previously identified SBHMs showed          conservation of most residues characteristic of the SBHM          superfamily Fig  The defining structural feature of          this domain is seen in the loop between strands  and           Figs   This loop is bounded by small residues at          each end mostly valine at the Nterminus and glycine at          the Cterminus and has a distinct signature with small          mostly glycine charged mostly aspartate and          hydrophobic residues occurring in succession in the          middle of the loop Figs   These observations          reveal an evolutionary relationship between the SBHM          domain of DDRP and the SBHMs found in other functionally          distinct proteins          The core SBHM domain consists of a repeat of two          threestranded units with the characteristic waistlike          structure occurring between the second and third strands          of each repeat Fig  In the complete SBHM strand           packs with strand  and the loops bounded by the two          waistlike regions adopt an extended conformation          resulting in the formation of a barrel In the crystal          structure of DDRP the SBHM domain inserted into the          subunit DPBB is in contact with the outwardprojecting          insert between strands  and  of the subunit DPBB          Furthermore the SBHM also contributes to the          stabilization of the catalytic site by forming an          interface between the two DPBBs Fig  The universal          presence of the SBHM inserted in the DPBB domain of the          DDRP subunit suggests that this domain was already          present in the common ancestor of all extant DDRPs The          wide spread in different phylogenetic lineages of two          other SBHM domains namely those found in          dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase and the          glycinecleaving enzyme is indicative of their presence          in LUCA     The SBHM of the DDRPs is specifically          related to the biotinlipoatebinding SBHMs The two          share a conserved basic residue that is present          immediately prior to strand  In all          biotinlipoatebinding SBHMs this position is occupied          by a lysine which covalently binds organic radical          ligands Fig  but there is no evidence for such a          role in the DDRP  subunits These observations suggest          that the ancestral SBHM interacted with various ligands          with a low specificity From such a precursor which          existed prior to LUCA the SBHM domain apparently          diversified into two forms one that covalently bound          organic radicals and another that specialized in          noncovalent interactions with proteins or nucleic acids          This latter form was recruited into the RNA polymerase          catalytic core where it provided additional surfaces for          the interaction between the DPBB domains and formed part          of the interface between the catalytic domains Thus it          appears likely that the ancestral DDRP evolved from the          coalescence of at least  distinct domains i the DPBB          that probably originally bound RNA and subsequently          segregated into the cores of the  subunit where it          acquired the metalcoordinating active site and of the           subunit with the two lysines projecting into the          catalytic cleft Fig  ii the Znribbon which was          probably involved in interactions with the template and          iii the SBHM domain that stabilized the interactions          between the DPBB domains forming the catalytic cleft          Fig  Additionally two AThook like modules which          probably had an accessory DNAbinding function were also          inserted into a conserved helix directly Nterminal of          the DPBB domain in the  subunit          The remaining conserved regions in the  and           subunits of the DDRPs do not show detectable relationship          with any other ancient conserved domains Examination of          these structures shows that they are principally composed          of large helical hairpins that form coiled coil          structures or stretches with successive shorter          helices Some of the other conserved regions consist of          meanders with unusually long strands These regions          probably emerged respectively through duplication and          divergence of a simple helical unit or through          stabilization of long loops by selection for hydrophobic          residues resulting in the formation of the core units of          the meanders                          Proliferation of the SandwichBarrel Hybrid Motif          and lineagespecific innovations of the large subunits of          bacterial DDRP          Further visual examination and structural alignments          revealed the presence of one additional SBHM domain in          the  subunit iw chain C region  and several          repeats of this domain in the  subunit iw chain D          regions     and           of the bacterial DDRPs Fig  A PSIBLAST          search started with the Nterminal SBHM from the           Aquifex aeolicus DDRP  subunit          detected several SBHMs from proteins other than the           subunit such as acetylornithine deacetylase E               iteration  the Cterminal region of bacterial          cytochrome F E    iteration  biotin carboxyl          carrier domain of biotin transcarboxylases E               iteration  and the phosphotransferase system enzyme          II E    iteration  This search also retrieved          the bacteriaspecific Cterminal SBHM domain of the           subunit eg           Thermotoga  E   and          interestingly also a SBHM in the Nterminal region of          the NusG protein from           Thermotoga maritima E               iteration  Reverse searches with the Cterminal region          of cytochrome F gi  residues           retrieved the bacterial  sequences in the second and          subsequent iterations with statistically significant          Evalues None of these additional SBHMs were detectable          in the archaeal or eukaryotic DDRPs either in sequence          searches or in direct comparisons of the crystal          structures Thus there appears to have been a          lineagespecific proliferation and dissemination of the          SBHM domains in bacteria          Bacterial  and  subunits show major variability in          the distribution of the SBHM domains Fig  All          bacterial  subunits share one additional SBHM which is          located Nterminal of the DPBB domain Similarly an          extra SBHM located Cterminal of the DPBB is conserved          in bacterial  subunits In some cyanobacteria the          portion of the  subunit containing the SBHM occurs as a          separate polypeptide In addition to the SBHMs that are          conserved among all bacterial lineages a cassette of up          to four SBHMs are present Nterminal of the DPBB domain          in the  subunit of           Thermus            Deinococcus and           Thermotoga Fig  Similarly the           subunit of proteobacteria           Aquifex  spirochaetes          cyanobacteria and chlamydiae contains an additional set          of SBHMs Cterminal of the DPBB domain preceding the          Cterminal SBHM that is shared by all bacteria Fig           The bacterialspecific SBHM domains present in the  and           subunits are typically located on the periphery of the          holoenzyme which makes them accessible for interactions          with other proteins Two of these SBHMs regions           and  in iw chain D are involved in the          interaction with the   subunit which is critical for          transcription initiation in bacteria     Thus it          appears likely that originally the SBHM domain of the           subunit participated in generic proteinprotein          interactions that allowed the ancestral DDRP to recruit          accessory subunits Subsequently in the bacterial          lineage proliferation of SBHMs provided for several          other specific interactions involved in initiation and          elongation          Several of the SBHMs that are specific to the          bacterial DDRPs show degradation of the waistlike loop          of the first internal repeat This is clearly a derived          state because the SBHM originally evolved through the          duplication of a single ancestral unit that contained an          intact waistlike loop between strands  and  The          form of the SBHM with a shortened loop in the first          internal repeat is additionally seen in several          bacterialspecific families of SBHMs These include the          SBHM of the phosphotransferase system enzyme II glucose          permease or PTSEII found in several lineages of          freeliving bacteria the one at the Ctermini of          cytochrome F from cyanobacteria and chloroplasts and the          NlpDlike cell wall peptidases that are present in most          bacteria In addition to the specific structural          relationship between some of the SBHMs of the DDRPs and          those present in these bacterial proteins they also show          detectable sequence similarity For example a PSIBLAST          search initiated with the SBHM from NlpD retrieved the          derived SBHMs of the bacterial RNA polymerase subunits          eg           Streptococcus  subunit E             iteration  well before the classical SBHMs eg           Mesorhizobium dihydrolipoamide          acetyltransferase E    iteration  The  and           subunits of the bacterial DDRP are the only proteins that          contain both versions of the SBHM Fig  Hence it          appears likely that the form of the SBHM with the          degraded loop in the first internal repeat initially          evolved in the bacterial DDRP subunits Subsequently          these domains appear to have been recruited for various          interactions in other bacterial proteins          Examination of the structure and multiple sequence          alignments of bacterial  and  subunits led to the          identification of two additional distinct domains which          so far are not detectable in any proteins other than the          DDRP and were accordingly designated BetaBeta Module           BBM region  iw chain D and BetaBeta          Module  BBM region  iw chain D Fig           Both these domains share an unusual common structural          core that we term the BBMcore BBMC of about           residues with an RMSD of  over the aligned region The          BBMC consists of N and Cterminal helices that bound a          central region with  unusual extended regions that fold          into a curved hairpin structure Fig A The BBM          domain is inserted after the Znribbon in all bacterial           subunits and additionally into the SBHM domain of          the  subunit in proteobacteria           Aquifex and chlamydiae Fig           Notably this is the same set of bacteria that contain          extra SBHM domains inserted in the Cterminal region of          the  subunit Fig and see above The BBM domain          shows a similar pattern of insertion the Cterminal          portion of all bacterial  subunit contains one copy          Thermotoga has two extra copies distal of the          panbacterial copy Proteobacteria           Aquifex  spirochetes and          chlamydiae have a BBM inserted into the Nterminal          region of the  subunit Fig  The functions of these          previously unnoticed modules and the nature of the          apparent congruence in the evolution of the two RDRP          subunits in a subset of bacteria remain to be          elucidated                          The RNA polymerase  subunitcorerelated domain          and other elaborations of the archaeoeukaryotic RNA          polymerase catalytic subunits          The bacterial DDRPs have two subunits that form a          homodimer at the base of the  dimer and stabilize          the catalyticbinding cleft In the archaeoeukaryotic          lineage there is a duplication of the subunit          resulting in two paralogous subunits RBP and RBP In          the eukaryotic DDRP complex these subunits occupy a          spatial position very similar to that of the subunit          homodimer of the bacterial DDRPs All these proteins          share a common    core domain with two helices          which form the dimer interface In the SCOP database the          subunit core domains have been classified together with          several other domains including the ligandbinding          domain of the bacterial arginine repressor the          dimerization cofactor of the transcription factor HNF          DCOH and a domain specific to the bacterial          aspartyltRNA synthetases To investigate this domain          further we conducted structural similarity searches of          the PDB database using the DALI program with the          subunits of the bacterial and eukaryotic DDRPs used as          the queries These searches showed that the core domain          of the subunits were most similar Z scores  with          RMSDs of   over the aligned C residues to the          arginine repressor ligandbinding domain    and          several domains that were not previously recognized as          being related Fig B These newly detected domains          included the SUI domain that is found in eIF and          related proteins     the third globular domain of          DNA gyraseTopoisomerase II and most interestingly a          distinct globular domain in the yeast DDRP  subunit          PDB k region  Reciprocal DALI searches          with these domains readily recovered the subunits of          DDRP as the best hits For example the domain from the          yeast  subunit hit the subunits of bacterial DDRPs          with Zscores of  and RMSD of   Hereinafter we          refer to these domains as the            subunit corerelated ASCR          domains The ASCR fold has a  topology and forms          a twolayered structure with a stranded sheet and          characteristic strand order of  Fig B The          ASCR domains of bacterial subunits and eukaryotic RBP          share a common insert domain between helix and strand           which apparently has been lost in the RBP subunit of          the eukaryotic DDRPs          The ASCR domain in the yeast  subunit is inserted          into another    domain Visual examination of the          topology and structural searches of the PDB database          using the DALI program showed that this domain it adopts          an RNA Recognition Motif RRMlike structure with a           topology forming a stranded sheet These          two domains comprise a conserved module that is          specifically shared by the archaeoeukaryotic DDRPs to          the exclusion of the bacterial  subunits Fig  This          twodomain module is inserted precisely in the same          region as the Cterminal SBHMs seen in the bacterial          lineage Fig  The closest relatives of the ASCR          domain detected in the  subunit are those present in          the subunits Fig B This observation suggests that          the primary event in the divergence of the          archaeoeukaryotic  subunit was the insertion of an          RRMlike domain into the ancestral core This was          followed by the insertion of the ASCR domain which          probably evolved as a result of a duplication of the          RBP subunits into this RRMlike domain Both the          spatial arrangement of the ASCR domain in the  subunits          and its extreme sequence divergence with respect to the          ASCR domains of the subunit suggests that it has          acquired a new function The RRMlike domain and the ASCR          domain are positioned in the exterior entrance to the          catalytic cleft and could interact with cofactors or with          nucleic acid There is no evidence that the ASCR domain          in the DDRP subunits binds nucleic acids and studies on          SUI protein and the arginine repressor ligandbinding          domain implicate the ASCR domain in proteinprotein          interactions and small molecule binding               However most of the ASCR domains are present in proteins          that interact with nucleic acids see above raising the          possibility of a role in nonspecific nucleic acid          binding          Mirroring the insertion of the ASCR domain in the           subunit a distinct    globular domain Nterminal to          the DPBB domain region  of K Chain B is          inserted in the  subunits of all archaeal and eukaryotic          DDRPs Fig  This domain contains a stranded sheet          with a  topology with the strands in a           order Visual examination of the topology and searches of          the PDB database using the DALI program showed that this          insert domain has the grasp fold      For          example in the DALI search the                     Staphylococcus immunoglobulinbinding protein IGBP          PDB code igd was detected with a Z score of  and a          RMSD of  over  residues This insert domain in the          archaeoeukaryotic  subunits resembles the version of          the grasp domain that is present in the bacterial          translation initiation factor IF and the IGBPs in          contrast to the distinct version found in ubiquitins          ferredoxins and ThiS Specifically the subunit insert          domain shares a stranded core with the former group          and like these proteins lacks a long insert between the          two terminal strands data not shown Given that this          domain lies in the periphery of the holoenzyme it is          likely to participate in interactions with cofactors          which is compatible with the proteinprotein interaction          function identified in several proteins with the grasp          fold               Thus a common set of ancient conserved modules          appears to have been repeatedly reused in the          evolutionary diversification of the RNA polymerase          subunits from their ancestral cores The lineagespecific          domain insertions in bacteria and in archaeaeukaryotes          correlate with the fundamental differences between the          basal transcription machinery of these two lineages               This suggests congruent evolution of the RNA          polymerase catalytic subunits and the basal transcription          factors                              Origin of the RDRPs          The evidence of an evolutionary relationship between          the core catalytic domains of the RDRPs and the DDRPs has          implications for the origin of the former group of          proteins Given that DDRP is universal whereas RDRP is          eukaryotespecific a plausible hypothesis might be that          RDRP evolved at the onset of eukaryotic evolution through          extensive rapid sequence divergence following a          duplication of the  subunit of the ancestral DDRP          However despite extensive comparisons using PSSM and          careful visual examination we failed to detect any          residual sequence similarity between DDRP and RDRP          outside the core DPBB domain containing the metalbinding          active site In particular no traces of the Znribbon          and the AThooklike modules which are conserved in all           subunits Fig  were detected All RDRP sequences          contain two closely spaced lysines which are conserved          in the YRH proteins Fig  and might functionally          correspond to the conserved lysines of the type DPBB          These residues are embedded in a secondary structure          context that is enriched in predicted strands Fig           hence in principle this region might correspond to the          type DPBB of the DDRPs However the respective region          of the RDRP sequences shows no detectable similarity to          the to this DPBB domain suggesting that the presence of          two functionally important lysines in both RDRP and DDRP          might be convergent In principle radical divergence          could have eroded all similarity between RDRP and DDRP          beyond the DPBB domain An alternative perhaps more          likely explanation is that while the core catalytic          domains of the two polymerases evolved from the same          ancestral DPBB they subsequently accreted distinct sets          of peripheral modules around this core The bacteriophage          YRH proteins show no specific relationship with the RDRPs          from any one eukaryotic lineage arguing against a recent          lateral transfer from eukaryotes to the phages Taken          together all these observations point to a scenario for          the origin of the RDRP under which the RDRPs and the          YRHs diverged from the DDRPs at a stage of evolution that          succeeded the divergence of the DPBB domains of the  and           subunits Fig  but preceded the emergence of          eukaryotes and even LUCA One class of substrates of the          extant eukaryotic RDRPs are small RNAs such as microRNAs          and stRNAs           and analogous small          RNAs have been identified in bacteria                 Given that small RNAs are likely to have been abundant in          the hypothetical ancient RNA world RDRPs might have been          involved in the replication of such RNAs since an early          stage of evolution Should that be the case the YRH          proteins could be late surviving derivatives of these          ancient enzymes which apparently have been shunned from          cellular life forms during the evolution of prokaryotes          Eukaryotes might have acquired the YRH gene from a          bacteriophage at an early stage of their evolution and          retained the RDRPs thanks to the selective advantage          conferred by the new level of gene expression regulation          mediated in part by these enzymes          The eukaryotic RDRP is part of a large ensemble of          functionally linked proteins which include the Dicer          helicasenuclease PIWI family proteins the          HenCorymbosalike RNA methylase AlkBrelated RNA          demethylases and Linlike RNAbinding proteins                Since no closely related homologs of any of these          proteins are encoded in the genomes of the phages that          encode YRH proteins the latter are unlikely to function          in a biological context similar to that of the eukaryotic          RDRPs Nevertheless the extended similarity between the          YRH and RDRP sequences and the presence of potential          nucleicacidbinding modules such as a Cterminal          Znribbon in the SpC YonO protein suggest that the YRH          proteins also have a RNA polymerase activity Possible          functions of the YRH proteins include a regulatory          activity via amplification of antisense RNAs or perhaps a          more conventional role as a DNAdependent RNA polymerase          of the respective phages                          General discussion and conclusions          Here we identified bacteriophage homologs of the          eukaryotic RDRP which is involved in          posttranscriptional gene silencing We also present          evidence that RDRP and the ubiquitous  subunit of DDRP          contain a homologous metalcoordinating catalytic          domain This domain adopts the DPBB fold in which the          signature DbDGD motif shared by RDRP and DDRP is          ensconced in the insert between the ultimate and          penultimate strands A second DPBB domain is present in          the  subunit of the DDRPs This version of the DPBB          domain lacks the metalcoordinating motif but contributes          two lysine residues which are critical for substrate          interactions in the catalytic cleft The DPBB domain in          the  subunit is distorted by large inserts and shares no          detectable sequence similarity with the DPBB from the           subunit However the DPBBs from the two DDRP subunits          are spatially juxtaposed in the DDRP crystal with the          catalytic cleft located between them This arrangement          suggests that the primordial RNA polymerase was a head to          tail homodimer of a DPBB domain a duplication of this          primordial DPBB domain probably gave rise to the two          DPBBs of modern DDRPs The presence of completely          different conserved residues and the asymmetric head to          tail arrangement of the monomers in the pair suggest that          the ancestral DPBB dimer was not specialized had no          catalytic activity and merely bound RNA Originally          these DPBB domains might have functioned as protein          cofactors that stabilized a ribozyme RNA polymerase and          eventually displaced the ribozyme as they acquired key          residues required for proteinbased polymerase activity          This evolutionary scenario complements a similar model          proposed for the evolution of the other major polymerase          class the palmdomaincontaining RNA and DNA          polymerases whose primordial core apparently consisted          of a RNAbinding domain of the RRM fold              The  and  subunits of DDRP additionally contain a          Znribbon and a SBHM domain respectively The former is a          widespread nucleicacidbinding domain whereas the          latter functions in a variety of biochemical contexts as          a smallmoleculebinding and proteinprotein interaction          domain Analysis of the conserved protein superfamilies          within these folds and their phyletic distribution          patterns suggests that diverse versions of these domains          with distinct functions were already present in LUCA          Thus several duplicationdivergence events apparently          preceded the emergence of the forms of these domains that          are seen in the catalytic core of DDRPs eg Fig           The ancestral versions of these domains would not have          the adaptations for specific roles possessed by their          descendant forms such as those in extant DDRP or RDRP          and probably functioned as generic RNAbinding and          proteinprotein interaction domains with the specificity          conferred by catalytic RNA molecules Hence considerable          diversity of protein domains appears to have emerged          prior to the crystallization    of a transcription          machinery similar to the one that operates in modern          cells and probably had been already in place in LUCA              Similar conclusions regarding the early stages of          protein domain evolution have been reached previously as          a result of evolutionary analysis of proteins involved in          translation such as aminoacyltRNA synthetases and          GTPases substantial diversification of protein domains          had occurred prior to the crystallization of elaborate          moderntype translation machinery               Although the major events in the evolution of          polymerases occurred at very early stages of evolution          and LUCA already had an advanced DDRP resembling the          extant forms subsequent lineagespecific elaborations of          considerable magnitude have occurred The most notable of          these is the proliferation and dissemination of SBHM and          the BBM domains in the bacterial  and  subunits In          the archaeoeukaryotic lineage another domain          apparently derived through duplication of the          dimerization domain of the DDRP subunit was inserted          into the Cterminal region of the  subunit          Additionally the Znribbon underwent duplication and          elaboration in the  subunit and was also recruited in          various transcription factors Similarly in the          archaeoeukaryotic  subunit a minimal grasp domain          was added to the conserved core          While we provide evidence that the catalytic cores of          the RDRPs their bacteriophage homologs and the DDRPs          evolved from a common ancestor the provenance of the          rest of the conserved RDRP module and accordingly the          evolutionary scenario for RDRP remain less clear No          similarity to DDRPs was detected in the RDRP sequences          beyond the core DPBB domain One possibility is that the          RDRP module has emerged at the onset of the evolution of          eukaryotes through extreme sequence divergence following          a duplication of the DDRP  subunit An alternative          scenario holds that the RDRPs are ancient enzymes that          diverged from the evolutionary precursor of DDRP at a          very early preLUCA stage of evolution albeit after the          duplication that led to the differentiation of the  and           versions of the DPBB domain In fact it appears          likely that the ancestral protein RNA polymerase at the          time of the differentiation of the type and type          DPBB domains functioned as an RDRP because DNA probably          had not evolved by that stage     The switch of the          ancestral enzyme to the DDRP activity and the emergence          of the evolutionary precursor of RDRP might be          tentatively linked to one another and associated with the          advent of DNA This view of the evolutionary history of          RDRPs is compatible with the presence of RDRP homologs in          phages and with their role in replicating microRNAs          potential relics of the RNA world during PTGS in          eukaryotes Subsequently this enzyme apparently has been          expunged from the cellular RNA synthesis systems and          survived only in some parasitic elements such as          bacteriophages through which it might have been          reintroduced into the genome of an ancestral eukaryote          This scenario shows parallels to the probable          evolutionary history of another major unrelated class of          polymerases the RDRPs and reverse transcriptases          containing the palm domain Among extant biological          entities these polymerases are encoded largely by RNA          viruses and retroid viruses but a reverse transcriptase          had been recruited by eukaryotes as the catalytic subunit          of the telomerase      There seems to be a          distinct possibility that both classes of RDRPs are          vestiges of the ancient RNA world that have been largely          displaced from cellular biochemical machinery at an early          stage of evolution because of the deleterious effects of          RNA replication in DNAbased organisms while surviving          in selfish genetic elements                            Material and Methods        The nonredundant NR database of protein sequences        National Center for Biotechnology Information NIH        Bethesda was searched
