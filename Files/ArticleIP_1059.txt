                                 Selling Land to Jews            Last week a yearoldPalestinian realestate dealer was murdered after he violated a new edict bythe Palestinian Authority making the sale of Arabowned land to Jews a capitalcrime The issue of land sales has a long history as a subtheme of theJewishArab struggle            The th century Jewish intellectuals who conceived ofZionism the idea that Jewish survival depends on the establishment of aJewish state in the biblical land of Israelnever worked out their ideologyslogistics Jewish settlement in Palestine then part of the decaying OttomanEmpire only proceeded piecemeal In the s and s about  Jewsimmigrated to Palestine Most integrated into multiethnic communities in thecities of Jaffa Tiberias and Jerusalem A second wave of  immigrantscame between  and  many of whom were Labor Zionists who wanted theJewish state to be socialist Extolling the virtues of manual labor theyacquired huge tracts of farmland from absentee Syrian and Lebanese landlordsThe New Palestinian Jew  they said needed to be physically tougherthan the brainy shopkeepers who had been trampled in Europe            The Jewish National Fund was founded in  for thepurpose of buying up land from Arabs After the Ottoman Empires defeatin World War I Britain acquired Palestine and promised in the BalfourDeclaration the creation of a Jewish state In anticipation Jews in Palestinebegan laying the groundwork for a greater sense of national identity TheJewish National Funds charter was amended to mandate that Jewish land couldnever be resold to Arabs or opened to nonJewish employees            FollowingJewish National Fund guidelines farmers evicted Palestinian peasants living onthe newly acquired plots The total number displaced was small By  Jewsowned only  percent of Palestine but the perceived threat of displacement waswidespread among Arabs Starting around  Arab newspapers railed againstJewish land acquisition Among the peasantry rumors spread alleging anAngloJewish conspiracy to remove Muslims from Palestine Anxious to avoidbeing blamed for Palestinian landlessness British officials began imposingtoken restrictions on Jewish land purchase in  They publicly supportedArab complaints that Jews were driving Arabs off the land            Palestinians say evictions destroyedtheir way of life forcing them to move from rural Palestine to crowded citiesin search of work They also say that the bettereducated Jewish buyers hadduped illiterate peasants into selling property            The ArabNational Fund created in  by wealthy Arab families to purchase land fordisplaced peasants was ineffective During the s Palestinian responsesturned violent  In  Jerusalems mufti the spiritual leader of thecitys Muslims decreed that believers were duty bound to murder other Muslimswho sold land to Jews Arabs who outnumbered Jews by more than torevolted against Jewish land acquisition and British promises of Jewishnationhood About  Arabs and several hundred Jews were killed in riots andguerrilla attacks between  and             Zionists argued that the land purchases benefited all theterritorys residents Jewish immigrants introduced modern agriculturaltechnology  which increased productivity and helped fill the markets withfood to feed the growing Arab population Zionists also maintain that Jewsbecame a lucrative market for Arabmanufactured goods            Somehistorians trace Palestinian landlessness to Palestines entry into theworld economy in the s Urban commerce drew some peasants from theirfamily farms Other subsistence farmers found themselves competing withcashcrop entrepreneurs Jews and Arabs whose successes changed the face ofPalestinian agriculture Jewish land purchases were not the primary factorthese historians say            Very little of the land owned today byindividual Jews and the Israeli government was acquired by purchase Jewishsovereignty and ownership were established the way these things usually are bywar Israel confiscated all land owned by the British government mostly desertand mountains after the  War of Independence  Property owned byArab refugees who either fled war zones or were forced from their homes by theIsraeli army another longstanding controversy was also taken over byindividual Jews or confiscated by the government Many Palestinians howeverstayed put retained their land and became Israeli citizens            A newschool of Jewish historians is more critical of the dislocations caused byJewish land acquisition and concludes that it was not always fair One populartheory compares Zionisms imperative to acquire land to the American idea ofManifest Destiny that it was the United States Godgiven right to rulefrom coast to coast Others argue that it was a mistake for the JewishNational Fund to prohibit nonJewish laborers from the newly purchased landsHowever even these revisionists agree that the Jews had not intended to evictMuslims from Palestine            Israeli security officials believed that the murderedrealestate dealer was executed by plainclothes Palestinian Authoritypolice The Palestinian Authoritys decision to make the sale of land to Jews acapital crime reflects Palestinian frustration with Israeli land usespecifically the creation of a new Jewish neighborhood now underconstruction in East Jerusalem            In the past deaththreats have done little to deter sales of land According to British landrecords the Jerusalem muftis  decree failed to prevent sales But thatdecree did not have the power of civil law behind it Nevertheless theincentives to sell at the market price are substantial and if the threatscreate new scarcities higher prices will probably encourage sellers to unloadtheir land
