                                 Floaters            Is there anything lesscinematic than a lengthy swatch of voiceover prose recited straight from thepages of a yearold novel with the camera yoked to an actresss face Wellactually yes about a million things car chases ocean liners taking onwater when the words are Virginia Woolfs and the face is Vanessa RedgravesIn the last halfhour of Marleen Gorris film of Mrs Dalloway  Woolfsrhapsodic prose and Redgraves radiant countenance combine for some of the mosttranscendentally beautiful cinema I have ever seen            Before Igo nuts with the superlatives let me add that the previous hour of MrsDalloway is pretty spotty The novel published in  standsshoulderhigh to Woolfs next book To the Lighthouse which is to sayto one of the dozen greatest novels written after World War I Its almostentirely interior set behind the eyes of a handful of uppercrust Londonerswith point of view slipped like a baton from one character to the next How doyou adapt it for a medium as surfaceoriented as the movies The book is somusical in its ebb and flow that it might lend itself best to a chamber operaconsisting entirely of interwoven solosmonodramas seen and heard by theaudience no one else            Gorriswho is Dutch and whose previous works include therabid A Question of Silence  and the Oscarwinning AntoniasLine doesnt get all the notes right but at least she gets thatthere ought to be notes that the work is fundamentally musical and that themusic shivers with nostalgia            For muchof the first hour Redgraves Clarissa Dalloway drifts around a sunnypostWorld War I London talking excitedly of a party to take place at her homethat evening exchanging formal pleasantries with various aristocrats andmoving in and out of her memories We move with her back before the war asthe young Clarissa Natascha McElhone lazes elegantly on a vast estateromping with her saucy and politically progressive friend Sally Seton LenaHeadey and putting up with Peter Walsh Alan Cox a misanthropic but palpablysmitten suitor Then she meets the bland proper Richard Dalloway RobertPortal and in choosing to marry him goes where she has been bred to goandwhere she will be safest The very title of the work is tinged with regretsince its protagonist is presented to us not as lighthearted Clarissa but asthe older Dalloways somewhat shrinking sickly missus Its odd that Gorriswhose other films are so flagrantlyeven homicidallyfeminist should put somuch more emphasis on Clarissas rejection of Peter when Woolf gives equal ifnot stronger weight to her inchoate romantic feelings for the vivaciousSally            Woolf provides a nightmarish echo to MrsDalloway in Septimus Warren Smith Rupert Graves an exsoldier who has hadthe misfortune of witnessing a buddy being blown to bits in front of his eyesHe now slips in and out of lucidity before his despairing Italianborn wifeRezia Amelia Bullmore like Clarissa he is haunted by the lack of permanencein all things Mrs Dalloway and Septimus never meet but Gorris brings them insight of each other at the start of the film and news of Septimus fatetriggers Mrs Dalloways tortured and then euphoric final musingsthe epiphanythat brings the movie to its poetic conclusion            Untilthen the doings have been awfully prosy Mrs Dalloways flashbacks are of theMasterpiece Theatre variety when they ought to have been less objectivemore impressionistic even if such doodling had come at the expense of afullbore narrative thrust Woolf herself is always losing the pulse of thenarrativewhich is perhaps the whole point Eileen Atkins the Englishactress who adapted Mrs Dalloway as a labor or labour of love hasdone almost too smooth a job of translating its charactersstreamofconsciousness perceptions into speakable dialogue Better I thinkto have left some bleeding fragments If ever a project called for acombination writerdirectora writer who would confidently leave thingsunwritten secure in the knowledge that he or she would as director fill itall inits Mrs Dalloway             As Gorris weaves together past and present often movingback and forth several times in a single scene she aims for a meltingfluidity But her images refuse to melt Her passthebaton shifts in point ofview come off as fancy but not especially resonant When the camera lingers onMrs Dalloways daughter Elizabeth Katie Carr as she sits on the top of adoubledecker bus the girls face is blank and the moment empty of meaningWhy have we followed Elizabeth onto this bus I half expected it to flattensome poor Tolstoyesque peasant It turns out that we stay with her so she cangaze in passing at an apartment houseso that the camera can travel up toand through a window and come upon Septimus supine on a sofacontemplatingwhat Read the book to learn what hes thinking and feelingbecause all Gorris gives us is a guy grimacing on a couch and a lot of distantexplosions to signal his flashbacks            It isGraves who suffers most from the lack of imagination The traumatizedflashbackridden veteran was a novel figure when Mrs Dalloway waswrittenand something of a mascot for the postwar modernist literature thatfollowed Now after decades of watching sweaty Vietnam vets sitting boltupright in bed after acidsoaked nightmares of their buddies gettingdisemboweled moviegoers regard such characters as so much Freudian chin musicIn the book what goes through Septimus head retains its power to startlenotso much for what he remembers as for how his remembrances color the present andpierce its surface like an Xray The movies Septimus never seems more than aliterary conceit and only in his fleeting moments of sanity does Gravesacquire a mordant poignancy            It should be said that Redgrave in addition tobeing too old for Mrs Dalloway is too tall she looms over her husband andtoo forceful All of which means of course diddly squat It barely mattersthat the books characters have been aged from their s to their s toaccommodate her because what else do you do when you have a shot at castingthe greatest actress in the world Even silent Redgrave is plangent aquivering string Pity the poor actress who has to embody her earlier selfMcElhone is a handsome young woman with the demeanor of an Irish milkmaidnotso much unformed as opaque Theres a thin line between period acting andoveracting and more than once McElhone drifts over it            With theexception of Bullmores ghastly Rezia her accent is pathetic the rest of theactors are treasurable Michael Kitchen as old Peter Walsh who melds soperfectly with Alan Cox the young Walsh that I wondered if Gorris had gothold of a time machine and used the same actor twice Selina Cadellsroughhewed missionary Miss Kilman Sarah Badels stout and effulgent LadyRosseter the aged Sally Seton Oliver Ford Davies lockjawed twit HughWhitbread John Standings anxiously settled older Dalloway and the lyricallyfoolish Lady Bruton of Margaret Tyzack full of liberal schemes for helping theunemployed by shipping them off to Canada            But it is Redgrave to whom we return In the lasthalfhour at the party we are finally allowed to hear Mrs Dallowaysthoughts Why couldnt there have been voiceovers all along As Redgravemoves from person to personworrying about what each is really thinking andabout the young man whose tragic fate she heard tell of from one of hergueststhe movie floods with feeling As potent as one of Beethovens laststring quartets Mrs Dalloway becomes a heartbreaking meditation on theevanescence of all things And like Clarissa herself I didnt want the partyto end Ill see the film again for the last sequence alone anything to stareat Redgraves face once more to hear her say You want to say to each momentStay Stay Stay
