                    Background        The excimer laser ablation is currently widely used        primarily to correct refractive errors by altering the        anterior curvature of the cornea Due to its potential for        accurate ablation of anterior stromal corneal lesions its        initial clinical utilization was removal of diseased        corneal tissue in a procedure called photo therapeutic        keratectomy PTK In  Serdareviz et al proposed the        first therapeutic use of the excimer laser to treat an        experimental Candida infectious keratitis     Despite        the lack of controlled clinical trials comparing PTK with        other treatment modalities such as superficial keratectomy        or lamellar keratoplasty the US Food and Drug        Administration FDA identified PTK as an alternative        therapeutic approach for the treatment of superficial        corneal and epithelial membrane dystrophies irregular        corneal surfaces and corneal scars and opacities        The major inherent obstacle of PTK for the management of        corneal surface irregularities is that through        photoablation these irregularities are reproduced deeper        within the stroma        Masking techniques refer to photorefractive procedures        utilizing various masking means or so called modulators to        protect flatter corneal areas while steeper areas are        excised with the excimer laser        Kornmehl et al    have shown that an ideal masking        agent should have moderate viscosity between that of        saline and  carboxymethylcellulose and concluded that        very viscous fluids would not cover irregular surfaces        uniformly whereas fluids of inadequate viscosity would run        off quickly exposing both peaks and valleys thus resulting        in irregular surfaces after ablation        Numerous previous investigators have used different        masking agents as methylcellulose       and sodium        hyaluronate      at various concentrations or        performed transepithelial so that the epithelium acts as a        natural masking agent treatments       and reported        the beneficial effect of masked PTK Fasano et al           reported that the ideal masking agent should have the same        ablation rate to that of the cornea be biocompatible and        adhere well to the cornea        These properties have been met with the use of collagen        solutions as modulators Their applicability as masking        agents for corneal photoablation was examined in        experimental models of animal and cadaver eyes Scott et        al Collagen modulator fluids for use during photoablation        keratectomy ARVO  Margaritis et al Properties of a        new two component gel material as an aid in PRK corneal        remodeling ARVO       as well as in limited        clinical trials of partially sighted eyes Pallikaris et        al Photoablated lenticular modulator PALM technique A        report of ten cases ARVO              PhotoAblatable Lenticular Modulator PALM technique        refers to the use of a modified collagen gel solution for        the photorefractive correction of corneal surface        irregularities     The PALM gel similarly to other        collagen modulators      is thermo reversible The        gel is in liquid state when heated to solidify to a firm        gel as its temperature lowers Its use for masking purposes        requires its application onto the corneal stoma at a        temperature of C where it can be molded to form a stable        lenticule that serves as the final masking agent        At temperatures of  to C the collagen individual        fibril bonds are broken and the collagen denatures to its        parent gelatinous form When the tissue temperature drops        to below C these bonds can reunite with possible        rearrangement of the matrix but without any cellular damage            Under this consideration the thermal contact of        the C preheated PALM gel onto the bare corneal stroma        for the in situ molding of the lenticule would not be        expected to induce any irreversible changes of the corneal        collagen chains However its sequential use as masking        agent for PTK could affect the lasertissue interaction and        probably the corneal healing response to irradiation        In the current study we examined the possible        implication of the PALM gel when used as described above        to the corneal wound healing on rabbit corneas        We examined the reepithelization process of  rabbit        eyes after PTK through PALM gel lenticules formed in situ        We used a moving slit delivery system in a  mm ablation        zone confined by means of a metal iris diaphragm An equal        group of rabbit eyes received conventional PTK of the same        depth and treatment zone and served as control                    Methods                  The PALM gel as a masking agent          The gel used as modulator is a soluble mixture of          purified type A gelatin from porcine skin and a          polysaccharide type III carrageenan K in nanopure water              Both components are commercially available for          laboratory use Sigma Chemical Co St Louis Mo          Being thermoreversible the gel can be stored at room          temperature in solid form When heated to C it          liquefies to a high viscosity fluid that solidifies          within minutes when exposed to room temperature When          still in liquid form the gel can be molded by means of a          rigid contact lens to form a stable lenticule that its          upper surface will reproduce the inner surface of the          molding lens          If the lenticule is molded in situ onto the cornea its          bottom surface will fill any corneal surface          irregularity As shown by testing on freshly excised          porcine corneas fig  the mixture for the preparation          of the gel is conditioned so that its solid form to have          the same ablation to that of the cornea     The full          removal of the lenticule with photoablation in PTK mode          would be expected to reproduce the lenticules upper          surface onto the surface of the cornea Selecting the          appropriate inner radius of curvature of the molding          lens the upper surface of the formed lenticule can be of          variable curvature Instillation of  m of the          preheated liquid solution    on the corneal surface          requires  minutes for the lenticule to acquire the          mechanical stiffness required to withstand the stress          induced by the lens removal at room temperature of C          After this time the lens mold is removed and the          lenticule is ablated through with irradiation in PTK          mode An effective amount of fluorescein in the lenticule          mixture provides the surgeon visual feedback for the          ablation progress Fluorescence fades as soon as the          lenticule is fully removed                          Surgical procedure          A total of  adult New Zealand white rabbits average          weight  Kg were anaesthetized by intramuscular          injection of ketamine hydrochloride  mgkg and          xylazine hydrochloride  mgkg mixture All          experimental procedures were carried out in accordance          with the Guiding Principles in the Care and Use of          Animals DHEW Publication NIH  and were approved          from the Universitys of Crete ethics committee          One drop of  proparacaine hydrochloride Alcon Ft          Worth TX was instilled into each eye and the corneas          were deepithelized with the use of a rotating brush We          treated one eye of each animal  were treated with PTK          through PALM gel experimental eyes and the remaining           received conventional treatment and served as controls          The laser system used in all eyes was the Aesculap          Meditec Mel  KarlZeiss Jena Germany with laser          fluence of  mJcm pulse rate at  Hz in PTK          mode          Experimental eyes received PTK through PALM gel          lenticules formed in situ onto deepithelized corneas as          described above In order to shorten the time of the          surgical procedures we obtained the thinner possible          lenticules using as molds the best fitting contact          lenses for each operative eye Molds used in the current          study had inner radii of curvature ranging from  to           mm After the removal of the mold an iris diaphragm          having an inner aperture of  mm was centrated over the          pupil onto the upper surface of the lenticule to define          the ablation zone The gel lenticules were ablated          through with irradiation in PTK mode As soon as          fluorescence faded each experimental eye received an          additional micron deep PTK          The control eyes were submitted to a phototherapeutic          keratectomy of  mm diameter ablation zone confined by          the same iris diaphragm depth of  m on          deepithelised cornea without the use of any masking          agent                          Postoperative care          Postoperative treatment of all treated eyes included          daily application of combined tobramycin           dexamethasone  ointment Alcon Ft Worth TX until          reepithelisation was complete No topical steroids were          used subsequently in the study          The reepithelization process was examined daily with          staining of the epithelial defect area using           fluorescein dye and a hand held slitlamp Corneal          clarity was recorded using a predetermined scale          grading of haze              Two animals of each group experimental and control          were sacrificed with an overdose of penthobarbital sodium          through the marginal ear vein at each of the following          postoperative intervals immediately after treatment           hours after treatment  week and at one three and six          postoperative months                          Histology processing          Immediately after enucleation the eyes were fixed          using  gludaraldehyde in  moll cacodylate buffer          pH  After short prefixation the corneas were          excised and placed in the same fresh fixative overnight          The tissue samples were post fixated in  osmium          tetroxide in  M cacodylate buffer Ph  for  hours          at C dehydrated in a series of alcohol and propylene          oxide and embedded in epoxy resin          m sections were stained with trichrome stain and          were processed for light microscopic examination whereas          ultra thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and          lead citrate and were examined with transmit ion electron          microscopy                            Results                  Clinical course          Reepithelisation was complete no epithelial defect          was observed with fluorescein staining within five days          in all treated eyes within  days in two control and one          experimental eye  days in three experimental and one          control eye and on the fifth postoperative day to the          rest of the treated eyes No persistent defects or          recurrent erosions were recorded          Corneal haze was evident from the first week in all          treated eyes ranging from grade  to grade           Corneal haze reached its maximum on the first          postoperative month ranging from grade  to  grade  in          one experimental eye          All treated eyes were clear or had minimal haze by the          third month grade  in one experimental and two control          eyes which was resolved in all eyes by the sixth          postoperative month                          Histology          In the specimens taken immediately after treatment          the surface of corneal stroma was covered by a          pseudomembrane typical after excimer laser The control          group didnt demonstrate any difference in pseudomembrane          thickness or regularity in comparison to the experiment          The most typical corneal morphology is demonstrated in          fig  The appearance of collagen fibrils and stromal          keratocytes was close to normal in both groups of          specimens           hours after irradiation the distribution of          collagen fibers under the ablated area was irregular due          to the occurrence of corneal edema Isolated macrophages          were observed on the stromal surface Keratocytes          situated within the  m of the upper stroma          demonstrated various pathological changes including          cytoplasm vacuolization and blebbing with formation of          cellular fragments fig  Keratocytes located deeper          than  m under ablated stromal surface did not          demonstrate any noticeable morphological alterations We          observed no differences in the type degree and extent of          the pathological changes of keratocytes under the ablated          surface between the control and experimental specimens          In the endothelial corneal layer both inside and outside          the ablation area we didnt observe any morphological          abnormalities neither in the experimental nor in the          control groups The nuclear chromatin abundant          mitochondria reticulum and coated vesicles had normal          appearance The cells preserved their apical junctional          complexes and well developed intercellular gap          junctions          In the specimens obtained  week after the procedure          the epithelium covering the stroma in the ablated zone          demonstrated mild hyperplasia The typical desmosomal          contacts between the basal cells which are very          characteristic for the intact stromal epithelium were          rather rare fig  However adhesive contacts with          significant resemblance with zonula adherens were          observed The morphological appearance of the          regenerating basement membrane that was removed during          the procedure corresponded to the initial phases of its          reconstruction formation of characteristic amorphous          layer of extracellular matrix was evident in some contact          zones of the epithelial cells with stroma In some places          this layer had focal discontinuities or duplication          Typical hemidesmosomes were not present However few          small sized hemidesmosomes with low electron density of          cytoplasmic plaque were observed The presence of these          immature hemidesmosomes was considered as an evidence of          adhesive contacts reconstruction between the epithelium          and the basement membrane At this stage inflammatory          cells infiltration was rarely observed in all obtained          specimens The anterior stroma beneath the treatment zone          consisted of newly synthesized extracellular matrix with          collagen fibers of irregular size and distribution as          well as few amorphous inclusions and empty spaces          giving this layer a foamy appearance The thickness of          this locally discontinued foam layer did not exceed           m The corneal endothelium of the  week specimens of          both groups had normal appearance A discontinuous layer          of an electron dense substance was observed beneath the          boarder between the endothelial layer and Descemets          membrane fig           One month postoperatively no epithelial          irregularities were observed fig  The desmosomes          between epithelial cells as well as the hemidesmosomes          between the basal epithelial cells and the basal lamina          were more frequently observed and although irregularly          distributed their morphology was close to the normal          structure of contacts of the intact epithelium The          irregular distribution of hemidesmosomes can be justified          by their concurrent reconstruction with the basal lamina          formation The thickness of the foam layer mostly          consisted of activated fibroblasts achieved its maximum           m by this interval The deeper corneal layers          demonstrated exquisitely regular structure fig           Three months postoperatively the epithelium covering          the ablation zone exceeded normal thickness only in very          few locations fig  The morphology of epithelial          cells the number of layers and the intercellular          contacts were close to normal The structure of the          epithelial basal lamina was also appeared close to          normal lamina densa and lamina lucida were well          distinguishable with rare branching and duplication The          hemidesmosomes were regularly distributed and had normal          morphology The thin  m layer of anterior stroma          beneath the treatment zone was close to normal with rare          exceptions of aggregations of electron dense substance          few irregularly located collagen fibres with small          variations of their diameter fig  The deeper stromal          layers had normal architecture with no signs of          scarring inflammatory infiltration or deformation          neither in the experimental nor in the control          specimens          Six months postoperatively we didnt find any          significant morphological difference compared to the          threemonth interval obtained specimens neither in the          experimental nor in the control group                            Discussion        Application of a heated agent on denuded cornea or even        ablation through a chemical agent could affect lasertissue        interaction corneal reepithelization or stromal healing        response after photo ablation        We used rabbits to examine the probable effect of the        PALM gel if used as a masking agent for PTK since stromal        healing is very similar in rabbits and humans            The healing course proved similar in the experimental        and control eyes No specimens obtained at any        postoperative interval had any sign of necrosis or        macrophages infiltration        The simultaneous reepithelization as well as the similar        histological findings between experimental specimens and        controls is indicative of negligible gels impact on        corneal healing response The newly synthesized        extracellular matrix presented as foam layer at the early        specimens is a common finding reported after photo        refractive keratectomy or even simple epithelial scrape        injury in a number of previous studies       and        is supposed to manifest the healing response of rabbit        corneas              The epithelial hyperplasia observed on the seventh        postoperative day was more intense than that reported in        the literature       The possibility of the gels        implication to this response is minimized since it was also        observed in the control eyes We assume that this finding        is related to the ablation profile of our treatments a        rather deep keratectomy with sharp edges which would        justify an intense epithelial healing response            The extrusion of electron dense fibrogranular material        into the descemets membrane is also a common finding        observed in a number of previous studies               and has been attributed to acoustic shock waves by        irradiation    or the distraction of the epithelial        integrity after trauma     The presence of this        finding in only one of our specimens may be related to the        homogenous and smooth removal of the corneal epithelium        with the rotating brush        In conclusion the use of the PALM gel did not seem to        seriously affect the healing process after PTK on rabbit        corneas as compared to controls A larger number of animals        would allow for statistical analysis of pathologic findings        such as activated fibroblasts by depth and thickness of        newly formed extracellular matrix between experimental and        control eyes Furthermore tenascin and fibronectin        staining of the specimens would allow for better        understanding of the corneal healing process        The use of new generation laser systems that offer        phototherapeutic ablation mode with transition zones are        expected to minimize epithelial hyperplasia and corneal        stroma healing response The major remaining drawback of        the PALM as well as of similar PTK techniques    in        order to obtain an optimal refractive result is the        accurate centration and placement of the molding lens for        the proper formation of the lenticule before        irradiation                    Competing Interests
