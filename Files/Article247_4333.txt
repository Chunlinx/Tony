                                 Flag Football            A few observations about tonights debate in Columbia SC as viewed ontelevision from New York City                           Nobody laid a glove on George W who is increasingly comfortable at theseevents and seemed in complete control of his opponents throughout the eveningBut Bush acquitted himself poorly nonetheless by once again shirking anopportunity to stand up to ugliness in his own party                                        Bush first gave a pass to conservative bigotry several months ago when hewas unwilling to say that Pat Buchanan didnt belong in the GOP He did it morerecently when he declined to meet with the an organization of gay Republicansbecause he didnt want to be a divider And he was at it once again tonightwhen in response to repeated questions from Brian Williams of NBC he refusedto criticize the flying of the Confederate flag over the state capitol inColumbia SC In response to Williams request for his personal opinion aboutthe flag Bush just kept reiterating that he thought it was up to the peopleof South Carolina to decide               This was a craven spineless response If Bush had any guts he would saywhat Id bet he really believes which is that while it may be up to the peopleof South Carolina to decide the issue he is personally offended when he sees asymbol of segregation flying over a public building If he wanted to be politicabout it Bush could have said that while he doesnt believe that the flag isintended as a racist symbol it is hurtful and divisive to many Americans andshould be hauled down for that reason               In the short run criticizing the flag might have led to Bush getting conkedon the head with one of the Bud Light cans visible on the tables where a largeand rowdy audience sat baying for red meat on guns gays and gambling Butultimately I think that finding some way to indicate disagreement with thisunattractive mob would have been both the honorable and the politically shrewdthing for Bush to do Bush will almost certainly win the GOP nomination Thatmeans he should be thinking beyond the nomination If he wins it with histolerant principles held high he will be in a far stronger position inrelation to the eventual Democratic nominee Much hinges on Bushs attempt tocleanse his party of bigotry and reposition it closer to the center It oughtto be obvious to him that pandering to the revanchist sentiments of a roomfulof boisterous white Southernerson national televisionundermines thateffort                                        It was almost funny that just after Bushs pathetic answer Steve Forbesput a question to Gary Bauer that accused Al Gores black campaign managerDonna Brazile of being a racist for criticizing Colin Powell and JC Watts inthe course of suggesting that the Republican Party doesnt really care aboutblacks Bauer responded that he shared Forbes outrage at the way the Democratshave long tried to smear our party with accusations of racism The complaintabout Brazile might have carried more credence at an event where the entireRepublican primary field wasnt so actively sucking up to conventionalwhiteonblack racist sentiment                                       John McCain turned in what I thought was his worst debate performance todate In place of the good nature and quick wit he has shown in all the pasthe was anxious defensive and far from lucid Of course it probably didnthelp that the first question Williams put to him was about another letter hesent to the FCC on behalf of a big campaign contributor McCain tried to changethe subject back to the faults in Bushs tax plan George the America peopleare tired of people who make promises about tax cuts they cant keep he saidBut the fact that McCains integrity has been called into question made hisaspersions against Bushs honesty look churlish                                       McCains nadir came when Bush cleverly asked Orrin Hatch to explain whyRepublicans oppose McCains campaignfinancereform plan Hatch zinged McCainby saying his Arizona colleague was starting to sound like an accordion playerwho only knows one tuneLady of Spain  Apparently unsettled by thiseffective onetwo punch McCain responded with a rambling compendium of hismost familiar lines on the subject of campaign finance reform culminating inhis repetition of his not very funny joke from last night about how Bush shouldget a better picture of McCain for the attack ads running in New Hampshirewhich arent in fact connected to the Bush campaign               With his strongest ally the press suddenly turned hostile McCain isclearly struggling Luckily theres an easy way for him to win back theaffection of the news media All he has to do is call a press conference beforehe leaves South Carolina and in no uncertain terms denounce the Confederateflag
