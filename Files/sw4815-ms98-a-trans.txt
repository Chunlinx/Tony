        okay uh okay so our subject is nursing homes um do you have any experience or any uh opinions on what to do i do     i do have actually as a matter of fact uh and im im not sure how it would relate to the big city but there are certainly ways and humane and and nice ways of handling care for our elderly i come from a very small community in northern Iowa and the churches have banded together and built and staffed a retirement home   umhum thats wonderful   and the care of course is is wonderful because these are all people who care   umhum   and every week the churches a different uh groups of the churches volunteer and come in and maybe have bingo day or special celebration day or help someone with their birthday or whatever and it makes the care very personalized of course but since it is a small community everybody knows everybody and so there there would be no absolutely zero chance of any abuse   umhum umhum thats great because uh you know i think that is probably a persons greatest fear and im not faced with this yet but my mother is seventy three shes in good health and living by herself but um ill probably be faced with this you know sometime in the next few years as to what to do when mom gets to the point that she cant take care of herself um unfortunately having her come live with us you know if she needs constant care is not going to be an option and what do you do you know   yeah its its a real problem um it is a real problem and i know that everybody hates the idea of going to one of these but i also think that it is a choice that we have all made in our lives as we have drawn back and internalized ourselves as opposed to being a part of the community   umhum   uh it used to be that neighbors looked out for you the churches looked out for you but many of us dont belong to churches any more   umhum   and so therefore we dont have this broadened community of caring people   and we dont have the nuclear family that we used to have many many years ago either   no no absolutely not you know i presume when when the time comes for something to happen to me that i will probably go back to Iowa to be in that community but uh   well its good that you know that you have that option available um that because i dont think that too many communities have something like that set up   but its the type of thing where i think we should look at some things that are working and try to use them in the cities also   umhum   i mean is there some reason why some of the churches here could not band together and do a similar situation   probably not um and it might even be easier here in that there are so many more churches available more people to draw from   yes and actually a great deal more money   well yes thats for certain my my mom lives in a small town also and i know you know the funds just arent available uh to do something in a small town that you have that you can do in a larger town but um uh you know other than care conditions you know i dont know really what else a person looks for uh convenience for the family would be a a wonderful thing uh but thats thats you know thats not always an option either   right but you know if my family if all of my kids still live here and i go back to Iowa course there is no convenience so probably it would behoove me  to try to start something of this sort here in Dallas   umhum   but uh thats a big job you know uh so many needs are crying the homeless the abused children the the beaten wives you know theres so many things going on that that how do we all of this and maybe thats a part of it maybe maybe what we can do is uh of course this is kind of a far flung situation but uh you know theyre talking about work fare now in uh Wisconsin i believe it is but is there some reason i wonder why we couldnt have some of these people involved in nursing homes     umhum is that   so that they didnt have to be so expensive you know if you if youve got somebody who is drawing welfare then perhaps that can be quote part of their their payment for their welfare payments   umhum well and i think that would be a good idea too i dont know if these people need it for selfesteem it would seem to me that they would but if nothing else yes let them earn some of their money   yeah because part of the problem now is that  it costs so much money to get into a convalescent home or or an aged home   umhum   you know its almost prohibited for many persons and uh you know so what do you do does someone go on welfare in order to get in one of those homes or does somebody in the family quit their job so that they can be at home and and but of course thats not always wonderful either because somebody with Alzheimers needs twenty four hour watching and nobody can do that   umhum thats right thats right i well i guess thats probably as people get older for   nobody can do that
