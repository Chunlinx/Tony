                    Background        Normal wound healing requires fibroblast proliferation        and migration into the wound bed followed by tightly        regulated matrix deposition and contraction Aberrations in        these processes can lead to excessive collagen accumulation        as found in keloids These scars extend beyond the original        wound margins and are excluded from glabrous surfaces        palms soles When grown in vitro keloid fibroblast        cultures contain a high percentage of smooth muscle actin        SMA expressing cells  myofibroblasts In spite of        numerous studies the etiology of keloid formation remains        obscure               However as TGF        regulates the expression and deposition of collagenous        extracellular matrix ECM      it is expected that        keloids develop due to aberrant responses to this cytokine        While in vitro analyses of TGF levels in keloid and        normal fibroblasts have yielded variable results                 higher levels of TGF receptors and Smad        activation were recently reported in keloid fibroblasts            Thus procedures that lower TGF expression may        help prevent keloid development               TGF also supports the differentiation of fibroblasts        into myofibroblasts which are a major constituent of the        granulation tissue      The process depends upon the        deformability of the ECM     and is mediated by the        EDA splice variant of fibronectin      EDA        fibronectin is expressed in the initial stages of wound        healing and along with collagen I is positively regulated        by TGF            Progression of granulation tissue to neodermis requires        a decrease in cellularity through apoptosis of endothelial        cells fibroblasts and myofibroblasts      Keloid        fibroblasts demonstrate aberrant apoptotic behavior            although studies have given variable results                    Our initial data for        serumstarvationinduced apoptosis in monolayer cultures of        dermal fibroblasts demonstrated delayed apoptosis of keloid        fibroblasts and a negative correlation with SMA        expression     Similar correlations were observed in        rat lung fibroblasts where TGF increased SMA content        while acting as an antiapoptotic agent      It        should be noted however that many of the myofibroblasts        were still able to undergo apoptosis consistent with in        vivo data on palatal wound healing     Thus TGF can        promote both SMA expression in the initial stages of        wound healing and apoptosis in later stages of wound        healing The latter effect may be related to the apoptosis        induced by relaxation of the ECM or of the collagen gel                    In order to follow both the differentiation of        fibroblasts into myofibroblasts and their apoptosis in        relation to the tension in the surrounding ECM we utilized        twocolor FACS analyses Experiments were carried out with        human dermal fibroblasts of different origins  keloid        nonaffected palmar sites of the corresponding patients        normal fibroblasts from palms heels or nonpalmoplantar        sites SMA content and apoptosis were evaluated as a        function of serum TGF and collagen type I The observed        phenotypic differences between fibroblasts grown from        glabrous vs nonglabrous tissue suggest a reason for the        exclusion of keloids from specific body sites of keloid        prone

experiments with fibroblasts from two keloid prone          individuals labeled as keloid D and keloid T as well          as with fibroblasts from one nonaffected individual          Similar results not presented here were found with          fibroblasts from other keloid donors and nonaffected          individuals                            Results and Discussion                  Growth rates and morphologic characteristics of          palmoplantar and nonpalmoplantar fibroblasts          The proliferation of preconfluent fibroblasts grown on          tissue culture plastic was measured as a function of          Hthymidine incorporation into TCAprecipitates As          shown in Fig  fibroblasts derived either from the          palmar skin of keloidforming donors or the plantar skin          of nonaffected donors incorporated more Hthymidine          than did those isolated from keloid or normal nonglabrous          trunk skin This apparent difference in proliferation          rate is consistent with the microscopic observation data          not shown that palmoplantar PP fibroblasts reached          confluence  days earlier than did the nonpalmoplantar          nonPP cultures when plated at the same density          Earlier work from other laboratories had indicated that          normal fibroblasts grew more quickly     similarly              or more slowly     than did keloid          fibroblasts Such variations may reflect differences in          culture conditions at the time of assay For example in          confluent cultures the growth rate of PP fibroblasts          slows to less than that of nonPP fibroblasts results          not shown          As shown in Fig Aand B PP cultures can also be          distinguished by a paucity of fibroblasts with high          granularity side scattering a characteristic often          associated with the elaboration of RER rough endoplasmic          reticulum     In both confluent and postconfluent          cultures the populations of cells with the highest          granularity were found in the nonPP isolates keloid and          nonplantar The differences in proliferation rate and          granularity predict and are consistent with differences          in protein expression      below Palmar but not          plantar isolates were also found to have smaller cell          size judged by forward scattering Fig ABand light          microscopy data not shown                          TGF receptor and EDA fibronectin in palmoplantar          and nonpalmoplantar fibroblasts          Earlier work demonstrated that palmoplantar          fibroblasts express less SMA than do keloid or to a          lesser extent normal nonpalmoplantar fibroblasts              As TGF is a positive regulator of SMA these          observations could reflect the relative levels of active          TGF or the levels of those proteins responsible for the          transduction of its signal We therefore measured the          expression of SMA together with of the expression of          those proteins participating in the initial signal          transduction event TGF its type II receptor          TGFRII and EDA fibronectin No consistent          differences were detected in the levels of intracellular          or secreted latent or active TGF data not shown          However as shown in Figs for FACS analysis examples          please see additional file  Additional data ppt          the expression of both TGFRII and EDA fibronectin was          lower in PP cultures than in nonPP cultures In contrast          to previous reports     the level of TGFRII in          keloid fibroblast cultures was similar to that in plantar          cultures or even lower than that of normal nonplantar          fibroblast cultures  Fig  SMA content correlated          most closely with the levels of EDA fibronectin Fig           For keloid fibroblasts the size and granularity of          the SMA expressing cells was similar to those          expressing EDA fibronectin rather than TGFRII not          shown please see additional file  Additional data          ppt Cells with the highest granularity expressed          TGFRII while cells with medium granularity had high          levels of SMA and EDA fibronectin not shown please          see additional file  Additional data ppt Together          with our previous results demonstrating higher levels of          thrombospondin in keloid fibroblasts     the data          suggest that                       keloid fibroblasts and to a lesser            extent normal nonPP fibroblasts appear primed to more            effectively transmit the TGF signal and thereby to            express the myofibroblast phenotype                      Additional File

normal dermal wound healing requires a          decrease in scar cellularity so as to prevent excessive          collagen accumulation and wound contraction The          reduction in cellularity

FACS analysis          demonstrated that these cells were all apoptotic not          shown see also     Although TGF acted          antiapoptotically in PP cultures palmar and normal          plantar fibroblasts and prevented the shedding of cells          into the media its effect was dissimilar in nonPP          cultures where TGF had either no impact keloid T and          normal nonplantar fibroblasts or was proapoptotic          keloid D cultures          In the presence of serum TGF acted          antiapoptotically only on the normal plantar cultures          and was without observable effect on the palmar cultures          Fig B However the addition of TGF to the nonPP          cultures always resulted in increased apoptosis in the          presence of serum in keloid D small increases were          observed and in keloid T and in normal nonplantar          cultures large increases were observed                                    Thus in contrast to the ability of              TGF to induce the expression of SMA in all              fibroblast cultures its effect on apoptosis was              fibroblastorigin dependent                                                  Impact of collagen on levels of SMA and apoptosis          in fibroblasts          Measurements were made of the SMA content and          apoptotic status of fibroblasts embedded within attached          or detachedrelaxed gels incubated for three days in the          presence or absence of serum and TGF Figs and           The data were compared with those obtained prior to          embedding and with three day post confluent monolayer          cultures Fig AB In attached gels SMA content          modestly increased in PP fibroblasts eg UL in a          Fig A for the FACS at confluence see examples in          Additional data  TGF further induced the expression          of SMA eg ULUR in Fig B Fig A although in no          instance were the levels increased to those observed in          the three day postconfluent cultures Fig A In          contrast to PP fibroblasts the SMA content of keloid          and normal nonPP fibroblasts did not increase post          collagen embedding Even TGF was modestly effective at          increasing SMA levels in keloid and normal nonPP          fibroblasts Fig A The inability of keloid          fibroblasts to respond with increased SMA to TGF may          be a consequence of their ability to initiate gel          contraction only the central portion of the gel remained          attached and apoptosis In relaxed gels there was no          detectable increase in SMA in palmar fibroblasts and a          decrease in SMA in keloid fibroblasts Most of the          fibroblasts were apoptotic eg LR in Figs c c          Similar results were obtained with normal PP and normal          nonPP fibroblasts          The impact of ECM collagen on SMA accumulation was          also evaluated in two other experimental settings data          not

settings SMA levels were reduced          compared to controls grown on noncoated tissue culture          plastic or without ascorbic acid see similar results in              Taken together these results suggest that the          presence of collagen and the stressed to relaxed state          transition of the ECM alters or dominates TGF signal          transduction see also     The corresponding          reduction in SMA is in agreement with recent in vivo          data on splintered vs unsplintered rat wounds              but differs from in vitro results on human gingival          fibroblasts              When apoptosis was evaluated it was found to increase          significantly in all fibroblast types within attached          gels by comparison to the input fibroblasts Fig B          Many of the apoptotic cells were SMA positive see UR          in Fig  Previous reports indicating a lack of          apoptosis in attached gels were based on analyses using          an ELISA that did not allow detection of events in          apoptosis which precede the formation of a nucleosomal          ladder     Experiments aimed at evaluating keloid          fibroblasts in attached gels were confounded by the          ability of these fibroblasts to contract the gels and          cause partial gel relaxation with concomitant apoptosis          Figs a B Thus while keloid fibroblasts did not          readily undergo apoptosis in response to serumstarvation          in monolayer cultures they underwent the most apoptosis          once embedded in attached gels due to the          selfrelaxation of these gels At the same time and under          the same conditions the corresponding palmar fibroblasts          showed lower apoptosis levels Figs b B TGF had          minor and variable effect on apoptosis in attached gels          Fig B          Upon gel relaxation ie after full detachment          apoptosis significantly increased LR in Fig c c          In contrast to monolayer cultures exogenous TGF did not          alter apoptosis Fig c c data not shown This is          consistent with other data on gelembedded foreskin          fibroblasts which led to the conclusion that prior          differentiation into myofibroblasts is not required for          apoptosis in granulation tissue     Our data on          attached gels when SMA positive fibroblasts were          present even without exogenous TGF demonstrated that a          considerable percentage of myofibroblasts underwent          apoptosis Fig a a b b and data not shown          The decrease in percentage of myofibroblasts in the          relaxed gels containing keloid fibroblasts compare Fig          b bwith Fig c c may be due to a gradual          turnover of SMA in the cells undergoing apoptosis In          the scheme presented in Fig this process would          correspond to the phenotypic conversion of apoptotic          myofibroblasts UR to apoptotic fibroblasts LR by          proteolysis of SMA However during granulation tissue          remodeling in vivo decreased cellularity may be the          result of apoptosis of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts                       Our findings showed that                       reduction of tension in the ECM            provokes apoptosis and reduces SMA as human dermal            myofibroblasts readily undergo apoptosis in response to            gel relaxation or wound contraction their absence            from the neodermis of a healed wound is likely the            result of apoptosis                                        Conclusions        There are several issues addressed for the first time in        this paper relating apoptosis and myofibroblast formation        in human dermal fibroblasts                  Phenotypic differences exist among          fibroblasts from different dermal origin                  nonpalmoplantar nonPP or palmoplantar PP         normal nonplantar plantar palmar from keloid patient        biopsies or abnormal from keloid biopsies Our work        demonstrated that keloid fibroblasts had higher cellular        levels of several members of the TGF pathway TGFRII        and EDA fibronectin also thrombospondin     In        addition TGF effects on apoptosis differed in nonPP vs        PP fibroblasts TGF acted proapoptotically on nonPP        fibroblasts and antiapoptotically on PP fibroblasts It        had a proapoptotic effect on myofibroblasts These results        suggest that at least in part the difference between        keloid and palmar fibroblasts may be due to particular        levels of TGFpathway related proteins at nonglabrous vs        glabrous sites                  Effect of tension in the ECM                  We found that matrix tension was dominant over TGF        in determining myofibroblast formation and apoptosis        levels Apoptotic cells predominated in relaxed gels        independent of TGF availability Keloid fibroblasts once        embedded in collagen gels  an environment exerting less        tension on the fibroblasts  were more apoptotic than the        corresponding palmar fibroblasts This difference may be        attributed to the ability of keloid fibroblasts to contract        the collagen gel        For the exuberant accumulation of collagen during keloid        formation matrix relaxationinduced apoptosis must be        delayed This suggests that bodysite specific keloid        formation may be dependent on the difference in the        development and resolution of tension in the wound bed at        nonglabrous vs glabrous sites in keloid prone patients        Thus a necessary requirement for keloid formation will be        maintenance of tension to prevent delay apoptosis This        gives sufficient time for the fibroblasts to express and        deposit collagen in the ECM With the accumulation of        collagen the tension experienced by the fibroblasts in the        keloid will be reduced and apoptosis initiated According        to our data reduced tension would lead to lowering of the        SMA level in the keloid        Although myofibroblasts were not detected in vivo            the propensity of keloid fibroblasts to express SMA in        vitro and the loss of this protein upon matrix contraction        gel relaxation do not allow one to dismiss a role for        myofibroblasts in keloids Rather it may be necessary to        reevaluate SMA expression in the early stages of keloid        development when tension within the wound bed is high        Usually the studied keloids are at least several months old        and may have had enough time for tension relaxation and        loss of SMA Interestingly keloids in some Caucasian        patients were found to contain SMA positive fibroblasts            Many of the SMA positive cells were        spindleshaped which suggests that these cells experienced        outside tension Furthermore persisting tension in the        wound bed may explain why hypertrophic scars maintain the        myofibroblast phenotype long after wound closure        Fibroblasts at glabrous sites palms soles do not        promote keloid formation consistent with an earlier        reduction in cellularity necessary for a normal wound        healing It is noteworthy that tensionmechanical loading        is exerted through the ECM by fibroblasts expressing a        synthetic fibroblast phenotype     As TGF supports        this phenotype keloid formation at glabrous sites may be        further limited by the PP fibroblast requirement for higher        andor more sustained levels of TGF        Clinical applications of pressure dressings that relieve        wound bed tension are traditionally used to prevent        aberrant scar formation during burn wound healing        Comparisons of nonpressure vs pressuretreated        hypertrophic scars have shown that pressure supports the        disappearance of SMA expressing myofibroblasts            The data presented in this work suggest that body site        differences in fibroblasts and wound tension are critical
