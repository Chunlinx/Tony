                okay so what are your opinion on it   well let me preface it im a i was a staff officer in Vietnam in sixty nine and seventy   umhum   and im in active reserve now so uh im probably not going to have the opinion you think i would have   umhum   um its it was an interesting in that i think that he gave the American people some uh uh a sense of the fact that that uh wars are really run by politicians   umhum   uh i are you old enough to remember the war   not not much im twenty eight so no i really dont remember anything about it i guess i was about ten when it ended right   yeah uh   i was born in sixty two so when did it end   well December seventy two was when uh we bombed North Vietnam and and they released the prisoners in early seventy three so that that time frame   yeah so i was ten and i dont remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in great detail   i think the the significant thing is is today did did you uh did you see Barbara Walters interview with Schwartzkopf   no i didnt   well they   but i i did read the book i have do have i have six years of college so i did read and study about the Vietnam War though so i am pretty familiar you know im more familiar with it than   well what whats your perspective on it   mine i think uh i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation and that i think it was the right thing to do to try and not to take away to you know just leave their freedoms there and to you know get rid of some of the atrocities that were going on i dont i dont know i dont really im tired of pacifist though see on the other hand im a pacifist im really struggling with it im a pacifist physical pacifist im a Christian and i believe that the real warfare is not with Saddam Hussein or the North Vietnamese but its in spiritual kingdoms and that the real warfare is done you know in your prayer closet on your knees so in a way in a sense im a pacifist but im really not you know what im saying   yes   i dont think just lay back and not do anything i think lets go to war but lets go to war praying and lets go to war for that way so   well well the difficulty i have is that uh are we our neighbors keepers     umhum   and this is what i find particularly difficult in that uh if we see injustice and whether its in a uh you know Chicago or uh or or Dallas i i think if we see it you know we see John Wiley Wiley Price hollering injustice i think thats wrong now the question is is was there injustice in Vietnam or was there injustice in Iraq and Kuwait   umhum umhum   umhum   the difficult i point is is to where do we step in and and i think that we   yeah   thats thats the part i have difficulty and the the other part is that the the when when your when your when youre looking at Vietnam and you say well is fifty eight thousand lives worth it and i dont know that anything is worth fifty eight thousand lives   umhum still have a problem with uh you know i havent come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this but and i know other Christians would disagree with me my husband and i are kind of not even in agreement on this but we dont fight over it or anything but you know how can you know the Bible says bless your enemies and bless those that curse you and its like be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient kind so its like how can you i dont know for me i dont know you know i cant say that i agree with Vietnam because how can you be gentle unto all men and and then shoot them   well the other issue is is is how do you allow uh how how do you allow injustice just like the the policeman in in Los Angeles   you so umhum   how could how could could you stand there and watch them beat that guy if your brother or your sister were being beaten   umhum   by the authorities do we step in well in some cases we would and i i think thats what makes it so difficult   yeah it is a difficult thing but then vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord and i will pay so i think God ultimately in charge of what goes on in i know like Mao Tse Chung in China he did all these terrible things and they were terrible and hes gonna be accountable for them and but if you look back you say wait a minute while he was in power he built roads he tore down all the temples he he unified the Chinese language it was impossible for missionaries to do accomplish anything in China   but   because of all that and so even in North and South Vietnam i bet youd see the same thing and that now he build roads so then hed open and then he dropped dead twenty five years premature he just dropped dead and so something good did come out of that in that now you see what i mean its like now   yeah but but the other the other difficulty is is that its just if if you take the admonition to to feed my sheep   uhhuh   and the question is who are my sheep and the idea do we go out and feed these people when theyre hungry   well bless your enemies if your enemy is hungry feed him if he if he needs your asks for your shirt give him your coat also so if the the the the South Vietnamese they asked us to help them right   but   is that right   yes uh they did the i think the the biggest difficulty is is that when your at an agrarian economy like South Vietnam was that in reality uh the the poor farmer poor rice farmer was going to pay taxes   umhum umhum   and the question is who was he going to pay it to   yeah   uh the Communists or the uh alleged Democrats uh democratic form of government and i   uhhuh   i think thats i think i think uh thats a little was a difficult part there and and i we didnt understand the culture we couldnt uh we had uh we had a a young lady that was fourteen that worked in our in the unit i was commander of that appeared to be eight or nine years old and and the people looked like children i mean you couldnt imagine that one would would would conceal a bomb and   umhum yeah   and and do these kind of things i think culturally it really destroyed a lot of the people that that went over and saw these people you just couldnt believe that they would that they would be mean and and and drop bombs and kill people and then we would turn around and and napalm them you know if   umhum umhum   and i think there was a lot of a lot of tearing of emotions and i think that if anything that when Schwartzkopf he was saying the idea that we learned we learned we learned a lot from Vietnam   umhum   now it was it was it was in general bad but and i dont know the problem is now im im concerned a little bit that that now that the Gulf War is on that were going to think it was a good war and it was okay   yeah   to go beat up on people and i think that i think we need to a little more justice at home im not sure how we get that  whether theres a connection there but   yeah but then again yeah id say it is wrong to invade Kuwait and im not saying President Bush made the wrong decision i think im lacking in my   in any event   i dont think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the Vietnam War because im going to interpret that through the Bible and ive kind of always i have been a Christian five years and ive kind of avoided that t hat those the war things and how God approaches that because i think its just now coming up to where i really feel like i need to come you know need to decide what i feel   well the difficulty is is if you look in the Old Testament and and the numbers of places that uh the Lord went out and just simply struck down and that was part of the problem when they went into the Promised Land that they that they uh they didnt destroy everybody and that thats   right right they left a woman and a child or the cat the sheep yeah   and and that that you know and you i think thats one of those things when we get to Heaven were going to ask God   i know   why did you do it that way   but then again though Jesus the grace pushes you beyond the law you know what im saying like so he didnt just say dont kill your dont kill your enemies but dont only dont kill them bless them you know and so therefore when we have an enemy come against us i really feel like but i really feel like i know i do feel this strongly that when if we had someone come and attack us the best way to handle it would be to bless them and humbly go to their other king or the other ruler and say what have we done to offend you what can we do to rectify this situation and that God would move in that sovereignly and he would get the glory though no king no Bush wouldnt   what do you   because it wouldnt make any sense you know what im saying itd look absolutely ridiculously stupid but it would work out because   yeah   if you follow the scriptural principals its going to work out because those are thats the best way to do it you know but the thing is is that then God gets the glory not a president not a king and i think thats a problem for a lot of politicians is they want the glory   well and i i and even at the even at the local level when somebodys assaulted   umhum   what do you do turn the other cheek   no well i believe personally i hope i this is where everyone always says my husband always goes through that i go yeah for one if someone broke in my house i would pray that i would have this faith to to to take authority over that and i know people that have done that i mean i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes and just say i bind you in Jesus name your  i just and rebuke any enemy because i believe its a spiritual war thats going on and its not normal for someone to come into someone elses home illegally thats not normal theres something going on there and that i would have discernment by the Holy Spirit to be able to pray over that do you see what i mean and then the same in Vietnam you would you wouldnt handle Vietnam the same way you would handle uh Saddam Hussein   yeah   but i just i have a problem with all the killing but im not a new ager i dont believe means that i am not for one world government im not for all these new age things i  i dont have a problem with uh national identity and im an American and having different nations and all of this but i am concerned about the killing that went on there because i just feel like God has a better way to handle it than that and
