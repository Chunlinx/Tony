                                 Booker Snooker                           The                God of SmallThings has been good to the South Indian novelist Arundhati Roy The pastyear has brought many blessings the fairytale arrival at her door of theeager publisher with the fat check a million advanceunheard of for adebut novel landmark sales  copies in hardcover multipletranslations  languages much feting and fanfare global book toursinterviews pride of place in India specials in Granta and The NewYorker  and finally the announcement last Tuesday that Roy had won the which is awarded annually to a writer from Britain or the Commonwealth andbrings with it a cash prize of more than             ThoughRoys victory seems to validate the ubiquitous comparisons to the ubiquitous there is cause for pause Sure The God of Small Things is a cozy readBut so are many of those books that go straight to the remainder pile So whydid Roy win the Booker Why all the hype            The answer is simple The Zeitgeist was ripe for Royand Roy for it Her book hit an Englishspeaking market that craves all thingsIndian tandoori food yoga Deepak Chopra the altiehiphop of Cornershopchai  Homi Bhabha And while it would be ridiculous to suggest that Royincubated this book for the better part of five years and then released it tocapitalize on India chic just as it crested it is also true that she hasplayed to that market in terms it understands and swallows whole            Nothingwrong with thatbut Roy is strenuous in her denials She claims that  shedoesnt want Brownie points because Im from India and  her book doesnttrade on the currency of cultural specificity But of course  she does and it does Roys booka humid tale of a pair of twins whose divorced motherhas an affair with an untouchableis the sum of its othernesses Thefamily at the center of the novel belongs to a small insular community whoseinner workings are foreign even to most Indians Their family home Ayemenemis located in the comparatively remote southern state of Kerala a region thatWesterners who might know Rushdies Delhi or Naipauls Bombay from readingtheir fiction might not recognize Roys descriptions therefore can be safelylush richly runny The river shrinks and black crows gorge on bright mangoesin still dustgreen trees Red bananas ripen Jackfruits burst Dissolutebluebottles hum  and die fatly baffled in the sun            No one cares that Roys prose is abreathdefying crush of runtogether words and runon sentences strategicallyrandom capitalization and italicization numbered lists reversed

narrative more than itenhances it forcing the reader to keep pace Click for a sample            Butnowhere is the selfindulgent circling as pointedor annoyingas in the imageof Rahel the girlwoman protagonist who is a dead ringer for Roy jeans andwhite Tshirt  wild hair tied back to look straight though it wasnt tiny diamond in one nostril  absurdly beautiful collarbones and a niceathletic run It is this image of the exoticfamiliar the combination ofdiamond stud and bluejeans that has made US reviewers go light on Roy Shesthe Indian babe who led that Eastern Religions seminar you took differentenough to charm similar enough not to intimidate And the fact that shesclearly smart and literate makes everyone feel goodand safeabout gushingHow glossy therefore is the praise how insubstantial the contact in theUS reviews Ive read Roy gives us a richly pictorial sense of thesecharacters daily routines and habits said Michiko Kakutani in the NewYork Times  and she delineates their emotional lives with insight andpanache revealing the fatal confluence of jealousy cruelty and naivete thatshapes their destinies forever No mention of the flabby plot with itscontrived deaths no taking to task for the overworked proseAyemenem is justtoo far away            So Roy rode the wave here in the United States Book clubsmet and raved and timorous tingling questions How deep did you have toreach to release those wonderful twins were asked during the authors toursThe public invited magnificent pronouncements from Roy a sense somehow thatthis woman felt things more deeply more creatively more spiritually And sheresponded Asked about her language she said it is the skin on my thoughtstraceable only to private rhythms So deeply felt so minutely realized werethese rhythms it seems that she rewrote nary a word of her book remarkablegiven its length pagesand the fact that a word processor is quick toforgive errors The narrative structure was crafted and designed obsessively for fourandahalf years The story too was mine mine so what if Rushdies latest was also set in Kerala I grew up in that villagein my grandmothers pickle factory Rushdie didnt invent that            Some ofher British critics would agree that Roy and Rushdie indeed have little incommon Only in the fantasies of publicists moaned the Guardian  cansuch comparisons be made The Brits feel they know India and several membersof the press at least appear unimpressed Arundhati Roys victory left meclose to despair said David Robson in the Sunday                Telegraph  Ifthis is the novel of the year then the novel is dead Carmen Callil whochaired last years prize committee called The God execrable and saidit shouldnt have made the list            Does the skepticism mean that The Godgot a more thorough goingover in Britain Not really Americans think of theBooker committee as the Protectors of the Literary Flame In fact Bookerpolitics are no less clubby and sordid than Oscar politics Prize and processare widely reviled by British readers and critics By giving Roy the prize thecommittee has confirmed the darkest suspicions of its critics Yes its soldout quality literature for pop accessibility Also The queens recent visit toIndia put the spotlight back on the issue of colonial guilt Her refusal toapologize publicly for a  massacre was badly received Roys win has beenspun as a compensatory gesture from the colonialists to the former colony            Roy herself was predictablymodest about The God s successnot the best novel the luckiest shesaid The win brought tears to her eyes of course and prompted a phone callto Mom in India The God of Small Things is dedicated to Mary Roy wholike the twins mother married outside her community before returning divorcedand in disgrace Mother and daughter were estranged for six years if thestories circulating here are to be believed Kicked out of the house when shewas only  she was called Suzie in those days Roy went to Delhi and thento architecture school supporting herself by selling empty milk bottles somesay beer bottles She bummed around the beaches of western India with ahusband some say a lover before settling down in

the laurels are about my past not myfuture says this ace of the apothegm I will only write another novel if Ihave another novel to write I dont believe in professions            At a book reading in Seattlesome months ago Roy told her audience that shed allowed The God to bepublished on the condition that it never be optioned Last week the DailyTelegraph reported that HarperCollins had finished recording an audioversion of the novel using the voice of British actress Diana Quick whothough she had been chosen because her British accent would not distractlisteners was directed to imitate Indian accents for some dialogue Earlierthis week Roy confessed that shed stuffed some movierelated faxes intobooks saving them for a calmer time  perhaps for when she repairs to thatquiet cottage in
