                 why dont you tell me about your choir   oh okay well we uh are a group of uh musicians that just kind of have you know formed out of a desire to sing and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they or just real talented i should say lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching uh others have theres one gal thats in the uh Plano Community Orchestra   umhum   uh  just you know different backgrounds its been really kind of interesting   great   so um   um i play the piano and uh i have a four year old who who has started to play the piano he does that uh musically listens and then he can play which is kind of interesting i think its because hes always heard music in our home all the since he was a baby   oh yeah umhum   uh  my husband and my other son whos eleven  just got through singing in a musical here in in the community at Music Man   oh they did   yeah and it was lots of fun   how did how did they get involved in that   um basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions it was the Plano Repertory Theatre   umhum   and so they went and tried out and my husband played Harold Hill from the Music Man and my son played one of the children in a band   oh how fun   so yeah it was really fun and uh my son plays the clarinet in his band at school  and my daughter takes piano lessons too   yeah umhum   but uh we just really like music its a i i especially like it as an outlet when the TV goes off we  get the TV off and and just have some nice quiet music   umhum umhum umhum yeah yeah thats nice you say have your four year old taking lessons already   umhum   and uh who do you have her or him take it from   um i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches Suzuki   uhhuh   which is an auditory type learning experience you listen to the music and then learn to play it by learning by hearing the intervals and things like that   umhum   i teach uh like what is traditionally taught you know you look at the note on the page and you play whats on the piano but he cant learn like that hes a delayed child hes only about i guess hes about two and a half in his real understanding of things   oh   and uh so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it uh with his right hand we went wow we better have him do something do something you know educationally   umhum yeah yeah   so that was really fun my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown though   well because my pardon me   so my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town into Dallas   umhum umhum well i have an eight and a half year old daughter whos taken piano lessons since the started out at the age of just turning five because she wanted you know she just seemed to enjoy it so much and now my my four year old four and a half year old daughter is   um   is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally she just   oh i think thats great   so i wasnt sure when to start her i didnt want to push her too early either but uh kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene   thats really hard i think because especially if you start them and then they get pretty good and then they get close ten you know eleven or something and they go i dont want to do this anymore and youre like   umhum   God i really want you to do it  you know so sometimes its hard to to know exactly when but   yeah yeah   i dont know if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it   umhum umhum yeah i think shed like to i just dont know if its really knowing from what my daughter has gone through shes she learned a lot and it course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it it was something easily forgotten so   uhhuh   um i dont know if shes any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight  or or should i say seven i mean shes not a gifted pianist in the sense that shes gonna excel just naturally she does have to really work at it but um so  yeah  uh so im kind of you know just playing with it but at this point were going to kind of wait i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway but   thats like me well it can get expensive thats for sure   yeah yeah   i my friend is is very generous in in letting us have my children uh do the Suzuki method without paying a lot out   umhum oh thats good   yeah so its been good for our family   well as a piano teacher do you have any feelings from kids who come from a Suzuki method have you had any former Suzuki students   i dont have any Suzuki students um something happening to me at Christmas time that that verified to me that i will always   i was wondering how they
