                    Background        The lysosome is a pivotal organelle responsible for a        diverse spectrum of cellular functions including protein        and lipid catabolism vesicular transport and sorting            Abnormal lysosomal physiology may result in cellular        dysfunction and eventually lead to a variety of diseases        For example deficiencies of various enzymes responsible        for lipid metabolism result in lipid accumulation in        lysosomal storage diseases such as NiemannPick and Gaucher        diseases     Alternatively modulation of lysosomal        lumen pH may alter membrane trafficking and associated        metabolic processes It has been reported that elevated        lysosomal pH is associated with the genetic lysosomal        disorder Mucolipidosis type IV disease where various        sphingolipids and mucolipids accumulate in the lysosome            Finally lysosomes may play multiple roles in cellular        oxidative metabolism     The oxidative activity in        lysosomes may regulate the modification of proteins and        lipids resulting in disruption of lysosomal membrane        integrity            The tumor promoter phorbol myristate acetate PMA has        been shown to activate the NADPH nicotinamide adenine        dinucleotide phosphate oxidase and initiate the oxidative        burst response in various phagocytes including neutrophils        and the macrophagelike cell line JA      During        the oxidative burst generation of reactive oxygen species        ROS such as hydrogen peroxide H          O           and superoxide anion O           is involved in degranulation        secretion of lysosomal enzymes and subsequent cytotoxic        killing of invading pathogens Although activation of the        NADPH oxidase complex in phagolysosomal or lysosomal        membranes has been reported         in situ generation of either H          O          or O          in these organelles in live cells        has not been demonstrated     This is partly due to the        lack of appropriate indicators that can monitor the        formation of these ROS and the concurrent change of        oxidative activity in these vacuoles Furthermore since        the charged free radical O          should have difficulty leaking        across hydrophobic membranes formation of this anion        radical inside the lysosome may have an immediate impact on        pH in this organelle The question addressed in the present        study is what is the distribution of oxidative activity        and pH changes in the lysosome when cells are stimulated        with PMA A fluorogenic substrate OxyBURST Green H          HFF Bovine Serum Albumin OxyBURST        Green H          HFF BSA was used to detect lysosomal        oxidative activity OxyBURST Green H          HFF BSA consists of bovine serum        albumin coupled to        dihydrohexafluorofluorescein H          HFF a reduced dye with improved        chemical stability The nonfluorescent BSA conjugate is        internalized into cells through the endocytic pathway and        accumulates in lysosomes where the extent of its oxidation        depends on the oxidative activity in this organelle The        spatial distribution of lysosomal pH in cells after PMA        treatment was investigated using both        fluoresceinconjugated dextran and a selective lysosomal        probe LysoTracker Red Finally possible mechanisms of        regulation between pH and oxidative activity in lysosomes        are discussed                    Results and discussion                  Effect of phorbol ester on the oxidative activities          of lysosomes          Although the location of activated NADPH oxidase          complex in phagolysosomes has been reported the release          of either H            O            or O                       in situ upon stimulation with PMA          has not been directly shown in live cells      In          order to directly measure the oxidative activity in          lysosomes I use a reduced fluorescein derivative that is          conjugated with BSA OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA as shown in Figure           Spectrofluorimetric analysis indicates that this reduced          compound is nonfluorescent and becomes fluorescent upon          HRPcatalyzed oxidation Furthermore upon incubation          with macrophages the reduced compound was internalized          into cells through fluid phase endocytosis and          eventually accumulated in lysosomes Therefore the          oxidation activity inside the lysosome determines the          oxidation of the reduced dye Upon oxidation this          compound emits strong fluorescence with emission maximum          centered at              which can be viewed and          quantified using fluorescence microscopy          I first labeled the total lysosomal population in          cells with a wellknown lysosomal marker dextran          conjugated with Cascade Blue fluorophore according to a          previously reported procedure    see Methods          section Cells were then labeled with OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA followed by chase labeling          without the reduced dye but in the presence or absence of           nM PMA Colocalization experiments indicate that all          of the OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA is distributed in lysosomes          but not endosomes after this labeling procedure see          below The fluorescence intensity of the oxidized          OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA in total lysosomal          populations was then quantified by a process using          Cascade Blueconjugated dextran as a mask for lysosomes              As shown in Table  when cells were treated with          PMA fluorescence intensity of the OxyBURST fluorophore          in lysosomes significantly increased ie oxidative          activity  vs  This increase in fluorescence          is not due to the internalization of oxidized dye since          no oxidation of the OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA was observed in the labeling          medium during the loading procedure data not shown          Furthermore cells were incubated with the OxyBURST Green          H            HFF at C for  min so that the          reduced dye is transported primarily into endosomes          rather than lysosomes Stimulation of endosome loaded          cells with control medium or medium containing PMA          resulted in no detectable changes in the fluorescent          properties of the endosome population data not shown          These results demonstrate that PMA initiates an elevation          of oxidative activity selectively within lysosomes          In order to understand the           in situ enhancement of lysosomal          oxidative activity by PMA the subcellular distribution          of the oxidized OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA in cells was investigated          As shown in Figure  oxidized OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA distributed within the          population of lysosomes where they colocalized with the          fluorescent dextran It was also noticed that strong          fluorescence of oxidized OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA only existed in a subset of          lysosomes as indicated by arrows in the inset                          Effect of phorbol ester on lysosomal pH          I next sought to investigate the effect of PMA          treatment on lysosomal pH Averaged lysosomal pH was          measured in control cells or cells treated with PMA          using fluoresceinconjugated dextran in dualexcitation          ratiometric mode     The validation of lysosomal pH          measurements was performed by the calibration curve using          ionophoreclamped cells as shown in Figure  The ratio          of emission fluorescence under excitation at  nm          versus  nm ie F                        F                         correlated linearly with          calibrated lysosomal pHs from  to  with a high r          value of  As shown in Table  the average pH in          total lysosomal population significantly increased           pH units upon PMA stimulation Most          interestingly a heterogeneous distribution of lysosomes          with elevated pH was observed by ratiometric images as          shown in Figure  Here lysosomal pH in untreated cells          is very homogeneous and estimated to be  Upon          PMA treatment pH was significantly elevated to as high          as  in a subset of lysosomes indicated by the          arrow          The effect of PMAinduced oxidation on lysosomal pH as          measured by the fluoresceindextran is worthwhile further          discussion see Table and Figure  It is critical to          test the possibility that the increase of oxidative          activity may change the pHdependence of          fluoresceindextran In other words lysosomes with          higher oxidative activities may induce abnormal change of          the pHdependence of fluoresceindextran that is within          If this is true then the resulting F                        F                         ratio of the fluorescence is no          longer pHdependent and can not be used as an indication          of pH increase in lysosomes To test this possibility          effect of HRPcatalyzed oxidation on pHdependence of          fluoresceindextran was investigated           in vitro  As shown in Figure           increase in oxidation showed no effect on the          pHdependence of fluoresceindextran Conversely changes          in lysosomal pH do not affect the fluorescence of          oxidized OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA as will be shown later                          Regulation of lysosomal pH and oxidative          activities          The observation that there are elevations of both          oxidative and pH activities in only a subset of lysosomes          Figures and  suggests that pH and oxidative activity          may be coupled in this organelle In order to demonstrate          this relationship in live cells the oxidative activities          and pH in lysosomes were simultaneously monitored by          OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA and LysoTracker Red DND          which is able to qualitatively indicate acidic          lysosomes          Briefly cell monolayers were incubated with  gmL          OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA at C for  hours washed          and then incubated in fresh medium containing  nM PMA          at C for  hour Cell monolayers were washed and          then incubated with  nM LysoTracker Red DND at C          for  min to label acidic lysosomes Consistent with          previous results PMA treatment elicits high oxidative          activity and thus increased OxyBURST fluorescent          intensity in a subset of lysosomes Figure           Interestingly lysosomes with strong OxyBURST          fluorescence contain only very weak fluorescence of          LysoTracker Red see arrows On the other hand acidic          lysosomes strongly stained by LysoTracker Red exhibited          very weak OxyBURST fluorescence see arrowhead The          mutual regulation of oxidative activity and alkalinity in          lysosomes can be better demonstrated by a ratio image as          shown in the lower panel          LysoTracker Red DND is a chloroquine analogue that          had been reported to selectively accumulate in acidic          lysosomes     In the present study when lysosomal pH          was elevated to  and then cell was stained with          the dye the fluorescence in lysosomes greatly decreased          or diminished This decrease in fluorescence is due to a          decrease in accumulation of the dye in lysosomes since          the change in pH itself has no effect on the fluorescence          of the dye data not shown Nevertheless the          fluorescence decrease of this dye in a subset of          lysosomes after PMA stimulation could also result from          reactions of the LysoTracker Red with higher oxidative          activity while the pH in this subset of lysosomes          remains unchanged This possibility was tested           in vitro by incubating LysoTracker          Red with H            O            or KO            as an O            donor in buffer solutions with          acidic  or alkaline  pHs As shown in Figure           the fluorescence of the LysoTracker Red is not affected          by either of these two oxygen species This data strongly          supports the contention that decreased fluorescence of          the LysoTracker Red in a subset of lysosomes does          indicate elevation of pH          I then characterized the heterogeneous fluorescence          distribution of oxidized OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA Fluorescence of fluorescein          and its analogs such as carboxyfluorescein has been shown          to be pHdependent      Elevation of pH increases          the ratio of fluorescent emission at             as excited by             over              The heterogeneous fluorescence          of the oxidized dye in subsets of lysosomes where it          exhibits a significant difference in pH  to  may          simply reflect the pHdependency of the oxidized dye and          not represent different levels of oxidative activity          among lysosomes The pHdependency of fluorescence of          both oxidized OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA and and          carboxyfluorescein were thus examined by the dual          excitation ratiometric measurement           in vitro  as shown in Figure           While and carboxyfluorescein exhibits strong          pHdependency the experiment clearly demonstrates that          fluorescence of the oxidized OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA is not affected by variation          of the pH within a range between  to           It is also possible that the heterogeneous          distribution of fluorescence intensity of oxidized          OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA is due to preferential          accumulation of the reduced dye in a subset of lysosomes          rather than being determined by a variation of oxidative          activity in these lysosomes In other words lysosomes          that accumulate more reduced dye will produce stronger          fluorescence after PMA stimulation To address this          possibility I performed the following experiment Cell          monolayers were grown on circular glass coverslips and          labeled with OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA as previously described The          cells were then mounted onto a temperaturecontrolled          stage with a perfusion chamber for microscopy The          temperature was controlled at C throughout the          experiment Cells were then treated with  nM PMA for           min followed by  nM LysoTracker Red DND for           min to label lysosomes Cells were next washed with PBS          and the fluorescence images of both oxidized OxyBURST          Green H            HFF BSA and LysoTracker Red were          recorded As shown in Figure a the fluorescence          intensity is higher in a subset of lysosomes see arrow          that accumulate very little LysoTracker Red Figure b          Conceivably if there was more reduced dye in this          lysosome area complete oxidation of the reduced dye          inside lysosomes should release more OxyBURST          fluorescence This was tested by adding H            O            to the cell final concentration of           in PBS The cells were then incubated for an          additional  min to allow oxidation of all the lysosomal          OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA The fluorescent image of          oxidized OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA in the same cell was then          recorded as shown in Figure c The addition of H            O            resulted in a fold average          intensity increase  vs  among the total          lysosomal population Fluorescence changes in five          selected lysosomal areas before insets Fig a and          after insets Fig c H            O            addition are further quantified as          shown in Figure  The figure shows that the maximal          fluorescence released by H            O            treatment among these five lysosomal          areas is very similar  gray levelpixel          area Importantly lysosomal area  which exhibited          stronger fluorescence before H            O            treatment  gray levelpixel          area does not release more fluorescence after complete          oxidation by the peroxide This clearly eliminates the          possibility that there is more OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA accumulating in lysosome          area  The experiment strongly supports the notion that          the oxidative activity within the lysosomal population is          heterogeneous          One concern regarding to the use of OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA in the present study is that          the accumulation of OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA itself may drive the          increase in pH If this is the case then lysosomes          containing OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA should have more alkaline          pH However this possibility is not consistent with one          observation that was presented in Figure where I showed          that distribution of OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA was very homogenous among          lysosomes nevertheless not every lysosomes exhibited          elevated lumen pH          Although direct measurements of lysosomal oxidative          activity in live cells were not available before the          present study several lines of evidence did point to a          regulatory mechanism in phagolysosomes or lysosomes in          phagocytes during phagocytosis and oxidative burst          First it has been shown that activation of NADPH oxidase          during a phagocytosis event results in alkalization of          phagolysosomal pH in the human neutrophil     The          phagolysosomal pH is influenced by NADPH oxidase activity          and to a lesser extent by a Na H antiporter Secondly          disruption of normal lysosomal pH by lysosomotropic weak          bases inhibits the respiratory burst in neutrophils              A normal transmembrane pH gradient in lysosomes is          suggested to play an important role in assembling the          NADPH oxidase complex during cell activation These          observations and my present results can be integrated and          summarized in a model proposed in Figure  PMA          treatment induces the assembly and activation of NADPH          oxidase in the lysosomal membrane Activation of the          oxidase generates intralysosomal O            that is membrane impermeable with          a short life span and is converted to H            O            instantly by the consumption of          protons see  H            O            then oxidizes the OxyBURST Green H            HFF BSA that accumulates in the          lysosome in the presence of peroxidases This          enzymecatalyzed oxidation generates hydroxyl ion OH           and radical OH see  Intralysosomal pH elevation          can be explained by a net effect of H consumption and OH          generation Alternatively the reactive OH radical may          interact with lysosomal membrane lipids or proteins and          disturb a normal transmembranedependent pH gradient               Eventually the elevated pH may then act as a          negative feedback control to down regulate the activation          of the NADPH oxidase and inhibit oxidative activity          Finally generation of ROS during phagocytosis has been          implicated in inactivation of lysosomal enzymes               It is conceivable that an elevation of lysosomal pH to          as high as  will inactivate various proteases in          this organelle          Another novel finding in the present study is the          heterogeneous distribution of oxidative activity and pH          in lysosomal population responding to PMA treatment          Heterogeneous distribution of low molecular weight          redoxactive iron has been reported in lysosomal          population within cells which may contribute to          differing stability of lysosomal membranes to oxidative          stress as shown by Brunk and colleagues     Although          the regulation of this heterogeneity is too complicated          and beyond the scope of the present study it does open          up another window for investigating lysosomal trafficking          in various diseases For example the accumulation of          lipids in lysosomal storage diseases appears to be          heterogeneous unpublished data Oxidative activity and          pH distribution may be used as           in situ indexes to improve our          understanding of lipid accumulation in subsets of          lysosomes Understanding the regulation mechanism will be          helpful in developing new treatment strategy for these          diseases                            Conclusions        Using a novel indicator for oxidative activity OxyBURST        Green H          HFF BSA I am able to study the        distribution of lysosomal oxidative burst activity and its        concurrent pH changes in live macrophagelike JA cell        The present result indicates that oxidative activity and pH        in lysosomes are interregulated Higher oxidative activity        results in higher alkalinity while lower lysosomal pH is        associated with lower oxidative activity This approach        provides a better opportunity to study the dynamic changes        of oxidation and pH in phagolysosomes during phagocytosis        which can not be resolved by conventional biochemical        analyses                    Methods                  Reagents and cell
