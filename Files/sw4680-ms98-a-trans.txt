                well i think Don that maybe immigration is more of an issue in my part of the country than it is in yours do you suppose thats true   well youre probably right up here in Rochester we uh   but   we dont have uh much controversy about immigration you know being on the Canadian border theres not a whole lot of people  you know dying to come across and live here   yeah maybe uh they have a problem   sometimes i think they ought to   yeah well of course were quite a ways from the Mexican border here   uhhuh   but uh oh you hear on the news and whatnot of uh some of the sad things associated with immigration like uh loading up a truck full of immigrants and it runs out of gas or something and they sit out in the bake in the sun because theyre locked in the back of it and things like that   umhum yeah   so there are a lot of tragedies i think associated with immigration   yeah i think its uh i think its a real shame but on the other hand you know it kind of even with all the tragedies if you step back and look at it the fact that people want to come here must be that theres something better here than or at least they think theres something better here than there is uh wherever theyre from   yeah oh absolutely absolutely i i mean that the what i see is Mexico of course rather South American countries   yeah uhhuh   uh unfortunately i think that that the immigrants tend to really stretch the social services that can be provided to the folks uh   uhhuh yeah yeah thats true but i think thats probably always been true throughout uh history of the United States uh i think anytime you have uh you know immigrants coming in who perhaps you know dont have the ability to communicate with a large percentage of the population thats already here i think theyre bound to to push the social services a little bit do you think its worse today than it was maybe fifty years ago   uh yeah i think maybe it is i and i think thats not necessarily the fault of immigration but just the way the world is going to you know what in a hand basket anyway  i think that theres so many other problems especially in the cities   uhhuh yeah uhhuh yeah   uh crime for example and i uh   yeah   uh i dont know i think its all tied up together i know that the immigrant immigrant of course now Dallas has a lot of uh   yeah youre probably right   Asian immigrants in fact a large community of them   uhhuh okay   and uh they have their special problems uh oh for example crime i mentioned crime against immigrants is is a severe problem because the people that came from the southeast Asian countries dont want to call the police   uhhuh yeah   you know they they have fear of the police and whatnot   thats right thats right its really interesting to me because as as you as as you pointed out at the beginning here in Rochester uh now we dont have it immigration problem we dont even have a lot of immigration but on the other hand you know its we do have uh a large influx of uh people from say Jamaica or other parts of the Caribbean that thats really you know and Puerto Rico we have a a large population from there people who have come over you know maybe in the last you know ten or twenty years   uhhuh   have moved here now why somebody from Jamaica want to would want to move to cold Rochester  im a little uh im a little hard pressed  to understand but they do it so so you know i dont blame them to each their own       but you know if you look at at a place like Rochester now now we have a large population of like second and third generation Americans of people who came you know whose parents or grandparents came to uh the United States you know people from Italy uh people from Poland people from the Ukraine um   uhhuh   and and i always you know i always wonder whether you know was the situation any different back then i mean how did the people who had been in the United States for for a while feel about this large amount of immigration uh its fairly well known that at one of the major companies in Rochester who i wont say their name but im sure youve heard of them uh back in the thirties didnt want to hire the Italian immigrants because it it was it was a discriminatory practice   huh yeah   and uh you know it just makes me wonder you know and you know i look at what what made this country great and a lot of cases it was the immigrants who came over and worked and i and sometimes i wonder you know whether you know just how different is the situation today   oh i think i think they want to work i think theyre often under educated   umhum   i think thats why maybe one reason why they have so much difficult in their own countries   umhum   uh i i have trouble with
