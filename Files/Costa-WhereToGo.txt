Where to GoMost visitors to the Costa del Sol are based in one of the large coastal resorts to the west of Mlaga Torremolinos Benalmdena Fuengirola Marbella or Estepona while far fewer head east toward Nerja Almucar or even as far as Almera Although the main aim for many is to relax on the beach and soak up as much sun as possible increasing numbers arrive to play golf It comes as little surprise therefore that the road signs proclaim the area west of Mlaga not just the Costa del Sol but the Costa del Golf alsoA few visitors forsake the beach for a day or two and venture out to either the amazingly varied historic towns and cities or the natural wonders of the national parks nearby Mlaga Ronda and perhaps Gibraltar can be seen in a day but Sevilla Crdoba Granada and the parks necessitate at least an overnight stopMlagaMlagas international airport is the gateway to the Costa del Sol and Andaluca for most people However few visitors spend much time in the city itself This is a shame as Mlaga is an ancient Andalucan city of not inconsiderable charm that offers a refreshing taste of the real SpainFounded by Phoenician traders more than  years ago it came under Carthaginian and Roman rule before falling to the Moorish invasion force in  The Moors fortified the city developing the settlement into a major trading port serving Granada and it was one of the last cities in Spain to be reconquered by Christian forces in A good place to begin a tour is at Mlagas principle landmark Gibralfaro from the Arabic Jebel al FaroLighthouse Hill Located some  m  ft above the city this hilltop is capped by the ramparts of a Phoenician castle reconstructed in the th century by the Moors who went on to build the lighthouse that gave Gibralfaro its name The restored walls and parapets offer a superb panoramic view of both the city below and the coastline disappearing into the horizon Because it looks down on the Plaza de Toros the hill also acts as free seating for bullfights taking place below Although it is possible to walk here it is not recommended Not only is the pathway somewhat difficult in places it is also a wellknown hangout for muggers Best then to take a taxiBack at sea level is the delightful Paseo del Parque with contrasting fountains at either end which connects the old town with the Plaza de Toros On its south side it is a lush seaside tropical garden enhanced by fountains duck ponds and small bars The other side is home to the smaller Jardnes Puerta Oscura and two impressive buildings the Ayuntamiento Town Hall and the thcentury La Aduana Old Custom HouseImmediately behind here is the sprawling Alcazaba fortresspalace complex that the Moors built between the th and th centuries A cobbled path climbs up the hillside within the walls to the portal dubbed Arco del Cristo Gateway of Christ The victorious Christian army of Ferdinand and Isabella celebrated mass here when the fortress finally fell into their hands in  Higher still the onetime palace a disappointment compared with those in Granada and Sevilla contains a small archaeological museum Beside the entrance to the Alcazaba are the partially excavated ruins of a Roman theater the only visible remains of the ancient cityA short walk away is the cathedral known locally as La Manquitathe onearmed ladybecause one of its twin towers remains unfinished The north tower soars  m some  ft above the street but work on the other a forlorn stump of stone stopped in  because of a lack of moneyMlaga was the birthplace of Pablo Ruiz Picasso though the young artist left his native city at age  for the more cosmopolitan climates of Madrid and Barcelona The house he was born in Casa Natal Picasso at Plaza de la Merced  doubles as a small museum and research center On a larger scale is the nearby Museo de Bellas Artes Fine Arts Museum an old Renaissancestyle palace with pleasing patios In late  it was being converted into the future Museo Picasso Picasso MuseumThe Museo de Artes y Tradiciones Populares on the western edge of the old town is easily missed but that would be a mistake Situated in the Posada de la Victoria a charming early thcentury historic inn that is incongruous with its surroundings the museum offers a fascinating glimpse of how life was lived in Mlaga in generations pastOn the way back to the center of Mlaga stop for a moment or two at the centuryold Mercado Atarazanas market Each morning it is filled with women admiring the bountiful displays of meat fish fruit and vegetables and shopping in the traditional manner for fresh not plasticwrapped produce This is also the western boundary of a collection of small roads and pedestrianonly streets that end at the main street Calle Marqus de Larios and combine to form Mlagas principal shopping center You can buy almost anything here from foodstuffs to footwear but be advised that the siesta still reigns in this part of Spain and nothing is open between about pm and pmNorth of MlagaJust an hours drive north of Mlaga lies some magnificent mountain scenery The national park of El Torcal de Antequera is a high limestone plateau that has been eroded by rainwater into a fantasy landscape of fluted pinnacles and towers Hikers can explore the marked trails which are up to  km  miles in length and wind among the rocks and enjoy panoramic views back to Mlaga and the distant blue Mediterranean This is where you will also find a most wonderful small hotel La Posada del TorcalNear the town of Alora you will find the breathtaking gorge known as the Garganta del Chorro Three hundred meters  feet in depth this sheersided canyon is cut by the Guadalhorce River It is also accessible from Mlaga by train ask for a ticket to El Chorro An improbable concrete catwalk called the Camino del Rey The Kings Way crosses a vertical cliff and continues into the heart of the gorge a dizzying  m  ft above the river It was built in the s to provide access for workers digging tunnels for a hydroelectricity project The artificial dams above the gorge have created attractive lakes known as the Pantanos del Chorro Fringed with woods sandy beaches and campsites they constitute a refreshing change of scenery from the heat and bustle of the coastWest of MlagaSome of the worlds most popular beach resorts line the coast that stretches  km  miles to the Rock of GibraltarTorremolinosJust a few kilometers west of Mlagas international airport is Torremolinos In the late s and early s it was the first resort on the Costa del Sol to establish a reputation as a popular international playground Although little more than an overgrown village it was a haven for young northern Europeans seeking an inexpensive vacation with muchsun sand and sangra Since then it has built quite literally on that reputation And although it is nowhere as inexpensive even relatively as it once was it is still a highly popular tourist destinationWalltowall hotels and apartments reach way back from the beaches and theres no denying that it delivers everything sunhungry vacationers could wish for Its miles of glorious beaches guaranteed sun cheap alcohol and food numerous bars discotheques and nightclubs attract a clientele that is largely British although other northern European countries are still well represented here Even a fair number of Americans and Russians are now visiting This cosmopolitan but not by any means sophisticated international invasion has completely overwhelmed the town There can be few places in the world where foreign languages principally English are more dominant than the native language But that is certainly the case in TorremolinosAlthough the first mention of the town dates back to  there is really nothing here of historical significance The town itself especially Calle San Miguel is simply a profusion of shops At the bottom of San Miguel a series of winding stairways lined by shops of course lead down towards a  km nearly  mile sweep of golden coastline This consists of six beaches connected by the wonderful Paseo Maritimo beach promenade and broken only by the rocky promontory of Castillo de Santa Clara which separates the Bajondillo east and Carihuela west sections of townChiringuitos small beachside restaurants are in plentiful supply especially in the former fishing village of La Carihuela There are still a few bona fide fishermen about and if you can manage to drag yourself out of bed between six and eight in the morning youll see them returning to shore in their gaily painted flatbottomed wooden boats with nets of sardines and anchovies At lunchtime you can sample the mornings catch skewered on a wooden stick and grilled over a fire on the beach see page Many other popular attractions lie close at hand including the wave pools and water slides of Atlantis Aquapark the horse show at the Club El Rancho and the hole course of the nearby Parador del Golf But the biggest draw in Torremolinos continues to be the bars discos and clubs that have earned the resort its international reputation for nonstop nightlifeBenalmdenaCostaHeading west it appears at first glance that BenalmdenaCosta is indistinguishable from its close neighbor However this isnt really so In fact it is somewhat less built up and frenetic than Torremolinos even though it is well endowed with bars discos and clubs Its fine beaches stretch for  km over  miles beginning at the large and attractive Puerto Deportivo on the border with Torremolinos Focal points are the three Moorish watch towers the pink neoMoorish walls of Castillo El BilBil built by a Frenchwoman in the s and used for concerts exhibitions and as a tourist office and one of the Costa del Sols casinos at the huge and impressive Torrequebrada complexA couple of kilometers about a mile inland and high above the sea lies the village of BenalmdenaPueblo Its Museo Arqueolgico y de Arte Colombino is an institution of national importance The museum takes pride in its collection of PreColumbian art said to be the most important of its kind in Spain with jewelry statuary and ceramics from all the major cultures Also in the Benalmdena area is the Tvoli World amusement park in the suburb of Arroyo de la Miel see page  the Sea Life aquarium in the Puerto Deportivo and the Eagle Park at the Colomares CastleFuengirolaNine kilometers  miles down the line is Fuengirola another resort thats hugely popular with the British Here bacon and eggs fish and chips darts snooker English beer and bars showing English soccer games are the norm But Fuengirola has assimilated this without losing its Spanish character And this is particularly true in early October during the annual fair when the town becomes a blaze of color and noise and most every man woman and child dons typical Andalucan dress Tradition survives too as the commercial fishing fleet is an ongoing concernThe Plaza de la Constitucin in the town center has numerous pleasant cafs lining the square beneath the church bell tower and nearby is the bullring and the small Zoo Municipal Across the river at the western end of town rise the remains of the Castillo de Sohail AbderRahman III built this hilltop fortress in the th century and gradually a settlement grew up around the walls Taken by the Christians in a bloody battle in  Sohail was then leveled on the orders of the Catholic kings After it was rebuilt it was occupied by French troops during the Peninsular War who left behind a souvenir of their staythe cannons that are now displayed along the promenade of the Paseo Martimo Other attractions here include a variety of water sports a marina the fishing harbor a sailing school the waterslides of the Mijas Aqua Park the El Cartujano horse show and horse racing at the newly opened Mijas HippodromeMijasEight kilometers  miles inland from Fuengirola and clinging to the hillside is Mijas Surrounded by modern villas and urbanizaciones developments it looks from the outside like any other quaint village with whitewashed houses But Mijas is different Most of the houses have been converted into upscale shops restaurants or bars making the village itself a unique tourist attraction Traffic is banned from the center so if you dont feel like the short walk from the parking lot take a mule taxiMijas has Spains only square bullring and across from it beautifully tended gardens slope down to a clifftop mirador with fine views all along the coast There is another mirador beside the car park On one side of this natural balcony you will find a tiny chapel dedicated to the Virgen de la Pea Our Lady of the Mountain set in a grotto carved from living rockMarbellaSheltered by the mountains of the Sierra Blanca on one side and with the Mediterranean Sea on the other Marbella has earned a reputation for being the most aristocratic of Costa del Sols resorts This began in the s when Prince Alfonso von Hohenlohe bought land and built himself a luxurious home here It became so popular with his guests that he developed it into the Marbella Club Hotel and that in turn launched Marbella as a trendy gathering place for the jet set in the s Today the town is a playground for the rich and famous frequented by celebrities and politicians royalty and business tycoons As a consequence this has seen the further development both here and along the coast of the largest collection of luxury hotels in Spain Naturally then prices are much higher here than in the other coastal resorts but you get what you pay for in terms of superior standards of accommodation service and cuisineMarbella is certainly a town of two parts The largest by far is the modern section and the center of this clustered around the palm trees and fountains of the Parque de la Alameda is taken up with busy sidewalk cafs smart boutiques banks and real estate agents offices The construction of a fourlane bypass has happily put an end to the crush of traffic that regularly used to jam this part of town It is at its most attractive though by the sea where the municipality of Marbella encompasses some  km  miles of beachfront The promenade winds along the beaches of El Fuerte and Fontanilla passing a marina Puerto Deportivo with moorings for several hundred pleasure boats overlooked by the tall spire of the lighthouse Some lively beach bars and restaurants make this a popular part of townThe promenade extends west for a mile or two between attractive apartment complexes and long stretches of golden sands The monuments of modern Marbella cling to the hills on the western outskirts The King of Saudi Arabias holiday home it looks like the White House in Washington DC only slightly larger hides behind a row of pines and palms on a hilltop just above the highway surrounded by high security fences On a neighboring rise stands Marbellas modernstyle mosque the Mezquita del Rey Abdulaziz Al Saud which is open to the public every afternoon except FridayBut Marbella has its historic side too In fact its history dates back some  years even though most of what can be seen in the town at least dates from the time of the Catholic Monarchs and later North of the main road the Casco Antiguo Old Town provides an intriguing glimpse of the past that has been cleverly integrated to cater to modern visitors First sit at a caf table in the Plaza de los Naranjos Square of the Orange Trees where you can admire the noble thcentury faade of the Casa Consistorial Town Hall and soak up the atmosphere Then wander through the maze of narrow twisting streets where the whitewashed walls are decorated with colorful baskets of flowersAs you explore the neighborhood youll come across the historic parish church with its landmark bell tower and the convents of La Trinidad and San Francisco it is said that Miguel de Cervantes creator of the famous Don Quixote lodged at the latter Uphill from the church lie the crumbling walls of the Moorish castillo Scattered throughout this area also are an eclectic array of shops and galleriesOther places of interest in Marbella are the Bonsai Museum the only one in Spain and one of the best in the world and the Museum of Spanish Contemporary Engravings Housed in a structure important in its own right the latter is the first of its kind in Spain and has works by Picasso Mir Tapies and other such famous artistsJust outside of Marbella are three other places with ancient historic connections the Roman Villa mosaics dating from the first and second centuries at Ro Verde near the beach the PaleoChristian basilica Vega del Mar in San Pedro de Alcntara and the Las Bovedas The Cellars Roman baths at GuadalminaWith the increasing popularity of Marbella high society has moved west to the chic suburb of Nueva Andaluca and its magnificent harbor Puerto Bans Sleek unbelievably expensive yachts line the quayside and Bentleys Porsches Rolls Royces and Mercedes adorn the streets Theres a glamorous lineup of expensive restaurants and highclass boutiques that seem to be permanently open High rollers haunt the tables in the nearby Casino Marbella then sip martinis and watch the sun rise from the decks of their luxury yachts Even if you cant quite afford to join in its fun just to watch how the other half lives The aquarium in Peurto Bans may be small but it is interesting nonethelessThis part of the Costa del Sol is also a golfers paradise In  nearly  golf clubs were in operation between Mlaga and Sotogrande These courses cater to all levels from beginners to experts taking part in the most important competitions in the golf worlds calendar At least half a dozen quality courses can be found between the western edge of Marbella and San Pedro de AlcntaraOjnInland from Marbella lie the high peaks of the Sierra Blanca the most distinctive being La Concha The Seashell which rises directly above the town A scenic road leads to the village of Ojn famous for its aguardiente a kind of brandy once produced here and on to the mountain pass called Puerto de Ojn Just beyond a road on the left leads to the Refugio de Juanar a hunting lodge set at the heart of a large national game reserve The peace and tranquility found here has attracted numerous famous personalities Not least of these is General Charles de Gaulle of France who finished his memoirs here in  This is the haunt of mountain hare partridge and the ibex Capra pyrenaica a wild mountain goat with large horns that is unique to SpainEsteponaThis is the last major resort town on the western part of the Costa del Sol and it provides all the vacation essentials good beaches golf courses restaurants and a marinain a smalltown atmosphere Lowrise apartment blocks unpretentious restaurants and hotels overlook the palmlined Paseo Martimo a promenade furnished with park benches flower displays and a little playgroundOriginally a Roman settlement Estepona preserves the remains of Moorish fortifications and watchtowers an thcentury parish church and an expressionistic bullring a startling piece of modern architecture which is beginning to look rather worse for wear On either side of the town itself gracious and upscale hotel resorts are beginning to make an emblematic impression on the coastlineBeyond Estepona development is more sporadic though there are some luxury resorts at Sotogrande and Puerto Duquesa About  km  miles outside of town a mountain road takes you up to Casares a spectacular white hilltop village clinging precariously to the rugged slopes below its Moorish fort The road commands sweeping views of the coast and countryside and on a clear day the eye is inevitably drawn to the twin peaks flanking the Strait of Gibraltarthe Rock of Gibraltar on the right and Moroccos Jebel Musa on the left These were known to the ancients as the Pillars of Hercules and in ancient times marked the limits of the known worldToward GibraltarGibraltar looms ever larger as you approach San Roque which was established by Spanish refugees who fled the Rock when the English captured it in  Building blocks for the town were found conveniently in the nearby ruins of Roman Carteya today though little remains of the classical site Branch off the N here and head for La Lnea de la Concepcin and the Rock itself La Lnea has experienced a miniboom since the border with Gibraltar was reopened in  after a blockade lasting  years but is still a dreary placeIt has been ascertained that Gibraltar was a home for prehistoric man Neanderthal skulls were found in  and  and Gibraltar is considered one of the final bastions for this species Although it is known that the Phoenicians Greeks and Carthaginians were aware of Gibraltar and that the Romans ruled here from about  bc to ad  no town was ever built The Visigoths and Vandals destroyed almost all traces of culture in the area and it wasnt until after the Moors invaded in  that the first city was constructed However even that wasnt until nearly  years later in The next three centuries saw numerous battles and it wasnt until  that Gibraltar was finally reconquered by the Spanish In the early th century problems over succession to the Spanish throne led to an AngloDutch force capturing Gibraltar in  That led in  to the treaty of Utrecht under which Spain ceded its rights to Gibraltar to the British However the Spanish didnt give up without a fightmore than one actually In  they failed in a siege and in  combined Spanish and French forces totaling  laid the final Great Siege against just  defenders After four years of much hardship the siege ended in  It wasnt until  that Gibraltar achieved the status of a British crown colony which it holds to this dayThe town and harbor lie on the east slope of the Rock overlooking the bay with the narrow defile of Main Street cutting through the middle This is lined with dutyfree shops selling liquor perfume cameras CD players video recorders and electronic goods and Britishstyle pubs serving pints of beer and bar lunches The unit of currency is the Gibraltarian pound equal to the British pound but shops and other businesses accept pounds sterling and pesetas as wellAlso at sea level is the Gibraltar Museum housed in a building containing what are considered the best preserved Moorish baths in Europe The museum has interesting exhibits on Gibraltars history Of interest too is Nelsons Anchorage where Admiral Nelsons body is said to have been brought in a barrel of rum after the Battle of Trafalgar on  October  and the nearby ton Victorian supergun the largest gun of its type in the worldMain Street ends at the Referendum Gates Beyond lies the cablecar station where you can take a trip to the top of the Rock with a stop halfway to visit the Apes Den The tailless Barbary apes that inhabit the Rock are natives of North Africa descended from monkeys brought over by sailors as pets and ships mascots Legend has it that if the apes ever leave the Rock then British rule will come to an end When the apes population declined significantly during World War II Winston Churchill himself was worried and the monkeys have been on special rations ever since The views from the summit  m  ft up are spectacular particularly across the strait to Morocco along the coast toward Estepona and down the sheer east face of the Rock to the water holding areas for desalination and the beaches of Sandy Bay Catalan Bay and Eastern BeachWhether youre traveling in your own car or in an official taxi or minivan dont leave Gibraltar without taking a tour of the Upper Rock Nature Reserve area On the way up note the yellow patches and their accompanying metal rings these were used when manually hauling the heavy cannons up the Rock Also of interest is the fact that there is no soil on the Upper Rock the  species of wildflower here grow directly out of the limestone from which the Rock is formedFirst stop is Saint Michaels Cave an impressive natural grotto that is sometimes used as a venue for musical performances Then stop to see the apes and at the north end of the Rock take time to explore the Upper Galleries These are a system of tunnels blasted through the inside of the rock face during the Great Siege of the late th century Note that the cannon emplacements slope downward a clever innovation that allowed the defenders to fire directly at the SpanishFrench forces attacking from La Linea What cannot be seen is the  km  miles of tunnels that were excavated during World War II and it is from these that General Eisenhower conducted the Allied invasion of North Africa On the way back to the town lies the Moorish castle which apart from its thcentury tower is of little interestAlgecirasJust across the bay from Gibraltar is an uninspiring port town whose only saving grace on good days at least is its unsurpassed views of Gibraltar From the harbor hydrofoils and car ferries cross the strait to Ceuta a Spanish protectorate and to Tangier in Morocco A day trip to Ceuta is certainly possible but there is not much beyond shopping of interest there Much more interesting and exciting is to continue on about  miles to Tetuan Morocco parts of which seem to have remained unchanged for centuries Because of the twohour time difference between Ceuta and Morocco its difficult but possible to see in one day Therefore an overnight stop in Ceuta is recommended For additional information see the Berlitz Travel Guide to MoroccoTarifaThis is where the waters of the Mediterranean mingle with those of the Atlantic and bring the Costa del Sol to an end Europe looks across the Strait of Gibraltar to Africa with the Rif Mountains of Morocco dominating the horizon a mere  km  miles away A section of the old Moorish walls remains as does the th century fortress However it is not its history that attracts most visitors these days The beaches stretching to the west are a mecca for windsurfers The prevailing wind known as the Poniente is from the west making the beaches among the windiest in EuropeThe windsurfers are not the only ones to take advantage of the reliable breeze the hillsides above the town have sprouted a veritable forest of windpowered electricity generators In spring and autumn storks buzzards and other soaring birds fill the skies as they climb in the rising thermals before gliding across the strait on their annual migration congregating here where the sea crossing is at its shortestEast of MlagaThe eastern part of the Costa del Sol stretches for more than  km  miles from Mlaga to Almera This part of the coast has a different feel from the western section with less intensive development and in parts a much rockier and attractive shorelineMlaga to NerjaLeaving the suburbs of Mlaga you arrive immediately in Rincn de la Victoria a Spanish resort largely given over to weekend apartments owned by the local city dwellers But prehistoric man was here first occupying a cave on the Mlaga side of the town known as Cueva del Tesoro Treasure Cave Cave paintings and prehistoric remains including a shrine to the goddess Noctiluca have been found and there is a beautiful underground lake with stalactites According to legend five Moorish kings buried a huge treasure inside the cave but it has never been foundTorre del Mar is the gateway to the wine and raisinproducing region of the Axarqua and its capital VlezMlaga which lies  km   miles inland Founded by the Phoenicians Vlez sprawls around a historic center dominated by a Moorish alcazaba and two venerable churches the lateGothic Iglesia de San Juan Bautista and the Iglesia de Santa Mara which incorporates a section of the towns former mosqueIn the village of TorroxCosta as elsewhere on the eastern Costa selfcatering accommodations predominate over hotels Once dedicated to fishing and agriculture TorroxCosta is now an expanding resort with extensive Roman ruinsNerjaNerja is the one large international resort to the east of Mlaga and its a popular destination for British German and Scandinavian vacationers The town is smaller than the resort towns in the west and despite the intensive development in the hills surrounding it has also managed to retain some of its village atmosphere The nightlife is lively though quieter than in Torremolinos and the beaches are prettier if smaller Theyre tucked into rocky covesThe area also offers good opportunities for hiking horseback riding scuba diving snorkeling and angling giving Nerja the edge for those seeking a more active vacationHotels and restaurants cluster around the Balcn de Europa a palmfringed clifftop promenade jutting out over the sea dividing the sandy crescent of La Caletilla beach on the west from La Calahonda on the eastJust  km  miles east of the beach of Maro is the famous Cueva de Nerja Cave of Nerja This huge cavern was discovered in  when a group of local boys stumbled on it one day while they were out hunting bats Floodlights illuminate the impressive limestone formations including a stalagmitestalactite over  m  ft high and  m  ft in diameter On display are archaeological remains confirming that these caves were inhabited  years ago The Nerja Festival of Music and Dance held in early July takes place in the acoustically acclaimed Sala de la Cascada Nearby a rather attractive aqueduct stands as testimony to the creative skills of the regions earlier generationsInland from Nerja the corrugated hills of the Sierra de Tejeda rise up toward the village of Frigiliana Under the Moors it was one of the many prosperous villages within the Kingdom of Granada Today the historic center is regarded as one of the most outstanding examples of Moorish village architecture on the Costa del Sol with a lovely thcentury church and ruined Moorish castleThe Far EastAfter Nerja the scenery changes dramatically the mountains begin to cascade to the sea and the panoramas of the ragged coastline are magnificent Just before La Herradura a rather neat little town with a nice beach road signs proclaim that you are now in the Provincia de Granada Until you pass into Almera this part of the Costa del Sol the most attractive but least known is now officially called the Costa TropicalAlmucar is the first town of any size and has an ancient history A fine aqueduct stands as a monument to the skills of the Roman engineers who constructed it during the reign of Antoninus Pius in the second century ad A port for Granada in Moorish times Almucar continued to enjoy a certain prestige after the Reconquest when Juan de Herrera the architect of El Escorial Philip IIs grand monastery cum palace near Madrid was commissioned to design the parish church These days the town set around an attractive curving beach is an increasingly popular family resortAlong the road from Almucar pretty villas with spectacular coastal views dot the hillsides until all of a sudden the scenery changes dramatically As the coast flattens out a town of whitewashed houses atop a rocky coneshaped hill comes into view Called Salobrea it makes for an impressive sight A Moorish castle beautifully restored stands isolated at the heart of the villageSalobrea stands as the gateway to the agriculturally rich vega plain of the thriving port city of Motril Sugarcane the source of the greenery flourishes here The sugar refineries in the area have earned the town its nicknameLittle Cuba Like that country Motril is known for its rum although its residents are crafty enough to make just about enough for local consumption and no more Motril and Salobrea have their own extensive beaches and there are many more to come as the road continues eastwardThe next  km  miles is a conservation area and the least developed of any section of the Costa del Sol The small towns and villages reminiscent of what the rest of the coastline used to be like before the mass tourist invasion have a very limited supply of hotels which means that even in midsummer the beaches are far from overcrowded Whats more its possible to be swimming in the Mediterranean while the snowcovered peaks of the Sierra Nevada shimmer in the distanceThis scenery changes and much for the worse after Adra an important fishing and fish processing center The N crosses a vast and dreary plain where every available piece of level land has been covered by ugly plastic greenhouses that produce much of Europes winter vegetables The road rejoins the coast at Aguadulce where tourists mainly Spanish enjoy good beaches new golf courses and marinas Here the mountains meet the sea again and the journey onto Almera is short but attractiveAlmeraRich in history Almera was once the most important city in Moorish Spain The Almera of today is a pleasant provincial capital thats worth a visit if your travels take you to the eastern limits of the Costa del SolThere are only two major sights AbderRahman IIIs massive Alcazaba looms large on the hilltop above the city Although an earthquake caused extensive damage in  the crenellated ocher outer walls and a section of the turreted ramparts stand firm providing wideranging vistas over the city and the sea And the forbidding fortified cathedral that stands just inland from the waterfront Paseo de Almera was built during the th century when Barbary pirates were terrorizing the coast see page Inland from Almera lies one of the most unEuropean landscapes on the European continent The Sierra de Alhamilla is a desert of barren mountains rocky ravines and dry gravel riverbeds spiky agave plants and prickly pears are the only vegetation The regions uncanny resemblance to the American West made it a popular film location for spaghetti westerns including such classics as A Fistful of Dollars and The Good the Bad and the Ugly which set a young Clint Eastwood on the road to stardom in Hollywood Near the village of Tabernas is an area known as MiniHollywood where two spaghettiwestern film sets have been preserved as tourist attractions complete with horses cowboys and barroom brawlsInland ExcursionsFor a complete contrast to the sun sea and sangra atmosphere of the coast you need only drive inland for a few hours to reach the cultural historical and architectural attractions of Ronda Jerez de la Frontera Sevilla Crdoba and Granadathe great cities of Andaluca If your time is limited try one of the day trips offered in all the major resorts or focus your attention on Ronda Most of the other destinations require an overnight stayRondaThe opening of an improved road from San Pedro de Alcntara to Ronda has ended the isolation of this mountain area and shortened the driving time from the coast to an hour One of the most spectacularly situated towns in Europe Ronda sits atop a cliffbound plateau cleaved through the middle by a sheersided gorge The older Moorish part of town La Ciudad lies to the south of the ravine linked by an thcentury bridge to El Mercadillo the modern district that arose after the ReconquistaThe gorge known as El Tajo is a deep and narrow crevasse that plunges  m  ft to the foaming Ro Guadalevn a tributary of the Guadiaro River During the Civil War nationalist sympathizers in the town were hurled to their deaths in the gorge an event recalled by Hemingway in his novel For Whom the Bell Tolls You can enjoy a superb view of the Tajo and the patchwork of fields beyond from the Puente Nuevo New Bridge built in  as well as from the walkways that follow the edge of the gorgeCross the bridge into the Ciudad the old Moorish enclave which remained impervious to Christian assault until  to see most of Rondas most important monuments On one side of the Plaza de Campillo square stands the Palacio de Mondragn constructed by Abomelic King of Ronda in  and later taken over by the Christian conquerors A Renaissance portal a distinguished later addition opens onto spacious courtyards where horseshoe arches Arabic inscriptions and distinctive tile ornaments indicate the Moorish origins of this grand buildingA block or so away Rondas original mosque survives in the form of the Church of Santa Mara la Mayor The minaret was converted into a bell tower and a Gothic nave was tacked on to the original structure followed by a high altar in ornate thcentury Plateresque style and some finely carved Baroque choir stalls The church overlooks the Plaza de la Duquesa de Parcent the main square with the long elegant faade of the Ayuntamiento Town Hall gracing another sideHeading back toward the Puente Nuevo stop to view the exterior of the Palacio del Marqus de Salvatierra an thcentury Renaissance mansion famous for its wroughtiron balconies made in the traditional Ronda style Note also the carved stone figures above the entrance Nearby stands La Casa del Rey Moro The Moorish Kings House which is a curious combination of the water mine and gardens designed by the French landscaper Jean Claude Nicolas Forestier in the s Beyond here the road curves down toward the Tajo where two more bridgesthe Puente Viejo Old Bridge built in  on top of Roman foundations and the Moorish Puente Arabespan the gorge and offer striking views of the chasm Down by the river stands the Baos rabes Moorish Baths with the vaulted roof still intactImmediately back across the Puente Nuevo a Parador hotel occupies what was the old Town Hall and just beyond that is Rondas Neoclassical Plaza de Toros one of the oldest bullrings in Spain Inaugurated in  it is regarded as the birthplace of the modern bullfight and is something of a shrine to aficionados of the corrida It has a small but very interesting museum below the arcaded arenaCdizThe ancient city of Cdiz sitting at the end of a very narrow peninsula of land that runs parallel to the coast was founded by the Phoenicians in  bc and is considered to be Spains oldest town In fact Cdizs amazing amalgam of history is not readily apparent with only the remains of the old Roman Theater to give much evidence of the citys age It was reconquered by Alfonso X in  and granted the Monopoly of Trade with Africa by the Catholic Monarchs in  Columbus also departed from this city on his second and fourth voyages in  and  respectively In the latter part of the th century it twice came under attack by enemy naval forces and a period of prosperity ensued when the Casa de Contratacin or the monopoly rights for trade with the Americas was transferred from Sevilla by order of Felipe V in  A century later on  March  while under attack from Napoleons forces the national parliament met in the St Felipe Neri Church and proclaimed the first Spanish parliamentOf most interest in the town today is the architecturally contrasting Baroque and Classical cathedral which was constructed between  and  The elegant Hospital de Mujeres Womens Hospital built even earlier in  is notable for its patio and art collection including a fine El Greco The curious and unusual Oratorio de la Santa Cueva Church of Santa Cueva has original underground chapels dating from  Of more interest is the domed upper chapel added in  whose ceiling is adorned by five spectacular paintingsthree of which are fine examples of Goyas work The St Felipe Neri Church mentioned above is also well worth a look Built in  it has towering columns and an unusual elliptical domeEl Puerto de Santa MaraThis small town on the coast of the Bay of Cdiz looks across to the town of the same name and has considerable charm It is generally overlooked by foreign visitors but the Spanish flock here in the thousands especially during August Then when there are a series of bullfights the seafood and shellfish restaurants for which El Puerto is famous are full to overflowing until the early hours In fact there isnt too much to see here but thats okayEl Puerto de Santa Mara is one of those places that is to be savored for its ambience Positioned between Jerez de la Frontera and Cdiz El Puerto is easily reached by road or rail However the most delightful way to get here is on the small ferryboat El Adriano which plies its way between the center of Cdiz and the dockside in El PuertoJerez de la FronteraThe name of this town is indicative of two things It once lay close to the frontier of the old Moorish kingdom of Granada hence de la Frontera And Jerez pronounced khayreth gave its name to the wine that has made the town famous better known to the world in its anglicized versionsherryAlthough known as long ago as the Phoenician era Jerez first came to prominence under the Moors in the th and th centuries and it is from that period that the impressively walled and towered Alczar dates Inside is a simple but elegant mosque that was later converted into a chapel dedicated to Santa Mara la Real Reconquered by King Alfonso X in  it became one of the most prosperous towns in Andaluca after the discovery of the Americas and the reunification of Spain in Below the Alczar lies the Colegiata Collegiate Church a towering dark stone cathedral dating from the th to th centuries Housed within is the precious image of Cristo de la Via Christ of the Vineyard It was the development of the sherry wine and brandy business that brought the city worldwide acclaim and more prosperity It is impossible to walk the streets without recognizing bodegas wineries of prestigious old firms such as Harvey Williams  Humbert GonzalezByass and Pedro Domecq As some of the names imply it was a group of English merchants who launched Jerez as the world capital of fortified wineThree centuries on their descendants continue to control the sherry trade All the larger companies offer tours of their bodegas mostly on weekday mornings and some require you to reserve in advance Traditional hospitality means of course that every tour ends with a tasting sessionJerez is also famous for its horses The sherryproducing aristocracy built vast ranches alongside the vineyards which provided an ideal environment for horse breeding And the Domecq family established the worldfamous Real Escuela Andaluza del Arte Ecuestre Royal Andalucan Riding School in  as a showcase for Andalucan equestrian skills The schools Thursday dressage exhibitions are a mustsee and the annual Horse Fair in early May is a colorful eventJerez has more subtle attractions also In addition to the expected numerous churches palaces and mansions look especially for the Andalucan Flamenco Center in the distinguished Pemartn Palace and the striking Clock Museum in its own delightful gardensSevillaThe capital of Andaluca Sevilla is the most Spanish of Spanish cities One of the most beautiful cities in the world it has a sensual spiritual and romantic ambienceIt was already a thriving riverside settlement when Julius Caesar arrived in  bc and under the Romans it developed into a major town In fact two Roman emperors Hadrian and Trajan were born in nearby Itlica Subsequently Sevilla became the capital of the Visigothic kingdom and then of a Moorish taifa before falling to King Ferdinand III in  A monopoly of trade with the New World brought the city to its peak during the Golden Age Madrid is the capital of Spain the saying went but Sevilla is the capital of the worldThe two most prominent monuments in the city are located around the Plaza del Triunfo Work on the cathedral the largest Gothic church in the world and the third largest of its kindonly St Peters in Rome and St Pauls in London are biggerbegan in  after the great mosque was razed The new building followed the ground plan of the old mosque accounting for its unusually broad rectangular formMassive without and richly decorated within the cathedral contains over  chapels including the central Capilla Mayor with its Flemish altarpiece and the Capilla Real Royal Chapel last resting place of Ferdinand III the KingSaint who delivered Sevilla from the hands of the infidel The silvergilt key to the city presented to Ferdinand by the vanquished Moors may be seen in the treasury along with a cross made from the first gold brought back by Cristobal Coln Christopher Columbus from the New World The Great Navigator himself is interred nearby in the ornate thcentury sarcophagus by the south entrance His remains were transferred to Sevilla from Havana in  when Cuba won its independence from SpainOn the north side of the cathedral lies the Patio de los Naranjos Court of the Orange Trees the ceremonial courtyard of the old mosque with its original ablutions fountains The minaret dating from  was preserved as the bell tower of the cathedral this celebrated Giralda tower is Sevillas most famous landmark The exterior is beautifully decorated with typical sebka design work It contrasts vividly with the bland interior where a series of  gently elevating ramps lead to an observation platform at a height of  m  ft Ferdinand III rode his horse to the top following the Reconquista in This is the finest mirador in Sevilla and provides for unparalleled views of the old city below It is surprising to note just how large the Plaza de Toros is when seen at this angle Look up and you will see how the tower came by its name In  an earthquake destroyed the original ornamental top And it wasnt until  that the addition of the huge bells and a weather vane Giralda in Spanish in the form of a statue of a beautiful goddess representing Faith raised the height to  m  ftThe Alczar entrance on far side of the square through the Puerta del Len is a major monument to midth century Mudjar architecture combining Moorish Gothic and Renaissance elements Built by Moorish craftsmen under Christian rule during the reign of Pedro the Cruel the rambling palace and its several courtyards incorporate fragments of an earlier Moorish fortress and blend Christian motifs with Moorish designs A visit begins with a tour of the Cuarto del Almirante the Admirals Apartments where a painting of the Virgen de los Mareantes Virgin of the Mariners in the chapel shows Columbus sheltered beneath the Virgins cloak The most interesting part is the Patio de las Doncellas Courtyard of the Maidens where the rooms preserve outstanding decorative featuresornamental tiles carved stucco and characteristic coffered artesonado ceilingsThe ornate domed Saln de Embajadores Hall of the Ambassadors is equal to anything in the palace of the Alhambra Next door is the glassroofed Patio de las Muecas Courtyard of the Dolls so named for the two tiny human faces carved into the decoration surrounding one of the Moorish arches These are very unusual as Muslim crafts men were forbidden by their religion to depict the human form in their artReturning to the entrance courtyard take the narrow passage on the right to the Patio de Maria Padilla which sits on top of underground baths The apartments beyond are hung with Flemish tapestries recording Charles Vs Tunis Expedition of  one of them showing an upsidedown map of the Mediterranean Not to be missed either are the extensive and beautiful gardens an oasis of tranquillity in this perpetually busy cityNestled around the walls of the Alcazar is the Barrio de Santa Cruz the old Jewish quarter a picturesque maze of whitewashed houses narrow lanes and tiny shaded patios that invite leisurely exploration Just south of the cathedral stands the former exchange building Casa Lonja which is now the Archivo de Indias The unusual Cuban wooden shelves are of interest as well as the documents relating to the discovery and conquest of the Americas that rest on themNearby on the banks of the river is another of Sevillas icons The Moorish Torre del Oro Tower of Gold is named after the goldcolored tiles that once covered the walls of this early thcentury chesspiece castle It is all that remains of Sevillas medieval fortifications and in times of possible invasion a huge metal chain was hauled from here to the other riverbank to protect the harbor Originally used to store treasures brought from the Americas it was also used as a prison and is now a maritime museum The round top and spire were added in the middle of the th century A visit to the Museo de Bellas Artes Museum of Fine Arts housed in an early thcentury convent and the second most important museum in Spain will remind visitors that Sevilla is the birthplace of two of Spains greatest artists Velzquez and MurilloThere are of course far too many other places of interest to mention here but those with a little extra time should visit the following The Casa de Pilatos the Hospital de la Caridad Charity Hospital the Bullfighting Museum and Plaza de Toros the Parque de los Descubrimientos Discovery Park on the site of Expo  and the pedestrian shopping district centered on the Calle de las Sierpes Dont forget that two of Europes bestknown festivals take place here each spring the Semana Santa Holy Week parades and the Fera de Abril celebrationCarmonaCarmona  km or so  miles east of Sevilla on the road to Crdoba sits like a beacon on top of the only hill on an otherwise unrelenting plain That position has given it strategic importance during its year old history It was the Roman era though that brought the area prosperity and wealth and the Museo y Necropolis is the largest Roman necropolis outside of Rome itselfThe towns fortunes declined after the Romans left but the Moorish invasion of  brought with it renewed growth and prosperity The Moors reign ended in  when Carmona was reconquered by King Ferdinand II The town was divided among the victors principally the orders of Santiago and Calatrava The th and th centuries were troublesome times as well The discord was only brought to an end when in  Felipe IV agreed to grant Carmona the rights of townshipCarmonas history is also unique because the town was never under feudal rule and was protected as a satellite of the crown It is for this reason that there is such an extraordinary number of palaces mansions convents and churches in Carmona These alone make it worth a visit and the two gates that linked the old card maxim Roman road Displays Sevillaand Cordoba Crdoba shouldnt be missed Displays is especially interesting the gate is an unusually shaped small fortressCrdobaThese days Crdoba a minor provincial city sandwiched between Sevilla and Granada is often passed over by visitors to Andaluca But to do so is a considerable mistake Besides having much charm it has fabulous historic connections and an eclectic array of attractions to match Crdoba was once the largest city in Roman Spain the capital of the province of Batik and the birthplace of Seneca the Younger philosopher and tragedianIts golden era was between the midth and very early th centuries when it was the center of the great medieval Caliphate of Crdoba With a population of half a million it was one of the worlds largest and most cultured cities and the splendid capital of the western Islamic Empire It had the first university and street lighting in Europe and a library with more than  volumesThe city is dominated by the greatest surviving monument from that period which has the distinction of being the oldest monument in daytoday use in the Western worldthe Great Mosque otherwise known as La Mezquita Construction on the mosque was begun in  but it was enlarged three times before attaining its present size in  It covers an astounding area of  hectares  acres Crdoba was reconquered in  and two small Christian chapels were added in  and  No further major changes were made until the early th century when Carlos V decided to construct a Christian cathedral in the center of the mosqueSeveral gateways provide access through the high wall surrounding La Mezquita the most impressive being the monumental Mudjar Puerta del Perdn Gate of Forgiveness Pass through it into the ceremonial forecourt of the Patio de los Naranjos with its fountains and venerable orange trees to reach the entrance to the mosque Inside as your eyes adjust to the dim light you will see mesmerizing rows of columns extending into the shadows in every direction Antique shafts of porphyry onyx marble and jasper they seem to grow out of the paving stones like trees in an enchanted forest The double arches overhead striped in redandwhite form a fanciful canopy of curving branchesAt the far end set in the southeast wall is the splendid thcentury mihrab lined with marble and gold mosaics and the maksourah the enclosure where the caliph attended to his prayers In the central area of the mosque restorers have exposed to view a section of the original carved and painted wooden ceiling which was covered over with vaulting in the th centuryThe cathedral found at the very center of the forest of pillars presents an overpowering contrast to its immediate surroundings The understated simplicityand lack of human imagesof Islamic design fades completely and is replaced with an ornate blaze of color within which human images in either paint stone or wood abound Around the walls more Christian chapels line the perimeter of the mosqueNorth of the La Mezquita lies the labyrinth of narrow streets that makes up the Barrio de la Judera Jewish Quarter Some of the best restaurants and tapas bars in Crdoba are to be found here Sights to look for include the Callejon de las Flores Alley of the Flowers which is lined with houses built around flowerfilled patios that are typical of Crdoba and the thcentury sinagoga synagogue in the street called Judios Its a modest affair just one small room with a balcony for female worshippers Crdobas Jews helped the Moors to gain control of the city in  and they lived in peace under the caliphatePerhaps the most illustrious resident of the neighborhood was Moses Maimnides And a statue of the thcentury doctor philosopher and theologian stands a few steps from the synagogue in the square named in his honor Plaza de Maimnides Also in the plaza is the Casa de las Bulas which holds the interesting combination of a small market of Crdoban craftspeople selling silver filigree and tooled leather goods and the Museo Taurino Bullfighting MuseumNortheast of the mosque on the Plaza Jernimo Paz the splendid Renaissance Palacio Paz houses the Museo Arqueolgico Provincial The exhibits span the centuries from the Iberian era to the Visigothic period but pride of place goes to objects from the thcentury palace of Medina Azahara like the bronze figure of a stag taken from a fountain presented by the Byzantine emperor Constantine VIIA Christian king Alfonso XI built Crdobas Alczar de los Reyes Cristianos overlooking the river to the southwest of the mosque The ramparts offer a fine view over the old town and the river the islets in midstream each occupied by a ruined Moorish mill and the ridges of the Sierra de Crdoba low on the northern horizon The Catholic Monarchs received Columbus and planned the invasion of Granada while residents hereOther places that are worth a visit are the th century Palacio de los Marqueses de Viana with its  patios and the Plaza de la Corredera dating from the th century It is the only Castilianstyle plaza in Andaluca Stroll to the unusual Plaza del Potro which gets its name from the fountain in the center dating from  It is home to two interesting museums the Museo de Bellas Artes Fine Arts Museum and the everpopular Julio Romero de Torres Museum a museum devoted to the Crdoban artist of the same name He was born nearby and specialized in mildly erotic paintings of rather beautiful Crdobse womenEight kilometers  miles west of Crdoba lies the ruins of the intriguing city cum palace of Medina Azahara It was commissioned in  by AbdelRahman III in honor of his favorite concubine Al Zahra The Flower and its design was so grand that detailed records indicate that building materials were brought from Constantinople and other North African locations Despite such auspicious beginnings it had a short life the palace was razed with the breakup of the Caliphate of Crdoba in the very early th century Many of the materials were subsequently used on constructions in Sevilla and other towns For nearly  years it was left in ruins and not until  did the slow work of excavation begin This still continues but reconstructed royal apartments give some impression of the original magnificence of this sumptuous complex of baths schools gardens and stately apartments built on three terracesAlcal la RealThe road from Crdoba to Granada is in many sections rather dramatic you pass through mountainous scenery dotted with small whitewalled towns often crowned with castles Alcal la Real as it was known in Roman times was a Moorish fortified city from the early th century and remained a strategic bastion until the reconquest of Granada in  after which further Christian monuments were added The Fortaleza de la Mota on the summit at  m  ft is a very amazing complex combining Moorish and Christian influences along with spectacular views A particular fascination and one both beautiful and gruesome is the semiruined church whose floor has been partly excavated leaving tombs with bones and skulls exposedGranadaThe Nasrid dynasty rose to power in Granada just as the fortunes of the Spanish Moors were beginning to wane see page  The first of the line Mohammed ben Alhamar established his capital here in  after Ferdinand III had forced him from Jan Two years later Moors fleeing from the newly vanquished Sevilla swelled the population which had already been augmented by refugees from Crdoba Rather than grieve for the homes they had left behind the industrious Moors set about making Granada the grandest city of Al Andalus Over the course of the next century the hilltop palace of the Alhambra took shape Granada was the last of the great Moorish kingdoms of Andaluca to be reconquered and King Boabdils surrender to the Catholic Monarchs in January  marked the end of the Muslim Empire in SpainThe second most visited monument in Spain is the worldfamous Alhambra The Red It takes its name from the redbrown bricks used in the construction of its outer walls which rise precipitously above the deep gorge of the Ro Darro Its towers strategically command superb views over the city belowWithin the walls of the Alhambra there are four main areas to explore which are best taken in the following order the Alcazaba fortress the Casa Real Vieja Old Royal Palace the Casa Real Nueva new Royal Palace and finally the Generalife summer gardens Amazingly this complex was allowed to fall into almost total disrepair over the centuries and was used as a barracks for Napoleons troops during the Wars of Independence It wasnt until  that it was designated a National MonumentThe Alcazaba is the oldest part of the Alhambra and only the impressive outer walls and towers survive The main attraction is the view from the Torre de la Vela north over Albaicn and Sacramonte and south to the high snowcapped peaks of the Sierra NevadaThe Palacio Nazares is the highlight of the monument It was the magnificent home of the rulers of the kingdom of Granada Actually a series of palaces not just one each palace home has its own patios fountains pools and other adornments The intricacy delicacy and bountiful beauty of the design creates a visual impression that is beyond mere wordsThe Saln de Embajadores Hall of the Ambassadors or royal audience chamber is one of the most sumptuously ornamented rooms in the Alhambra Skirted with geometric tiling the walls and roof are overlaid with delicately shaped plaster stalactites reaching  m  ft to the carved and painted wooden ceiling Verses from the Koran and the name of the thcentury monarch Yusuf I are woven into the design Through the tall arched windows are magnificent views of Albaicn and the Darro The Sala de Abencerrajes recalls the aristocratic family of that name who was accused of disloyalty and collusion with the Christians by Boabdil The king invited the Abencerrajes to a reception in this very room and massacred all  of the unsuspecting family members The Patio de los Leones whose name derives from the splashing fountain in the center upheld by  stone lions the Torre de las Damas Tower of the Ladies and the old bath area are of particular interest alsoThe Casa Real Nueva though imposing is as the name implies relatively new and architecturally at odds with the more ornate older palaces some of which were destroyed to make way for it Commissioned by Carlos V in  its exterior is in the shape of a square with a surprisingly elegant twostory circular patio on the inside Considered on its own merits the building must be regarded as a fine example of Renaissance architectureTwo museums are housed inside the palace The first the Museo Nacional de Arte HispanoMusulmn Museum of HispanoMoorish Art displays such evocative artifacts as the throne of the Nasrids a wooden armchair inlaid with silver and ivory and the Alhambra Vase which once graced the Hall of the Two Sisters The second known as the Museo de Bellas Artes Fine Arts Museum contains a collection of works chronicling the development of the school of Granada between the th and th centuriesThe Generalife is found at the eastern end of the Alhambra fortifications on the neighboring hillside A modest summer palace it is surrounded by beautiful terraced gardens where oleander and roses bloom luxuriantly and delicate fountains and cascades play among the neatly clipped cypress hedgesBack down in the city the most prominent monument is the exquisite Capilla Real Royal Chapel a Renaissance chapel that serves as the mausoleum of the Catholic Monarchs The effigies of Ferdinand and Isabella lie on the righthand side of the chancel with those of their daughter Juana La Loca and her husband Felipe El Hermoso on the slightly higher monument on the left Their mortal remains have been interred in the crypt underneath since  after a ceremonial transfer of their remains from the Alhambra On exhibition in the sacristy are mementos of the Catholic Monarchs including Ferdinands sword and Isabellas scepter and crown a circle of gold embellished with acanthus scrollsThe cathedral next door is large and imposing A few steps away is the Alcaicera area the old silk market of the Moors These days it is a colorful collection of narrow lanes that serve as a center for the sale of handicrafts and souvenirs Not far away is the Corral del Carbn House of Coal Dating from the th century it is the oldest Moorish monument in the city and is now a center for typical Granadino arts and craftsAlbaicn the old Moorish district on the hill opposite the Alhambra has a maze of narrow streets and staircases surrounding its ancient whitewashed houses and enclosed patio gardens Down by the Darro River is the exquisite Casa de Castril dating from  and home of the Archaeological Museum as well as nearby thcentury El Bauelo Moorish baths Farther up the hill is the Mirador San Nicols From here you get the best view of the Alhambra framed by the snowcapped Sierra Nevada mountains in the backgrounda scene replicated on many postcards High to the right of Albaicn is the Gitano Gypsy area of Sacramonte famous for its caves and tablaos literally stages where gypsies for the benefit of tourists reenact wedding ceremonies Tourists though should be wary especially at night as this is not the safest part of townLying about  km  miles east of Granada on the road to Murcia is Guadix a particularly unusual city in that many of its inhabitants are troglodytes In the Barrio Santiago there are streets with houses that have their own small front yards and faades that on the surface make them indistinguishable from ordinary homes Look closely though and the white circular chimneys emanating from the rocks give the game away These are actually caves with a practical use theyre cool in summer and warm in winter There is plenty else of interest here including a Moorish castle dating from the th and th centuries a late thcentury cathedral and many important palaces houses and churchesLas AlpujarrasThis is a remote area even today located as it is between the Sierra Nevada and Sierra de la Contraviesa mountain ranges with the southern slopes of the latter dropping graciously into the Mediterranean Sea Not particularly pretty it is dotted with small towns and villages that retain many appearances of a lifestyle long since departed from other areas The way of life here in the early th century was detailed explicitly by Gerald Brenan in his book South from Granada In fact these communities fall into one of two areas depending on their altitude and climate those in La Alpujarra Alta the high Alpujarra just south of the highest peaks in the Sierra Nevada and those in La Alpujarra Baja the low Alpujarra in the Sierra de la Contraviesa Trevelez considered the highest village in Spain is famous for its jamn serrano dried cured ham and Lanjarn is familiar throughout Spain as the name on the red green and white label on bottles of water originating from the towns springs Incidentally that same water runs free from the fuentes fountains of many villagesThe main entrance to Las Alpujarras is from the Granada to Motril road the same road along which the defeated Moors traveled on their way to exile Even today there is a place on that road just  km  miles south of Granada that bears the sad name El Puerto del Suspiro del Moro the Pass of the Sigh of the Moor It is from here that distant Granada finally fades from view and the land takes its name from the comments made by the defeated King Boabdils mother when he supposedly wept while looking back at the city Somewhat cruelly she is reported to have told him Dont cry like a woman for something you couldnt defend as a manAndalucas Natural ParksAndaluca has an abundance of natural parks ranging from those with international fame to more obscure remote nature preserves Below some of the most interesting are describedThe Sierra Morena This nearly  km mile mountain range runs from the mountains of southern Portugal in the west to the border of the Provincia de Murcia in the east effectively forming the border between Andaluca and most of the rest of SpainCovering an area of  hectares  acres the Sierra Morena encompasses no fewer than seven natural parks namely the Sierra de Aracena y Picos de Aroche the Sierra Norte de Sevilla the Sierra de Hornachuelos the Sierra Cardea y Montoro the Sierra de Andjar Despeaperros and the Sierra de Cazorla Segurla y Las VillasEach of these parks has its own attributes and the whole area is a stronghold of the Spanish Lynx but the highest peaks and the most dramatic scenery is found in the last of these which is also the birthplace of the great Guadalquivir RiverDoana National Park This is probably the most famous park in Spain It holds many national and international honors and is even listed as a World Heritage Site Consisting of  hectares  acres it is bordered on two sides by the Atlantic Ocean and the Guadalquivir River as it winds its way down from Sevilla to reach the ocean at Sanlcar de Barrameda In fact Doana is the last great lowland wilderness sanctuary in southern Europe and has three distinct ecosystems the marismas salt marshes matorral brushwood and las dunas sand dunes Within its bounds can be found an amazing array of animal bird and plant life but what you see is very much dependent upon the time of year you visit and even then can be very hit or missThe only way to really see the park is on a tour organized by Coop Andaluz Marismas del Rocio whose largewheel buses depart from the visitors center at El Acebuche Be forewarned though this is a very bumpy rough ride and definitely not advisable for those with artificial hips or physical handicaps Lasting about four hours it enters the sand dunes at Matalascaas and the first part of the trip is along  km nearly  miles of unspoiled beaches The only human residents here are the fishermen living in what look like very ramshackle huts albeit with wheel drive vehicles and TV antennas on display The vast stretches of salt marshes are fascinating with many animals living along the edge of the grassland adjoining them The huge sand dunes perpetually changing make for a surreal sightLaguna de Medina Across the Guadalquivir and just about  km  miles east of Jerez de la Frontera is this small lake one of the last stops in Europe for birds migrating south from northern and central Europe to Africa at the end of August In periods of drought it is attractive to birds that usually reside at Doana and around  species have been observed hereGrazalema A short distance to the east of Laguna de Medina is the mainly mountain wilderness of the natural park of Grazalema Its  hectares  acres are home to three species of eagles and numerous other birds mammals and reptiles Interestingly the mountains here which range between  and  meters  and  ft are the first stop for clouds arriving from the Atlantic giving the area the greatest annual rainfall in Spain This allows a fine array of flora to thrive Of particular note is the rare abies pinsapo Spanish fir treeEl Torcal de Antequera and the Fuente de Piedra Just south of the city of Antequera is one of the more famous geological formations in Spain The limestone mountains of the El Torcal de Antequera have eroded to form some of the most unusual shapes seen anywhere In fact these formations so resemble modern sculptures that they have been assigned comical names Just north of Antequera droughts notwithstanding is the Fuente de Piedra Andalucas largest lake with a surface area that can reach  hectares  acres Each spring provided that weather conditions are favorable it becomes a home to flamingos In fact it is the only inland breeding area in Europe for this colorful species Springtime means the islet of La Colonia becomes one of the most crowded bird habitats anywhere more than  breeding pairs were identified in  Over  species of birds have been counted on the lake or in surrounding areasSierra Nevada  Las Alpujarras This recently created national park which begins near Granada has the distinction of having the highest peak on the Spanish mainland Mulhacn is  meters  ft tall and a wide diversity of flora made possible by the nearby Mediterranean Biosphere Reserve It also has the highest road in Europe Along it is the Solynieve literally Sun and Snow skiing resort accessible yearround at some  m  ft and the more elevated Pico Veleta the Weathercock at  m  ft which can only be reached during a few short weeks in summer
