                                 The KiddieCash Caper            Recent campaignfinancerevelations have focused on the vast and unregulated sums of soft money thatflowed through the  campaigns While much of this fund raising wassleazy most of it was legal But there is another category of sleazy givingwhere the law is not murky kiddie cashcontributions made by parents in thename of their children            The lawhere is simple When it comes to hardmoney donations an individual can giveonly up to  to a federal campaign during an election cycle Butincreasingly many parents who have maxed out seem to be using theirchildrens names to give more Unless it can be shown convincingly that a childactually directed the gift and controls the money in question suchcontributions violate the law Not only is giving more than  illegal butgiving money in another persons name is also a violation Fines range up totwice the size of the gift If a campaign could be shown to have orchestratedsuch a kiddiecash drive the penalties are even more severeup to fiveyears in prison and a  fine for each count of conspiracy to lie to thegovernment A confidential Democratic National Committee fundraising memowarned of the peril Reporting a contribution from someone in the name ofsomeone else is a very serious offenseoften resulting in criminalliability            The law notwithstanding candidates in both parties havestepped up their kiddiecash collections Contributions of more than from persons listed as students in Federal Election Commission records havemore than  In the  cycle Sen Edward Kennedy DMass set the recordfor such collections  In the runup to the last presidential electionClintons campaign took in more than  in kiddie cash outscoring hisopponent almost to Bob Dole who raised similar amounts of hard moneyraised some  from kids last year            The Guptafamily of Omaha Neb is among the more generous sources of student cashVinod Gupta is the founder and CEO of American Business Information Campaigngifts totaling  tied him at No  on the Mother Jones list oftop contributors His sons Jess age  Benjamin  and Alexander gave an additional  All this went to two campaignsClintons andNebraska Gov Ben Nelsonsin which the senior Gupta had reached hismaximum            Jess a student at Philips Exeter Academyfreely admits he had nothing to do with the donations Dad makes thosedonations in my name he says Vinod Gupta insists his son was misquoted            In factall the money came from trust funds set up in the names of the childrenaccording to their father This is a common practice among the kiddiecash setYet the FEC has ruled in the past that donations from a source over which thedonor does not have sole control are illegal            The Guptas are not alone in their familial largessAccording to FEC records at least  and perhaps  of the top  politicaldonors last year two in the top  were joined by one or more children orgrandchildren from preteens to grad students in giving to their favoritecandidates These earned four White House sleepovers eight White Housecoffees two trade missions and four memberships to the Republican PartysTeam             Smaller givers are in goodcompany as well Among the somewhat less generous parents and other relativesof kiddie donors are Clinton Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles the winemakingGallos the Florida sugarcane Fanjuls Wall Street billionaire George Sorosand former Tennessee Gov Lamar Alexander            Typical ofa largescale kiddiecash operation are the Bransons of Dallas No  on theMother Jones list The Branson kids Buck Frank L IV and Jenniferwere listed as students on  worth of FEC filings donations that addedto their triallawyer parents  All the money went to candidates towhom their parents had already donated            The take may be even larger than the studentdonor tally indicates A crosscheck of names and addresses of known studentdonors with persons who left the occupation spot in other FEC filings blankor listed college namesother employment revealed another  in giftsfrom the same donors The yearold Jess Gupta male student for exampleis listed as a housewife in another filing The group of student donors whocollectively gave  to Clinton used different designations whencontributing an additional  to him and others            In factthere is no way to tell how many kids and how much money may be involved sincemany FEC filings are incomplete Last year the DNC fully identified only percent of its donors            Hundreds of politicians attract small numbers of studentcontributions But some campaigns seem to specialize in their receipt Morethan  percent of the  such contributions made in the last cycle up fromonly  in  was received by just  candidates Click for a rundownof candidates and organizations that raised more than  fromstudents            Didcampaigns orchestrate such donations Some evidence from public records issuggestive In every case where I was able to establish a parentchildrelationship minors gave to exactly the same campaigns as their parentsalmost always on the same day Many are strategically timed Ninety percent ofClintons  student donations for example were raised during the primarywhen his need for hard money was greatest and his donor base was smallestIncidentally half of the  donations failed when first disclosed to theFEC to reveal that the source was a student In Clintons last campaign percent of student donations came in just one month September half thatin just two days            Many of the young donors parents are longtimepolitical activists who know the rules Some were sophisticated campaignfundraisers themselves For example David Grossman the son of StevenGrossman the DNCs new head contributed  When headed the DemocraticSenatorial Campaign Committee in  it raised about  grand in kiddiecash That election was a highwater mark for student donations in anonpresidential yeartwice the level of the  campaigns Westbrook alsohad some familial help His son now collegeage has given more than over the years            Anotherbig Democratic money raiser Howard Glicken also was helped by his sonsGlicken is credited with having brought in more than  million to the DNC andClinton campaigns Aaron and Stephen Glicken came up with extra donations forClinton and for Sen Tom Harkin of Iowa Former MCA chairman Lew Wassermanraised more than  million for Clinton his kids chipped in  ArthurSchechter raised  million for the Democrats his offspring ponied up morethan             While Clinton won the kiddiecash sweepstakes for thecycle the leading contenders in the primary season were two cashhungryRepublicans Texas Sen Phil Gramm who raised  and Lamar Alexanderwho raked in  in student cash mostly from homestate stalwartsAlexanders own highschoolage son chipped in as did the children of one ofGramms finance chairmen Whitewater investigatorinchief Al DAmato RNYraised  from kids            Even soDemocrats have dominated this field On the list of the top  recipients ofkiddie cash Democrats outraised Republicans by about  RobertTorricelli recently chosen to head up the partys  campaign efforts was aleading recipient taking in more than  from people listed as studentsin FEC records            One obvious explanation for this dominance isthat GOP advantages in fund raising drive Democrats to reach deeper into thepockets of their regulars The Democrats big TV buys also increased theirappetite for hard money DNC rules require that part of each issue ad be paidfor with hard money As White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes noted ina July  memo failure to raise enough hard money would mean that part ofthe soft money the DNC had amassed couldnt be spent            Anotherspur to kiddiecash collectors is that the FEC has never shown much interest inpursuing the issue though two adult daughters of one big giver Harold CSimmons recently sued their father for dipping into their trust funds to makecontributions in their names Just recently the commission in negotiating asettlement with the campaign of Sen Bob Bennett RUtah dropped the matter ofapparently illegal donations made in the name of the Huntsman chemical companychildren one of whom was a severely retarded minor The contributions werereturned after the FEC opened its investigation In other cases the FECaccepted letters from yearolds as sufficient proof that they controlleddonation money without ever interviewing the child Even the lamest story doesnot seem to stir the commissions suspicion One father informed the FEC thathis daughter earned the money for her  contribution from raisingvegetables cucumbers and onions specifically                           Addendum  This weeks newspapers drew attention to onekiddiecash case in which the government has apparently taken action Nora andGene Lum two major Democratic fundraisers have agreed to plead guilty tofelony charges that they arranged  in illegal political contributions in Their daughter Trisha has also been charged with a misdemeanor foracting as an illegal conduit for  in contributions
