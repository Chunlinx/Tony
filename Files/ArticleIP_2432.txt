                                 Stapled            In fullpage ads in majornewspapers Staples and Office Depot assure the public that their proposedmerger into a  billion officeproducts giant will lead to lower prices foroffice supplies Their larger operations and greater buying ability theysay will produce lower costs and that will mean bigger savings for you Howthoughtful            But maybeyou suspect that when the two top competitors in a market stop competing andmerge the result will be higher prices not lower This kind of thinking goesby the name of antitrusta concept thats been out of fashion in recentyears The Federal Trade Commission shares your suspicion and voted  tohold up the deal The FTC has even been inviting public comments overthe Internetreportedly a first for any federal agency And the Web ischattering with amateur antitrust sleuths To read the discussion or to joinin yourself check out some of the newsgroups addressing the topic            For some people office supplies are a subject thatinspires much passion The CEO of Office Depot told Reuters that hes usingbodyguards because of threats apparently from his employees A few of theseemployees at least seem to buy their executives argument that the mergerwill probably lead to price cuts because it will definitely lead to jobcuts Other believers include investors who have bid up the stock prices ofboth firms            Is itpossible that Staples and Office Depot have a case That their merger would begoodor at least would not be badfor consumers Since the s both theDepartment of Justice and the FTC have taken a far more tolerant view ofmergers and acquisitions partly on the grounds that increasing internationalcompetition provides a check on US conglomerates Few Americans of coursebuy their office supplies in foreign countries But the agency has also becomemore sensitive to the details of particular products and markets Bigness perse is no longer sufficient grounds for suspicion Account must be taken asmany economists have long argued of the greater operating efficiencies andhence presumed lower costs produced by concentration Moreover if a companyhoards its savings from size instead of passing them on to consumers in lowerprices new competitors will enter the business            But the merger of two former competitors isinherently more suspicious than a company that comes to dominate the marketthrough its own growth And appreciation of the competitive markets marvelouscapacity for selfregulation can be carried to extremes Markets bearwatchingand common sense is often a better guide to regulators than theadvice of battling experts These experts will run regression analyses andestimate the crosselasticities of demand And they will computeHerfindahlHirschman indexes that show the measure of concentration in a givenmarket And in the end the regulators will have to consult their ownjudgment            Considerthe question of what constitutes the market in which Staples and Office Depotcompete The companies want to define the market as broadly as possible Theywould include not only such smallscale officesupply retailers as may survivein the cities they have invaded but mammoth outlets like WalMart and CircuitCity which sell some office supplies By this measure the companies analystsfigure the combination of Staples  superstores in  markets across theUnited States and Canada and Office Depots  North American outlets mostlysuperstores would still command less than  percent of the market            But the FTC takes a different view Sure you can buy manyof the products that Staples and Office Depot sell in other places But theirstrength as competitors lies in their being onestop officesupply superstoreswhere all these products are brought together in one often bewilderingagglomeration And in this market there are only three competitorsStaplesOffice Depot and a third rival Office Max A merger of the first two wouldallow them to control twothirds or more of the relevant market dominatesuppliers and drive out upstart competitors            The FTChas some telling facts to back up its theory The agency has sales data showingthat prices are lower in markets where two of the three superstorescompeteand lower still where all three are in local competition In otherwords forget marketshare equations Look at prices to find the real storyAnother commonsense check One big reason that Staples was anxious to mergewith Office Depot was that it feared an Office Depot invasion of its home turfNew England What did it fear exactly if not that competition would force itto lower its prices            The essential question is whether the predictedcost efficiencies of a merger will outweigh the lost discipline provided bycompetition It is ironic to see for example the Wall Street Journalfulminating against government interference with this merger since the notionthat the efficiencies of bigness outweigh the discipline of competition used togo by the name socialism or even the name communism            Is thecostcutting story plausible As a dominant buyer Office Behemoth couldcommand concessions from Paper Clip Inc But surely these two superstore chainsare already big enough to squeeze suppliers quite effectively Whats to gainMore likely any cost savings would come from eliminating stores in sharedmarketsthat is from eliminating stores that currently compete with eachother            The FTC seems inclined to steer a middle course Permit themerger on condition that Office Behemoth sell off  superstores to theremaining competitor Office Max The stores would be sold at bargain pricesand many are located in communities where there would otherwise be nopostmerger competitor The commission seems to be giving some credence to theclaimed benefits of the merger while hedging its bets on the competition issueby shoring up Office Max and seeding healthy retail conflict in scores ofcommunities            Thismoderate course doesnt satisfy the most avid consumerists Ralph Nader forexample notes that if Office Max now supports the merger which it does thatmakes you wonder how much real competition is in the offing If the fastfoodworld had only three players and McDonaldss proposed to buy out Burger Kinghow reassured would we be if they offered the palliative of selling a fewfranchises to Taco Bell Do you take comfort that in some sense Red Lobsterwill provide competition Not much            Much of the Internet discussion about thismerger frames the issue as Which is worse Big Business or Big Regulator Inmy view the FTC seems to be getting the balance about right neither rollingover and playing dead nor being blind to business practicalities and longruncompetitive innovation in retailing new kinds of superstores discountshopping on the Net Who knows            Interestingly too the FTCseems to have picked an issue to take a stand on that really matters to peopleoutside the Washington
