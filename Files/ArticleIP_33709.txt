                                 The Cocaine Question            Thisweekend Adam Clymer of the New York Times reported that George W Bushresponding in Ohio to a question about longago cocaine abuse had issuedanother awkward answer of the sort that had made the issue linger ATimes Media Watch story noted that Bushs previous answers hadobviously failed to end the questioning What both articles neglected tomention was who had asked the question in Ohio Adam Clymer            Thispractice of selfconcealment which reporters pass off as objectivity is oneof the great frauds of American journalism While many opinion writers argueopenly that the cocaine question is legitimatepointing out for example thatBush has jailed drug offenders and that Republicans have investigated PresidentClintons sex lifemost news reporters pretend that the question isimmaculately conceived and needs no justification Reluctant to become part ofthe story news reporters press the question while obscuring their complicityin keeping it alive Instead they tell readers that the question is doggingBush Nonsense Questions dont dog politicians Reporters dog politicians Andwhile theyre dogging Bush they ought to account for dodging a few questionsof their own                            Whos asking                the cocaine question Journalistspretend that the question drives itself It hounds haunts and stalksBush It percolates persists and swirls around him It is turbulencea storm a blizzard John Stacks a Time editor who has led the drugfrenzy said the question has a kind of organic life These things take on alife of their own agreed Dan Balz of the Washington Post  It followedBush from Texas to Ohio today the question that will not go away NBCsBrian Williams reported Thursday night The questions would not go awayagreed NBC correspondent David Bloom And who exactly had followed Bush andasked him the question that day David Bloom                            Whos judging                Bushs answers Not the media Theydont evaluate the merits of a candidates remarks They just assess whetherthe remarks will succeed or fail politically Rather than treat the cocaineinquiry as a dialogue in which the questions as well as the answers are subjectto rational scrutiny most reporters depict it as a force of nature Bushsreplies have failed to douse the questions dampen the controversy orturn down the heat On the contrary they have stoked a brush fire fedthe story and given it oxygen with the automatic and absolutelyinevitable effect of keeping it going Journalists are just part of thisautomatic cycle Theyre not hurting Bush Hes hurting himself                            Why is the                press pursuing him Reporters whoacknowledge their role in the assault seldom offer a reason They say theyrejust doing what comes naturally and Bush is to blame for provoking them Hisanswers opened the door courted scrutiny and encouraged more questionsHis not answering it is just like waving red meat in front of carnivoresargued Susan Feeney of the frenzyleading Dallas Morning News  Itsinevitable that reporters will push until theres an answer On GoodMorning America  ABCs Charles Gibson told George Stephanopoulos You knowthe press Bushs answers wont push the questions away and hell get themagain and again Boys on the bus will be boys on the bus                            Whats wrong                with his answers Journalists who admitto judging Bushs answers generally accuse him of shifting backpedalingaltering and reversing And what exactly did he reverse He reversed hisstance of not going beyond acknowledging youthful mistakes  complained theTimes  Maureen Dowd  First it was seven years then it was years then it was  years The complaint is not that Bush reversed hisstorythere is no contradiction in being drugfree for seven  and yearsbut that he reversed his spin obliging his advisers to defend thechange of strategy Why concede a politicians substantive consistency whenyou can attack his tactical vacillation                            Did he                use cocaine Careful journalists never infersuch impropriety Instead they posit the appearance of improprietywarning that Bushs answers create an appearance at least that he hassomething to hide and leave the implication that he used hard drugs Hisassertion of marital fidelity according to the Times  only adds tothe impression that he is hiding something about other aspects of his life Byconfining their inferences to such impressions the media sidestep theunpleasant duty of ascertaining the truth                            Is he                lying Again scrupulous reporters eschew thisquestion focusing instead on public perception Dowd Paul Gigot of theWall Street Journal  and Chris Black of CNN concluded that Bush lookslike and sounds like hes dissembling The Post suggested that Bush may have created the impression withvoters that he is being cute or coy rather than forthcoming Other punditstoo scrupulous to characterize the publics perceptions of Bush quoted theircolleagues perceptions of the publics perceptions Several people said that George Bush came off as Clintonesque ventured CBSs Bob SchiefferSince the media decline to characterize the truth perception is all thatmatters Inconsistencies and ambiguities real or imagined are to journalistsas catnip to the cat shrugged the New York Daily News  justifying thedrug storys persistence                            Is the                controversy important Pundits tend to ignorethis question focusing instead on how Bush is handling the crisis Whatdisturbed me this past week more was not even the fundamental issue but it wasthe handling of it said ABCs Cokie Roberts Gigot agreed What should especiallydisturb Republicans is Mr Bushs political judgment If theres bad news toget out Politics  says release it as early as possible                   Time                called the controversy the first big public test ofBushs instincts and of his staff and the results were pretty wobbly Otherpublications too timid to endorse even this superficial assessment reportedthat analysts and top Republicans were questioning Bushs erratic handlingof the drug question and warning that his candidacy had been bruised by hishandling of the issue                            What exactly                is the question The media imply thatBush keeps refusing to say whether he has used cocaine But thats not how thequestion has generally been posed during this twoweek frenzy The firstversion crafted by CNNs RowlandEvans was Sir is it not in your interest to tell us flatly if theserumors are or are not true  Everybody saysevery politicianthat itsto your disadvantage not to answer it The second version posed by a Reuterscorrespondent was whether Bush thought rumors of his cocaine use were beingplanted A third version posed by USA Today  was How can you makequestions about whether you used illegal drugs in your youth go away Wontthey dog your campaign until you answer As Bushs inquisitors focus less onthe truth and more on politics the inquisition becomes selfjustifying            BushsRepublican rivals are happy to exploit and hide behind the mediaspseudoobjectivity While defending Bushs privacy Sen John McCainstipulated that it is the media and the American people who decide whatquestions should be asked A spokesman for Gary Bauer agreed Gary feels thecandidates dont determine what is the statute of limitations on questions ofcharacter and committing a felony The American people and the press do DanQuayle called the drug story a side show but added that Bushs wounds wereselfinflicted  The general principle is that these questionsunfortunately are going to be asked Sen Orrin Hatch concluded I dontthink its going to go away  The media is going to beat it to death untilhe finally has to just say one way or the other            Itshard to feel sorry for Bush given his preposterous spins on the question Hesays hes stonewalling it because divulging past drug abuse sends bad signalsto your children Bushs surrogates claim that hes leading a heroic effortto purge the system of this gotcha politics Hes making himself apositive role model for kids and displaying the leadership for which theAmerican people are hungering George Bush is the first guy in the line offire whos had the guts to stand up and say Im not going to play by the oldrules anymore  former GOP Chairman Haley Barbour boasted on television thisweekend House Majority Whip Tom DeLay RTexas chastised Bushs rivals forfailing to show the same courage that George W has shown by taking a standagainst personal destruction Comments like these make you wonder not whetherBush and his friends ever used cocaine but whether they ever stopped            Thepoint is not that the question is unfair The point is that the power to chooseand craft questions is more profound than the power to choose and craftanswersand with that power goes responsibility When the question is ascontroversial as the answer journalists who report the exact answer and whosaid it ought to report the exact question and who asked it And if its theirquestion they ought to justify it In Newsweek  for example Stuart Taylor Jr spends an entirecolumn proposing and defending a better question than the media have asked Bushso far Would you seek long prison terms for todays yearolds for doingwhat you say you may or may not have done as a young manand when you nowsuggest that whatever you did was a mere youthful indiscretion and thusirrelevant to your candidacy You can decide for yourself whether you likeTaylors questionand thats the point He has thought it through spelled itout and told you whos asking it and why            Thesame cant be said for the New York Times  In its editorial on thecocaine controversy the Times advised Bush to be honest and to letthe country take his measure In his campaign the governor has emphasized theimportance of assuming responsibility for ones own actions He should bethinking now about how to set a good example So should the Times
