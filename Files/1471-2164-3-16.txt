                    Background        Cancer is a progressive genetic disease that involves        the accumulation of multiple and heterogeneous genetic and        epigenetic changes Among the    human genes             an expanding list of genes has been shown to be        involved in cancer development and progression Recently        developed technologies including cDNA microarrays allow        cancer researchers to screen thousands of genes        simultaneously to identify genes that show abnormal        expression in cancers               Cancer researchers face a serious challenge when trying        to apply these tools to clinical cancer specimens First        cancers are often detected at a late stage in development        after multiple genetic and epigenetic changes have rendered        the cancer metastatic and highly refractory even to harsh        treatment Multiple clones in the same tumor mass which        can often be distinguished by morphological features would        yield more information if they could be microdissected and        analyzed separately Second tumor tissues invariably        include a mixture of different cells such as inflammatory        cells stromal cells vascular cells and others Each type        of cells may contribute to a unique aspect of the cancer        phenotype and may serve as a target for treatment        Therefore there is a need to dissect those cells for        separate study For example it was found that tumor        vascular cells have distinct gene expression profiles from        those of normal vascular cells     and the genes that        are uniquely expressed on the surface of tumor endothelium        cells can serve as targets for specific cancer therapy        Finally a key breakthrough in cancer treatment would come        from early detection and diagnosis of cancer and the study        of molecular events in the early stages of cancer        progression A difficulty in studying cancer at early        stages is that the tumor size is small and only limited        material can be obtained through means such as fine needle        aspiration Identification of the genetic changes in such a        small sample is especially challenging because only limited        assays can be performed using conventional approaches It        is obvious that the full potential of genomic technologies        will only be realized if they can be applied to minute        amounts of biological material        For a typical gene expression profiling experiment        carried out on a glass microarray where thousands of cDNA        probes are deposited in an orderly manner RNA is first        isolated from the biological material under study The mRNA         of total RNA is reverse transcribed to cDNA during        which process fluorescent dyes Cy or Cy are        incorporated The labeled cDNAs are hybridized to the        microarray and after washing the fluorescent signals are        detected by a laser scanner Current protocols typically        require more than  g of total RNA for consistent        microarray hybridization Several hundred milligrams of        tumor tissues are often needed to obtain this much RNA        which is simply unavailable in many situations Thus it is        crucial to develop a more sensitive and reliable procedure        that requires less RNA Several molecular biology        approaches such as T in vitro transcription and PCR based        assays have been attempted       However only        cursory analysis has been carried out to validate the        assays and limited confirmation experiments have been        performed to evaluate the validity of the amplification        results        In this study we performed and analyzed a set of nine        microarray experiments to evaluate an amplification        protocol adopted from Wang         et al     Focusing primarily on        the ability to identify differentially expressed genes we        developed the following criteria for a successful        amplification protocol         Because amplification may enhance the signal of genes        expressed at low copy numbers more genes should be        detected by an amplification protocol than by a regular        protocol         Most genes detected as differentially expressed using        a regular protocol should also be detected using an        amplification protocol In other words the two protocols        should reveal similar patterns of differential        expression         An amplification protocol should generate signal        intensity profiles as reproducibly and reliably as a        regular protocol         Microarray results obtained from an amplification        protocol should match data obtained from other molecular        biology approaches such as northern blotting western        blotting and immunohistochemistry assay        Our results showed that our amplification protocol        produced reproducible reliable microarray data that was        consistent with the regular protocol We also confirmed        that our amplification protocol revealed accurate        information about the differential expression of low copy        number genes that failed to give sufficient signal        intensities using the regular protocol Therefore many        clinical experiments for which only a minute amount of        material is available can be pursued using this        protocol                    Results                  Enhancement of signal intensity for genes expressed          at a low copy number          We expected the amplification protocol to increase the          signal intensity of low expressing genes in other words          the number of genes having measurable signal intensity          above background levels from using the amplification          protocol should be higher than that using the regular          protocol We used SN   to determine if a gene has          measurable signal intensity on an array ie if the          difference between signal intensity and background          intensity is greater than  SD of the local background          then the gene gives adequate signal intensity We          assessed all  arrays the results are summarized in          Table  The results showed that the number of genes          whose SN ratio exceeds  SD of background is          consistently higher in both channels when using the          amplification protocol The signal intensities of low          expressors indeed are improved so that more genes          turned out to be detectable Our result also showed that          the PCR step  or  cycles before aRNA amplification          had no detectable effect on the final results                          Consistent patterns of differential gene          expression          Finding differentially expressed genes is one of the          goals of microarray technology Ideally both the regular          and amplification protocols would identify the same list          of differentially expressed genes We did not expect to          see identical lists of differentially expressed genes          generated from the two protocols since we may not even          achieve that goal using the same protocol twice due to          the variability associated with microarray experiments                However we do want to see most          differentially expressed genes appearing on both          lists          To identify differentially expressed genes we          computed smooth tstatistics To apply this method we          first computed the mean log intensity and the standard          deviation for the replicated spots within each channel          Since the standard deviation varies systematically with          the mean we then fit a smooth curve representing the          standard deviation as a function of the mean After          pooling the smooth estimates of standard deviation from          the two channels we used the pooled estimates to compute          a tstatistic for each gene      These smooth          tstatistics can also be viewed as studentized log          ratios ie as log ratios between channels that have          been rescaled to account for the intrinsic          variability          We found that the consistency and reproducibility of          smooth tstatistics between experiments is high          regardless of the protocol being used We quantified the          reproducibility using the concordance coefficient which          is analogous to the correlation coefficient but measures          how well a set of points matches the identity line                The concordance between experiments using the          regular protocol ranged from  to  with a          median of  The concordance using the amplification          protocol ranged from  to  with a median of           The concordance between the experiments using          different protocols ranged from  to  with a          median of           Using data from all experiments performed with the          regular protocol we computed a combined set of smooth          tstatistics We computed a similar set of tstatistics          using data from all experiments performed with the          amplification protocol Genes are viewed as          differentially expressed if the smooth tstatistic          exceeds some threshold for this study we chose genes          with smooth tstatistic greater than four in absolute          value Using this criterion we found that the regular          protocol identified  genes that were differentially          expressed between U and LN cell lines and the          amplification protocol identified  differentially          expressed genes Fifteen genes were common to both lists          Thirteen genes were found using the amplification          protocol but not the regular protocol the smooth          tstatistics for these genes ranged in absolute value          from  to  with a median of  Six genes were          found using the regular protocol but not the          amplification protocol the smooth tstatistics for these          genes using the amplification protocol ranged in absolute          value from  to  with a median of  In every          case the sign of the tscores was the same using the          different protocols indicating that the same cell line          overexpressed the gene                          Reproducibility and reliability of signal          intensity          To evaluate whether the amplification protocol          preserved signals that were seen using the regular          protocol we first found all the spots in each channel          U or LN that consistently had SN   in all          five experiments using the regular protocol We then          computed the percentage of those genes that also had SN            on each of the arrays using the amplification          protocol We found that  to  of the genes that are          consistently found to be expressed using the regular          protocol were also found to be expressed using the          amplification protocol For U on four amplified          arrays the percentages are    and  for          LN    and                           Confirmation of the results from amplification          experiments          A key criterion for the validity of microarray          experiments is whether the results are real and can be          confirmed by other approaches In order to obtain          representative information rather than noise from          nonspecific binding of targets to the DNA probes in a          microarray experiment the hybridization has to be          specific To demonstrate the hybridization specificity in          our microarray experiments we selectively labeled a          specific target such as actin or GAPDH with one dye and          hybridized to the microarray Our results showed that the          specific target only hybridized to its corresponding          spots on the array     Second in order to confirm          the results the clones printed on the microarray have to          be correct and error free This is an important issue          because most clone libraries used for making microarrays          contain significant errors To surmount this problem all          the clones printed on our microarrays were sequence          verified before printing     Because of those          quality control measures we expected that our microarray          results should be confirmed as long as the amplification          is stable and consistent among different experiments          From the results of comparison between U and LN          we selected six genes that showed differential expression          either using both the regular and the amplification          procedures or only using the amplification procedure          Among these four genes were detected by both protocols          and two genes were only detected by the amplification          protocol Figure  Genes that belong to the latter case          are most likely expressed at very low levels that fall          below the threshold of detection by the regular protocol          These genes were then tested by other molecular          methodologies          We first selected two genes S and GFAP that are          common markers for glial cells Among U and LN          cells the microarray results from both protocols showed          that S was expressed at higher levels in LN cells          and GFAP at higher levels in U cells U and LN          cells were embedded in paraffin blocks and sectioned The          sections were stained with antibodies for those two          antigens The immunohistochemistry results showed that          S is expressed at higher levels in LN cells and          GFAP at higher levels in U cells Fig A Two          additional genes HLADR alpha and SNRPB that were also          obtained using the two protocols were confirmed by          northern blotting Fig A          We mentioned that some lowexpressing genes could only          be detected by the amplification protocol and not by the          regular protocol To confirm whether the new information          by this approach is reliable we randomly picked up two          differentially expressed genes IGFBP and integrin beta           that were identified by the amplification protocol but          not by the regular protocol for confirmation using          western blotting northern blotting and          immunohistochemistry assays The results from these          experiments showed that all the two genes were expressed          at higher levels in U cells Figure B as obtained by          the microarray data It should be noted that for the low          expressed genes that could only be detected by the          amplification protocol longer exposure time for the          northern blotting is needed and the signal intensity is          much lower than that generated from the high expressed          genes that could be detected by both protocols Figure          B          In summary we have carried out a series of          confirmation experiments using northern blotting western          blotting and immunohistochemistry assay and all six          differentially expressed genes revealed from the          microarray experiments have been confirmed                            Discussion        A major difficulty in the study of cancer is that cancer        cells are extremely elusive and the genetic mutation events        are continuously occurring temporally and spatially The        development of high throughput genomic technologies enables        us to screen thousands of genes simultaneously for the        informative genes yet the power of these technologies is        greatly attenuated when inappropriate samples are studied        Generally speaking the most biologically appropriate        materials obtained from clinical samples are small in        quantity This observation motivates the development of        experimental protocols that allow application of genomic        technologies to minute amounts of biological materials In        this manuscript we have described such a method that        allows us to use cDNA microarrays with only  microgram of        total RNA        The initial evaluation of the methodology is based on        the detection of fluorescent signals on the microarray        after hybridization Although we could see bright spots        with the amplification protocols this apparent success        does not mean the information so acquired is reliable        False positives are often the result of sideeffects during        amplification We set out to assess the accuracy and        reliability using both statistical and experimental        approaches Both approaches supported the validity of our        protocol in the identification of differentially expressed        genes in two cell populations This demonstrates that the        same genes are amplified to the same extent in different        cell populations However in our results the amount of        amplification varies from gene to gene Therefore the        amplification process is not balanced and changes the        relative transcript levels in a given cell population        Thus from the amplified results one cannot infer the        relative expression levels of different genes in a single        sample However in most biological studies identification        of differentially expressed genes among different samples        is the main aim These genes can serve as useful markers        for diagnosis for prediction of therapeutic response and        perhaps as a target for developing new drugs Thus we have        developed an assay that will enable us to approach a series        of important clinical issues given a limited amount of        material This assay has been used in several ongoing        studies and useful information has been obtained                    Conclusion        We have confirmed a powerful and consistent cDNA        microarray procedure that can be used to study minute        amounts of biological tissue                    Materials and Methods                  Microarray production

Backgroundcorrected intensity was computed by          subtracting local background from spot intensity The SN          ratio was computed by dividing the backgroundcorrected          intensity by the

median log ratio between channels close to  for          expressed spots and it also permits us to compare          individual channels across arrays After normalization          any spot whose normalized intensity remained below the          threshold value of  was considered to be undetectable          and its value was replaced by the threshold value In our          arrays a normalized value of  corresponds roughly to          a spot whose SN ratio equals  and thus any spot whose          backgroundcorrected intensity falls below this threshold          cannot be reliably distinguished from background noise          Finally the backgroundcorrected normalized signal          intensities were logtransformed base two for further          analysis
