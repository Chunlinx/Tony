                                                            Go NorthImpeachment                        As the author of a book on the politics of theIranContra affair especially the congressional hearings I was pleased tosee Michael Kinsleys  on impeaching Reagan and Bush Clearly the issues thenwere of much greater constitutional import            Besides quoting Rep Henry Hyde you could havealso quoted Rep Bill McCollum and Sen Orrin Hatch Hatch told North I dontwant you prosecuted I dont I dont think many people in America do And Ithink theres going to be one lot of hell raised if you are McCollum now oneof the House managers I believe told North that he had served your countryadmirably and that he was a dedicated patriotic soldier for whom McCollumand the country was grateful These statements were made of course afterNorth under a grant of immunity proclaimed that he had previously misled andlied to Congress And as you point out in your piece these were issuesinvolving life and deathnot only TOWs in Iran but also aid to the guerrillafighters in Nicaragua who were regularly implicated in killing peasantvillagers and others            Keep up the goodwork

As an artist I was very pleased to see JacobWeisbergs review of the current crop of biographies in  His conclusion thatthe lives of the artists provide little or no illumination of their artisticproduction is entirely accurate To understand the work look at the work andunderstand its aesthetic context Literary insights are to be found in otherwritingcriticism theory philosophy art history and the artists ownwriting Visual creativity is driven by a variety of elements socialpolitical cultural intellectual theoretical aesthetic an artistsphysiology by virtue of idiosyncrasies of the mechanics of vision has moreeffect than the artists psychology on his or her work            Although the artistsbiography may be interesting and at times inspiring as is the case with HenriMatisse it more often than not distracts from the work and leads to the mostinane and invalid interpretations Thanks to Weisberg for addressing this issueand providing the reader with an appropriate perspective                           JoScraba Brooklyn NY                           UltraFat Cats                        Discussing the SAT prepindustry article in the New York Times Magazine  the writer of describes rich kids as overprivileged Privilege itself already suggests tome the sense of overness if you will Privilege is above and beyond thenormal Either someone is privileged or he is not To use overprivilegedsuggests that while a certain amount of privilege is acceptable too muchprivilege is wrong and should be taken away This seems to me a whollyirrational distinction to make                           Joel D Smith                        NewYork City                           TastySpatulas                        In  Jeffrey Goldberg alluded to but didnt quitehit on the ideal baby toy for the two month to  month set ie a spatulaYou can buy a darn nice spatula for about wooden with a rubbery bladeandits easy for kids to grip It makes no noise when they whack things with itunlike a wooden spoon and the blade gives them something to gnaw on whichthey find very satisfying and theres no risk of splinters Its also quietwhen theyre in church hey Im from the Midwest OK unlike say squeakytoys or a set of car keys I suppose the only hazard is the noxious chemicalsthey use to make the blade rubbery but if you post this in                  Slate                there will undoubtedly be an organic rubberspatula with blackandwhite geometric patterns in soy ink on a sustainablyharvested tropical hardwood grown by a womens cooperative handle availablesoon for             Good luck with thesquirts The only other valuable child raising hint I have is to dress the kidsin orange shirts when they get mobile because then theyre easy to spot in acrowd nobody wears orange voluntarily although if you put this in                  Slate                and everyone does it it wont work anymore                           Matthew Cole Saint Paul Minn                           Trial anError                        About the trial coverage  We need to be clearabout something The trial of the president in the Senate will not really be atrial or at least not a trial that any of us recognize First lets set asideany pondering about what the chief justice will or will not do He cant reallydo much of anything On any ruling by the CJ as to admissibilityrelevancy or objections to testimony that the justice may make the jury thesenators can overrule him by a simple majority of  votes There are Republican senators so getting to  is not a high hurdle Second in anyordinary trial meetings conversations or even deals are not made between theprosecutors and the jury Here the House team is the prosecution team and thesenators the jury The House team and various senators have been in constantcontact making deals and arrangements That would be considered jury tamperingand would get any other case thrown out of court In any ordinary trial thejudge sets the rules and the time frame In this trial the senators can changethe rules from day to daydoing on one day what they would not allow onanother They can decide midpresentation if they want to to permit testimonythat was disallowed during the previous presentation Or midwitness if itcomes to that Remember it takes only  votes to make any decision and thereare  Republican senators            I do not have anyconfidence that this trial will observe longestablished rules of law Thesenators have made it plain to anyone who is listening closely to theirSenatespeak that they will do it their way
