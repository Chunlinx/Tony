           all right what type of things would you fix if youre having company come over   well i have a really great one that i make in the summertime because its cool and its uh its just really pretty easy its pretty much dumping things in and stirring and i like that   uhhuh   uh the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in in it and then i youre supposed to do chicken but i just use those little cans of chicken   uhhuh   and it makes it so much easier and so you dump the rice you dump the chicken and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off but i get my kids to do that so  i i dont have to do that   oh   and um and it really and you mix it all up with yeah theres a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up but its so simple and it tastes really good because its cool in the summertime uhhuh   oh yeah you serve it cold oh yeah that sounds good   yeah it has to sit in the fridge over night but but its really good   hum   and i like that one   yeah usually when we entertain we do something really simple because i like to visit with my company and not be scurrying around in the kitchen so a lot of times well barbecue like that for Memorial Day we had some friends over and we   yeah exactly   just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like Adolphs Meat Marinate and put it on the smoker and   uhhuh oh that sounds good   cooked it and that it was real good you can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way and then people think theyre eating steak or something   yeah  yeah and these days that helps doesnt it yeah   yeah yeah it really does   i know what you mean   i dont usually i just pass on any recipe thats got more than five or six steps to it because i just know ill never take the time to do it   now spaghettis such an easy one um i do that a lot   uhhuh   i do spaghetti a lot   yeah it seems like most people like spaghetti   yeah i dont like to do that if if its hot real hot though   yeah   because um i dont know i have a real thing about being hot in the in the summertime i guess   uhhuh well i think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference   yeah   in your whole house   yeah i think thats right and um we dont entertain that often but when we do im like you i like it to be fast and easy and something so that we can talk and not   uhhuh yeah   and not have to worry about being in the kitchen all the time   most we dont entertain like people from work or stuff even often usually friends from church and stuff and its usually kind of like   yeah   you want to come over and they say well what can we bring and so its real easy because you just make one or two things and everybody else brings something   yeah thats exactly like us from our church we just do it yeah   oh yeah yeah its a lot more relaxing i dont know if i could take the pressure of having to make you know put on this really fancy dinner for someone   oh well you see all that on TV  and i could never be that person     huhuh   it just uh im just not well im so im pretty laid back   yeah   and uh and so i dont i know a lady in a my church and uh she like does her own bread and does her own stuff and so when she um does food she really goes all out and i dont know how she can do it and be calm   yeah yeah do you work   i guess no i dont   do you stay home with kids   uhhum yeah   yeah i ive been working were going to have a baby this summer and im not going to work anymore yeah so hopefully i think ill enjoy cooking more when i dont have to work all day i dont like to come home and   oh how exciting   stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up and by then its eight thirty or nine oclock at night so   yeah well i usually start about six and an and cook and and then eat at seven i mean cook cook at five and eat at six rather   uhhuh eat at six yeah   yeah and uh my family and i were a sit down together family   oh thats good   uh yeah i dont like the run in and out part and   yeah   i like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me and and my husband about whats happened and   yeah thats neat   i think i that was ingrained in me during my family time at home and uh   uhhuh   you know we could learn to talk about things and i think thats good   yeah that really is it keeps the family in touch with whats going on with each other   yeah i think   right now we eat in front of the TV but since its just the two of us its   yeah yeah well that happens to us sometimes too uh   yeah   sometimes if something uh is on that they want to watch i leave it on but we eat in the kitchen and their heads are always poking past the door   uhhuh see whats happening   yeah anyway food is is uh a real lifestyle kind of thing and i some people dont like to do this but i like to cook uh cook with my kids   oh uhhuh   and if theyre going to have other kids over then then they help and we make real simple things you know those oh i dont i dont know if youve ever made them maybe not since you dont have kids yet but those JELLO uh gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers i cant think of what they call it   oh ive seen those in the magazines   yeah theyre so simple   uhhuh   and the kids love to do that uh finger food is is a biggie with them and   yeah   and like  now one thing i wish i could find a a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that and its just really hard and if they have to work with a knife i dont like that so   yeah   thats uh they like to eat it but its a hard one to have to to prepare   yeah ill bet   but they like that with the the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that so yeah   oh yeah yeah we like that thats good that thats a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too   yeah my sons getting to be a a real good cook so uh   oh neat   sometimes he fixes me breakfast   oh wow thats great   yeah i like it i like it a lot   how old he   hes eleven   eleven wow thats good   uhhuh yeah so hes   do you cook breakfast like you cook a breakfast every morning or   uh not every morning uh mostly during the summer its hit and miss and we usually have like uh cold cereal or something like that um during the summer during   yeah yeah   wintertime when theyre in school um then i try to vary it so that we only eat that like a twice a twice a week or something and then have like when its really cold i even cook oatmeal because i like oatmeal and the look they like it all right and um   uhhuh yeah   then sometimes we do something it has to be fast because theyre on their way to school we do like Eggo waffles and stuff like that but   oh uhhuh yeah   yeah so i try to uh and sometimes we do eggs if i get up early enough to do that i used to do them in the microwave but they dont like that   oh do they get rubbery or   uh um   ive never tried it   it depends it depends if you let them cook too long   uhhuh   then theyll turn a little bit gray you can tell if theyve gone to long because theyll turn a little bit gray and they will be a little harder and i dont like that   yeah   so you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in if you have a microwave book but uh you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with a like a plate over the top and let it steam and then and then stir it up   oh uhhuh huh   yeah an and that turns out okay and its funny because if i turn them out on to a dish i on to like a plate for them to take what they want   yeah uhhuh   they dont know ive ever done it in a microwave       its really funny its very deceiving you know because if they see it with their eyes they go uh i dont like want that   yeah   you know and yet if they dont ever see it then then its like oh this tastes okay you know so anyway   yeah we had my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash everybody would say we dont like squash we wont eat squash so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there you know and then wed go oh this is really good   yeah
