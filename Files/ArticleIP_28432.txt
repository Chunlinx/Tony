                                 Glass Wear            About  years ago I attended an exhibition ofcorsets at a great costume collection in Manchester England In a dim roomwere gathered a dozen elegant undergarments each in its own glass case andeach accompanied by at least three paragraphs of scholarly labeling aboutmaterials structure and shape            Chosen from a collection of hundreds of corsetsthese garments dated only from the second quarter of the  thcentury They were masterpieces of delicate craftsmanship no two were exactlythe same Looking at them was like looking at ancient Etruscan bronzes orRenaissance enameled boxes But it was also like a private showing Nobody elsewas there In those days costume was dear only to a few obsessedantiquarians with no connection to the mad scuffle of fashion in real life Ashow back then at the Metropolitan Museum of Arts Costume Institute might havedisplayed a tired ecclesiastical vestment from  th century Spain ora stiffly

asabout  or maybe a little before that Except for bits and pieces nogorgeous suits from Shakespeares day survive no goldbordered gowns from MonaLisas wardrobe none of King Richard IIIs rich doublets fitted to hishumpback The dazzling styles of the distant past live only in pictures            A fashion designer can put old imagery to use But a museumcollector needs history in material form the better to display its links withthe productions of more recent ateliers The earliest and most magnificent itemin the current show is a bright salmonpink English ladys ensemble from made of silk damask brocaded in bold patterns with multicolored silk floss andmetallic thread The strong color and buoyant presence of this ornate dresscommand our attention the dress has no mustiness at all Another Frenchensemble from around  all in canaryyellow silk taffeta selftrimmed inmiles of applied pleated ruffles creates a similar effect These dramaticdresses easily compete in intensity or sensationalism with the vivid works byIssey Miyake and Alix Grs nearby            Some th century mens outfits are equally bold especially a Frenchcoat dated between which is to say just at the Revolutionary

to mirror any emotional and eroticnuance in the souls of women for three centuries            The exhibit made me hope that the fashion of thefuture will be all the more liberated for seeking its sources in the libertiesof the past But the show made me realize something else as well that ourpresent clothes are already museum pieces The largest change in fashion since has been an immense new consciousness of what clothes mean so that peoplehave got used to thinking about what their own outfits say By bringingtogether old and new this exhibition encourages that habit of looking forsignificance in our own garments While we stare with detached sociologicalattention at the garb of generations who lived in complex past times wereinvited to stare the same way at contemporary modes to see them as thehistorical artifacts of our own fraught epoch And the gulf between Those Daysand These once unbridgeable starts to disappear
