              okay  well considering you moved here from California i guess the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you would have down there   yeah oh yeah we have um in California im in central i lived in central California we have rain couple times a year and other than that you know itd be maybe October and then in the spring and then other than that there wouldnt be any rain   especially the last few years   so yeah yeah   its kind of has its kind of been a drought out there hasnt it uh   yeah there has so here i know that um last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state and im glad to see there havent been any this year   thats what i was thinking yet  generally if were gonna get them its not going to happen uh prior to January one you know you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like weve been getting in December but   yeah yet still could come huh uhhuh yeah   usually the bitterest weather if were gonna have any comes in January and February then by March things are getting warm again so we really dont have as long a cold season i guess as people up north   hm yeah yeah its so hard to predict here   its been eighty degrees on Christmas day here before  lots of times   yeah well today its not bad out there   no its nice i just came in from outside and its its really pretty its kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out   umhum yeah   before it rains again im a im a scoutmaster and so i wind up going out camping with   yeah   uh a bunch of boys at one time and so its better for us if it hasnt been just totally wet before we go   uhhuh yeah so you do that even in January huh uhhuh   oh yeah yeah we camp year round   yeah oh thats interesting   but uh its uh its definitely different and then i guess youve been through a couple of summers here too right   umhum yeah yep and theyre not too pleasant  it gets so humid to me its humid here people that i know that come from um like Georgia or North Carolina yeah they say this isnt humid     well it is its not as humid as Houston say or Atlanta but it   yeah but i find it humid   its more humid than Arizona and California for the most part   right   were you northern California   yeah i was central California Central Valley so its very dry there   central okay so that was dry but pretty even climate wasnt it year round fairly not wide fluctuations   yeah yeah well its pretty hot in the summer its in the usually you know for a good three four weeks we have over a hundred degrees but its a dry heat yeah   but its a drier hundred  when you have a hundred here everybodys dying   uhhuh yeah i know huh well i lived in Africa for a couple years in   oh   Cameroon and thats a tropical climate and it really feels similar to this during the summer   what types of what take what type of business takes you to those climates or was that just vacation or something   no i was um working with um i still work with Wycliffe Bible Translators   oh   its an organization where we are looking to translate the Bible into languages of the world that arent yet written   not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages   right languages that dont have anything written yet so this is like the first thing thats written down or you know first an alphabet is developed and then um   oh thats interesting you dont think about that as a career a normal career uh when youre thinking of things that people might be doing   so yeah yeah well its based here um the international headquarters for Wycliffe Bible Translators is right here in in Dallas   oh so youre youre with the home office now   yeah right now i am so thats what brought me here yeah   well the uh i think uh all in all there are a lot worse climates than Dallas uh the weather   yeah   you know does change fast and things do happen severely a few times a year but theres an awful lot of good weather too in between   yeah i agree i agree i i thought the fall was really nice   yeah and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice too after the last freeze and and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time uh i like that   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   particularly if im gonna be outdoors and doing uh outdoor activity hiking and things and thats nicer yeah i do quite a bit of that   umhum yeah and you probably do a lot of that with scouts scouting uhhuh   think were going in just a couple of weeks out to the east Texas and it is a little more humid out there than it is here so   umhum   i guess well the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally come through out here on the plains theres not much between us and the North Pole  and then when you get one of those tornado type   umhum yeah umhum   systems through or severe hail or thunderstorms and it it doent seem to be
