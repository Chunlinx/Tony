                     This is Chief Master Sergeant Clem Francis retired from the US Air Force         Today he is going to talk to us about the Third SS the U Quick and the Blackbird         Go ahead Mr Francis                     Im uh Chief Master Sergeant retired as Rick said         Uh I spent much of my time in uh Special Activities         Thats kind of unique in that I uh spent uh about  years of my career in Special Activities         I dont want to go into the Third SS thats Third Strategic Support Squadron         Way back in uh  and   and  when I returned from the uh Korea I was assigned to uh a unit which was called C Third Strategic Support Squadron and uh one of their primary purposes was to uh uh move atomic weapons to forward locations         And uh one of my jobs at the time was training individuals how to put parachutes on a nuclear weapons trigger to uh which detonates the atomic bomb itself         But my job was to put parachutes on it and life preservers when we would load it and start to an overseas location         I would uh put parachutes on the trigger itself and we use that if in case we had to throw the trigger out over land when we was approaching water we had to put four life preservers on what they call Mae West on the trigger so we just threw it out over water         That was the primary thing we wanted to save         since there wasnt any way to dump a megaton Hbomb off a  a C         If you started to run it back to the elevator why it would turn the aircraft upside down so it would if we had trouble the the bomb itself would end with the aircraft of course         The rest of us after uh after we got the trigger out why we uh would bale out of the aircraft regardless whether if it was water over land air or what but the bottom did go in         I want to say that there wasnt any danger of going in with the bomb because it would not explode regardless of how hard it hit the ground         Even if the aircraft was on fire why it it would uh burn and it would melt through a lead component for the radiation to leak out         It would not explode without the trigger         But anyway uh         I had a top secret clearance in that so in  and  why uh they started uh I didnt know why they was a running the clearance on me to begin because I thought uh top secret was the highest you could go in security clearance and of course that I knew everybody in my neighborhood was asking me Well what if theyre asking about you         And even uh uh a neighbor in Earl NC told me that they was a checking with him on why uh uh on why uh they was running a clearance on me         I didnt know anything about it until about the time well uh I knew about it when they was running the clearance on me when I had a top secret so I didnt know anything about what it was all about until I arrived         I got orders to go to Del Rio TX so when I arrived out there well I found out I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base         I was reporting to a certain place in Del Rio then I had to go to Laughlin Air Force Base which had just reopened         It wasnt nothing but a desert there was sagebrush out on the runway         Anyway it was pretty soon after I arrived there there was some RV   arrived which used crasher suits as a high altitude photography plane well I figured thats what it was         I had to start training in course         I had already been to partial pressure suit school in my career field where I was   so I started training with equipment I had never handled before         I didnt know what it was all about or anything till I had to go out and train hook in a   in a RVD which I say now I found it it was a forerunner to your U aircraft         But at the time I arrived there we didnt have any Us         We didnt know what a U was and nobody knew anything about a U         But all of a sudden we was called out to look at what was flying         Well they looked like two big gliders flying over the base and they made a circle and come in and landed and I didnt know whether it was a glider or what it was I hadnt heard the name U when I first arrived         Come to find out it was a U aircraft but we couldnt we could not say one word about what it was nothing to our wives kids or anybody         OK well I started the training in the U with the pressure suits and everything and uh I dont know how long it was I suited and unsuited the pilots and just practiced putting them in the aircraft         Well it got to where theres two or three aircraft arrive in a week and I didnt know where theyre flying to         All we done they never did tell us any place where they was going even when they left the base to go to somewhere else to stay for a while         We didnt know where they were going         Anyway it got up to we had about uh ah I dont remember the numbers         Its  or  U aircraft and wed started the training Chinese pilots British pilots in them just all over the the world that we were allies with         Uh but one of the things that I am proud of in the Us I was the life support man   uh         Of course parachutes and life rafts packed the survival kits but the U kits had what they call a F hundred regulator in them which was a highly cued regulator to give the pilots breathing pressure and counter pressure in their capstans of the partial pressure suits in case they had a decompression at high altitudes like   thousand feet         You know you cant you cannot survive if you dont have any counter pressure increase breathing pressure in those altitudes         If if your hand was exposed outside of the pressure suit your hands would go to about five times the size if you had a decompression         Well of of course needless to say we had a we could not make a mistake         So uh I skip a lot of things here that I could say but they chose me and one more guy         That I was the only  which was life support man the other man was a physiological support         Physiological support differs from life support in that he handles the altitude chambers which run pilots up to  thousand feet in high altitude chambers and brings him back down         They have to go through a number of altitude chambers uh rides before they start even flying Us or flying with pressure suits         Of course they already had done the pilots bit before they done well I had to go through altitude chambers myself because I was working with pressure suits         I went to Fort Worth TX to go through the altitude chambers with a partial pressure just like I was working with and when when all the training was done on the pressure suits and things I was chosen with a sergeant secretary to go through a school which we was in a school about the size of a nicesize bathroom         We would go in there         The doors were locked when we went in         Michael Santo of of Firewell and Company of Buffalo NY they was the one that uh manufactured uh invented the high O regulator before that they built fire control on the stove well         Anyway they come up with this invention of the high O regulator         Say it was a tremendous breakthrough for Firewell and Company         Well Mike Santo would start training us in this small room with F hundred regulator with we had to tear it down and break it break it down so many times and uh we had to uh set injections on it         Its a little screw which set an injection but the the breathing pressure tube to the pilot and counter pressure         Each pilot has a different breathing capacity and we would have to uh uh bend then individual over in the pressure suit uh uh Id have to have to set it for uh a second or which was going through school         Then hed dress me and uh hed set the injection on me and you uh uh wed have to bend down and come up with the regulator in the seat kit itself then wed come up breathing as hard as we could and you better if uh the the the top portion of your helmet surged which you had rubber around the neck and the visor closed         And uh if it surged and just kept surging it would go whish and like it was going to pull your head off         Youd better get the little screw turned down a little bit because you could damage and individuals lungs very easily         And well anyway needless to say I had to tear down the regulator and put it back together blindfold         I never did see and dont know yet why unless it was just ex ex expressing the the the need to know what you was a doing and whatever         The part was there was  parts to it and we had to break it down put it back together break it down and never make a mistake         Well I had taken me about  days   and I both to get through the school and my wife will tell you today that I turned grayheaded within those  days and not real gray but I did turn gray headed         And uh but uh I would think at night I couldnt sleep         I would think Well Im Im going to let somebody else go but then I would think My God         Theyve they chosen me over about  individuals there to go to through that school and Im not Im not         So I would go back determined determined to stay with it and of course they trained two more after I had been through but who did they use to set all the injections         And it was myself and Secretary the one who went through that school that you know the two that we went         One more thing uh   while we were in the school and Mike Santo was teaching us we could uh take notes but before we left out of the room Mike would take and tear every one of the notes up that we had and get it down to where youd rub a pencil over it where you could not read         He would tear the the paper up and put it in the sand ashtray sand set it on a fire and burn it and then stir the ashes up like that         Now thats how classified it was         And so well anyway uh they chose me         Also oh let me go through this         About uh less than two months after uh uh we finished the school and was set the injections on pilots for about two months Firewell and Company come up with an automatic foolproof uh uh that uh the regulator adjusted itself with a little valve that moved back and forth         It would not burst the lungs it would not over inflate it it was so perfect that you neednt even have to open the kit to set the injection         It was uh automatic         OK well thats where I went         They chose me over everybody else and of course Sergeant Secretary he was a different AFC but hes the one that went through school with they chose me to go out of the uh uh the organization that I was at on the present         Now its on the same base but theyve set taken me to field maintenance to run regulators in the   altitude chambers         You had to run them every so often every  days I believe it was had to make sure that they was uh reading exact pressure like at uh eight or  feet      feet and you had to record it         If it was off one iota you had to do some adjusting to the regulator itself         And I thought that was a privilege and its still its still I was the only nine twotwo ExO which was my AFFC Air Force Career field         Uh I was still the one and only nine twotwo that had ever set the injection on the regulator         I was the only one that uh ever run the regulators for the the test in the miniature altitude chambers         Im proud of that         So anyway I worked with the th until  and  late  well  before I left the th and I have some things here         Well if I can find the picture of the          Just give me a minute if you want to cut it off Id uh go         Uh well of course you know  was shot down over Russia in  and  and then we come with the Cuban Crisis         It was uh which we uh had Rudolph Anderson in a a formulation of three Us         It was from a airbase that flew over Cuba and of course Rudolph Anderson was shot down         He was the only casualty of the Cuban Crisis and uh Kaiser uh he got the pictures and flew straight to Andrews Air Force in Washington         The CIA unloaded the the film taken them to the United Nations the next day         And uh Adlai Stevenson which was United Nations uh uh Ambassador to US US he sit and told Androv Gromikov of Russia that he would sit there until hell froze over unless he had admitted to having the missiles installed in Cuba offensive missiles headed for the United States targeted for the United States         And of course Androv Gromikov didnt answer anything but we had all the information from the films the U had taken         Well the next day of course President Kennedy uh blockaded Cuba and uh our ships stopped a Russian ship that was headed just outside of Cuba within and they found missiles on them         Well if uh I think this is official history         If they would have kept moving with that ship towards Cuba its my understanding that uh we come within six minutes of nuclear war because President Kennedy would have launched the missiles uh on Russia         But anyway Nikita Khrushchev backed down turned all of his ships around and headed back to Russia         Of course we were this is picture of me now I was at home stationed         And I had put uh five detachments out of Us         Now I uh uh worked with life support I had to stay there and keep extra gear extra pressure suits extra kits extra parachuteseverything that if I had to in an emergency that would wed send these this equipment out to one of those attachments and and thats what I did         And of course uh this is an outstanding job that uh General   that uh he was a colonel at that time gave me an award for doing that outstanding job and also this is the same Colonel Colonel   that uh with President Kennedy giving our unit the outstanding unit award and until today Ive got it all here in the in the papers that until today the th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing of the Us that I was in at that time is the highest uh unit in peace time there are         That still stands today         Uh of course I wont go but we I have just so much I could talk about but uh that is the main things that we of course everybody knows now that the what has happened         Uh Russia backed down and thats the good thing to do because if they did not and we went to nuclear war I was trying to get my family out of Del Rio and back to NC but it happened so fast I didnt get them back         Because if their was a nuclear war then or if theres nuclear bombs started missiles or anything I would want the first one to hit me right between the running lights because this just would be a world after a nuclear war and         So well I uh anyway uh uh this is the three uh U pilots that uh President Kennedys office in Washington with General May         President Kennedy says to the pilots says Gentlemen you take good pictures         This is the one that went over Cuba and got the pictures they showed in the United Nations and of Rudolph Anderson was shot down uh during the flight         He didnt get to go         Thats all         And this is a picture of Colonel   with some of his officers         And and we were uh the th Extension Reconnaissance Wing this was after the Cuban crisis was a voted by the TX legislature that all the members of the th Extension Reconnaissance Wing was uh the TX Ambassadors         This was the first time that that had happened in  years that TX legislature had voted a military unit being TX Ambassadors so needed TX Ambassadors                  Late  uh I got orders to go to Washington DC I didnt know what I was going for or anything so was to report to a designated place in Washington         Uh I went ahead up and it was highly classified even my orders were classified         So I went to I went to Washington DC and I didnt go directly to uh that uh they had told me to on my orders         I went to my sisters that lived there          Her husband was in the service and worked with Intelligence and I went to their house         They lived just in MD just outside of the beltway Washington DC So I went to her house and then I called in to this number I was supposed to call when I got there         And I called in and they asked me where I was at         I told them my sisters         They asked a few questions and I answered them and they said Get your baggage and leave there immediately and come to the address you were supposed to when you arrived in Washington         I go ahead and picked the baggage and went to the address I was supposed to         Of course they questioned me there why I went         Well they they live there and I uh needed a place to stay         They said Were paying for a place for you to stay         You dont have to stay there         Well after they checked they asked me about her husband         After they checked found out he was in security service with the Air Force they said OK I could go ahead back and stay there if I wanted and they gave me a certain time to report to the CIA Headquarters which I can say that name and needless to say I was up there for a week and I I cant say anything else what happened or anything         But I didnt know what in Gods world I was there for         I I just didnt I was just puzzled         Of course I came back after a week to Laughlin Air Force base and then shortly thereafter I got orders I could bring my family and everything to Las Vegas NV and I couldnt tell my wife or anything about why I was going there because I didnt know         And so we moved to Las Vegas NV and I reported just like I did in Washington to a certain address in downtown Las Vegas         They told me that uh that I would be called in a guy at the end for me to meet         It was another GI and said I would go with him on Monday morning to a certain location and we never was for many many years we could not even mention the location but now I have the declassification of it Roadrunners International right there in its authorized and it tells all about the A Blackbird crew that I was going to in early  and I guess it was the most classified thing that there was at that time in the United States but when I got out and gone out found out what was going into and I looked at one of those birds there was actually bile come into my mouth         Now thats how uh I stay buckled in         We had full pressure suits there in the aircraft just just like the astronauts wore except ours was totally silver silver uh boot and everything to reflect heat of course         I started immediately uh uh training into that from the other two guys that was at the location         They had already had their training in the full pressure suits and it taken me a while if you go into full pressure suits         Different totally different types parachutes and in an bird that flies uh three times the speed of sound over  miles an hour         You cant even imagine that and I really cant get over as as many pilots that I put in that aircraft and know and seen them come in   and go walk up the plank to to get him out of the aircraft and he waits for me to get him out         And then he looks         When I pull when he pulls the canopy for me to start getting him out he points to two instruments on the left side of the aircraft that had actually melted during the flight         And one of our jobs was to measure uh heat on the top of their helmet which was a piece to tape that went across there and put out by NASA that uh there was different spots of paint on it         And the spots of paint would change every hundred degrees it might be red it change to blue         Where I didnt know what the code was but of course Id take it and turn it in to individuals back at life support but I know that I have measured them and they told me he had  degrees on the top of his head         But you have to remember he had a tremendous cooling system going in to his full pressure suit and going out to the inside of his hands channels and then down to his feet hes got channels pumping cold air down there all the time and then comes back and exhausts out the outside of the control         Theres so much you could talk about on that Ill just skip that         But uh think about it         Youre putting a man in there its risking his life those tests like what we had Lockheed Aircraft individuals         Test pilots that flew them first like Lou   I could name all of them really but they test the birds first and then our CIA pilots started flying them         We were the ones handled our CIA pilots uh anyway uh we set all kinds of records step by step         Only lost two three aircraft while we was there and uh test phase         But we only lost one CIA pilot there and really why uh theres a modification that we shouldnt have made         You live and learn you know when you test uh aircraft         Uh well its uh the speeds got faster faster and faster until we deployed overseas         In the meantime the Air Force bought the SR now the A that we were working with the CIA         It was one space aircraft oneman aircraft he operated all the cameras and everything and flew the aircraft         The SR was a two space aircraft which you had a pilot and a systems operator in the back seat give the pilot a little bit of a break from what the A CIA version of the plane had         Anyway we deployed and I can tell now be because of this that that that uh we deployed to Kadina Okinawa and this was in          And I will tell you about one flight that we made over there that I hooked up         One individual Mr Weeks had his name here on page six and he made the flight over up to the edge of China over North Korea extreme north back over the middle and back down south         Got the pictures of the Pueblo when the North Koreans captured the Pueblo and brought it in to North Korea         I dont know if you remembered it or not or ever thought about it         Well we got the pictures of that and and even got the pictures of a Russian officer walking on the gangplank         Why this was the next day         Why I remember it so is that I was the individual that put MrWeeks in the aircraft and and sent him out on his mission and made a successful mission         And uh one bad thing though coming back down below South Korea between there and Japan our battleships launched their vehicles and started firing         They see uh we flew on radio silence         All of our pilots flew on radio silence period         And of course they were going so fast they couldnt move up and down but evidently they got uh word back real quickly by mashing the scrambler a button on the inside of the aircraft         I dont know that I never was told that but CIA got the word quick like that but they never could shoot him down anyway and they have never never         Theyve had so many thousands and they never been shot down yet         I stayed with them until  and  before I left there         And uh course I wont go into anything else because Im not prepared with my information here but thank you very much
