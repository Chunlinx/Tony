Changes in the HouseholdLevel Demand for Postal DeliveryServices from  to Frank A Wolak Department of Economics Stanford UniversityMotivationOver the past decade there has been an dramaticincrease in  Available modes of interpersonal communication andthe range in quality of these modes of communication in termsspeed reliability and flexibility  Reductions in the price ofthese modes of

signal a levelingoff or decline inhouseholdlevel use of USPS postal delivery servicesPurpose of TalkReconcile growth in aggregate pieces delivered and mail revenueswith increasing relative price of postal delivery services andgrowing number of substitutes at household levelAre household sector trends consistent with aggregatetrendsQuantify decline in aggregate household sector postageconsumptionDetermine the relative extent to which the decline in householdsectorconsumption over time can be attributed to Increasing penetration of alternative modes ofcommunication Increasing relative price of USPS postal deliveryservicesSpecific Questions Addressed What has happened to the average householdlevel consumptionand aggregate US Population household consumption of postaldelivery services over the past decade What are ownprice crossprice and expenditure elasticitiesof the householdlevel demand for postal delivery services and howhave they changed over time What is the impact of home computing technology on postaldemand What household characteristics predict differences inhouseholdlevel postal demandAggregate Household Consumption of Postal DeliveryServicesBureau of Labor Statistics BLS Consumer Expenditure SurveyCES A national probability sample of households Sampling framegenerated from the  Census percent detail fileTwo surveys
