                                 High Life on the Potomac            I am notnowand never have beena fan of Robert Reichs economics or politicsFourteen years ago I said in a review of one of his books            This book has threeelements a description of the terrible present state and future prospects ofthe American economy a theory of the causes of that dreadful condition and aprescription for rescuing us The description of our condition is grosslyexaggerated The theory of the causes of the alleged condition is inadequatelysupported The prescription is with some exceptions unpersuasive            Readinghis new book Locked in the Cabinet Alfred A Knopf  pages about his four years as secretary of labor from  through  I find thathe has not changed his mindor I mineeven though his new book gives us acloser look at Reich the person than the earlier ones did He does not comethrough as particularly admirable He is selfrighteous and selfpitying He isunfair often in a petty way to people with whom he disagreesnotably forsome reason Alan Greenspan And his treatment of Bill Clinton his longtimefriend who made Reich a national figure by appointing him to the Cabinet isif not exactly disloyal surely unseemly Clinton comes through in Reichsaccount as an amiable man a good politician and a great preacher who isnonetheless unprincipled indecisive and overwhelmed by the responsibilitiesthat come with the presidency He is the kind of person least qualified to bepresident and most likely to become one There are plenty of people other thanReich who could have told us all that The presidents pal didnt have to doitor he could at least have waited until Clinton was out of office But asthe saying goes they all do it            Iput all these negatives up front so that my friends wontthink that I have gone off my rocker when I say I enjoyed much of Locked inthe Cabinet and ended it feeling sorry for Reich The book has twointerwoven partsa policy part and a life part The policy part I findinadequate and unconvincing The life part I find fascinating The story in thepolicy part goes like this            Reich came to Washington witha policy for relieving the suffering of the American worker That policyincluded stronger unions corporate responsibility a higher minimum wage andmost important more federal spending onor as he would say federalinvestment injob training and retraining Reichs fouryear effort to getthis policy adopted was largely defeated by the opposition of Wall Street BigBusiness rich people in generaland their hirelings or dupes in thegovernment The main instrument they used for defeating him was a call forobeisance to a false god Balancing the Budget So our hero leaves thebattlefield with his head bloody but only slightly bowed            What valueyou assign to this story depends on how valid you think Reichs policy is Ifhis policy would have been the salvation of the American worker the story ofits defeat is a tragic drama If the policy was mistaken and would have beenineffective anyway there is no drama no tragedy no hero and no villains Inthat case his endless kvetching about training and the rest of it is a bore tothe reader as I suspect it sometimes was to the president            But aside from relating a few anecdotes Reichmakes no effort to demonstrate the validity of his prescription He couldhardly do so in a book like this one The issues are complicated and difficultJob training is an example That the federal government should support jobtraining is not a new idea The Kennedy administration was taken by that idea years ago Since  the federal government has spent  billion in dollars on job training and employment programs Probably at least  billionhas been spent on research to evaluate these programs trying to measure theirbenefits and costs My understanding of the conclusion of all this research isthat for male workers there was no net benefit and for female workers verylittle Reich may have reason to dispute that conclusion But to explain thatand convince the reader of it would require sophisticated analysis of a mass ofdata and would be an entirely different book from the collection of personalreminiscences he has produced            Ifreaders bypass all that however and remind themselves not to enter intopolicy debate with the author they will find the other part of the bookthelife partinteresting enjoyable and valuable This part is about what it islike to be a Cabinet secretary What does he do all day What if anythinggoes on at a Cabinet meeting How can the administrations economic officialsall presumably on the same team meet for hours to talk about the budgetwithout getting one step forward How does one prepare for and behave at acongressional hearing What do people talk about and eat at Washingtonreceptions and dinners How does it feel to address a meeting of hostilelobbyists or to meet the press or to appear on television with Jay Leno Andso on            Idid not share all Reichs experiences when I was in thegovernment But I observed such life enough to say that his picture isrealistic I was however shocked when he said that the cabins at Camp Davidwere mildewed Things must have gone down a lot after the Nixonadministration He tells this story with a vividness that I did not expect ofhim with insight some irony and touches of gallows humor There are muchbetter books by former members of the CabinetGeorge Shultzs forexamplebut none that I know of that is so rich in personal detail            This bookis not a road map for improving the American economy It will probably have noeffect on future elections or public policy But that is not the important testof a book This one can give readers pleasure and amusement and also help themunderstand a little better the world we live in I have learned mainly fromtalking with taxi drivers that everyones life is interesting if you knowenough about it That is true of Cabinet secretaries as well as of taxidrivers            So why am I sorry for Robert Reich It iscertainly not because he failed to get most of his policy proposals adopted Itis because he did not enjoy his life in Washington His four years here werethe most exciting part of his whole life and could have been the happiest partof his professional one But he got no pleasure from it He was so determinedto maintain his selfimage of moral superiority that he could not relax toenjoy his Washington experience I feel that after it was over he realized hemay have missed something In the epilogue on Page  he says My job wasthe most fascinating and rewarding I could ever hope for But in the preceding pages derived from notes taken during his four years in office we havethe picture of an angry and unhappy man That is why I am sorry for RobertReich
