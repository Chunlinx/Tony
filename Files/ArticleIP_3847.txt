                                                            UnplugStephen Chapman                        In Unplug the DOEStephen Chapman recommends that an empty symbolic gesture drive policy Whatsmore he does it without apology or embarrassment            What may be provocative copyfor Slate is actually outdated discourse The perennial argument fordismantling the Department of Energy doesnt succeed because it doesnt makesense No proposal has ever identified clear savings for taxpayers fromeliminating the DOEat least none that rivals the billions the departmentsaved under the Clinton administration by undertaking contract reform cuttingwaste privatizing and streamlining operations            Of his various arguments forredistributing our responsibilities most disconcerting is Chapmans easy passof DOEs nuclearweapons responsibilities to the Pentagon The decadesoldcheck and balance relationship between the DOE and the DOD squares the needsof the people who are responsible for the safety control and stewardship ofnuclear weapons with those of the people who decide whether to use theweapons            ThenDefense Secretary Perrysaid last year With the new technical challenges of providing stewardship ofthe stockpile in the absence of underground testing this is not a time to befundamentally restructuring the management of these activities And EnergyDaily reported the Bush administrations energy secretary Adm JamesWatkins as saying I think it would be a mistake to give weapons functionsto the DOD and that Defense Department officials may not understand theimportance of rigorousand expensivenuclearsafety practices Watkinsdescribed a DOD official who wanted to stonewall public concerns aboutenvironmental contamination and safety threats at DOE sites by exercising thegovernments sovereignimmunity defense against litigation And to hell withnuclear safety he added            So Chapman wants to giveweapons safety and cleanup to Defense The people living near our nuclear sitesaround the country have seen progress both in openness and cleanup by thedepartment I dont think they would want this change            Chapmansultimate goal is actually one we share ensuring that the American people fullyunderstand the Clinton administrations success in reducing the size ofgovernment while increasing its effect A better solution would be forcolumnists like Chapman to report the story But that would be more difficultthan covering empty symbols                           CarmenMacDougalldeputy assistant secretary for

know theprofessional pundit who is supposed to know whether and how we should haveintervened in Rwanda who should win the Oscar for best cinematography thisyear what revisions should be made to the method of GNP calculations whatconcessions the baseball owners should accept and so on Well Slate hasbrought punditry to almost unimaginable new heights with its ongoing Is There aGod dialogue between Andrew Sullivan and Stephen Chapman I suppose thatkeeping up with Alan Sinais daily predictions of Dow movements does give onesome authority on this matter but it still seems to me musings on thissubject like those on solidstate physics for example should if they aregoing to be published be assigned to individuals who have had more than alittle training in the matter            One can for example readall the exchanges to date without knowing what either writer means by the wordGod We know that Sullivan believes in him her it us and the other guydoes not and that Sullivan has always had this belief while the other guyhas lost his But thats about it Furthermore while there have been nodefinitions or real elucidations the discussions seem mired in the concept ofa personal Christiantype deity as though the ability to prove or disprove theexistence of that sort of entity is in some way dispositive Im not sure ifthe correspondents realize that the Hindu concept of Brahman has been aroundconsiderably longer than Sullivans crosspollination of something like thefollowing a powerful yet devout bearded man a cool breeze on a clear summernight a John Lennon tune and the Lion King            Listen Ireally dont want to criticize Many of us struggle with these issues for muchof our adult lives and perhaps its something we ought to do  somethingthats good for us and for the world Its probably therapeutic for Slates twowarriors to be taking time out from their inquiries into the House Budget orTravelgate to organize their thoughts on their place in the universe Andalthough I got a PhD in philosophy many years ago and have thought and readabout these matters ever since heaven or whatever knows I dont have toomany answers that I feel confident about These matters are both very difficultand except for strict Little Raft Buddhists who are interested only in therelief of suffering not in metaphysics very important I dont mindtherefore that your two gentlemen are interested or that they arent makingmuch headway I just resist the idea of punditry in certain spheres I mean isnothing holy                           Walter Horn                                       GiveGates the Bill                        Bill Gates ranks th in total giving on the Slate list but here is some food for thought            I heard on the radio thatSir Bill is worth around  billion now My calculations may be slipping azero here or there but If one divides  million Gates contributions tocharity so far this year by  billion and uses that percentage to proratewhat an American family with a net worth of  might give to charity onewould come up with an annual contribution of about a dollar a week atthe collection plate of the local church            Dont get me wrong Bill isentitled to do whatever he wants with his cash But it is a little sad to seethat he has not taken a little more aggressive approach toward charitablegiving His oftstated goal of waiting until he retires to worry about givingaway his money is nice but extremely shortsighted            Awellplaced billion or two especially when not burdened with the bureaucracyof the state could well cure cancer or AIDS or otherwise profoundly alterthe lives of millions of people Bills family like many families in theUnited States has been directly touched by cancer Its sad to think that theepitaph on countless headstones over the next few decades will have thispostscript I might have lived a full life if Bill had decided to retire justa bit earlier                           MichaelJohnson                                       TrickleDown CampaignFinance Reform                        Why should the US publicaccept the yardstick JacobWeisberg offered us for measuring the Clintonforeigncontributions scandal in his defense of the Democrats DoesEverybody Do It Weisberg makes the myopic error of defining everybodyas the pustular ranks of Republicans and Democrats incestuously engaged indoling out political favors to their campaign contributors There is littlediscerning power evident in Weisbergs relativist judging of the moral failingsof Democratic campaigns against the most afflicted Republican examples Thereare some politicians who dont play the campaignfinance game despite the oddsstacked against them Some are even members of the Republican and Democraticparties            The current shock and horrorover alleged large softmoney donations to the Democratic National Committee byforeign nationals Koreans Taiwanese and Indonesians in return for economicand militarypolicy considerations by the Clinton administration is amusingasif softmoney contributions made by domestic corporations and executives aresomehow better less sullied more ethical If such activity is consideredbribery when foreign nationals engage in it why is it any different whendomestic entities put our campaign system of legalized bribery to use Thispoints to a moral duality in the current situation which is troubling            Campaignfinance reformersfixate too much on the demand side of this economic market If we consider fora moment that the primary aim behind reform is the reduction ofinfluencepeddling then we can look at the present campaign system as apoliticalinfluence market people making payments in return for policy favorsNo matter whether it is  from a multinational corporation or a check from an individual a payment is made because someone feels certaingovernment policies benefit him or her Most reforms attempt to deal with theproblem by placing limits on the demand sidethat is campaigncontributionlimits campaignexpenditure limits etc            Invariably contributorsfind loopholes and skirt the limitsbending even breaking the laws Therecord tide of campaign expenditure during this election cycle can be viewed asan index of the level of economic dependence of individuals andcorporationseven foreign oneson government policies Is it any wonder thatafter the breakup of the Soviet Union the economic marginal utility of USforeign policy has skyrocketed and foreign entities are anteing up to thelarger pot the United States has to offer Demandside proposals also run smackup against the First Amendment guarantee of free speech something somefearfully consider abridging            Addressing the supply side of the politicalinfluence market may get us pastsome of the pitfalls endemic to campaignkickback reform A supplysideapproach would focus on reducing the ability of government to dole out favorsReduce the marginal utility of government influence peddling and campaigncontributions will take care of themselves Reduce the stakes and players willleave the table                           Kris Lipman
