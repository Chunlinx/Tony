                            I didnt want to be just another MBA says Pascal Herzer one of the first recipients        of a new graduate credential known as the professional science masters or PSM Not many        people have the ability to understand science and business and the PSM program was        designed for that very purpose        PSMs are twoyear American masters degrees financed in large part by the Alfred P        Sloan Foundation to cultivate science managers Sloans ultimate goal is to make science        careers more attractive to talented young people like Herzer a  PSM graduate in        Applied Biosciences from the University of Arizona who believes his PSM makes him more        marketable to sciencebased businesses I am at the true junction of science and        business he says                    The Missing Degree        Fortunately for Herzer the business of science is booming Jobs for scientists and        engineers grew four times faster than the United States national average since  and        should outpace the market until at least  Surprisingly to many academics most of        these jobs are in industry In  the last year with complete data two out of three        employed science and engineering SE graduates worked in industry including the        great majority of bachelors and masters degree holders and  of doctorates In other        words industry not academe now drives American SE employment and will for the near        future        Like academia industry needs scientifically literate personnel unlike academia        industry wants employees with business savvy as well However in the past graduate        students received either science or business instruction not both Industry simply hired        regular mastersdegreed people or MBAs or more likely PhDs and just expected them to        learn their weaknesses on the job says Eleanor L Babco Executive Director of the        Commission on Professionals in Science and Technology a nonprofit corporation with funding        from the Sloan Foundation to assess PSM graduates        For sciencebased businesses then the American SE doctorateviewed by many as the        worldwide gold standard for science educationis too specialized for their needs see Box         But a masters degree may be just right                    Bridging the Gap        During the th century the masters degree evolved as a professional credential in        many fields including business education and social work and more recently pharmacy        physical therapy and accounting In the s nonincidental masters in the sciencesin        other words intentionally terminal degrees not consolation prizes for failing out of        graduate schoolcrept into engineering and applied mathematics too as companies grew more        reliant on computational analysis and hired accordingly From  to  for example        the number of earned masters degrees in mathematics and computer science more than        doubled        With hopes of spurring a significant movement in  the Sloan Foundation bet big on        professional masters degrees eventually spending  million on almost  programs        across the US Sloan Foundationbacked PSM programs now operate at  universities in         states in such fields as microbial biotechnology and applied genomics similar programs        have also developed independently of the Sloan Foundation such as the Master of Science in        Bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins And while most PSMstyle programs are currently in the US        this may soon change the  Bologna Agreement requires all European Union universities        to adopt uniform undergraduate and graduate degrees relevant to the European labour        market so masterslevel industrycentric degrees are sure to follow At Leiden        University in the Netherlands for example students can now add a sciencebased business        focus to any research master of science MSc program        Like all graduate programs PSMs offer advanced coursework in a science or math        specialization usually in an emerging or hybrid field such as bioinformatics Most PSMs        also provide business coursesincluding finance project management regulatory affairs        and intellectual property lawand information technology classes as well PSMs are        industry relevant by design with external advisory committees populated by local        business leaders weekly colloquia led by corporate representatives special arrangements        for employed students and industry internships or final projects exploring realistic        business scenarios see Box         A key principle underlying the PSM model is interdisciplinarity PSM students are        encouraged to reach out to other departments and broaden their expertise in multiple areas        to better understand the collaborative culture of industrystyle scientific enterprise To        promote such connections PSM programs explicitly teach teamwork and effective scientific        communication with authentic case studies analyzed alongside MBA students classroom        presentations and public seminars and open defenses of final projects Consequently PSM        graduates unlike many doctoral graduates are trained to possess a wide array of        interactive skills including sizing up an audience for their ability to comprehend the        presented material and adapting appropriately        In a sciencebased business ideas must flow freely between scientists and        nonscientists in and out of the companybetween researchers and marketers say or        inventors and patent lawyersto capitalize on discoveries and comply with regulations When        nonscientists misunderstand the science underpinning a business model profits suffer But        the presence of a central employee who streams data between differently educated members of        the network may boost the bottom line PSM students are specifically trained to act as such        science translators My PSM allows me to serve as an efficient mediator between        corporate entities university personnel and scientists says Herzer        For this reason small companies and startups which cannot afford specialists for        every position may particularly benefit from PSMcredentialed employees able to connect        different people and function in multiple roles indeed many PSM graduates have job        descriptions expressly created for them We need generalists rather than specialists        says James L Ratcliff Chairman and CEO of Rowpar Pharmaceuticals a dental products        company in Scottsdale Arizona For small companies like his Ratcliff says PSM graduates        have an appropriate combination of project management expertise an understanding of        business environments and priorities and advanced knowledge in the physical and life        sciences        Although it is too early for comprehensive assessment employment outcomes for PSM        graduates have been examined and this result is clear they are getting industry jobs        According to The Conference Board an independent business management organization funded        by the Sloan Foundation to survey PSM alumni by   of the first PSM graduates had        obtained fulltime positions within their field despite a whitecollar recession        twothirds with salaries of  or more A separate analysis by the Commission on        Professionals in Science and Technology found that  of employed respondents were hired        by businesses Employment opportunities range from marketing to bioinformatics see Box         Companies need people that can work in companies says Lindy A Brigham coordinator of        the Applied Biosciences PSM program at the University of Arizona                    Not a Perfect Cure        Although most scientific careers demand a graduate degree a professional masters in        many hard sciences still encounters entrenched academic opposition According to LeeJen        Wei then acting chair of the Department of Biostatistics in the Harvard School of Public        Health quoted in the         Wall Street Journal  Harvard tries to create leadership in industry        academics and government and our philosophy is we dont think that with a masters degree        people can fill that role very easily        The government appears to agree with this view While most doctoral candidates receive        federal funds for tuition and other expenses there is little money for masters students        who disproportionately end up in industry regardless of specialization PSM students are        especially affected by this problem because interdisciplinary equals expensive        Similarly interdisciplinary can also mean hard to findcompanies with targeted        recruitment often miss PSM students who are not in any particular departmentand        confusingdifferences in these new still somewhat vaguely defined programs can make        hiring comparisons difficult But perhaps the most conspicuous drawback to PSMs is their        newness and resulting obscurity almost half of graduates say they are not sure        employers will value their PSM or the unique skill set it affords                    But Will They Succeed        Still many observers of higher education support the PSM concept Judith GlazerRaymo        author of the forthcoming book         Professionalizing Graduate Education The Masters Degree in the        Marketplace  argues that converging market forces will lead to the success of the        professional masters degree in science These forces include rapid technological change        the rise of alternative learning channels such as online and distance education corporate        universities and hitech certification programs the proliferation of degrees in general        and in multidisciplinary fields specifically and a fundamental societal shift away from        public service and toward entrepreneurship profitability and competition        Kenneth R Smith former dean of the Eller College of Business and Public Administration        at the University of Arizona and others make the case that PSMs may protect students        careers from outsourcing to foreign countries The American SE labor pool is        shrinking and industry has already responded by transferring much of its research and        development overseas however companies are mostly moving lab scientists not strategic        analysts Crosstraining in both science and business could thus provide an edge for        domestic workers in the nearterm employment environment in fact PSM programs have a        higher proportion of US citizens and residents than SE doctoral programs        Further in its  report the National Science Board urged the government to better        align SE graduate education with expected national skill needs including        interdisciplinary skills The report also recommended federal funding for a wider range        of educational options and more attention on the real economic concerns of studentscode        words for support of professional masters degree initiatives In the same vein top        universities now advocate interconnections between their professional schools and        traditional departments as a way of strengthening the overall academic mission and many        countries are sponsoring initiatives to stimulate universityindustry links to maximize        marketing of technological innovations        For advocates then the PSM both advances the cause of science education reform and        addresses changing employment conditions with one big idea reinvention of the twoyear        graduate credential for an entrepreneurial age Herzer for one now a technology        development representative at the Scripps Research Institute has staked his future on the        potential of professional masters degrees Scientists rarely understand business        dealings and business personnel rarely comprehend scientific discoveries he says The        overlay of the two is crucial for any successful business transaction of scientific        origins
