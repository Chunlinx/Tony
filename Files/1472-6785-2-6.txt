                    Background        The importance of parasites in the ecology of large        mammals is being increasingly recognized but empirical        studies on the ecology of parasites of large mammals are        scanty Parasites can potentially affect population growth        of a species as well as interactions between species Apart        from devastating epidemics     the milder endemic        parasites can also play a major role in population        regulation      Parasites have many other ecological        implications in phenomena such as parasite mediated host        competition     sex and sexual selection               social behaviour including xenophobia and sexual fidelity            foraging strategies     and predator prey        dynamics             Parasites are likely to play a significant role in the        ecology of tigers for twofold reasons Watve and Sukumar           showed that animals having less predatory pressure        have greater parasite loads tigers showing the maximum        loads among the  species they examined in the Mudumalai        wildlife sanctuary The estimated parasite densities in        some of the tigers in the Mudumalai wildlife sanctuary were        up to  flukes in the lungs or a total of  meter        length of tapeworms in the intestine     Parasites in        such a large amount can certainly have considerable impact        on the health behaviour and reproductive success of        individuals Parasites may be responsible for cub mortality        and cub mortality is perhaps the most important factor in        the population viability of tigers     Secondly        parasites having the prey species as intermediate host and        the predator as a definitive host may alter the predator        prey dynamics     Parasites with a predatorprey life        cycle constitute a substantial proportion of the parasite        community of carnivores and therefore these might have a        more significant role in the ecology of predators        We report here the patterns in the abundance and        diversity of faecally dispersed helminth parasites of Tiger        in the Tadoba National Park of central India and discuss        the possible implications for tiger ecology We use the        fecal densities of parasite eggs larvae and cysts        referred together as parasite propagules as indicators of        parasite load of an individual Coprologic studies have        been used to study the parasites of wild mammals        qualitatively as well as quantitatively                  Shaw and Moss    found that egg densities were        linearly correlated with worm burdens in Red Grouse        Skorping et al    showed a positive correlation between        worm biomass and egg output For an endangered predator        such as tiger there is no alternative way of collecting        sufficient number of samples Therefore despite the        inherent limitations fecal examination is the only        practicable way of collecting data on parasites                    Results and discussion        Out of the  samples analyzed  were positive for        helminth propagules The mean intensities in the positive        samples were high propagules per gram mean          median   maximum   The mean for all samples        was  The postmortem examination of a dead old tigress        revealed an estimated  meter length of         Diphyllobothrium   meters of         Taenia sp and close to          Toxascaris leonina  Tapeworm        segments were frequently found in fresh or old scats The        parasite prevalence and abundance in tigers of Tadoba were        high but substantially less as compared to two other        published studies from southern India     and        Thailand     Host species that are free of predatory        pressures appear to have higher parasite loads    and        therefore the high prevalence and abundance in tigers is        not surprising There was considerable variation in the        parasite loads of individuals and this could be one of the        determinants in the competitive success of individuals The        parasite component therefore should be an essential part of        any comprehensive study of tiger ecology        Parasites from  genera were detected in the  positive        samples table  The conservative estimate of the number        of biotypes based on propagule morphology was  and a        liberal one was  The frequency distribution of parasite        densities in all the samples was highly aggregated as        indicated by the large variance to mean ratio The        variances for all types of parasites were one or two orders        of magnitude greater than the mean and tended to increase        with the mean Similar to the observations of McCallum           on protozoan parasite densities in fish the double        logarithmic plot of means and variances was linear with a        slope close to two fig  The variances thus scaled        linearly with the square of the mean A similar pattern was        noted by Watve    across a range of host species The        consistency of this pattern in the three unrelated        situations is curious but as yet we do not know the factors        that make the parasite variance scale with the square of        the mean        The prevalence of a parasite species was positively        correlated with the mean density in positive samples        Pearsons r   p   Prevalence abundance        correlations are seen in other parasite communities            as well as freeliving communities     A simple        explanation for this could be that parasites which have        higher densities are also more easily detected and hence        add to the prevalence It is also likely to be due to a        spill over effect Parasites that infect individuals with        greater intensities produce more propagules and thereby        infect a greater proportion of individuals There was no        significant correlation between the propagule densities of        any two genera or any pair of operational taxonomic units        OTUs see methods for explanation Therefore there was no        evidence for competitive exclusion or cooccurrence between        any two parasites        The parasite community was dominated by parasites with        indirect life cycles This would be expected for hosts that        occur in low densities so that direct transmission between        individuals is difficult Further the short monsoon and low        soil moisture perhaps makes the survival of direct        lifecycle parasites more difficult Therefore unlike the        prolonged monsoon habitat of Mudumalai wild life sanctuary            hookworms were not common in Tadoba National Park        Particularly common were         Diphyllobothrium and         Taenia sp Unlike the findings of        Watve    and Patton and Robinowitz            Paragonimus and         Capillaria were not common         Diphyllobothrium was the most        prevalent and was detected in  samples and densities up        to   g were found The species of         Diphyllobothrium in domestic        carnivores have a lifecycle involving fish as the        intermediate host The definitive host is known to get        infected by consuming infected fish However the contents        of over  tiger scats data not shown did not reveal        scales or any other evidence of fish eating in the study        area Dubay    also analyzed  tiger scats in the        same area during  to  but did not report fish        scales in the scat If         Diphyllobothrium infection were        acquired by eating fish the cost of fish eating for a tiger        would be large as compared to the nutritional benefit No        specific information is available on the pathological        effects of         Diphyllobothrium on tigers However        since         Diphyllobothrium are very large worms        the energy cost of their growth or even the space occupied        in the intestine can be a significant cost to the host        individual Therefore fish eating would not be an        evolutionary stable behaviour for tigers in areas with        adequate ungulate prey density It is possible therefore        that the species of         Diphyllobothrium seen in tigers has a        different life cycle that does not necessarily involve fish        eating by the definitive host The definitive host could be        small aquatic animals which are ingested accidentally by        tigers Alternatively the infective stages may leave the        alternative host and enter the definitive host through        water or by active penetration of the skin The life cycle        needs to be investigated The life cycles of other        parasites can be currently assumed to be similar to those        in the domestic carnivores table  It is hard to obtain        data on the pathological effects of parasites on the host        individual in the wild Tapeworms hookworms or lung fluke        are known to be debilitating when in large numbers            If the same applies to wild tigers parasites can        potentially be an important population regulating factor in        tigers This needs serious investigations        Although the  samples analyzed revealed between  to         possible species it is likely that many more species        remain undetected This is particularly likely because a        number of species were encountered only once We used the        nonparametric bootstrap estimator of the total number of        species including the ones that were not detected             Using the conservative morphotype number the estimate was         sd   n and a liberal estimate was         sd   n   The helminth community of tigers        therefore was highly diverse despite the host population        being small and fragmented        A possible source of bias in the above analysis is that        the  samples must have come from a much smaller number of        individuals Many individuals therefore must have been        sampled repeatedly and each individual sample cannot be        considered as independent In an attempt to correct for        repeated sampling we subjected the  samples to cluster        analysis The predominant helminth species of tigers are        large and longlived Therefore we do not expect the        parasite species composition to change rapidly If this is        true a cluster analysis of all the samples should yield        definite clusters that probably represent individual        tigers We used a log transform of abundance data on each        parasite taxon in each sample and subjected all samples to        cluster analysis using Euclidean distance and group average        strategy for clustering    fig  The number of        clusters decreased with distance with two distinct plateaus        Fig  Defining clusters at a plateau is natural as well        robust     The first plateau occurred at a distance of         resulting into  clusters Clusters at this level are        unlikely to represent individual tigers for two reasons        The samples analyzed contain four from a male and three        from a female tiger that were identified anecdotally from        sightings and distinctive pugmarks Both of them belonged        to two distinct clusters fig  The maximum distance        between two samples of an identified individual was         that is considerably greater than the position of the first        plateau but slightly less than that for the second plateau        downstream It seems reasonable therefore to assume that        the distinct clusters obtained with the second plateau        beginning at a distance of  represent different        individual tigers The first plateau gives us  clusters        which is unrealistically large for the study area The        second plateau gives us  distinct clusters This number        is within the limits of the reported tiger densities from        comparable habitats            The broad statistical patterns observed remained        unchanged after clustering The double logarithmic plot of        means and variances was linear with a slope of  The        prevalence abundance correlation remained positive but was        nonsignificant No association was found between any two        parasites after clustering        Out of the  clusters recognized  were represented by        a number of samples and  were single samples The        territory holding resident tigers are very likely to be        sampled repeatedly whereas the nonresident transients that        may have visited the study area occasionally could have        been sampled only once If the larger clusters represented        resident tigers the study area could have  resident tigers        and an unestimated but certainly a larger number of        nonresident tigers Out of the four large clusters        cluster  consisted of zero or low density  g of        propagules The propagules however belonged to three        different parasites in different samples namely ascarid         Taenia and lungworms Therefore the        cluster might represent up to three individuals raising the        possible number of resident tigers to  The cluster         consisted of samples having between  to          Diphyllobothrium eggs per gram and no        other parasite The cluster  consisted of between  to                 Diphyllobothrium eggs and occasional        ascarid eggs and the cluster  consisted of a large number         of         Diphyllobothrium eggs with a low to        moderate number of         Taenia and Ascarid or lungworm If        the areas over which each of the four large clusters was        sampled fig  were considered as home ranges of        individual tigers the home range sizes were  Km for        cluster   Km for cluster   Km for cluster         and  Km for cluster  The presumed home range        sizes are close to the sizes of tiger home ranges in radio        telemetry studies     There was a considerable overlap        in the distribution of the collection sites of the samples        in different clusters Very similar overlaps have been seen        in radiotelemetry studies            Interestingly the presumed resident tigers had        significantly lower parasite loads than the presumed        nonresident ones Median test X   p   This        can happen if tigers which are parasite resistant and        therefore healthier are more likely to be successful in        establishing territories Alternatively transient tigers        may be under greater stress and therefore more susceptible        to parasites Ranging over a larger area might also result        in acquiring more parasites since the range covers more        microhabitats that may harbor different intermediate hosts        and different survival conditions for parasite infective        stages It cannot be ignored however that such a pattern        can arise as an artifact of cluster analysis If the        variance in parasite densities within scat samples of a        single individual increased with the mean it is likely that        the distances become larger for samples with higher        parasite loads A log transformation of the data would        substantially reduce this effect In any case the        suggestion obtained from the observed pattern needs        validation that can be done by monitoring the parasite        compositions of identified or radiocollared tigers over a        considerable time period                    Conclusions        Tigers have rich and diverse parasite communities that        are dominated by indirect life cycle parasites Parasite        community of tiger shares certain statistical patterns with        other parasite communities notably the positively skewed        distribution prevalenceabundance correlation and scaling        of variance with the square of the mean        Of particular interest are the clusters the        territories occupied by each of the clusters and the        apparently higher parasite loads of the presumably        nonterritorial ones These findings need to be validated        by long term parasite monitoring of identified individual        tigers In the absence of such a validation the above        results are only suggestive They leave no doubt however        about the need to include parasites in any comprehensive        study of tiger ecology Since the frequency of locating        fresh scats is usually high in most of the tiger areas        parasite compositions in scats can be a useful tool in        monitoring tigers particularly in areas where tiger        sighting is rare Besides a number of questions regarding        individual health prey choice territorial behaviour        movement patterns and reproductive success in relation to        parasite loads can be worth investigating                    Materials and Methods                  Study Area          The TadobaAndhari Tiger Reserve TATR between             N to    N latitude to    E          to    E longitude lies in the Chandrapur          district of Vidarbha Region of Maharashtra and is spread

except for the pugmark          based estimate by the forest department of  tigers in          TATR and  in the Tadoba National Park No standard          deviations are available with these estimates                          Sample collection and analysis          Fresh faecal samples of tigers were collected by          following fresh tiger trails in the early morning hours          from the Tadoba range over a period of two years Samples          were collected from the ground avoiding the part          contaminated with soil Weighed quantities of the samples          typically  grams were analyzed using the quantitative          zinc sulphate sedimentation flotation technique              to estimate parasite propagule densities per gram of          faeces The sample was mixed with water and filtered to          remove debris The filtrate was centrifuged at  rmp          for  minutes The supernatant was then removed and  ml          of ZnSO            solution sp Gr  was added          and mixed with the sediment This was again centrifuged          at  rpm for  minutes Using an L shaped wire loop          with a  mm diameter loop the contents of the surface          layer were transferred on to a slide for observation All          the propagules were counted and the count converted into          density per gram of sample Watve  compared          different methods of fecal analysis and found that Zinc          Sulfate flotation was more sensitive in detecting low          densities of propagules although at high concentrations          it tended to underestimate the numbers The counts thus          obtained were used for calculation of prevalence and mean          densities The prevalence was defined as the proportion          of samples showing the presence of parasite The mean          densities for all the samples were calculated separately          and mean intensities in positive samples were calculated          ignoring the negative samples          Adult worms and tapeworm segments were collected from          faeces whenever present and from autopsy of a dead          tigress The  samples collected came from a much          smaller number of individuals Many individuals therefore          must have been sampled repeatedly For seven of the          samples the individual sampled was identified by sighting          or by a distinctive pugmark                          Parasite identification          Parasites were identified to the genus or family level          from the propagule morphology Since extensive taxonomic          accounts of the helminth species of tigers in the wild          are not available we do not claim to have identified all          species Whenever morphological differences in the          propagules including distinct bimodality in size were          present within a genus distinct operational taxonomic          units OTUs were recognized Attempt to identify the          species was made only when the adult stages were          collected Due to the unavoidable tentativeness in          identification while analyzing parasite diversity we          used two strategies A conservative one in which closely          resembling morphotypes were merged into a single OTU and          a liberal one in which OTUs were split based on small but          distinguishable differences Due to the limitations of          faecal analysis the terms prevalence and intensities have          somewhat different meanings     than the classical          definitions of Margolis                              Statistical analysis          Parasite distributions are typically highly skewed          Therefore we use nonparametric methods throughout          Species richness estimate by Bootstrap  The method uses          a computer simulated subsampling from the data and          calculates the species richness using Smith and van Belle          equation          BS  S   p           i  n          Where          B  bootstrap estimate of species richness          S  Observed number of species in original data          p           i  proportion of the n bootstrap          quadrats that have species i present The simulation is          repeated  times to get the mean estimate and its          standard deviation                          Clustering by parasite species composition          Parasite abundance data for each taxon was log          transformed The log transformed data for each taxon were          used for cluster analysis using CLUSTERBAS    with          Euclidean distance and group average strategy Thus both          species richness and relative abundance are considered          during clustering
