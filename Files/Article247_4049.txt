                                 What Do Autopilots Do                        News reports about the crashes of EgyptAirFlight  and the private plane carrying golfer Payne Stewart have focused onthe use of the airplanes autopilots What exactly do autopilotsdo            The autopilot is an electronic system that manipulates thethree control surfaces that determine an airplanes course the movablepanels called ailerons on the back of each wing thatallow the plane to bank right or left the tail rudder which turns theaircrafts nose and the elevators which point the plane up or down Theautothrottle which determines the airplanes speed is controlled by aseparate system            On commercial aircraft the autopilot and autothrottle arecontrolled by an advanced onboard navigational computer called the flightmanagement system FMS Typically a pilot programs the FMS before takeoffentering landmarks altitude and desired speed during flight the FMS usesinstrument readings and radio signals from fixed points on the ground to figureout what adjustments are needed to meet the flight plan If a human is incommand he or she must make the changes by hand with the autopilot engagedthese adjustments are made automatically            Autopilots have several advantages Primarily they help keepthe crew from getting tired leaving them free to alter the flight plan scoutfor traffic and monitor the planes other systems like hydraulics and airpressurization Autopilots also improve fuel efficiency and passenger comfortsince the adjustments made by an autopilot are more subtle and accurate thanthose made by hand            Thats why autopilots are typically engaged on commercialaircraft throughout nearly the entire flight When human pilots takecontrolusually during takeoff and landing and occasionally in midflightits largely because they need to stay in practice not because theautopilot would be unable to fly safely In fact in bad weather the FAA mayrequire that pilots allow the autopilot and FMS which dont rely on visualcues to land the plane Pilots also take command in turbulence since anautopilot would waste fuel and possibly exacerbate the bumps by making manyadjustments to keep the plane on a steady course If a pilot doesnt disengagethe autopilot before taking control the FMS interprets his movements asoutside forces and instructs the autopilot to work against them            Nextquestion            Explainer thanks the Air TransportAssociation and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association
