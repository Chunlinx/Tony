                                 Ideas Optimism Compassion            Jack Kemp is a man of ideasJack Kemp is compassionate a selfdescribed bleedingheart conservativeJack Kemp is optimistic These are the three great strengths Kemp is said tobring to the Republican ticket And the downside Judging from the mediacoverage Kemps only problem is that he may be too good for the job tooreasonable for his extremeconservative party too idealistic to get along withthe worldweary Bob Dole too boyishly bumptious to sit quietly in secondplace            Kemp is neither a phony nora cynic He is sincere wellmeaning and impossible not to like But he hasgotten an amazing free pass since Dole chose him last week on his threealleged strengths            Take hissocalled ideas Kemp does indeed love ideas But he loves them the way ararebook collector loves his leather volumes He loves to acquire them ownthem fondle them display themeverything but open them up and read themSimilarly Kemp adds ideas to his collectionsupplyside economics the goldstandard enterprise zones school vouchersthen immediately puts them behindglass A real man of ideas loves to play with ideas Kemp just loves to repeatthem            Its laughably easy to get a reputation as a thinker inWashington At least Kemp unlike the last man of ideas in American politicsGary Hart does not posture as the chinpulling philosopher Indeed hisselfdeprecating Imjustadumbjock routine inoculates him against charges ofintellectual pretension But Kemp will for example ostentatiously throw outthe full name of a  th century French economistJean BaptisteSayas a way of implying incorrectly that he has more than the vaguestnotion of what Says Law supply creates its own demand is aboutother thanknowing that it includes the magic word supply Reporters are impressed Andif they arent completely buffaloed they still give Kemp points for effort andobvious sincerity Even an empty enthusiasm for ideas is appealing in a partywhose other leaders Dole Speaker Newt Gingrich Chairman Haley Barbour claimnot to have read their own platform            Like the first names of deadeconomists the blizzard of statistics that blows through Kemps oeuvreof opeds gives an impression of learning But Jack Kemp is a propagandist nota thinker One small example In the New York Times last Februaryarguing surprise surprise that tax cuts will increase tax revenues Kempwrote In the s taxes were lowered from a top marginal rate of  percentto  percent By the end of the decade Americas real gross domestic productsurged by  percent A little math reveals that this surge implies averageannual GDP growth of  percentnot too different from the  percent growthof recent years that Kemp claims is woefully inadequate And the differenceas Jodie Allen pointed out in Slate a whileback can be fully accounted for by the ironic fact that governmentspendingwhich is part of GDPgrew in the Reaganite s and is shrinking inthe Clintonite s Kemps writings have no more inaccuracies misleadingstatistics and fallacious arguments than those of most other politicians Buta glaring internal contradiction is especially telling for a wouldbe man ofideas It suggests that you are not subjecting your own ideas to even theminimal test of logical consistency            Whatsusually missing from Kemps ideas is the intellectual discipline ofacknowledging that more of this means less of that Regarding abortion Kempsays My premise is that both the motherthe womanand the childtheunbornshould have constitutional protections for life and freedom It wouldbe lovely if a womans freedom to choose didnt conflict with a fetus claim onlife But the notion that this can be arranged is a magic wish not anidea            The same defect mars Kemps compassionJournalists seem to regard bleedingheart conservative as a charming anomalyor a welcome melding of extremes into moderation rather than as a mathematicalconundrum Kemp is in favor of expensive programs for the poor He also favorsgiant tax cuts for the rich And he opposes any cuts in middleclassentitlements It is a remarkable coincidence that none of Kemps ideas forhelping the poorwhich get him so much credit for beingcompassionateinvolves any effort or sacrifice by the affluent and themiddle class Quite the contrary They almost invariably involve tax breaks forthese groups No doubt Kemp sincerely believes in the supplyside alchemy Andno doubt his personal compassion for societys downtrodden is real But aspublic policy costfree compassion is worth about what it costs            Whichbrings us to optimism I too would be optimistic if I thought most of oursocial problems could be solved by lower taxes for everyone even lower taxesfor rich people no taxes at all for residents of Washington DC yes Kemphas proposed a zero tax rate for K Street lawyers and Georgetown socialitesand that the more you cut peoples taxes the more money will flood into thefederal treasury But believing that requires more than a leap of faith Itrequires a leap of reason            Its easy to be optimistic if you believe in the toothfairy Kemp seems to think that those who refuse to leap with him actuallyprefer pain sacrifice and rootcanal economics And its probablytrue that psychological predisposition as much as reason and intellect leadsdour characters like Paul Tsongas anduntil the other dayBob Dole to bepreachers of sacrifice while sunny characters like Jack Kemp become apologistsfor alchemy But its silly to prize optimism for its own sake in a publicfigure irrespective of whether that optimism is justified Indeed unjustifiedoptimism is more dangerous than unjustified pessimism Unless that is just adour predisposition talking            The main reason the mediahave greeted Jack Kemp so rapturously isnt his ideas his optimism or hiscompassion It is simple doglike gratitude for a reason to declare thepresidential race more interesting And credit for that compassionateoptimistic idea goes to cruel braindead sourpuss Bob Dole So credit givenNow lets give Kemp the goingover he deserves            Michael Kinsley is editorof Slate
