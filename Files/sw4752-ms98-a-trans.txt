        im ready       well in Atlanta Georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in Patterson California   oh could could be   uh this little city is only about eight thousand people   um   so   oh yeah we is is crime a problem there do you like a major problem minor problem or   well in Patterson theres its not a problem here but like uh i lived in Oakland uh until just recently     umhum   and uh Oakland California God theyve had like uh sixty seven murders so far this year compared to like uh forty at this time last year   yeah   so its really bad there  its all related to drugs it seems like   yeah oh yeah   is that what its there too   yeah um ive only been here for like oh probably just over six months i started started school here   uhhuh   um i came from a smaller town in in New York and crime the city was fairly big size or not real big but we had a problem there but here its just no comparison that much more crime uh   umhum umhum   every every night the news is very depressing because it just you know they run down the list of how many people were shot you know drive by shootings or   yeah   whatever and its its its pretty bad theyre theyre its things are basically improved here over the last few years theyve the theyve actually taken steps to try to make it better but it still it still is a problem   yeah Like i dont know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen   well thats that seemed to be what they were doing and it has and theyve started stepped up more patrols in certain areas and it has has made some places safer but you you know its very difficult i mean if you dont have an infinite amount of money to to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could   uhhuh umhum umhum   as it is a is definitely a problem and you know the more it more less thats done about it the more it seems it tends to spread even to smaller areas unfortunately   umhum yeah well i i think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands and you know then then maybe those other people would be kind of scared and they would not do these bad things you know   right yeah i think i think uh its uh seems to be that i dont know some people they tend they do something you know they shoot somebody or whatever they go to jail sentenced to jail for like thirty years theyre out in five and theyre back on the street and then they shoot someone else and just cyclical cyclical cyclical and it seems seems as though the the system doesnt  tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done   yeah i just dont understand our our laws here because you know like in other countries man i mean theyre really a lot stricker than we are   yeah its its definitely true it seems seems as though we we try to play humanitarian i think to a little to much and maybe some of the people dont deserve the the humanitarian treatment that they get   umhum umhum   unfortunately but i dont know its a difficult situation i think and some something has to be done because i definitely think its it it really plays reeks havoc with uh your quality of life when you know you can see its going on around you but then when once it finally affects you then then it really starts to bother you   umhum umhum um   but it seems i mean it people move like out of the city because they want to get away from the crime and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out but you know its only a matter of time before you know it still catches up with them you cant really run away from the problem   yeah   and something you know something has to be done but its just that too many people argue about how to fix it   yeah i know when i lived in Oakland it was just that uh like i definitely wouldnt go into certain areas of of the city by myself   oh sure   and uh and then then again some areas i wouldnt go by myself after dark   right   you know   right   but down here in Patterson well like i say its so small that you can go anywhere   yeah yeah thats good   but just uh like twenty miles away see in Modesto they have uh those gangs and things over there   right   and its its bad in Sacramento also they have uh drive by shootings it seems like all the time   yeah   so i dont know i just i just dont know what what they can do you know   yeah yeah its its to bad because its um i mean the just the even the random occurrences where you know its unsafe for a woman just to walk from their car to the some in certain areas like from from the car from their car to the mall or something and its dangerous and its just thats just ridiculous and   i know   you know its just uh its just not right something you know   yeah i mean like even even going to the grocery store i know weve had this one lady that was attacked you know i mean just uh you just you just dont know what to do anymore you know   right right right   and some of the times its happening in the daytime too you know so its not always happening at dark   yeah   so i dont know   yeah its uh definitely unfortunate unfortunate and it just
