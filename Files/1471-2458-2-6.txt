                    Background        Mefloquine was developed by the US Army and introduced        for the treatment of malaria in the late s           Mefloquine was first used for prophylaxis in  and        since then approximately  million people have been        prescribed the drug for malaria prevention versus         million for treatment           In the first decade of mefloquines use the reported        adverse effects were mainly gastrointestinal    In the        late s it became clear that mefloquine could cause        neuropsychiatric adverse effects    The first        randomised controlled trial of mefloquine prophylaxis in        heterogeneous nonimmune Western travellers was published        in  and found that onethird of all mefloquine users        reported neuropsychiatric adverse effects and  of all        users reported at least one severe adverse event defined        as requiring medical advice           On the evidence from a case series published in  by        the manufacturer HoffmannLa Roche the World Health        Organisation WHO recommends that travellers with a        personal or family history of seizures or manicdepressive        illness should not take mefloquine prophylaxis            However the Centers for Disease Control and their Canadian        equivalent CATMAT do not recognise this as a valid        contraindication to taking mefloquine           A recent analysis of spontaneous reports held on the        Dutch national pharmacovigilance database suggested that        there is a mefloquine syndrome consisting of excessive        sweating accompanied by malaise nausea diarrhoea        agitation concentration problems and nightmares           The aetiology of the adverse effects associated with        mefloquine use remains obscure Ten cohort studies in        tourists found that women generally experienced worse side        effects from mefloquine than men                    an eleventh did not find this effect    In        randomised controlled trials children have tolerated        mefloquine well     Surprisingly one cohort study        found that some older adult travellers tolerate mefloquine        better than younger adults    It has also been        reported that Asian patients tolerate mefloquine better        than Caucasians and Africans     Despite early        concerns mefloquine appears to be safe in pregnancy                  Although the adverse effects of mefloquine are common        and often serious and long lasting and the drug has been        widely used for over  years no real attempts have so far        been made to investigate and explain these effects A        systematic review of mefloquine prophylaxis performed        within the Cochrane Collaboration now tabulates  case        reports published in  papers between         describing adverse effects from mefloquine at prophylactic        and therapeutic dosages           We retrieved and critically reviewed all the original        papers listed in the Cochrane review to clarify the        phenomenology of the adverse effects associated with        mefloquine and to look for clues to possibly safer use of        the drug                    Analysis of case reports                  Common features of the case reports          Of the  published case reports of mefloquine          adverse effects recorded in the mefloquine systematic          review  of the reports related to prophylactic          mefloquine use and  to treatment use  of the           cases  related to tourists or business travellers             Onethird of the reports were in languages other          than English  mainly French German and Danish The          search strategy for finding the case reports is described          in the review    An annotated bibliography of the           published reports can be found at          httpwwwlivacukevidence           of the case reports recorded three or fewer          individual patient parameters for example the patients          age sex and mefloquine dose taken and many of these          reports were little more than a short description of an          unexpected adverse event set in the context of a larger          study  of the reports however contained some          discussion of the causality of the symptoms attributed to          the drug and  proposed a mechanism by which these          symptoms might be occurring           of the  case reports we reviewed described one          or more symptoms consistent with a           transient anicteric chemical          hepatitis eg malaise fever anorexia headache          abdominal pain nausea diarrhoea concentration          difficulties Of the remaining reports many were          consistent with a           posthepatic syndrome although in          some cases the disorders described could have been due to          conditions such as anxiety depression chronic fatigue          or jet lag           of all the case reports described symptomatology          suggesting acutely           disturbed thyroid function eg          anorexia fatigue tremor palpitations nervousness          increased sweating mood andor sleep disturbance memory          and concentration disorders emotional lability altered          bowel habit depression          Table categorises the  published case reports          according to whether the clinical features were very          likely plausibly or probably unrelated to liver or          thyroid pathology We have based this classification on          standard lists of the common symptoms and signs of liver          and thyroid disease     The direction of thyroid          symptoms was mainly towards hyperthyroidism though some          patients exhibited signs of both an over and an          underactive thyroid for example tachycardia          alternating with bradycardia          The table also shows the median duration of symptoms          reported by prophylactic and treatment mefloquine          users and the median dose taken within each category          The median duration of adverse effects of patients who          took mefloquine as treatment appears to have been shorter          than that of those who took the drug as prophylaxis           days versus  days even though the median dose of          mefloquine taken was higher in the treatment group We          believe that one explanation for this unexpected finding          may lie in the fact that the treatment users of          mefloquine were more likely to have taken the drug as          monotherapy whereas the prophylaxis users more commonly          took one or more comedications as well as alcohol We          discuss the possible significance of this later in this          paper                          Mefloquine and the liver          Mefloquine is an aryl amino alcohol which accumulates          in both the liver and the lungs and is subject to          enterohepatic circulation    It has recently been          found to cause acute hepatitis             Mefloquine does not appear to cause florid signs of          liver disease However transient subclinical          disturbances of liver function are a common feature of          many drugs metabolised in the liver and this may explain          the frequent finding of transaminase changes in safety          studies of new drugs these biochemical findings are          usually dismissed as meaningless noise but they may in          fact be sensitive or oversensitive markers of          vulnerability of low specificity          That mefloquine induces liver enzymes is well          documented Jaspers et al reported significantly raised          transaminases in Dutch marines who took mefloquine during           months in Cambodia and who were not drinking alcohol          at the time    Takeshima found that of a cohort of          healthy Japanese soldiers who took prophylactic          mefloquine for  weeks without drinking alcohol          onequarter developed symptoms compatible with liver          pathology and four showed disturbed liver function             Reisinger et al observed the same phenomenon in a          cohort of shortstay European travellers to Africa but          it is not clear whether alcohol could have contributed to          this effect    One of the travellers who was          concurrently taking a liverdamaging agent sulfadoxine             showed gross morphological changes in his liver          which were attributed to his use of prophylactic          mefloquine Liver biopsy showed intralobular cellular          infiltrates consisting of macrophages and eosinophils as          well as sporadic eosinophilic cell necroses virology was          negative    Grieco et al described a yearold          woman who drank wine daily while taking mefloquine and          who became nervous and depressed with nausea vomiting          and diarrhoea She was dehydrated and in severe liver          failure with negative virology Liver biopsy showed          diffuse macrovesical hepatic steatosis             Heavy sun exposure is noted in a case report of a          yearold Frenchman who reacted acutely to his second          mefloquine tablet it is likely that this sun exposure          would have caused dehydration    A year old French          traveller concurrently taking an oral contraceptive had          epileptic seizures in her sixth week of mefloquine          prophylaxis directly after severe exertion    It          seems likely that in some mefloquine users dehydration          will impose an added burden on the liver and that this          could contribute to a severe reaction to the drug Many          longhaul travellers using mefloquine are mildly          dehydrated from inflight alcohol and air conditioning          followed by hot and dry conditions and more alcohol          consumption at their holiday or business          destination          Of the  case reports we reviewed eleven cited          alcohol as possibly contributing to the adverse drug          effects described Wittes et al reported a remarkable          challengerechallenge experiment where a healthy male          geologist took both his third and his fourth weekly          mefloquine tablet together with half a bottle of whisky          and on both occasions experienced acute paranoid          delusions depression and suicidal ideation a fellow          geologist who shared the same whisky bottle and who was          taking no antimalaria medication experienced no such          effects             Vuurman et al sponsored by HoffmannLa Roche tested          in healthy volunteers whether or not alcohol might          interact adversely with mefloquine    They found          psychomotor performance unimpaired but their study          design had important limitations Only  participants          took mefloquine and of these two women dropped out due          to adverse events one with nausea vomiting and          dizziness the other with malaise fever and headache          The study protocol forbade strenuous physical activity          and any prescribed medications Alcohol was given under          strict laboratory conditions  h after mefloquine          ingestion and then in small and interrupted doses such          that the blood alcohol concentration in any participant          never exceeded  mg ml  The authors admit that          their study did not address the question of what might          happen should mefloquine users consume intoxicating          amounts of alcohol    Their findings can thus not be          generalised to the broad population of tourists and          business travellers          Approximately half of the case reports listed in the          Cochrane review note some comedication taken along with          mefloquine    Other quinoline derivatives chiefly          chloroquine and quinine are the commonest comedications          mentioned in the case reports After antimalaria drugs          an oral contraceptive noted in  reports is the next          most commonly reported comedication followed by sodium          valproate  and diazepam  All these drugs can cause          liver damage    Diazepam is also a thyroid hormone          antagonist and we discuss below the possible          significance of this Meszaros et al reported a male          traveller who in addition to mefloquine took          thioridazine amitriptyline and fluphenazine all capable          of damaging the liver and whose mefloquineassociated          neuropsychiatric symptoms persisted for over a year             Gullahorn et al reported a series of patients who          experienced delirium on emerging from anaesthesia          possibly because in addition to mefloquine they had          received isoflurane an anaesthetic known to cause          hepatocellular necrosis              One report describes an acute reaction in a man who          took one mefloquine tablet each week together with two          aspirin tablets One hour after taking his fifth          mefloquine tablet he experienced acute amnesia lasting          approximately one hour    Aspirin can cause          hepatocellular necrosis    and in addition can          aggravate acute thyroid disturbance discussed below by          competing with thyroid hormones for sites on binding          proteins                             Mefloquine and the thyroid          The preclinical studies of mefloquine by the US Army          involved close monitoring in animal models and human          volunteers of several organ systems but not the thyroid             The effect of mefloquine on thyroid function          appears not to have been investigated in any phase III or          phase IV study Thyroid function has not been tested          routinely in the diagnosis or management of patients          suffering from mefloquinerelated adverse effects          Thyroid disease or some possible interference with          thyroid activity is reported in only three of the           case reports in the Cochrane review    Bem et al          described a year old German woman with a thyroid          condition who was also taking tranquillisers          unspecified and alcohol and who had an acute          exacerbation of her schizophrenia after a single tablet          of mefloquine her symptoms persisted for  weeks             Conget et al reported a year old previously healthy          woman who experienced abdominal pain palpitations          instability insomnia and a fine distal tremor in her          second week of mefloquine prophylaxis A thyroid function          screen showed a raised serum thyroglobulin level           gml normal range  to  this returned to          normal within a month of her stopping mefloquine             Bauer et al reported acute psychotic reactions in a          healthy US Peace Corps worker who took prophylactic          mefloquine concurrently with diiodohydroxyquinoline for a          presumed parasitic infection                               Presentation of the hypothesis                  The mefloquine syndrome          The published literature describes a mefloquine          syndrome that presents in a variety of ways including          headache gastrointestinal disturbances nervousness          fatigue disorders of sleep mood memory and          concentration and occasionally frank psychosis Young          western women are particularly vulnerable to mefloquines          adverse effects Certain groups however children older          adult travellers and Asian patients tolerate mefloquine          well                          Hypothesis          The phenomenology of mefloquines adverse effect          profile together with incidental details in some of the          published case reports references to alcohol and to          known hepatotoxic comedications such as the oral          contraceptive pill suggest that for many mefloquine          users adverse drug effects may be the result of primary          hepatocellular injury caused by the drug in association          with one or more concurrent liver insults Further it          seems that in some of these symptomatic users of          mefloquine a transient thyroid disturbance may appear as          well either as an endocrine disorder secondary to the          primary liver damage or as an independent pathological          process          We therefore postulate that many of the adverse          effects of mefloquine are a posthepatic syndrome caused          by primary liver damage In some individuals we believe          that symptomatic thyroid disturbance occurs either as an          independent process or as a secondary consequence of the          initial hepatocellular injury          Previous liver or thyroid disease and concurrent          insults to the liver such as from alcohol dehydration          an oral contraceptive pill recreational drugs and other          drugs that can damage the liver may be related to the          development of many severe or prolonged adverse reactions          to mefloquine Comedications that are thyroid hormone          antagonists may also be risk factors                          Relevant reports with other quinoline          derivatives          Mefloquine is a synthetic quinoline other quinolines          include primaquine amodiaquine and chloroquine                      High doses of primaquine in rhesus monkeys have caused          acute fatal liver damage             Amodiaquine is still used to treat malaria but was          withdrawn from general use for malaria prophylaxis in           after it was found to cause liver damage and          hepatitis mostly anicteric     Some of these          reports mention comedications known to damage liver          cells phenylbutazone oral contraceptive alcohol              Amodiaquine has not been linked to disturbed thyroid          function          The possibility of a threeway interaction has already          been suggested between a quinoline derivative          chloroquine and the liver and the thyroid Munera et al          described a woman with hypothyroidism well stabilised on          thyroxine sodium  g daily who took prophylactic          chloroquine and proguanil daily for  months for a          vacation in Africa    At four weeks her thyroid          stimulating hormone TSH concentration was found to be          very high  mU normal range  but it          returned to normal within a week of her stopping the          drugs Rechallenge with chloroquine and proguanil a year          later again resulted in raised levels of TSH a lowered          concentration of free triiodothyronine T             and normal free thyroxine T             concentration Liver function was          not tested but the authors speculated that          Chloroquine seems to have enhanced the induction of          liver enzymes It probably increased the catabolism of          thyroid hormones by enzymatic induction    They also          suggested that chloroquine might act centrally on the          hypothalamus through disruption of the feedback system          by which thyrotropin releasing hormone stimulates the          pituitary to release and later synthesise TSH             A third mechanism by which chloroquine and chemically          related drugs such as mefloquine might interfere with          thyroid function is through structural homology to T             resulting in thyroid hormone          antagonism    In the rat chloroquine injections          more than halve the T            concentration without changing the          level of free T                Chloroquine has been          reported to inhibit T            uptake in mammalian cells by          inhibiting receptormediated endocytosis                               Testing the hypothesis        Our hypothesis needs to be tested through a large        multicentre cohort study of mefloquine prophylaxis in        tourists and business travellers perhaps recruited in        collaboration with one or more airlines Small randomised        controlled trials should test specific elements of the        hypothesis such as the postulated link between mefloquine        and thyroid disturbance and the presumed interaction        between mefloquine and oral contraception National        pharmacovigilance databases should also be analysed        systematically to see if the spontaneous reports of        mefloquines adverse effects tend to support our hypothesis        or not        The multicentre cohort study of prophylactic mefloquine        use should be questionnairebased and should enquire        specifically into the major risk factors alcohol intake        during travel hydration status use of hormonal        contraception and recreational drugs other potentially        hepatotoxic or thyrotoxic drugs previous history of proven        or suspected liver andor thyroid abnormality that we have        proposed The study design should include pre and        postexposure testing of liver and thyroid function in at        least a sample of the cohort        One or more casecontrol studies should be nested within        the cohort study     These nested studies would        allow for rigorous testing of the aetiological mechanisms        which we have proposed for mefloquines adverse effects        The studies should also resolve those prescribing issues on        which experts opinions differ eg Is mefloquine safe in        pregnancy Is it safe for longterm prophylaxis Should        airline pilots be prescribed mefloquine Should mefloquine        be prescribed to people with a personal or family history        of neuropsychiatric illness Can mefloquine be given safely        as a pretravel loading dose for rapid induction of        chemoprophylaxis             Mefloquine is a clinically important drug commonly used        by healthy people A much higher standard of safety is        therefore required for mefloquine prophylaxis than for        drugs given to treat serious diseases     The study        we propose is urgently needed                    Implications of the hypothesis                  What our hypothesis explains          The hypothesis explains much of the complexity of the          pattern of adverse effects of mefloquine and also the          fact that many healthy users of the drug suffer no          adverse effects at all It also explains some aspects of          mefloquines tolerability profile in travellers which          until now have not been understood notably that young          women experience more adverse effects from mefloquine          than men and that children and older adult travellers          who do not use oral contraception and who rarely misuse          alcohol seem to tolerate the drug well In addition our          hypothesis may explain the ethnic and inter individual          variations in the pharmacokinetics of this agent which          until now have not been understood              It has been known for some years that mefloquine users          who take comedications are about  times more likely          to experience an adverse drug event than those users who          take no comedications and twice as likely to experience          severe adverse drug events    The frequency of          reported adverse drug events also increases when multiple          comedications are taken    Our hypothesis plausibly          explains these earlier findings          The use of marijuana and other psychoactive agents by          chloroquine users has been associated with acute          psychotic reactions and it has been suggested that          mefloquine users who take recreational drugs may likewise          be predisposed to neuropsychiatric problems     We          believe that this association is consistent with our          hypothesis since recreational drugs can cause          hepatocellular damage and liver failure             A puzzling observation is that although the adverse          effects of mefloquine are usually reversible in some          patients these effects can persist for months or even          years after the drug has been stopped    We believe          that the occasionally protracted time course of the          adverse effects can be plausibly explained by supposing          that in these patients mefloquine is just one of several          concurrent insults to the liver and that it is the          continuance of the other insults most commonly alcohol          and certain prescription drugs that makes the          mefloquineinduced syndrome persist Some published          evidence supports this view      There is          evidence from this study Table  that the adverse          effects of mefloquine in those who have taken the drug          prophylactically persist longer than they do in patients          who have been treated with it even though the latter          group mostly receive larger doses of the drug this          paradox might be explained by the fact that although          prophylactic users usually stop mefloquine as soon as          they have experienced adverse effects they often          continue to assault their livers in other ways and it is          this which makes the effects persist          Most of the reported adverse effects of mefloquine fit          into the model we propose For example mefloquine has          been associated with a wide variety of dermatological          adverse effects and most of these can be linked with          effects on the liver or thyroid     Convulsions          and dizziness are other reported effects of mefloquine          which can be related to liver or thyroid disturbance                                       Who should not take mefloquine          We believe that people with a history of any proven or          suspected liver or thyroid abnormality in the previous          two years should avoid mefloquine Travellers taking          mefloquine should not drink alcohol especially within           h of their weekly mefloquine dose          While taking mefloquine travellers should be advised          to maintain good hydration with water or carbonated          drinks especially on long plane journeys or during          arduous work in hot conditions Alcohol tea or coffee          should not be used to maintain hydration since they all          increase water loss          Travellers taking mefloquine should not take a          hormonal contraceptive nor any other drug known to          injure liver cells    They should not take any drug          known to antagonise thyroid hormone    We propose          that drugs that are known to cause hepatocellular injury           and also to be thyroid hormone          antagonists should be absolutely contraindicated in          mefloquine users such drugs include amiodarone          benzodiazepines calcium channel blockers and phenytoin                       Because of the potential for additive toxicity          travellers taking mefloquine should avoid concurrent use          of any other quinoline derivative eg amodiaquine          chloroquine primaquine quinidine quinine          tafenoquine whether for additional prophylaxis or for          treatment The administration of a different quinoline          derivative at the same time as mefloquine may increase          the risk of adverse effects     For the same          reason mefloquine users should avoid other quinine          analogues such as fluoroquinolone antibiotics          Fluoroquinolones such as sparfloxacin of loxacin and          ciprofloxacin are increasingly prescribed in severe          cases of travellers diarrhoea and have been associated          with severe reactions in mefloquine users                             Who should take mefloquine          Mefloquine is a safe and exceptionally useful drug for          the mass prophylaxis and treatment of those resident          populations in malariaendemic areas which traditionally          abstain from alcohol and hormonal contraception It has          been suggested that in such settings mefloquine should          be combined with artemisinin or a derivative to protect          both drugs from resistance             On the basis of our hypothesis we believe that          children and also pregnant women can safely be          prescribed mefloquine because neither group uses alcohol          or oral contraceptives          Accompanied by explicit advice to avoid alcohol          maintain good hydration and use comedications with          caution we believe that prophylactic mefloquine could be          recommended to certain occupational subsets of travellers          who carry out safetycritical tasks and who until now          have been denied the use of this drug These occupational          groups include airline pilots    divers    and          operators of heavy machinery             Some authorities advise that travellers engaged in          highrisk leisure pursuits such as mountain climbing          should not use mefloquine    We believe that this          exclusion is unjustified as long as there is no recent          history of liver or thyroid disease and provided the          precautions we have proposed above avoidance of alcohol          maintenance of hydration and nonuse of hormonal          contraception recreational drugs and certain          comedications are adhered to          Lobel et al consider that WHOs exclusion of people          with a personal or family history of neuropsychiatric          illness from taking mefloquine is based on limited          evidence or theoretical concerns and we believe their          scepticism is justified    Neuropsychiatric illness          may not contraindicate use of mefloquine provided that          the patient is not currently taking anything that can          cause liver damage or thyroid disturbance                            Competing interests        None declared
