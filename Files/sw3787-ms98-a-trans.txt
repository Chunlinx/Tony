                 so hows your lawn and garden work   well today its uh  were not doing much with it because its kind of raining outside but or snowing actually  uh      yeah i understand that it actually is snowing cold and wet   but um actually my husband is in the other room um planning a um organic garden or organic treatment um   oh is he okay   yeah do you do a lot of lawn work   not so much anymore im im getting older im fifty two now so ive just uh ive sort of slowed down you know we use this rather than do it ourselves as far as fertilizing i utilize a service and i guess they do a an okay jype of job   umhum   but uh and ive let this little kid that lives behind us cut our grass just a little bit this past year i think im gonna let him do it all this year just i work uh im out of town quite a bit and i come home and seems like every Friday thats what i have to face on Saturday is doing my lawn so i just stopped doing that   well there was a time when my  husband had had had traveled a lot and um so we had a service for the first year that we were in our house and the lawn looked great  um now that that hes home we dont um   right     we havent been treating it as well you know using fertilizer and stuff or i guess the lawn looks okay its just that we dont we  still have a problem with weeds   oh i understand yeah we yeah we have a problem about every other year with weeds it it appears that every other year a service can get rid of them and uh but just just about every other year they come back   and i think maybe they uh spread some because theyre putting it down   its a constant battle i tell you   but the thing that he is wanting to try this year is um using some organic treatments and       were not real naturalists or anything but um   right     what we have heard is that the  amount of fertilizer that we put on our lawns is about the same amount that a farmer would put on a whole entire crop   i understand   and uh  i have a cold so im having a hard time   i do too so im have the same problem   um but uh um so he wants to try doing some you know different kind of stuff i dont really know what it involves or um um   right   at this point in time i enjoyed having the service when we did um the only problem was they never told us when they were coming and then you find a note on your door that says water within two to three days and it was never uh right right but uh   right right with a thirty five dollar bill  well well we didnt use one year before last a service because we  we had weeds like two years in a row and you know when you when you have a service you dont expect that so we stopped and i sort of did it myself year before last then this last summer id went back to a service and then went but went to a new service and they appear to have be doing a better job   what service did you use   Lawn Doctor   Lawn Doctor   and we used to use one in Plano and we switched to one thats more local   hm   one of our friends bought the one in Plano they just didnt uh didnt do that good a job on our lawn so we changed services   yeah we tried using Chem Lawn but um our problem is our front yard is completely different from the backyard   right   and um i think they just use the same stuff on everything because weve got a mixture our front yard is um all Bermuda whats not weeds     right   and the backyard is a mixture of Saint Augustine Bermuda and some type of uh winter grass that stays green all all winter   right either rye or something   yeah something like that its real clumpy and   yeah you can see i have we have a lot of trees in our yard so its a its you know during the summer its bare under the trees so ive pratted a lot planted a lot of rye winter rye to grow because that will grow in the summertime under trees       its more of a shade its a better shade grass so now as as cold as it is out there and as rainy as it is we have you can see where we planted all the green grass but as its in the summer because thats thats the only green area in our lawn   yeah oh  do you do you ever do you ever double sod or um  whatever   all of our Bermudas all brown we have on the side yard few years back right   you know where they mix the seed   im always uh you know sometimes im  sometimes im im over at Home Depot ill just a grab a grass a thing of  of grass seed and put it in the old spreader and just spread it real quick or throw it out in the areas where i think i need it but overall i guess we have a pretty good stand of grass they say in the summertime the hotter it is the better the Bermuda grows and course that supposedly quote will crowd out the weeds and everything so   yeah yeah i think thats our problem is that we we just need to get it fertilized really good so that we can get the grass grass growing rather than the weeds   so i just   right how about how about flowers you have you have nice flowers in your front yard   um in the front yard not so much we have a lot
