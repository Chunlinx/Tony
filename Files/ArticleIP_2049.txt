                                 Monopoly Shopping            Microsoft is paying me towrite this column Does that affect my objectivity I dont think so but Imight be wrong Fortunately it doesnt matter Im not asking for your trustIm going to lay out a simple logical argument that you can check for yourselfThe argument stands or falls on its own merits            In otherwords I aim to occupy the same high ground claimed by Abraham Lincoln in hissixth debate against Stephen A Douglas            If you have ever studiedgeometry you remember that by a course of reasoning Euclid proves that all theangles in a triangle are equal to two right angles Euclid has shown you how towork it out Now if you were to undertake to disprove that proposition wouldyou prove it to be false by calling Euclid a liar            I amprepared to go Lincoln one better and to assert that you could not proveEuclids proposition to be false even by calling him a Microsoft employee            Now then lets talk about Web browsers Morespecifically lets talk about what will happen if Microsoft extends itsoperating system monopoly into the browser market as the Department of Justiceclaims it is trying to do Microsoft denies that intention claiming it bundlesbrowsers with operating systems only to take advantage of technicalsynergies            Whosright about that one I have no idea Well OK I have some ideas but theyreprobably no better informed than yours Instead I want to ask a relatedquestion one that is central to this whole affair but has been almost entirelyignored in the dozens of oped pieces that have cropped up over the past coupleof weeks Namely Would a Microsoft browser monopoly be good or bad forconsumers            Wellgood or bad compared with what What isthe alternative to a Microsoft browser monopoly There are several scenariosyou might envision One is an eternal competition between Microsoft andNetscape each striving to capture market share through innovation The upsideof that scenario is that browsers would get better the downside is thatinnovation uses a lot of resources that might be better employed elsewhereIts not clear whether the benefits of that competition would outweigh thecosts or viceversa            Anotheralternative to a Microsoft monopoly is a Netscape monopoly Which ofthose would be better for consumers Your gut response to that questionis likely to depend pretty heavily on whose software has caused you the mostrecent frustration For the record my own level of frustration withboth companies products is so high that I dont run Windows or Netscape Communicator But lets you and I try putting aside ourindividual peeves and recasting the question at a more abstract level Assumefor the sake of argument that there will be only one browser and that itsquality will be the same regardless of whether Microsoft or Netscape suppliesit Then should you the consumer care who supplies it            Under those assumptions theres an unambiguous answer Youshould root for Microsoft Give me a few paragraphs and Ill explain why            Windows costs about  at my local computer superstore Why doesnt it cost moreBecause despite its monopoly power Microsoft remains subject to the laws ofthe marketplace At a higher price too many customers would walk away If youdoubt a small price increase would significantly affect the sales of Windows you must conclude Microsoft is undercharging out of either foolishness orgenerosityneither of which is terribly consistent with the way the JusticeDepartment and the public at large think of Microsoft            In fact every time Microsoft raises the priceof Windows  it gets punished twice First it loses sales of Windows Second with each of those lost sales it loses a potential user of InternetExplorer For example if Microsoft has half the browser market then lost Windows sales imply  fewer users of Internet Explorer This assumespeople who dont buy Windows wont need a browser            You mightask why Microsoft is punished by the loss of an Internet Explorer user giventhat Internet Explorer can be downloaded free The answer of course is thatin the long run it wont be free Even when it comes packaged freewith Windows  youll really be paying a combined price for the operatingsystem and the browser which will surely be higher than the price Microsoftwould charge for an operating system alone            Now think what would happen if Microsoft had a monopoly inthe browser market The second punishment would be doubled lost Windowssales would mean  lost Internet Explorer sales not  Thats goodnews for consumers Give Microsoft a monopoly on browsers and youll intensifythe downward pressure on the price of its operating systems            In factthe same kind of pressure works to lower browser prices too Just as a doublymonopolistic Microsoft would be reluctant to raise the price of Windows  forfear of losing Internet Explorer users it would be equally reluctant to raisethe price of Internet Explorer for fear of losing Windows  users who mightnot be willing to invest in a computer at all if the price of browsers is toohigh Of course prices will still rise and fall in response to otherforcesbut they will never rise as high under a dual monopoly as they wouldunder two separate monopolies            That doesnt prove that a Microsoft monopolybeats any alternative But it does prove a Microsoft monopoly beats aNetscape monopoly assuming the companies provide products of comparablequality            I promised to make anargument that would stand or fall on its own merits and I claim to havefulfilled that promise You can judge the argument for itself and it doesntmatter who else has endorsed it But I do want to mention for the record thatit has a lot of endorsements In economics textbooks it is commonplace toobserve that vertical integration of monopolies tends to reduce consumerpricesfor essentially the same reasons Ive given in this column Thatobservation wasnt always commonplace but it has been for nearly years nowever since one Robert H Bork forcefully called it to economistsattention In my own textbook the discussion of this issue is peppered withquotes from Bork In his recent public statements he has skirted this issueentirely Of course Netscape pays him a lot more than Microsoft pays me
