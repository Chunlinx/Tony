                     Im interviewing Avis Gregory         Avis is from NY and shes  years old         Shes Black American         And Avis has some stories that shed like to um tell us regarding reading and um some experiences shes had with books and with teachers         Now Avis you had mentioned to me before about you had a fifth grade teacher who you really enjoyed who uh got you excited about reading         But did you have any other uh experiences with reading that brings back memories prior to fifth grade or did it really start with fifth grade                     Umm reading has always been a passion for me and um that was probably one of my favorite Christmas presents growing up         My mom knew that if she got me a new book I was happy                  Umm so it didnt just begin in fifth grade but when you had um asked me about my favorite book                     Umhum                     it took me back to fifth grade because thats when I fell in love with my favorite book         Well its one of my favorite books now but then it was it became my passion                     What fav favorite book was that         Do you remember                     Yes of course                  It was the dictionary                     Oh really                     Yes                     I just did a report on the dictionary                     Really         Well she part of the fifth grade teachers had pretty much required fiveword that you learn five words a day  words a week         And that was pretty much it as far as vocabulary and spelling                     Umhum                     Mrs Agee was I think was perceived by a lot of the kids as a tyrant but her um I dont know exactly how to express it intensity regarding                       Thats a good word                                       Um grammar and English         It was just something that I kind of gobbled up         It was wonderful for me         She required  words a day a hundred words         And you had to not only be able spell it and give a definition for it but also had to be able to use it in a sentence                     Ooh                     And so vocabulary became electric for me         I mean I just and and therefore the dictionary itself became something that I really I mean if I had to choose one book besides my Bible         it would be the dictionary         I dont think I could live without it                     Thats amazing because most people when when they talk about their favorite book its usually a short story or a novel that is a prose         And certainly the dictionary isnt prose         So that is really unusual         Ive never heard of somebody who had their favorite book as the dictionary                                 Oh                     So thats thats really interesting         Now you had to learn  words a day         So a hundred words a week                     Thats right                     How did you go about doing that                     Oh we had assignments where um we had to um write out the definition actually write out you know using the word in a sentence         And we had um spelling bee types of situations where we had to spell the word         Um we tested on it and um but it was like every week like clockwork         Um we were expected to to um produce you know this homework         And um for me it was exciting and fun         Everybody else was like Oh no         Please not this                              And she gave you the  words                     Oh yes         Uhhuh                     And then did you have to look them up yourself                     Absolutely                     So thats how your involvement got in with the dictionary         You had to look them up yourself                     Yes                     Well what about looking up words         Why would that be an exciting thing for you                     Well um at heart Im pretty much an adventurer and um as a child uh stories were one way of exploring um for me         But um when I dont know I learn something new it just feeds something inside of me that uh I dont know maybe my enthusiasm for life is just taken to another another level         As an adult uh of course it has expanded into other areas but I still um enjoy uh spending time with my friend the dictionary         Um one of the things that my husband teases me about is that when when I have episodes during my chronic illness and I have to be horizontal um sometimes Ill play Scrabble by myself         And Ill play both sides and but I dont play of course         the way you would in competition         But I have my dictionary there so I can say Ok now what         You know this looks like it ought to be a word lets see if theres anything                  So I use it as a learning experience and find out new things                     Interesting         Ive never heard of it solo                  Thats really interesting         When um when you went beyond the fif that was the fifth grade wasnt it         When you went beyond fifth grade um did you continue on did the next teacher continue on that passion with vocabulary                     Um not really         Um but when I left fifth grade I also left Brooklyn and when I came to the VA school system things were very different         Actually um there was a sense in which I think I was a little bit ahead of where folks were um in VA at that time         Um in the um the middle school it was a major adjustment for me culturally         Um where we were from in Brooklyn it was a very multicultural environment and um it was very all the races were kind of accepted to a certain degree         Um actually um I didnt even have any kind of racial um prejudicialtype experience except for um from Blacks which                     Huh thats unusual                     Which I know         Well not really not as unusual as you might think         But um when we moved to VA and I started to go to school here um the rejection I got was because I was a Northerner and uh well not here because I am in Charlotte now but there                     Umhum                     And uh they were very unhappy with the way I spoke and um I tended to stay to myself         I tended to read a lot         I really with withdrew socially                     Umhum                     To into books         And um the teachers themselves didnt necessarily emphasize it it just became the library became my favorite place                     Humm                     And if at all possible I would get permission like to spend my lunch hours and to um spend my homeroom hours anytime I could get to the library it was uh a haven for me         And uh uh I prob the librarian was probably my my best friend                              I can imagine why                              Yeah it was uh a a good outlet for me         In fact I um when I got to high school which was in VA I um I remember beginning in the biography section and just starting with A         And just reading each book and um just keeping on going until I got to the end and um                     Boy that was a real task wasnt it                     I didnt consider it a task         It was wonderful         I mean I would devour a book a day and my mom would say Honey take your nose out of a that book and SOCIALIZE                  Talk to your brothers and sisters                  I would read while I ate Id read on the bus I would read while I walked down the street if I could get away with it                              So you were really absorbed in that                     I did         I read all the time                     Allconsuming                     It was         It was         And my mom had to really stay on me to be more well rounded um because it was very easy for me to escape into that because I was um rejection was that was very hard to to deal with         And one of the things that I did attempted to do was to absorb the language around me and that was part of my my interest         I mean I al because we were always around so many different cultures I always had an interest in language and an interest in cultures         When we moved to VA it was not as diversified         It was almost that was where it was like uh I really got to see black and white division         I went to school at a predominately white uh school after my sixth and seventh grades                     Uhuh                     And umm I didnt have a problem with that         I mean I grew up accepting all races so I didnt have a problem with that         But because I didnt have a problem with that there were those who had a problem         with me                     With you                     And so umm so it was very easy for me to withdraw from people into a world of reading                     Umhum                     And uh          its more balanced now                  But I dont have to do that                     Do you ever look back and and regret the fact that you spent all that time in those books         Do you think in other words do you look at your experience as being a negative one and it drew you into forced you into those books or did you think it was in some odd way more of a good experience because you have absorbed your life in those books                     I didnt consider it negative I mean it was negative from the standpoint that that I was being rejected in that respect         But the books having the opportunity it was fun to me         It wasnt it you know as if say I had been in a situation where I hadnt had the rejection and there I was more accepted socially         I dont know that I wouldnt have done the same thing                           But I loved reading         And whether it was by I really liked true stories more than novels         There are few novels that I can enjoy         Its just that and maybe part of my critical rigging comes from         I tend to be very critical of my own writing                     Umhum                     And if a story is not very well written it just leaves me disappointed                     Umhum                     And true life tends to be more fulfilling in reading to me than someone elses imagination         I guess really Im not I guess there are very few things that I find um where I find that someone elses imagination intrigues me enough to for me to read a lot of their material                     So you prefer more of the biographies                     Absolutely                     Is that the same in movie watching                     Yes yes         Um my husband and I both tend to be very critical when it comes to story lines and stuff like that         And while were watching something Ill say OK honey whats going to happen next         Or Ill tell him what I think is going to happen next         And if the way that the plot is um constructed if theyve got like loopholes or got if its a nonsequitur         If things do not follow what I consider logical or if they make some kind of leap that is not explained or not presented at least so you can leap with them or see how they made that leap then it leaves me cold         I really dont want to um watch that show any more                              So it basically uh turns you from the um plot instead of going with the plot         It just turns you away from it                     Absolutely                     You lose interest         Have you ever thought about because of your love for books have you ever thought about writing                     Absolutely         I dont perceive in myself and maybe this Ill gain this as I get older but my attempts at short stories at least have left me flat                  I dont do very well in cultivating the characters you know         Now the writing that I do like the journaling that I do um of course thats real life so that has a different intensity                     Umhum                     Um the poem the poetry that I write and the songs that I write um depending on whether I felt that it has meet met I guess my criteria for excellence um I I am working on compiling my poetry                     Umhum                     But um I havent gotten to the point where I feel like its ready yet         And my family is chompingatthebit ready for me         When are you going to publish                  And when its ready itll be ready and I really cant rush that                     Uhhuh thats because thats the creative part         And and you know that that creativity is not something you can force                     No but even having I mean I think I have my mom my grandmother says I know you have enough stuff put together         Like it doesnt take that much                  But um the book that Im working on theres a certain flow that I anticipated having and at this point therere gaps                     Umhum                     And I dont know what fills those gaps yet         But umm as soon as those gaps are filled then the book will be ready and well well move you know         By that point in time the Lord will have shown me you know who to present it to as far as uh uh presenting it for publication                     Uhhuh         Have you ever because uh of your race have you ever thought about writing about um you know the Blacks and culture and and maybe have you ever had any interest also in any Black writers                     Oh absolutely         Um Yes to both of those questions         Um our family is a very mixed family         My heritage is Black and Indian and White and Jewish that I know of                  There may be others          but those are the the the strains that I know of or the races that I know of and um I know that there are gaps in what I know         And          I havent really thought about um how to present that         I mean I always thought of it as a wonderful heritage and I love being mixed sotospeak         Um I think it gives me an advantage         I mean I feel connected to more than just my race because my race are so many                  Umm but because our family history or I mean there is so much history that I dont know but because of so many complex issues regarding         my family I dont think the older members of my family could probably appreciate me writing about umm our racial heritage at this particular point in time         Maybe umm maybe at some point in the future although now that you have brought it up Ill have to consider it         more strongly                              I just thought about it because being February and and um its Black American History Mon th or something like that and Im Im doing a report on that on Zora Neale Hurstons Their Eyes Were Watching God and um I found her to be very interesting but uh she writes solely upon the Black culture and her experiences in growing up         So I didnt know if you had any experiences reading any of the materials that the Black writers female Black writers have whether that material interested you                     Maya Angelou was probably the first that really captured my attention         Um her I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings um having experienced pain in my childhood her writing about her pain which you know I write about my pain privately in my journal but writing it for someone else to read is a totally different story                  And I thought that was very courageous for her and I still enjoy listening to her and hearing the wisdom that she has to share um regarding not letting lifes experiences bitter you         And so shes one of the Black female writers that attracted me         Um Ive read a lot         Unfortunately I dont remember everything         Ive ever read                     I have the same problem                              And thats challenging                  But one of the things that um I guess if any particular subject that I would feel that I might write about it wouldnt just be from like uh the Black culture because other than my experiences in the Black culture tend to not be traditional from the standpoint that I dont seem to fit in or be generally excepted um at least from a childhood perspective         Now its not so much of a problem         I mean but I live in a multicultural world now         Um but even in our family it is incredible to me how the different shades of color of our skin bring prejudices from both sides or from from all the different shades         Whether I mean my grandmother who was on my dads side was mostly Indian         As a matter of fact I dont know if she had any Black blood in her         She married a man who had Black blood but um she was ostracized in her family because of the Indian coloring         She had more of it than any of the other children so they would call her derogatory names                     Umhum                     And um from her offspring which some married into the white race some married into the Black race                     Umhum                     And theres from black to white there are varying attitudes         And I was really shocked         I thought my family was very small on my dads side         As a matter of fact I didnt even know that we had the myriad of cousins that we do                     Umm                     Come to find out at my dads death that um one of the reasons that he shielded us from them was because of their hatred for us which was incredible to me         I had no clue                     Yes                              And to see it was shocking          So that might be something that I would write about                     Umhum                     But dont know         I would have to have a positive reason for writing about it because         you know at this point I dont have a happy ending to the story                              Yes                     Um just sadness                     Umhum         Some people dont write for others they write for themselves         It just so happens that others take part in sharing it by reading it                     Thats true         Like I write for myself in my journal and I dont hide things in that but I havent gotten to the point of sharing my journals with the world                              Did your journaling come from a teachers uh uh expectation of you         I know that some teachers they require a student to write in a journal everyday         I didnt have that experience did you                     I did in high school         I was already writing but it was not every day or structured         Um Miss Red I think it was in tenth grade required us to write everyday in our journal and then get to turn it in                     Umhum                     And that was when I began um journaling with consistency         And um and being willing to let you know someone know my heart so to speak because I felt very privately         Um my mom had always warned us to be very careful about what we put on paper so the really innermost things of my heart I didnt write um until I got much older                     Umhum                     But it was that high school experience that that solidified it for me         Then we took a Discipleship Class um my husband and I that that um really taught us how to study the Bible and journaling and Bible Study became enmeshed so to speak for me         So when I spent time in the Scriptures I um write my insights and sometimes I write my prayers and I also you know pour out my heart                     Umhum                     My journals have uh taken a much different character as uh as Ive grown older and learned different things                     Uhhuh         Uhhuh         The teacher in high school that started you with your journal did she also um did she also activate in you a desire for any reading or other types of writing or did another teacher         Or did that stop back in your sixth grade class                     No um actually that teacher did encourage me to write         Um I was already homing as we call it         Um and she enjoyed and encouraged me to do that         It was actually the librarian in my high school experience that um she was uh also uh a creative writer and um we would share poetry         And um I think more than my teacher she really I guess you would say inspired me to uh cultivate it and express myself more so in that that way                     So your your writing first came about in high school                     Umm no         I I cant remember when I wasnt writing poetry         I just always was making up things                     Umhum                     Umm high school was when I would write it down and keep it                  I mean I have things now that I can go back to uh poems that I wrote in high school but I was writing before that I just you know how things just disappear                     Yes                     We moved quite a bit and you know I have no clue what happened with all of those         Well Mom had six kids so it probably ended up you know in the trash because it was just such a volume of mail                     Right                     of uh not mail uh schoolwork and paperwork and stuff like that         Uh but Ive been really glad that Ive held on to the early things that I wrote         One of the poems that um I still pull out and read from time to time is um Can I Be Me All By Myself                     Do you remember it                     Oh from memory         No um                     What sparked you to write that one                     Uh one of the things that I didnt I would never be able to articulate as a child but looking back um there was a there was a certain chameleon quality to my personality         I was very much a pleaser and whatever the authority figure who I was with wanted from me was what I tried to give them         And um I guess in a in a way I was kind of         frustrated with my own chameleon self         And um I didnt know who I was         I was always being someone else or what was expected of me and um thats not necessarily a bad thing except for um sometimes it was a very          um the expectations were opposites         And so you know if one person wants you to be the opposite of another person         I mean who are you really when you please when you are trying to please both people you know         God forbid theyd both be in the same room at the same time                              That would be a problem wouldnt it                     It would         It would         But one of the books one of the one of the uh writers that I have been able to appreciate um is AA Milne         And as you can see my Pooh characters Ive got a collection of the original Pooh Tales         And I really appreciated the original stories from this perspective         He captured personalities in a way that um I still go back to th those uh Pooh and Eeyore         When Im my husband and I talk personality a lot and you know what personality type is a particular person and we really found it to be very helpful in understanding them and we realize that no one is one personality type were all conglomerates         But he the way that he wrote the characters and um uh captured the different personality types was has intrigued me even to this day and I can really appreciate um how he did that         And there are times when I can really identify with Pooh and then there are I have my Eeyore Days                  I dont always appreciate what Disney has done with it now because they have commercialized it so but um thats one of the few things I I never really was a cartoon kid         I mean my siblings watched and I know what they were but um it was so funny         We had a situation         We were at a family reunion and we were playing a game         I cant I think oh it was Pictionary         And um the my partner was drawing a anvil but I cant remember now what he was trying to get me to say but it was from a cartoon         It was like I dont know what that cartoon was about                  I didnt watch cartoons                  Cartoons really just I mean even to this day I think How can people watch that junk         But Winnie the Pooh is one of the cartoons that I can appreciate         But the rest of them I can lump them all in the same bag and I dont have much use for them         But um I can appreciate Milnes work                     Did your poem and his work the poem about who you are                     Uhhuh                     Did you seem to assimilate that into his descriptions and characters         Did you try to say Im more like this one than this one          Did you make any connections there                     No not al all         I wasnt so much even I I did not even know how to I wish I could put my hands on it         If I had of thought about it I had no clue that we were even going to talk about him         I think where in the world do I have that         Umm I know I have written it down but I am trying to think where is my book                  It will come to me and Ill Ill maybe be able to find it and I dont mind sharing it with you         But my my focus was in in solitude         I was unsure about who I really was because I was pretending so much so it wasnt I had no clue         At at that point in time I wasnt even thinking in the personality realm and I hadnt drawn any connection to it         Um it was it was just um more of my you know how the teenagers go through uh Trying to find myself a questioning period         And that was one of the poems that came out of my Who Am I         What am I doing here         And why         type of         you know struggle         But um Its been really uh encouraging for me as I have um grown up and um I look back to that poem because to some degree I have learned now that I can be myself all by myself         I can be me you know         I dont have to be a pleaser although I do I still enjoy people being pleased with me                  Who doesnt         But umm Ive Ive learned that um the Lord is pleased with me and if I do what is pleasing to Him you know everybody else the chips fall where they may b                  Thats just the way it has to be                     Going back to your high school your favorite book in fifth grade wasnt it the dictionary                     Uhhuh                     Did that change         Did your favorite book become something else when you grew up a little bit more and you were in high school                              Well it didnt the dictionary is still one of my favorite books but one of the books that I read over and over again and I still periodically check it out in the library and read Little Women         Uh Louisa Alcott         Um her writings not just Little Women but Little Men and Jos Boys um I Ive appreciated um her imagination                  In some parts I know it was based on her life and so there is a ring of reality but there again I hadnt realize this till we were talking but you have the different personality types                     Thats true                     And um I kind of identified with Jo who of course is a writer         And although I was I wasnt really tomboyish but I was definitely not interested in boys                  And umm so I uh Ive actually thats one of the few movies when I see when theyve done remakes of it different times that Ive been able to appreciate every single version of it         Usually if Ive read the book and then see the movie Im like uh sigh                              It takes something away from the book                     Well my imagination is very different from their imagination so I dont when I read the book my imagination is engaged and um I think of things a certain way and its very rare when I can appreciate somebody elses imagination if its contrary to what my imagination says                     Umhum                     Um so that became that has become one of my favorites Little Women that started in um high school         Um there is something Ive got to tell you its just uh         uh one of the things that my sister who is like two years behind me said         I couldnt understand her frustration she says Do you know that theres not a book in this library that your name isnt in                  I dont know why that tickles me so much but                     Back in those days when you check out a book they put your name in it                              You wrote your name in it          And she couldnt and every time she checked out a book my name was already there                      But that probably went to the fact that she wanted to be the oldest and umm that was something that reminded her that she was not the first                     Not the first one         Thats interesting                              I know                  Why it would bother her so much I dont know but                     Sibling rivalry                     Yeah                     It doesnt matter what its in                     It was from her end more than from my end because I was the oldest         You couldnt dispute         that                  But um one of the other areas uh I did learn to enjoy I cant remember exactly when it was but science fiction became became intriguing to me and I think it was during high school years                     Now thats very creative         That would be the antithesis of biography                              Oh I know I know                  Not that I would appreciate everybodys science fiction but uh there is a trilogy that I ha ve read and its The Foundation Trilogy and uh Im trying to remember who wrote it         I cant think of the author right now but its one that both my husband and I have enjoyed         And matter of right we point back to it         Lord please help me to remember his name         I cant think of the writers name but the writer does so well with um with intrigue and irony         And one of the things that I have found whether its in a movie or a book its got to engage me psychologically on some level         I mean I dont really go for for fluff very much         I         have a low low tolerance for it                     Umhum                     Um so um I cant believe I cant believe I cant think of this mans name         It must be the chronic fatigue         robbing me         Um it will probably pop in at some point so Ill let you know         But um have you ever read The Foundation Trilogies                     No I havent                     Oh                  For the most part I think its pretty clean and thats something else I really appreciate is when I dont have to do deal with a lot of profanity or unwholesomeness         You know there is so much that you can write about thats good and wholesome and intriguing without going into the areas that are unprofitable that um and I dont I havent read The Foundation again in like probably the last five years but um periodically Ill feel like Ive got to visit this book again                     So you dont mind rereading                     Oh no especially thats how I know what my favorite books are because they are books I go back to                     Go back to                     Yeah         Umm other than them Im trying to think favorites         Um oh there was one back from I guess from the elementary years that I had forgotten to mention to you um Harold and the Purple Pen                     The Purple Pen                     Uhhuh         Uh if I could get my hands on this book I would buy it         It that was a book that left a lasting impression on me         Harold was um a little boy and the way that this book is written its somebody thats drawing         I mean you basically just have you know its not like um photo photographic         Its you know somebodys drawing         Well Harold was a draw was one who who drew and he would draw things with his pen that would come alive                  I dont know there is just something about that book that even though I havent read it in decades that still intrigues me and I want to put get my hands on it and read it again         Umm as a matter of fact when um oh I guess my first radio job in VA I I started doing this little um like anonymous gift thing         Like with my coworkers I might bake something or whatever and Id I had bought a purple pen and I would say The purple pen strikes again                      and uh         no one ever knew it was from Harold and the Purple Pen         But or I dont I dont I dont think anyone ever knew it was from me unless somebody maybe figured out my handwriting or something like that but it was                                       Thats really neat the way you did that         You made that connection there                     Yeah                     Do you always seem to have a habit of making connections in your personal life with things you have read about                     Absolutely                     And so you celebrate those things like you did that one                     To some degree         I mean obviously you see my Pooh stuff                              Thats obvious                     To some degree things that really have an impact on me have tended to become a part of my life on some level or another         I mean I may not it may not manifest in my everyday existence but um at some point or another when its appropriate you know Ill reach back and re and connect to that book or that character or whatever or some aspect of it and bring it forward                     I think that is really um putting your reading into reallife uh experiences and making your reading become a part of you and personalizing         Uh not very many people do that                     Really                     And with your ability to do that I think that that carries over into your writing                     Hum                     Because what you read about might spark something that becomes an interest to you and then you carry it over into your writing         You might do it completely different than what the book has done                     Umhum                     And just basically assimilated it into writing                     Humm                     Carry on that creativity into some other avenue                     One of the recent when I say recent in recent years I read a book about George Washington Carver         And it was incredible to me the things that he went through the the his intrigue with um discovering like all the uses for soy a soy the soy the soybean um or peanut or whatever         I mean I went out and bought peanut oil         just because he was in the book it it was saying um how good it was for your skin and stuff like that         I started in rubbing peanut oil         I got over it but and I still use it                     You didnt get a greasy effect did you                     I really didnt mind the grease it was the smell                  But um yeah the books that have an impact on me         Usually in some way yeah you can find little pieces of it in my life         And um my life experiences are often what end up in my writing         Like um theres a poem on the wall over there that I wrote         And I wrote it out of an actual experience that um my husband and I had         We went on um a honeymoon well it wasnt a honeymoon         A uh anniversary trip                     Umhum                     And um he took me to um Charleston and Folly Beach and to Isle of Palms because he knows I love the ocean         The Isle of Palms Beach was my favorite         I mean          every beach has a character         And um as I was walking along the beach there were broken sand dollars         I mean it was just an incredible number of broken pieces of sand dollars         And it was I couldnt believe I couldnt find a whole one         That was ah my first thought Theres got to be a whole one down here somewhere                  But umm then as I was thinking about it and I was looking at it and at first I wasnt even so much interested in the broken ones         I was picking up the broken pieces and it made me think about our own brokenness in our lives         And umm I dont remember whether it was that night or I think it was later         But that experience was so impacting for me that that poem was born         And um so it was just uh I dont know you dont let your experiences whether theyre experience its experiences that youve read or what youve lived                     Umhum                     How you dont connect with it         I dont understand how people dont connect with it         But then again maybe in a reading took a different because it was an escape for me maybe I connected with it too much                              You never really escape from reading                     Oh not from it no         Um I enjoy visiting the different worlds so to speak you know of the character or whatever         Whoever they were I enjoyed walking so to speak with them in their life                     Umhum                     Um and um and thats thats still an enjoyable thing for me you know when I have the opportunity                     Does that carry over weve talked about you know the area in that the reading and the writing does that carry over your love for all those things into theater as well                     Um I have enjoyed um working in theater in my youth                  I dont really have much of an outlet for it now         Um I guess the um lack of opportunity is probably the biggest aspect of why I wouldnt now but if I had the opportunity I wouldnt mind                     I guess my favorite um one of my favorite courses in college was improvisation         I enjoyed doing that                     Umhum                     And um when we were growing up uh our Sunday school youth group we we did put on plays and and so that there was an outlet in my youth in my younger days in college         But since then um I havent had much of an opportunity to indulge that passion                     What about attending theater and watching it         Does that do uh does that do very much for you         Or do you find that that is not the same as reading it                     It depends         It depends on the story and it depends on um well whether or not its well done                     Umhum                     Um when I was in in junior high our orchestra teacher took us to see Fiddler on the Roof                     Umhum                     And that it was a theater production it was         Um it was one that I thoroughly enjoyed and I could you know get right and it is something thats one of my favorite stories although now that I think about it Ive never read it         Ive you know seen it on television but Ive never read it         Ill have to do that                              Put it on your list                     Thats right                  Fiddler on the Roof         Um but uh I did enjoy it in the theater         Um one of the plays I enjoyed reading Lorraine START OF TAPE  SIDE B NM Excuse me                     Thats all right                     A Raisin in the Sun was the title                     Yes                     And you saw it on television                     Ive seen it on television and Ive I was interested in seeing it in the theater but but I never had that opportunity         So if its well done if its a wellwritten story                     Umhum                     Um I feel I would definitely enjoy         I have not had a lot of other than college productions and stuff like that uh I havent done a lot of theater going                     Umhum                     But um its um and Im trying to think the theater uh other than Fiddler on the Roof of course I havent seen a lot of different things but um has not had the same level of impact I guess         Uh uh going to see The Fiddler on the Roof of course as a violinist that you know was part of our our class um project and that was part of our appreciation         They also had a full orchestra                     Umhum                     So she wanted to expose us to that but uh that has um remained an intriguing story partially I think because of the insight into a different culture                     Umhum                     And um also when you think about the characters         that are in Fiddler on the Roof you know they have very definite personalities                     And there youre again youre drawn to personalities in writing or even acting         I think just from talking to you thats a very important aspect of of um your reading         And I think with that we can make the connection of the dictionary         The dictionary is a definition of a word and a personality is a definition of a person                     Whew         How interesting         Yeah         I hadnt thought about that                     Umhum                     Well understanding is one of the things if I had to say that there was something underlying in my life Ive always wanted to understand whether it was understanding people or understanding why things happen                     Umhum                     Um understand why you know there are times I know it must drive my husband crazy when we get to talking about         a particular word and Im saying That doesnt mean that         And hes like well thats what it you know thats what it means to him and Im like Well lets get the dictionary                  Well find out what Webster uh understood it to mean         So we can have a common ground so we can both speak the same language and we can both you know know what were talking about         Because different words do mean different things to different people                     Yes                     And and I have found it to be a spark of misunderstanding so quickly                     Umhum                     Um that you know if you can get an understanding to clarify figure out where theyre coming from and there again that personality thing                     Yes                     Understanding um a persons perspective from their personality view you know helps you whether you need to make allowances for them or um         just uh figuring out the puzzle you know                     Umhum                     And I have to admit that theres a little bit of a Sherlock Holmes in me         I love figuring out puzzles                     Umhum                     Whether its life puzzles or um in my work um we         we often find ourselves in situations where there are mysteries and we have to follow the clues         And I I love I love it when I find the answer                  Everybody in the office knows         I got it                              Did that ever lead you into mysteries for reading                     Um to some degree         But um sometimes I guess I find mysteries that leave gaps or I dont follow them quite I dont know whether its my perspective or my language         Were not on the same plane         And I end up not finishing it                  Now Im the kind of person Im very sequential Ive got to know what the end is         I go to the back of the book         to find out how it ended         But I dont care about the middle part because somehow they lose me in the you know especially if they digress to other you know if they dont follow the story                     Umhum                     They go too many different places without bringing some level of resolution to whatever the uh issue is that theyre dealing with you know         Jumping around with three different kinds of story lines that does not appeal to me         at all                     Are you in the habit then since you go to the back of the book for the mysteries are you having to do that with the other readings                     Um sometimes         I guess it really depends on my mood                     Umhum                     If if I want to if I really want to know how it ends and then I really want to know how they got there then Ill do that but usually now Im more patient                  I usually just wait until I get there and see how it ends                     Umhum                     If they dont end it ri ght then Im mad                  Thats not how it should have ended         Not that everything has to have a happy ending it just has to have a a Bible solution of one of the things going back to The Foundation Trilogy in their closing chap chapters well its like two chapters that end the book         The chapter before the last chapter is is titled The Answer That Satisfies         And its like the answer to the mystery that the characters are dealing with and they are satisfied with this answer         But then the final chapter is the answer thats real                     Umm         AG And I dont know         Theres something well not only that aspect of the way that the writer he writes he basically gives two different endings to the story         You know you could stop at the answer that satisfies and think that thats the end of the story but then you go to the next chapter and its like Ah ha                              Umhum                     And I do happen to love a touch of irony         I dont know what it is about um my sense of humor which I dont have dont have an appreciation of humor that seems like the general population has         Because I mean a lot of things that people think are funny I dont think are funny                     Umhum                     And I can appreciate that they do but personally it doesnt tickle my funny bone but irony tickles me                              Umhum                     Um and one of the other things that um I almost had the name of the author um the writer of Foundation um that my husband and I both have taken away from that book is um there is a I guess a philosophy so to speak of um the um there are a couple of main groups in the story and the group that knows the most has a certain philosophy                     Umhum                     And uh we have seen I guess the essence of that truth to be uh applicable in real life                     Umhum                     And so when a book can take a real life truth and weave it into the storyline then I dont know even though its a novel it has a basis in reality thats intriguing                     Umhum                     So um thats                     Speaking of reality you like the realism type of writing         We talked about the classics you know with Louisa May Alcott and uh do you have you ever read much of the realism in modern literature which deals with realistic living and realistic lives and realistic families and the way they really are and not something thats fictional         They call Cinderellatype of stories         These stories are pretty much what you would see today in lives of people realism         Have you ever involved yourself much with the reading of that                     When you say modern do you mean like I mean how modern are you talking about                              I know there are degrees of modernness                  Im talking about modern in the th or actually th centurytype of reading of novels in literature         They deal very much with realism they dont like the authors dont like the Cinderella endings the Cinderella type of of storyline         The Father Knows Besttypes of families you know         They think its very unrealistic         Uh ever involved yourself with that type of reading                     Im trying to remember something specific         I mean I have                     Umhum                     I mean because I like to read about peoples real lives         So from that standpoint I would say my answer to your question would be Yes         And Im trying to think of something specific         Um I remember um a book uh this is probably in the s Black Like Me                     All right         OK                     And that probably would fall into the category of reading that youre thinking about         Um it was where uh a Caucasian man underwent a treatment where his skin color was darkened and he experienced what it was like to be Black                     Umm                     And um that had you know that realistic tone that youre talking about         And um Im definitely attracted to real life stuff         As long as they dont get too vulgar                     Umhum                     I appreciate not having to deal with vulgarity         I mean you can you can be realistic without going into great detail         I think about the ugliness of life                     Umhum                     Its not that I think that we should gloss over and I dont         But I think that you have to um                  You can tell enough of the story for people to understand without um mashing your face in it so to speak                     Umhum                     And um I I dont have a high tolerance for violence and um I I I recently read a book um it was the authors name that attracted me to it         Im trying to think of the name of it         Aftermath was the name of the book and it was by                  I dont remember his name         Its the gentleman that played Jordie on Star Trek                  I dont know if that will mean anything to you                     No I didnt follow Star Trek that well                     He also does um Reading Rainbow for kids         I cannot remember that guys name         Itll come to me after while         Anyway it was his name that uh attracted me to the book and uh um Ive read the book but I threw it away                     Ooh                     I would never want to read it again         It was just too graphic for me and I wouldnt have given it to anybody else                     Umhum                     And I dont believe in throwing books away         I come from a family where you just dont throw a book away         Its a treasure         And you know um I recently as a matter of fact had a situation where I was at my grandmothers house and in the bedroom where I was was a book         I looked at it and couldnt believe that it was in her house         And I went to her and I was expressing my concern to her and um of course that you dont throw away a book came up But Gran         Some books you just have to throw away         I mean its garbage just garbage         And it wasnt something that she read         It was something that had come from someone who had gotten a box of books and was somebody elses library         So they probably didnt even know it was in the house         But I wasnt the only grandchild or greatgrandchild that was there and I would have hated for some impressionable person to have gotten a hold of it         And being in grandmothers house they would have thought it was OK                     Umm                     And it was horrible         So um                     Was your grandmother a prolific reader                     Very much so         Shes um and probably liked poetry love of poetry comes from her because she would quote poetry all the time         And thats one of the things that is handed down from my grandmother to my mom and um you know to us and to the greatgrandchildren as well         One of the poems that she would quote to my mom and I dont know the whole poem but it starts off I have to live with myself so I have to be fit for myself to know um I cant keep on the closet shelf a lot of secrets about myself I think that no one will ever know         Thats where I get lost                  But she can quote the whole thing         And so yes she definitely um in the um time where she was raising her children it was really a a challenge to um that she took on to encourage them to be their absolute best         And as a matter of fact both of her daughters became teachers         And um all of her children are are readers         And um she definitely believed that education was a essential and You will go to college         So that was something that was definitely handed down                     Did she ever read stories to you         Or did she just quote poetry                              Um I dont know that my grandmother has ever really read a book to me         When I would spend time most of the time she was working         I mean she was either working for a living or she was working to take care of us         And she was I cant I dont remember a whole lot of leisure where she now shes more leisurely                     Umhum                     And one thing that we do is play Scrabble                  And she still beats me                     She does                              I can play as hard and the best I can and she can still beat me                              So shes still living         And still has her wits about her                              Oh yes         Definitely          And thats a real blessing                     I can imagine that it would be         Now she doesnt live here                     No         Shes in Southerland VA                     Oh OK                     I dont I know that she reads her Bible         And I know I know that she is a reader but actually seeing her read                     Umhum                     I didnt now my mom has piles of books         and piles of articles takes two papers and its EVERYWHERE                     Does she collect or does she read                     She reads and she collects                  And I um try to keep my piles under control                  And periodically I have to go through and I will go to like the library book sales and Ill choose to take what piles either the author or the title that will interest me         Its only a quarter so you support the library and you buy a book and                     Umhum                     And then Ill eventually get around to reading it and whether it stays or goes depends on what its like                              Yeah         Do you have a collection of special books                     Oh definitely         Ones that I always will have and will never get rid of                     Yeah         Umhum                     One of my almost every year Ive got to read books         And since Ive got one of the few nonfiction books that uh and again its based on um reality is Hannah Hurnards Hinds Feet in High Places and Mountains of Spices         And the depiction the the the story that she depicts um is so to me has so many aspects of a true the struggles of our lives that every time I read it because Im a little different I get something a little different from it         And thats one that I give it away and then have to go get another copy                  Because I always want that in my library         I always want to be able to go back and read it again                     Uhhuh         I had someone give me that book once         Years ago         I probably still have it                     Umhum                     So Im familiar with that particular book         Um in your high school years youre going back to that time period and your librarian was one that you said who encouraged you and you had some challenges between each other in writing poetry                     Umhum                     Um did she did you meet weekly or was it                     I was in there everyday                     Everyday                              Several times I day                              Now that was still during those times in high school                     Umhum         I got permission to have homeroom in the library and I then I would go there for my lunch and I mean I would take me like         that long to eat my food and I would go I have permission to go up to the library                     Umm                     And so um I found it kind of like being the librarian helper because I was there all the time         And uh I as a matter of fact at one point I was going to go into Library Science                     I was just about to ask you         I was surprised that you havent become a librarian                     Yeah         I toyed with it at times         Ive worked in a couple of different church libraries and um I thoroughly enjoy it         Um at this particular point physically its not something I could keep up with but um the library is actually my favorite place                     Umhum                              Other than home                  Uh well if I had my way Id have the library in my home                              Thats possible you know                     I know                     Youve probably collected enough books that you could fill up a room with them                     Yep                     Well we have a study that we have filled you know youve seen our study the books that we have                     Umhum                     And Im Im now with Rons collection and mine Im starting to go into his area and pulling off the shelves books that hes collected and going to read those                     Ooh                     Because Im like you you know         I just like to read and Id like to continue that         Are your bothers or sisters as much of a reader as you are         Or have an interest at all in reading                     Oh um          I think there are six of us all together and theres only one brother         To my recollection I think all but one of my siblings is very strong in the area of reading         And that one sibling is she came up at a time when they switched from phonics to sightreading                     Yes                     And it crippled her to a certain degree         All of her life she has struggled with um not being able to sound out words and that it it has really limited her in reading and its not very much fun to her         But the rest of my siblings um are always kind of not so much that theyre doing I dont get the sense that theyre doing so much leisure reading now but they are um always you know continuing their education in whatever area theyre studying in and their reading in that area                     Umm         Interesting                     Yeah         They definitely encourage their children in that regard too                     Umhum                     And so they have passed on that passion unto their children                     Thats great         Well its been real interesting your life story about reading and writing         I appreciate the time                     Oh its my pleasure         Any time
