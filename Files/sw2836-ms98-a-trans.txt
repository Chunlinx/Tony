        okay uh as far as you know crime in the cities im sure it like in yours its pretty pretty bad uh probably the biggest thing weve got going now is the robberies and theft and probably murder are the two top ones that we have how about you   umhum uh well i dont actually live in the city but uh id probably say thats roughly right i mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life but i i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff id say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution um and sale of drugs   umhum probably probably right if you look at it from that stand point   umhum   what uh is there anything that uh that you particularly are concerned with in in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing   uh where i live no its its not so bad i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it um but i do have friends who live in the city and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing um just because there are like crack houses you know on their street and stuff like this   umhum  do you live in a real small town or or out in the country   i live out in the country yeah   how far out from the city i mean do you   i am about fifteen miles out   about fifteen miles i live in a little suburb uh which is i guess from Dallas is twelve miles or so   umhum   but its pretty congested we are considered in the country but it doesnt really feel like youre in the country our major crimes in our immediate   hm hm   town uh  is probably robberies house robberies   umhum   and very few instances of you know alcohol drug uh reported however im sure theyre there   umhum   but uh right now our neighborhood is running about uh eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed sometime during their their uh existence in that neighborhood   wow thats huge   and since that time everybodys gotten some sort of burglar system or you know uh burglar alarms   umhum   uh and including the out uh the outer perimeter type uh devices the sensors and things like that its cut back   umhum   you know considerably but it it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to another neighborhood so  it still uh remains city wide pretty pretty high   are they are there any theories on why this is happening   uh i would say the majority of its happening during the day uh between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon   umhum but why why is it happening   most well most families most families they are young and both people are working so theyre happening during the hours theyre gone from work  uh so  uh   umhum umhum   i would say thats probably their prime motivation theyll stalk theyll stalk your house and uh look at your pattern and then go from there   so theyre professionals   um they classify most of them as professionals uh you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier uh just taking  uh you know just junk items that they they can just get you know ten to twenty bucks for real quick   hm umhum   probably the biggest items that uh that you get in our neighborhood or would be the high classed automobiles  Mercedes Volvos things that they can get you know big dollars for uh jewelry   umhum   are the major targets guns that sort of stuff   hm   very few you know penny penny ante stuff   well what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime   well uh the police force for one i think they could uh definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use uh its oh right now i think were about thirty thousand people and theres only eight officers that patrol for thirty for that amount of people which is not very many and   umhum umhum right but that mean thats gonna tend to i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher in other words youve increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place   well the course in our particular state uh we have the prison overcrowding whatever so theyre giving the early release uh   right theyre doing that in our state too   yeah and and its i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences uh but for the that would be certainly be a deterrent   so you think that would be a deterrent umhum   and uh not necessarily you know uh give in to their uh human rights desires you know if theyre overcrowded just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate uh   well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty   uh i think theyd have to go to extra measures to make sure a persons guilty you know in a lot of cases course i i know you cant be a hundred percent foolproof uh   right so youd youd rather see it harder to convict somebody   id rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence uh to convict somebody and then those convicted especially of you know murder and and uh you know major crimes uh   umhum umhum   to reach the life sentences and you know death penalties and followthrough with that uh   hm   especially you you know in the case of murder uh i know in my case i had my wife and daughter were kidnapped during a house robbery back in eighty five and we caught the individuals got caught we uh   right oh wow    oh my goodness umhum   we went through the court system and all that sort of thing and uh you know two counts of kidnapping uh you know the the forty five to the head you know just the the mental anguish and the whole nine yards   umhum right   uh you know the the guy only got five years and you know he was out within two months because of the parole system so what what   wow did you did you sue him under the civil system   do what now   did you sue him under the civil system   no no im not real familiar with that   well you probably sue him for mental anguish or something right and try to get money from him and   oh well the insurance companies and all that tried to tried to go after him and they said well you know he theyre he has no job he has nothing theres nothing that he has that that you could go after   yeah makes you wish they had uh still had indentured servitude for this sort of thing   yeah uh very seldom   but they give give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt   yeah they dont do that here course they pay them but they dont you dont you or the insurance companies never see any of that money   yeah thats too bad   and uh you know and theyre right now theyre reluctant to go after them because theyre you know theyre theyre repeat offenders they uh theyve bee n in jail before theyve been released you know several times which is another   umhum umhum umhum   uh deal i hate to see  but uh you know basically the guy commits you know three major crimes and uh and car theft on top of it and destroys my car he were out you know uh you know   umhum yeah i i think thats a  yeah yeah thats awful   fifteen thousand dollars and you know the guy gets out in two months and he goes out and commits it again fact hes back in jail now so what what uh   gives you sympathy for the vigilantes just   yeah what what deterrent does he really have   yeah   and i think in our in our particular neighborhood vigilantism is becoming a real real possibility  uh weve had a couple instances where breakins where the the people have actually you know   umhum   shot the people and uh return offenders have   oh my God   and uh return offenders have theyve actually waited for them where theyve robbed you know particular neighborhood theyll rob one house then other people will wait up you know and wait for somebody to do something else and try to take it in their own hands course it doesnt always work out in their favor   hm right   but uh nevertheless i think people are just getting fed up and saying you know you cant arrest all of us you can you know you can get some of us you cant get all of us   right umhum   uh and were beginning to see more and more of that   i mean that sounds thats a deterrent too if you think the home owner might be armed right and awake hear you break in and youre gonna get shot   yeah yeah thats i mean thats certainly a a possibility and and we have had a a few cases where the guy has broken in you know during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death   umhum   and uh it helps for a while but then just another different set of people come in and most of the people are transients from out outside of the state   umhum hm   uh i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught theyre from places like up in Oklahoma and Louisiana Arkansas you know across the the border   wow   so you know people who dont readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever its not many from the local communities  but uh   umhum umhum   its a problem and i i just i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in in stiffer in their penalties would be a definite deterrent and   yeah yeah   and uh giving the uh police uh agencies a little bit more jurisdiction over what they do when they when they catch these people   umhum i mean i i tend to agree with you i think uh what i would like to see is number one completely getting rid of these victimless crimes um theres no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it   right   and and worry about these things where people are getting hurt and i think one of the big things that you can do is to increase deterrence is um if someone is found guilty of a uh felony  level offense they lose their citizenship and they lose their constitutional rights   umhum   you know and just a lot of things that were trying to worry about you know protecting these people from we just dont protect them   i know like in my wifes case they made her feel like the criminal they they went to all all   i know and i think i think thats ridiculous
