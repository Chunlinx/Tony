                                 La Dolce Vita            Barbara Kopples recentironically titled Wild Man Blues chronicled the European tour of WoodyAllen and his Dixieland jazz band Those who endured it I felt caged whichmight have been Kopples intent saw the celebrity polite but frozenfaced asstar struck wellwishers attempted to make conversation with him then moaningthat he wished he could be back in his New York apartment or editing room Imnot sure if Allen was ever a public person but his social skills have visiblyeroded after  years of selfimposed isolationof hiding behind his wealthand celebrity If anyone was not in a position to give us insight intothe corrosive vacuity of our culture its Allen whos so out of touch that hereportedly cast Kirstie Allen in his last film Deconstructing Harry without ever having seen Cheers  and whose idea of sexual audacity inhis new one is to have a hooker Bebe Neuwirth another actress he never saw onCheers  teach a repressed hysteric Judy Davis how to give a blow jobby sliding a banana in and out of her mouth            Allendoesnt go to big premieres or Academy Award parties and Celebrity ishis idea of what hes missing The movie which was the celebrity studdedopening night attraction of the New York Film Festival and will soon arrive ata theater near you is more entertaining than it ought to bebut then Allenhas evolved into a firstrate director Last year Roger Ebert ridiculedsomething I wrote about Deconstructing Harry  The result is morerambunctiousand more funthan any movie he has made in years What puzzlesme is why it still adds up to something so anemic and coldly distasteful Itsalways nice to be noticed but Eberts implicationthat its silly to beconflicted about the work of an artist even one whose technical and emotionalsmarts have matured at different ratesis willfully obtuse As a piece ofcinema music Celebrity is limpid and graceful and Sven Nykvistsblackandwhite photography gives the images a luster thats oftenexhilaratingly at odds with the degeneracy being portrayed Episode afterepisode has a pleasing shape with wittily protracted takes and on the buttonpunch lines Buthere we go again RogerI found the movie cheap muddledand thoroughly devoid of insight If you think Im divided on Allen Rogeryou should hear me on Bill Clinton            The pictures entree into this dolce vita is KennethBranagh as Lee Simon a celebrityprofiling magazine writer and failed novelistwhos also peddling an action screenplay but with a strong personal crisisLee comes on to virtually every beautiful woman he meets and has an amazingamount of success for someone so otherwise unsuccessful and so thickened withdissipation Branagh plays the part with a Woody Allen stammermaybe thedumbest creative decision he has made since casting Robert De Niro asFrankensteins monster As written the character has no center and Branaghsmimetic turn allows him to skip along the surface of the part while people inthe audience whisper He sounds like Woody Allen Nearly  years ago Allenwrote a brilliant short story about a man who goes to the hospital to visit adying acquaintance and then returns on a daily basis portraying himself as asaint because he has the hots for the attending nurse Allen brings the samelacerating selfhatred to his protagonist here but with no new wisdom forcedto explain himself Lee can only stammer incoherently In Long Days JourneyInto Night  Eugene ONeill has Edmund Tyrone his alter ego announceStammering is the native eloquence of us fog people For Allen stammering isthe acquired eloquence of obfuscators His fog is selfinduced            Its alsoprotective The very idea of public culture seems to fill him with dread andits hard to think of a single piece of meaningful social intercourse in theentire movie People at parties are bimbos or phonies orworst ofallcritics Lees jittery exwife Robin Davis turns the head of a sweetproducer Joe Mantegna who puts her on television to interview billionairevulgarians and exhibitionistic freaks She becomes a celebrity and achievessolidity while Lee remains arrestedchasing glassyeyed supermodels and flakytwentysomething actresses He is in a starstudded hell            For someone so appalled by celebrity Allenexploits it deftly casting bigname actors to fill out parts that wouldotherwise be recognized as pathetically underwritten In Celebrity  hegets a lot of mileage out of Davis playing yet another poeticallydiscombobulated basket casegorgeously Winona Ryder even more breathtakingin blackandwhite Mantegna Famke Janssen Gretchen Mol Melanie Griffithgiving Lee a blow job and Leonardo DiCaprio as a hotel room trashing prettyboy superstar Allen gets more than he deserves from DiCaprio whose briefappearance is the highlight of the picture Hes meant to embody everythingshallow and psychotic about stardom the conception is out of tabloid tales ofJohnny Depp but the actor has never looked as beautiful with the chiseledinsolence of a young Elvis Presley and the bearing of a Greek god Every ideain the sequence is banal but DiCaprio reminds you why movie stars sometimesdeserve to be worshipped            Perpetually dissatisfied Allens protagonist hops from one fabulous babe toanother but never comes close to wholeness His one attempt at somethingsolida novelis vindictively destroyed by a jilted lover Theres only onecopya device that was stale a century ago when Hedda Gabler burned EjlertLovborgs manuscript and in the age of word processors is just inane Inlinking Lees selfdestructiveness to the culture in which hes enmeshed Allenreminds me of Newt Gingrich who blamed Susan Smiths drowning of her childrenon liberals and the counterculture before it was revealed that the youngwomans disturbed psyche had more to do with the nocturnal visits of herstepfather a higherup in the states Republican Party In one sequence Allenridicules plastic surgeons and the aging wealthy women who cling and kowtow tothem This from a man in his mids who casts himself opposite increasinglyyounger starlets a man who argues that taking up with a girl barely out of herteens is a mark of purity Allens sanctimoniousness makes me understand whypeople trash hotel rooms            In Celebrity  the protagonist peddles a script aboutan armored car robbery but with a strong personal crisis That sounds alittle like Ronin  which has won rave reviews for its pokerfaceddepiction of rootless professional assassins among them Robert De Niro andJean Reno who get double and triple and quadruplecrossed and come toquestion the meaning of their existence Well not really The audience getsdoublecrossed too in the climax but by then so many people have had theirheads casually blown off that its hard to care whos doing what to whom andwhy Directed by the veteran John Frankenheimer Ronin doesnt have theshorthand syntax of a s thriller It has a gritty feel and a tightmethodical onethingafteranother tempo Bystanders are mowed down innocentpeople are blown away cars go careening down twisty French streets andFrankenheimer just keeps barreling ahead substituting noise and brutality fora point of view Or does he want us to think that his emotionless linearity isan Existential point of view I was absorbed by Ronin for an hour orso but gradually realized that I was wearing De Niros dyspeptic scowl Athree Maalox thriller                           Clay Pigeons gets offto a jolly start before petering out into hiply modernist irresolution Bothviolent and absurd it features a hero Joaquin Phoenix whos guilty of asexual indiscretion but gets more than he bargained for when the distraughthusband of his mistress commits suicide and makes it look like a murdercommitted byguess who Pretty soon Phoenix is under suspicion for a wholebunch of killings he didnt commit including those of a prolific serialkiller The film smoothly directed by David Dobkin has a neat farcicalstructure but is too in love with its overly tightlipped protagonist anddeadpan pacing See it for Jeneane Garafolo as a sour sarcastic FBI agent andVince Vaughn as a rhinestone cowboy trucker whose unlined face and blandbonhomie grow more hilariously creepy with each passing corpse                           What Dreams May Comeweds an epic sometimes visionary depiction of the afterlife to a script andstory with fewer psychological layers than the average Hallmark card Featuringthe random deaths of young children fatal automobile accidents a suicide anda lot of afterdeath romping amid watercolored lilies its about as deadly asa movie can be without literally emitting mustard gas
