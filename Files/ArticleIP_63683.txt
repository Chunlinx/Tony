                                 The Greene Mile            Ralph Fiennes makes methink of a line from A Midsummer Nights Dream  That is hot ice andwondrous strange snow His piercing blue eyes signal anger or torment whilehis manner stays glassy and querulous This aloof slightly inhuman mix oftraits somehow suited both the insubstantial martyr of Quiz Show and the Nazi sadist of Schindlers List  In the latter his deepvoice sounded great with a German accent at once oily and metallic ButFiennes is truly in his odd element as a Graham Greene hero in Neil Jordansfluid adaptation of                   The End of the Affair                He playsMaurice Bendrix a selfcentered novelist who embarks on an opportunistic butincreasingly incendiary romance with Sarah Julianne Moore the wife of abland civil servant named Henry Miles Stephen Rea This happens during theLondon blitzkrieg and the German bombs both heighten the passion all rulesare suspended and underscore the hopelessness As Maurice becomes morepossessive Sarah begins the inexorable Graham Greeneian drift intoselfabnegating Catholicism Fiennes is superb at jealousy and even betterwhen he has to fulminate at something so intangible and yet to Greene soirrefutable as the existence of God He looks enraged at having reached thelimit of his spiritual resources and his haggard selfdoubt humanizes him            The movie doesntcapture all aspects of the novel but that hardly matters Its middlingGreene The author barely bothers to characterize England under siege he wasmore evocative when his settings were farther from home as they almost alwayswere and the last thirdin which the atheistic Maurice has his face rubbedin the rightness of Sarahs faithfeels like a denouement not a climax Theglory of the bookof most of Greenes booksis in the dialogue in which allthat vague spiritual yearning coalesces into candor so biting that it still hasthe power to shock Wounded lovers dismiss each other with compact fury whilethe fiercest insults are reserved for representatives of a God who has letdespair run riot Greenes dialogue is already close to great screenwritingand Jordan edits and orchestrates it with masterful cunning            More important he distills from the novel a mournfully wryfable on the allconsuming convolutions of jealousy We meet Maurice two yearsafter his entanglement with Sarah has abruptly ended but an encounter withher husbandforlorn and hatless in a deluge convinced that his wife is holedup somewhere with a loverbrings the greeneyed monster as well as a host ofmemories back with a snap Its the exparamour not the husband who hires adetective agency to dog the mysteriously wayward Sarah andin one of thoseironies that feels delightfully postmodernits Maurice himself who ends upbeing trailed by a Cockney gumshoe Parkis an amusingly earnest Ian Hartwhen Sarah reinitiates contact The story touches on sex farce but onlybriefly This is a tale in which every possessive human act ends up driving theheroine closerboth spiritually and literallyto God The movie is areligious conspiracy disguised as a romance            Jordans mysticism isnton the surface the way it is in some of his other films but in the recessesHe and his cinematographer Roger Pratt have loaded the screen withshadowsnot the hardedged ones of film noir but a sort of existentialEnglish smudginess The textures are muddied the palette damp Its as ifthe light has had to pass through layer upon layer of dust and fog so thatonly the faded yellows oranges and the occasional green of some wallpaperregister amid the ashy grays You cant make this world seem too welcoming orthe characters will lose the incentive to seek out a better one That meansfreezing rain cheerlessly crabbed interiors and lots of extras who visiblylive lives of quiet desperation The effect of so much misery isntnarcotizing however Jordan like Greene is too sensitive to his charactersvexationsto their colorful spasms of pique His heroes dont go mutely theirsouls scratch and kick            Julianne Moore is especially raw Her whitish faintlyfreckled complexion affords her no protection from the elements worldly orotherwise When Maurice questions Sarahs love while bombs drop nearby sheresponds by screwing him harder her bare breasts looming over him imperiousyet vulnerable as the plaster dust rains down This is one of Moores softhairperformances I tend to prefer the straighthair onesthe razorsedgehysterics of The Big Lebowski  The Myth of Fingerprints and the upcoming Magnolia although her softhaired repositoryof environmental poison in Safe  is probably her most amazingwork I love everything she does but I wish that Jordan hadnt left her soexposed He misdirects her in her big scene in which a bomb falls on Sarah andMaurices love nest and her response to his apparent death spells the end ofher earthly happiness Moore internalizes the emotion a shade too much and herlack of urgency amid the rubble borders on camp Its a mark of her staturethat another potential camp moment doesnt bring the house down the line Itsonly a coughnever a happy portent in a love story            At first Reas hangdogpersona struck me as overly pitiable for Henry A more repressed formalEnglishman would make his wifes open disregard seem less cruel But Greeneintends an element of cruelty and Reas blurry bewilderment is finally movingYou can see why even a cold fish like Fiennes Maurice would feel compelled totake care of him In a late scene the husband invades the lovers seasideidyll which is an impulse that might seem out of character for Henry and thatisnt in the book Jordan has lifted the idea from another Greene work SinceGreene would juggle the same motifs for the rest of his lifethe trianglesthe bonds between cuckolds and lovers the selfsacrificing renunciations theuse of birthmarks to indicate spiritual blight the insistent pull ofCatholicismJordans interpolation seems not an impertinence but the highestform of respect On their first date Maurice takes Sarah to the cinema to seean adaption of one of his novels and has to shield his eyes from the coarsenessof it I think if Greene took a date to see The End of the Affair hedsay The bloody cheek I didntohhmmmthats very good Thats very goodindeed            By contrast Frank Darabonts threehour adaptation ofStephen Kings serial novel                   The Green Mile                is superficiallyrespectful but ultimately cruel He exposes the work as hooey Actually notall of the movie is melodramatic pseudomystical drivelonly about two hoursand  minutes            That leaves a stately minutes in which the texture of Depressionera life in the deathrow wing of aSouthern prison is richly evoked The rhythms are leisurely but fraughteventhe most casual exchanges carry an awareness of the electric chair nearby Theday before an execution the condemned man is sent away and a surrogate HarryDean Stanton does a dress rehearsal Walkin the mile  repeats the old manas he and the guards troop down the corridorknown as the Green Mile for thecolor of the floorto the chair in which hes elaborately strapped offeredan opportunity to make a final statement Sorry for all the bad shit I doneand mockdispatched When the surrogate makes a sick joke and the guards eruptin laughter the head guard Paul Edgecomb Tom Hanks silences themworriedly He says they shouldnt make jokes because the next day when a manwill actually die they might remember the joke and not be able to stop fromcracking up That rebuke is a wonderful piece of writingit establishes bothEdgecombs watchfulness and his decency The movie is full of details likethat Its attention to rituals that other films dont have time for gives itsurprising power And its episodic constructionwhich mirrors Kings novelisa relief from the beeline structure of most bigbudget thrillers            T he Green Mile also features a giant mentally
