        do you see anything wrong with public school systems   well yes i do um i think im concerned about the large number of children that        each teacher is expected to to deal with in some quality way i think maybe weve given our teachers a almost impossible job   i agree   do you do you have children in the public school system   yes and i taught for fourteen years   is that right   before we moved to Texas and the the one thing i see is changing is i was held accountable so much i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms for all the children   you you were a bookkeeper  oh   everything had to be documented and i had file cabinets that werent filled with neat stuff for kids it was filled with documentation   oh no well um im i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back and and im just really in a dilemma if thats what you know id love   yes   to work with children and to teach them but im really having questions if if i can deal with that system and and have a good conscience about you know what i do i dont think   me too   i dont think its the teachers i think its the system but um   i think so too        theyre so worried about lawsuits and the scores that children get on tests now   right   and teacher competency you know and its not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best shes always worried whose looking over her shoulder and   what childs gonna say something some parents going to overreact to thats   thats right i know   thats true  well its its hard on the children too i think you know because the um the teachers are overworked and just like a mommy thats overworked youre not at your best you know um and   thats right do you have children in the system   i have two i have uh in the system one is in ninth grade and one is in seventh grade and them um im home schooling my kindergartner this year   ah   we um  live in a district that has open classrooms and i wasnt particularly comfortable with that for her   yep are you in Plano yep i am too and i have one in ninth grade at Clark and one at Hendrick this year and he my ninth my uh sixth grader came from an open classroom at Matthews   yes you too   and the very first year i taught back in seventy three we had open classroom and it didnt work then and when we moved down here i was just appalled that they were still doing it here   oh still at it well the explanation i was was given about you know they they seemed to admit that it wasnt working but they didnt have the money to restructure but looks to me that it wouldnt take really that much money to at least come up with i mean some kind of partitions you know   partitions or just to face the children different directions or to do something   just yeah   i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school so he spent all day in this one large open area   oh goodness oh   so i didnt really care for that it seems like the schools in Michigan were much better than they are down here   were they   that was our last tour up in Michigan   well we were from North um Carolina and of course North North Carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education i think they rank about forty ninth but our children got a very good education there they were in the magnet school program   oh umhum   and a lot of their classes from the time they were about third grade they they changed classes several times during the day which has its pros and cons but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes   oh wow   and it was wonderful so you know im coming to to Plano thinking well gosh its going to be really great its ranked so much better   yes yes thats right we heard wonderful things about it till we actually got in the system   isnt that interesting i i i dont understand how they get this this reputation unless its just that they spend a lot of money i dont know   probably so on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are   i guess so well my son is at Clark this year too so uh were yes   so as a freshman yep   and uh hes pleased with his classes um i i dont guess ive been in the high school long enough to to know           what to expect really you know how to judge it uh   yeah my daughter seems to be having a good time she was absent with strep throat the last three days and i ran over and picked up her report card and she did very good so   well thats good   and she seems to be studying and has just about the right amount of homework i would expect   yeah   for a freshman to have shes not bogged down but yet she has some every night   well Eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesnt have any so thats interesting but he his grades i havent seen them yet but supposedly theyre good so   yes you always hear how good now my sons at junior high and says that his grades are going to be wonderful but who knows what hes going to bring home so i dont   thats right
