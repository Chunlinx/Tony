                                 Fanciful Traces            The British royal familyas everyone knows by now has an image problem What better solution than toexport some of their most prestigious but rarely seen images the drawings ofMichelangelo for public display in the wide world Tucked away in agroundfloor corner of the East Wing of the National Gallery in WashingtonDC are some of the finest drawings to be seen in the United States just nowThere are  by the master himself as compared with fewer than  in all theAmerican collections combined and another  drawings by contemporaries andsuccessors that betray his influence Fanned out in six rooms arranged like abeehive with the lights turned low to protect the fragile treasures and lenda mood of reverence to the occasion the enthralling show is calledMichelangelo and His Influence Drawings from Windsor Castle            Even inhis own time Michelangelo  was recognized as having no peer insculpture drawing or architecture Only the multitalented Leonardo da Vinciwith his greater intellectual range rivals the younger Michelangelo amongRenaissance artists Anyone who has seen Michelangelos David has noneed to see anything else by any other sculptor living or dead gushed hisfirst biographer his contemporary Giorgio Vasari Vasaris account ofMichelangelos heroic labors in the Sistine Chapel has entered popular loreIts hard not to think of Charlton Heston in The Agony and the Ecstasy Alone on the high scaffold paint dripping into his upturned eyes he pushesforward with his Sisyphean task as Rex Harrison playing Michelangelosimpatient patron Pope Julius II paces angrily below            Heroism seriousness monumentalgrandeurthese are all part of the Michelangelo legend But the drawings inthe National Gallery invite us to discover another Michelangelo an artist ofdelicacy and pictorial wit Consider the exquisite airborne Archers who while Cupid sleeps in the foreground send their errant arrows toward thetarget Few hit their mark and no wonderfor those archers we suddenlyrealize arent holding bows No one knows the meaning of this enigmaticredchalk drawingwhile Cupid sleeps love goes awry But the sheer joy of theimage is contagious Where Archers suggests the lightfooted world ofdreams the grotesque mask situated among the Ideal Heads in the firstroomits headdress borrowed it seems from the Statue of Libertyevokes anearthbound world where the human and animal realms are not easilydistinguished Is this a man disguised as a lion or a lion turning into a manThe bared teeth are clearly human but the feral eyes looking sharply to theside the curling upper lip and the bristling facial hair suggest a catpersonready to pounce            Leoninetoo is Hercules performing three labors in one of the dazzlingPresentation                Drawings finished drawings that were given tofriends and patronsin the next room As he pries open the Vulcanian jaws ofthe Nemean lion the heros own lionskin disguise hovers like a halo over hisback as though he cant throw off his animal identity so easily Across thesame sheet Hercules fumbles with the Hydra We know hes going to lop offthose serpentine heads one of which is biting him brazenly in the rear But asMichelangelo conceives him Hercules seems to be dancing with the Hydra asthough hes drawing from this encounter some of the writhing erotic energy ofthe monster A humorless penandink drawing of the same subject by Raphaelthat appears later in the show depicts Hercules staring down the Hydra Theawkward crosshatching makes one wonder why Michelangelo was so competitive notto say bitchy about his rival What Raphael had of art he wrote in a letter he had of me Raphael had been dead for  years            Michelangelos metamorphic wit somewherebetween the nightmare transformations of his fellow Florentine Dante Alighieriand the baroque fantasies of Lorenzo Bernini is nowhere better displayed thanin his famous drawing of Phathons fall Phathon youll remember wanted todrive his fathers carthat is Apollosacross the sky He lost control asyoung drivers will and Jupiter astride his eagle shot him down with alightning bolt Intertwined with his four magnificent horses Phathon turnshis splendid body toward us one last time An image of the consequences ofpride and vanity says the sober wall label Perhaps But Phathons falllike the cascading forms in Michelangelos Sistine Last Judgment  hasits own headlong ecstasy His three anxious sisters watching from the groundbelow are beginning to turn into treestheir punishment for their brothershubris            Michelangelo gave the drawing of Phathon to Tommaso de Cavalieri the Romannobleman to whom he addressed some of his most passionate sonnetsMichelangelowas a gifted poet too According to your will he told Cavalieri Im hotin the harshest winter cold in the sun While Michelangelos homosexualityhas long been assumedthe Victorian critic Walter Pater wrote of his vagueand wayward lovesthere is no evidence that Cavalieri reciprocated hisfeelings            Another drawing given to Cavalieri takesMichelangelos transforming wit to a whole new level It depicts the giantTityus whose punishment for raping the goddess Leto was to have his liverripped out each day by a vulture only to have it grow back each nightMichelangelos Tityus reclines on his craggy bed of rock from which hismuscular body seems to have been sculpted His punishment looks like anotherrape with the vulture having its way with the bound and lustful andapparently acquiescent giant A tree with an openjawed faceone of Dantesdamned souls perhapsscreams in the background            Then asif this werent masterly enough Michelangelo did something amazing He flippedthe sheet of paper over rotated it  degrees and traced the nowupright formof Tityus The tortured giant became the risen Christ stepping from his tombThe viewer goes around and around the freestanding frame to see just howMichelangelo did it And what subversive intent what wicked wit was at workhere Did the artist mean to imply an erotic side of Christ a mortification ofhuman desire rewarded by bodily resurrection No wonder Michelangeloscontemporaries were in awe of him and tried to follow his intimidatinglead            Exhibitions billed as showing a major artistand his influence are sometimes excuses for including inferior art to fillout an occasion While there are a few too many drawings by variousaccomplished hands after Michelangelo originals this show feels winnoweddown and sharply focused Some of these drawings have their own distinctiveflavor showing less Michelangelos influence than his provocation AnnibaleCarraccis Ignudo  transforms one of the languorous young malenudes of Michelangelos Sistine ceiling into a wily satyrlike characterhecould be Shakespeares Mercutio Indeed the grandeur and flashing wit of thesurly Florentine and the enigmatic Englishman have much in common There arethe towering achievements of boththe public buildings the tragediesand theunexpected delights on a smaller scale            We expect to be awed by thesheer size and marmoreal magnificence of David  the Sistine Chapel thedome of St Peters in Rome These have a public purpose captured in the Irishpoet William Butler Yeats lines about the bestknown Sistine image Thatgirls at puberty may find The first Adam in their thought Theres adifferent but no less intense pleasure to be derived from these miraclesworked up from the meager materials of paper
