                                 Virtual Fur            Furs were the first clothesstripped off the same beasts that provided food and bone tools Fur clotheswere strictly utilitarian until people learned to spin thread fine enough toweave into cloth soft enough to drape around the body Once that happenedmaybe about  years ago fur worn by people became both a luxury and asymbol of wealth and power and it still is Fortunately or not we can nevergo back to those artless Paleolithic days            But aftermillennia of arrogance laced with sensuality for some and awe laced with rancorfor most fur has been tamed and put in its place Men and women swathed inseal and sable are no longer obvious lords of the world trailing intimidatingallusions to Renaissance princes or Russian czars and their consorts insteadthey look faintly outofdate And those spectacular women in tailored leopardcoats still found in old movies have vanished from real life ever since theidea took hold that exotic fur garments were not just too luxurious but alsobad for the soul and bad for the planet These days the wearer of a big coatmade wholly of fur seems almost to be hiding inside an animal costumedisguised as a member of an endangered species as it were            What looks suitable now is fur in piquant tracesdecorative little sealskin scarves or squirrel trim for hoods or neat foxcollars for coats All these are very attractive and marginal enough tosuggest the wearers superiority to fashion altogether in accordance with thecurrent style In the same spirit they can all be jolly fakes Real is finefake is essentially no different Thats because textile technology has finallyproduced a range of synthetic fluff that vies with fur in visual beauty andtactile lusciousness Some of this synthetic fiber is wrought into velvet andits cousins plush and chenille materials known to be manmade even when madeof silk In their company manmade chinchilla and mink dont seem in the leastfalse            Best ofall now we can have no fur but the image of fur pictured skins of the rarestkind with which we can enjoy ourselves in a range of materials Fur has solvedits social and economic identity problem by leaping out of nature and into thevirtualreality third millennium So we can have plastic hair clips or cottonpotholders in zebra skin vinylcovered hassocks in giraffe pelt soft corduroysofa cushions or tough twill suitcases in tiger fur and nylon zipper jacketsin Dalmatian spots for yearolds Cheetah spots merge with giraffe spots onbright green or purple Lycra stretch pants I have a tawny silk blouse printedwith a clever blend of black lace and leopard skin In it I can vaguelyresemble a leopard wearing seethrough lingerie a nice mlange of warringerotic symbols            Iacquired this blouse soon after my adventureslast August I was in Botswana looking at the indigenous wild beasts in theirliving flesh and fur and I came to understand why leopard is the mostdesirable of all the fur prints for clothes Its because of the way a realleopard behaves All the African animals we sawspotted striped or plainwart hogs and wildebeests no less than elephants and antelopes zebras andgiraffeswere beautiful with the integrity of physical design and movementthey share with other animals But among them its the leopard who seems tofeel it            We saw only one theyrediscreeta female we were told We watched her emerge from a thicket into asunlit clearing and pose Theres no other word for it She stood perfectlystill head up tail in a majestic arc while we stared entranced for a full seconds Then she paced slowly off as if on a runway each perfect paw straightin front of the other haunches delicately swaying tail holding its curvepeerless coat glittering in the sun Our guide said that only the leopard walkslike thatthe lions just shamble and clump along Of course we deeply lovedand respected all those heavyfooted lions and all those highshoulderedcheetahs too But the leopard is another thing and all things considered wewant to be like her            People have felt this wayfor a very long time A week ago I was looking among the Egyptian antiquitiesin the renovated Louvre and my eye was caught by a small painted limestonepanel from the tomb of Princess Nefertiabet who lived and died in the reign ofher kinsman Cheops  BC The young princess is shown seated before alow table her hands engaged with some objects and her body clad in a longclinging oneshouldered Thierry Mugler dress entirely covered with leopardspots Well well well This was no real animals pelt Leopard skins doappear frequently in ancient Egyptian art but as privileged ritual gear slungover the shoulders of priests with paws and tail dangling down No by gollyhere was a yearold leopardprint dress worthy of being worn foreternity in the Realm of the Dead I turned my head and saw the woman next tome wearing a leopardprint scarf and I felt a little dizzy You couldntexactly say that leopard print is always in fashion But you would have toadmit that its always in force
