                                 The Slates Man            I was on the up escalatorrising into the perfumed precincts of the second floor of the Nordstromdepartment store in Virginias Pentagon City mall when a tall shapely blackwoman about  years of age sashayed past and settled in three steps aboveme From the heterosexualmale perspective the view was outstanding a finefemale rump in tight velvet pants shifting around slightly somewhere north ofeye level            Until that moment I hadbeen feeling like a Slate magazine kind of guy My pants were slatecolored myjacket a charcoal that certainly qualified as the same I had absorbed thewisdom of Slate dialogists Susan Estrich and Stuart Taylor Jr on thesubtleties of contemporary sexualharassment law Thus I chastely averted myeyes from the behind ahead of me I had balanced my budget following therecommendations of Professor Stein I had slaked my thirst for OJ news byreading Harry Shearer The Gist of my Spin was that I was above The Fray Mytabula was rasa             All Ineeded to round out my sartorial and spiritual Slateness I knew was a goodpair of Slates TM  The latter refers of course to a line of menspants sold by Levi Strauss to leading department stores everywhere            My search had begun the day before at Hechts in downtownWashington DC Navigating through brightly colored racks of Tommy Hilfigergear and a bold display of Timberland boots I had been distracted by a drabblot to the right of the aisle There stood a table covered with stacks offolded mens slacks uninspiring in color dubious in cut I slowed to browsefirst a mound of sandcolored leggings and a veritable tower of dullforestgreen numbers nearby two racks of gray garments hanging limply beneatha sign that said  Slates the little promotional poster announcedThese are those pants            Thisstupid tautology bugged me immediatelybut then stupid tautologies are thehallmark of criminal regimes and successful ad campaigns everywhere Coke isIt Nixons the One etc so I checked my annoyance If the people whosell Slates are so dumb and Im so smart how come I aint rich like them Ifingered the fabric and looked for a pair in my size  waist  inseamSome were  percent worsted woolbut who wants to wear wool in the summer Astack of gabardines would have made a fine cover for a motel love seat butthey seemed out of place on my person And then there was the rack of bottomsmade of something billed as Microfiber            What is it about modern life I wondered idlythat makes entrepreneurs want to celebrate and sell its microness Especiallywhen the label in the waistband reveals that Microfiber is another way ofsaying  percent Dacron            Then it dawned on me Whatif Slateness as embodied by the magazine and the pants wasnt as cool as Iwas assuming What if it wasnt cool at all For all I knew Slate wasactually insiders lingo for a certain market nichemy marketnichecomprising guys who have gained  pounds since high school guys whoknow their way around a search engine but what with the wife and the childsupport and the gas bills and all those  bottles of wine lack the loosedollars and idle time that can buy true American style            Suddenly I was face to facewith one of the recurring nightmares of bourgeois life I was caught in one ofthose waking dreams in which you understand full well that your individualtastes carefully nurtured and developed over the decades have in fact beenanticipated designed and shaped by others every step of the way My searchfor Slates apparently an act of free will was but a pawns move in the greatgame of advertising played by casually superior types on Madison Avenue and inHollywood and in Redmond Wash for billiondollar stakes in which I wouldnever share            Thus theSlate mind pierces the false consciousness of late capitalism Your vauntedindividuality is exposed as nothing but a pixel in the big picture of the moneyboys But you do get a prize my friend You get to wear Dacron            Bitterly I toted three pairs of Slates to the dressingroom vowing never again to subscribe to an online magazine even one thatdoesnt charge There in the privacy of the changing room I understood that theerotic subtext of Slatesthe pantswas that there is no eroticsubtext While much of mens and womens clothing is designed to send out acomplex code of sexual and social signals Slates true to their name areblank You mean you want to slip into something that might attract theattention and admiration of a fellow mammal These are not thosepants            The sole and grudgingconcession that Slates make to male vanity is pleats Now I like pleats and Iwas consoled briefly in the changing room by the thought that this subtlest offashion statements was all that a Slate guy needed I tried on the grayMicrofiber model waist size  I checked the mirror not bad I emerged toask the salesman if he thought the pleats were pulling too much He was amusedby my Slateness            Try a he said            The humiliation caused by his unkind smilepersisted for  hours Not until that supremely attractive female butt crossedmy radar in Nordstrom did I start to feel better And no sooner had I begun toenjoy my Slateness than glorious erotic opportunity went aglimmering At thetop of the escalator the phat lady made a sharp left into a silky hedge of LizClaiborne blouses to confer with a salesclerk I wanted to follow her askingplayful questions Instead I turned right toward the mens department stillsearching for those pants            Truth be told it was notall that hard to come to terms with the unbearable Slateness of being I had toadmit that Slates although perhaps overpriced and ugly were not altogetherinappropriate for a guy like me My pleats do pull My prosperous ass istoo big for Dockers and too wise to try to fake the funk  la Tommy HilfigerIs the man of Slate too good for Dacron Not at all I marched up to asalesgirl in the mens department and inquired if she had any Slates            She looked at meno otherword will doblankly            Theyre a line of pantsfrom Levis I stammered            Oh we do not carry anyLevis she said emphatically Never have She smiled and produced a smallpiece of candy Want one            I poppedthat caramel treat into my mouth and looked into her pretty eyes Suchexquisitely miniaturized and stylized sexual situations it occurred to mewere the reward the glory of a Slatetype guy Thus the Slate mind grasps theunfolding rationality of hedonistic capitalism Microsoft MicrofiberMicrosex            The salesgirl directed me still sucking gratefully on hermicrogift onward to the Macys at the other end of the mall Here the lightswere brighter the music a wee bit louder and the tease of pleasurableconsumption a bit less subtle and a bit more fetishistic though no lesspleasurable The makeup counter was lined with female forms an older Latinwoman painting the wideopen eyes of an AfricanAmerican teenager a whitegirl and a pink girl and a brown girl crowding around the eyeliner counteravidly seeking their one true color amid the promiscuous riot of magentapeach chartreuse fuchsia and mauve Undistracted in this brothel of platonicindulgence I went to the mens department and found another salesclerk Shehad a mustache the cultural significance of which completely confounded theSlate mind            Do you have Slates I askedweakly The pants            Slates No she repliedWe have the Savanes the Dockers and the Club Internationals on this sideBut no Slates Maybe you should look down there She helpfully pointed to acorner lined with mens suits            There itwas again an island of Slates dull as dirt but not as cheap two pairs for I quickly snatched up a bunch of size s before any of the salespeoplecould get close to me and headed toward the changing room            The fit was nice and loose the way my wifelikes it The pleats were pleasing Checking myself out in the dressingroommirror I realized that in these pants I would never again be fearful of thatother nightmare of bourgeois life the moment in which you sense that yourmiddleclass prosperity your hightech skills your credit cards and theadvertising industry all give you license to slough off your work ethic relaxyour discipline and lower your guard The Slate man knows the culturalcontradictions of capitalism He lives them wears them and so is proofedagainst the temptation to follow the logical sequel to bourgeois successtheurge to abandon the selfdenial that made it all possible to mock yourcolleagues and spurn your peers to return no email to call in sick from thebeach house to drink  bottles of wine every night to watch porno movies inbed with ironic complit graduate students and to vanish for days on end inpursuit of unbourgeois happiness            No my Slates reassured meI would do none of those things and I would be no less delighted and contentfor not doing them            The only problem was that mypleats were still pulling I noticed that I had brought in a size  I cantbe that big I thought picking up the pants Thus the man of Slate correctsthe error of his ways I tried them on Tucked in a wee bit at the waist theyfit me perfectly
