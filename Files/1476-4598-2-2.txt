                    Background        Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm of skeletal        muscle and is one of the most common soft tissue        malignancies in the children and adolescent population        Histopathologically rhabdomyosarcoma can be divided into        two major subtypes embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma representing        about  of the clinical cases and alveolar        rhabdomyosarcoma representing about  of the total cases             Extensive cytogenetic studies showed that the        embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas are generally associated with        loss of heterozygosity LOH for multiple closely linked        loci at chromosomal p suggesting inactivation of one        or more tumorsuppressor genes in this region             But the gene involved in this region has yet to be        identified Many other associated mutation or amplification        of oncogenes tumor suppressor genes including p Kras        Nras and Nmyc etc are frequently seen but the roles of        these gene mutationsamplifications in pathogenesis of the        tumor remain largely unclear         The alveolar        subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma however is consistently        associated with two common chromosomal translocations Most        cases of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma are associated with a        chromosomal translocation t  q q and less        commonly with t p q        The t         translocation results in fusion of a portion of the Pax        gene to a portion of the FKHR gene leading to formation of        fusion protein PaxFKHR Pax gene encodes a        transcriptional factor important in early development        program while FKHR gene encodes another generic        transcriptional factor that is widely expressed in        mammalian tissues The t  translocation results in        formation of PaxFKHR Both PaxFKHR and PaxFKHR were        shown to possess more potent transcriptional activity than        its original forms Pax and Pax      How the        chimeric fusion proteins contribute to pathogenesis of        rhabdomyosarcoma remains unclear        Ataxia telangiectasia mutated gene ATM is a newly        identified member of PI kinase family that is mutated in        human autosomal recessive disease ataxia telangiectasia        AT      ATM gene is large spanning about  kbs        of genomic DNA and is located on chromosome q In        response to DNA damage agents such as ionizing irradiation        and chemical agent cisplatin ATM kinase is activated        leading to a cascade of kinase reactions regulating cell        cycle apoptosis and DNA damage repair      Many        downstream target molecules of ATM kinase were so far        identified These target proteins include the cAbl        tyrosine kinase the p tumor suppressor the Chk and        Chk serinethreoine kinase the p subunit of replication        protein A RPA Chk serinethreoine kinase and NBS        kinase which is mutated in human autosomal recessive        disease Nijmegan breakage syndrome                   Clinical characteristics of AT patients include        hypersensitivity to irradiation thymic dysplasia immune        defects and higher tendency to develop malignant tumor        suggesting that ATM function is critical in DNA damage        repair and tumor suppression However up to date AT        patients are not known to develop rhabdomyosarcoma        In this study we report an association of human        rhabdomyosarcoma with deletionmutation of ATM gene This        is the first report so far of ATM gene associated with        solid malignancy except for the mantle cell lymphoma a        malignant tumor in lymphoid origin The association of ATM        gene mutationdeletion with rhabdomyosarcoma suggests a        link of ATM gene with cancer risk and ATM kinase may        contribute to pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma                    Results        Totally  patients specimen were retrieved from the        archived tissue blocks The clinical characteristics of        these patients were listed as in Table  Some patients        clinical information was not available at the time of the        study These patients all carried clinical        histopathological diagnoses of rhabdomyosarcoma embryonal        or alveolar type and showed immunostaining positivity for        myogenin a specific skeletal muscle marker        Immunofluorescent or immunohistochemical staining with        antiATM antibody was performed on the total of         specimens and  of the  rhabdomyosarcomas were negative        for ATM protein  see Table  Totally  of the         were positive for ATM kinase  ATM protein was        predominantly located in cytoplasm in the tumor sections        and interestingly predominantly seen in the nuclei in the        rhabdomyosarcoma cell line as those seen with myoD        staining RD cells Fig and  There is no difference in        staining pattern in regard to the subtypes of the        rhabdomyosarcomas namely embryonal or alveolar        subtypes        It is surprising to note that  of the         rhabdomyosarcoma specimens stained negatively for the        presence of ATM protein Under the normal condition ATM        expression is ubiquitous To further confirm the        immunostaining results two different approaches were        taken One was to see if the ATM mRNA is properly        transcribed and another is to directly see the ATM protein        itself by Western blotting analysis from the tumors and        compare with the normal form Due to the limited resource        of the fresh tumor samples we turned to the cell culture        system and used the wellestablished rhabdomyosarcoma cell        lines First we designed eight pairs of oligonucleotide        primers encompassing the almost entire coding sequence of        ATM mRNA based on the published cDNA sequence Genbank        accession number U    Table  The primer        designing strategy is shown in Fig  ATM mRNA is        approximately  kbs in length and contains multiple        protein binding domains for its kinase activity and        interaction with other cellular proteins Fig  We used        reverse transcriptionPCR method to analyze five different        rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines RD cells embryonal Rh        Rh alveolar Rh Rh and mouse normal myoblast CC        cells The human foreskin fibroblasts were used as the        control cells The mRNA was isolated from these cells and        used for RTPCR assays As shown in Fig  in normal        fibroblasts RD cells Rh cells the amplified DNA        fragments were identical in regard to the lengths in        comparing with the control fibroblasts whereas in Rh        cells two fragments in  and  lanes  kbs in Lane         and  kbs in Lane  were absent and in lane         the fragment amplified was approximately  bps smaller        than that seen in the fibroblasts and other        rhabdomyosarcoma cells Fig  The combined length of        missing DNA sequence is estimated  kb fragment  plus        fragment  and additional  bps in lane         The next question is whether ATM protein is normally        translated from ATM mRNA and expressed in the        rhabdomyosarcoma cells We analyzed the ATM protein in        different cell lines In human Hela cells and human normal        foreskin fibroblasts the ATM was estimated to be  kD        consistent with the results previously described             In three rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines RD Rh and RH        there was one aberrant form of ATM protein  kD that        was significantly smaller than that seen in the normal        fibroblasts and the Hela cells Fig  The levels of ATM        expression in these three rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines are        not identical and Rh cells seemed to express less ATM        than the other two Rhabdomyosarcoma cells The murine ATM        proteins from CC and T  cells were significantly        different in size and there appeared to be two species of        ATM proteins in murine cells                    Discussion        ATM gene is a member of PI kinase family ATM kinase is        critical in DNA damage signaling pathway In response to        DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation or chemical agents        such as cisplatin ATM kinase is activated and        phosphorylates a number of downstream regulatory proteins        important for cell cycle arrest growth control apoptosis        and DNA repair        AT patients are known to        be predisposed to a variety of cancers and the fibroblasts        of AT patients are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation            Although many reports showed the association of ATM        mutation with risk of a number of different human        malignancies including prostate cancer breast cancer        ovarian cancer Bcell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and        mantle cell lymphoma the underlying molecular mechanism by        which ATM gene causes these changes are not well understood                 There is so far no study showing        the association of ATM gene with any solid tumor There is        enormous epidemiological interest in establishing the link        of ATM gene abnormality with cancer risk since the        percentage of the ATM heterozygotes is high and estimated        to represent  of total population        We studied the immunostaining characteristics of ATM        protein in clinical rhabdomyosarcoma cases and found that a        significantly high number of cases lacked the proper ATM        gene product  in  cases The clinical significance        of this finding is unclear at this point There is high        percentage of clinical rhabdomyosarcoma cases associated        with p gene mutationdeletion The p mutant mice tend        to develop rhabdomyosarcoma     P is a tumor        suppressor regulating cell cycle control and apoptosis and        p is one of the many downstream targets of ATM kinase             ATM phosphorylate p at Serine  in response to        DNA damage agents     It is unknown how the mutated        ATM contributes to pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma in the        presence of the mutated p In fact the rhabdomyosarcoma        cells Rh is known to have p mutation and is also        positive for t  chromosomal translocation            Further investigations are needed to address these        important questions        The finding of ATM protein predominantly present in the        cytoplasm but not the nucleus of the tumor sections        suggests a different role of ATM in the tumor cells In the        tumor cell lines the ATM protein is present predominantly        in the nucleus The underlying significance of this finding        is unclear Presumably ATM protein in the cytoplasm may        function differently in the tumor cells in vivo from that        in the nucleus seen in the cell culture        The murine ATM was found significantly different in        size although the ATM knockout mice recapitulate the        phenotypic features of AT patients     This species        difference may be important in interpreting the data from        human cells and from murine cells                    Methods                  Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent          staining          Human rhabdomyosarcoma tumor
