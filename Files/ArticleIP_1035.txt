                                 School Desegregation            Fortytwo years afterBrown vs Board of Education  what has happened to school desegregationHow integrated are Americas schools What is the legal status of courtordereddesegregation Whatever became of busing            There have been three stagesof Supreme Court jurisprudence on desegregation since the landmark Brown case In the first stage from  to  the court gavefederal district courts broad authority to impose remedies for segregationincluding busing In the second stage from  to  it curtailedthe authority of the lower courts by virtually forbidding desegregation acrossdistrict lines and by requiring lower courts to give greater leeway to localauthorities In the third stage which began in  the high court haseased the way for schools to be released altogether from desegregation decreesNevertheless over  school districts still operate to some extent under afederal desegregation decree            Has itworked The Department of Education reported recently that the share ofblack students attending intensely segregated schools  percent orhigher minority fell from  percent in  to  percent in  In theSouth the share of black students attending majoritywhite schools went from percent in  to  percent in  However no national database hastracked racial balance in the schools over recent decades reportingrequirements are few and uneven            Whats happened with mandatory busing  In the North Carolina case of Swann vs CharlotteMecklenberg Board ofEducation  the Supreme Court granted federal judges the authority to orderdistrictwide busing to desegregate schools Although public opposition has beengreat no subsequent court ruling has ever invalidated mandatory busingHundreds of districts still operate mandatory busing programs Only one largecity Seattle has ever voluntarily undertaken busing However theSupreme Court signaled a possible shift in  when it allowed a federallysupervised Georgia school district to regain control over busing even beforethe district had fully desegregated            The legalbasis for courtordered busing and other measures is that government officialshave purposely acted to keep the schools segregated As a practical matterthough the main reason schools remain heavily segregated is thatresidential housing patterns are segregated In  the blackpopulations in the  largest metro areas in the North were so concentratedthat  percent would have had to move in order to achieve residential racialbalance In  the court invalidated a desegregation plan that involvedbusing students between heavily black Detroit and its heavily white suburbsThere could be no remedies across district lines for racial imbalancewithin district lines without proof that the lines themselves weredrawn for racially discriminatory reasons The case Milliken vsBradley  was a turning point for it deemed that voluntary white flightfrom urban centers was beyond the power of the courts to remedy            Since the mids magnetschools specialized or especially highquality schools designed to drawstudents voluntarily from a wide geographical areahave been an increasinglypopular way to desegregate school systems without resorting to mandatorybusing A recent ruling marks the limits of this method Since  the judgesupervising the desegregation of the Kansas City Mo schools had ordered over billion in expenditures for a system of magnet schools Last June inMissouri vs Jenkins  the Supreme Court ruled that the judge had gonetoo far He could not require the openended financing of magnet schools andhe could not use magnet schools to attract suburban whites to Kansas Cityschools when the suburbs had done nothing unlawful            Doescourtordered desegregation ever end  At first the Supreme Court saidschool authorities would be under federal supervision until they had dischargedthe affirmative duty to eliminate the vestiges of segregation root andbranch That standard has changed dramatically In  the court held thatonce a school district has made a good faith effort and taken allpracticable steps to end segregation it should be released from its courtorder In  the court ruled that a federal judges jurisdiction can beterminated before the schools have achieved full compliance with adesegregation order In both opinions the court placed a premium on returningschools to local control            As the federal judiciary has backed off desegregationplaintiffs increasingly have turned to state courts  Many stateconstitutions have provisions relating specifically to education TheConnecticut Supreme Court ruled this summer in Sheff vs ONeill thatthe segregation of Hartfords public schools violated the equitable educationprovisions of the state constitution The ruling was significant for tworeasons First the court found no intentional discrimination but ruled thatthe districts segregation was in itself unconstitutional Second thecourt declared that the cause of the segregation was the practice of basingdistrict lines on municipal boundaries Thus it undid in Connecticut the USSupreme Courts two major restraints on courtordered desegregation            In recent years attentionhas turned away from integration and toward the issue of inequalities inschool financing  Most public schools are financed primarily by localproperty taxes Even at the same or a lower tax rate  more affluentlargely white districts can spend more per student than poorer largelyblack districts with a smaller tax base  The US Supreme Court hasdeclined opportunities to find this disparity unconstitutional but severalstate supreme courts have taken it up
