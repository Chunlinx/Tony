          okay Dee are you familiar with the Latin American policies of late   um yeah to a point its not my best subject   umhum really yeah its not mine either but uh i know i know our policy i like in Nicaragua im familiar with that  because we have um some friends that live on the Nicaraguan border and theyre theyre missionaries there and they they live there and they have to travel by boat forty five minutes to get to their car and stuff and uh i know that they helped a lot of those Sandinistas refugees coming across the border and they housed them and stuff theyve been down there about three years now and they lived its kind of weird  they have bats in their roof but the bats eat the bad spiders so they leave the bats you know so uh   yeah its a whole whole different culture um it its weird down there because   uhhuh   theres all lizards and things running around that people who live there they just they take it for granted and its like we go down there on vacation its like oh how can these people live with these lizards and like bats in their house   umhum yeah i think their policy with them that though is um i dont know i think i wish we would have just im not that up on the policy of way i know thats kind of old but i dont know i just im glad that the Sandinistas arent in power anymore because i think that they were  very wicked and uh probably some of the biggest drug dealers that the world has probably ever seen and i feel like most of the leaders in Latin America are probably you would be safe to say that they were just very very you know big into drugs   yeah their very corrupt like the Panamanians Panamanians are were very corrupt   yeah right   the thing about it is like the Panamanians is a lot of servicemen down there a lot of a lot of American servicemen are involved   umhum   because i guess there was a big big uh scam they they set all these guys up and like a dozen servicemen got caught for running a drug ring   umhum yeah um   so its its like everybody is into it its just greed human greed interestingly about about that country is in Honduras   yeah umhum   its very pro American   umhum   and we have i my girlfriend used to uh be in the Navy and she was based uh based in Panama   uhhuh   in Honduras its very um uh pro American and theres a lot of American i dont know how many American uh soldiers are there but theres a lot i mean they uh   uhhuh   uh and you cant the American government you cant trust them either because you think you dont know how corrupt they are i mean they keep people in power like the Shah of Iran and things like that i mean its the lesser of two evils theyll probably you know say this is the lesser of two evils   umhum yeah   but i dont know how corrupt the Honduran government is but the   yeah i they need to have more checks and balances in their government to  get rid of the corruption but i think first though i dont know they need to i think turn these people in the repentance on the leadership of the different nations for all their uh you know the atrocities that theyve commit and the drug dealings and in the just in the drug crimes because i feel like a lot of the leadership of those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or theyre moved from power that you know but there are so many of them that the next one to come up if you just knock one off you going to have another one and i know a lot of those nations theres uh Brazil i know is like forty percent evangelical Christian not just go to church but you know really on fire for God and theyre just surpassing America Latin America by the drugs you know its just incomprehensible and uh so i just think that i think that Gods going to honor that and that hes going to put in some good leadership and i know the president of i believe Costa Rica is a Christian and he goes to no Guatemala because he goes to Virgo Church in Guatemala City our church is in real close relationship with him and he is a former president of Guatemala hes an elder at Virgo Church and you know that that God is doing something he is raising up some leaders and the people want him back as president bad but they have a rule in Guatemala that he cant have another term so theyre the people are trying to override that i mean not just the Christians but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority the people rejoice so yeah   yeah good see thats the thing that is going to have to thats the undoing of everything is that we have no morals i mean   umhum   talk about the crime and all that in the city its just the kids have no morals thats the thing that will eventually you know if anyone is going to be saved it is having a good moral background   right umhum   um but its funny you will mention Costa Rica because i guess theyre one of the most successful and peaceful countries in Central America   umhum yeah i know   so i was reading an article in uh National Geographic and i dont know i dont think they have any more money than any of the other countries they dont have oil or anything and they dont have big tourism   umhum   so maybe it is their faith that has enabled them to keep the crime out   uhhuh i know that Costa Rica they dont allow anybody to come in that um to come in any uh what do you call what do you call immigrants they dont allow anything like that like i could not go to Costa Rica and live as an American citizen they would not permit me to move there to work they wouldnt their jobs are there for Costa Ricans they dont allow people to move in like less nations you know and take the jobs   yeah they dont they dont probably dont take a lot of refugees from other countries either   no they dont take any i mean i couldnt even go there my husband couldnt we would have to receive all this special permission to go there for even when some you know in in inner company you know transfer or something and i have another friend from uh Costa Rica that she was born there shes Costa Rican i guess i do know a little bit i went to Mexico City one time and stayed ive been there twice and stayed and that was that was just really sad but a lot of it though is their debt i think that we should not loan them anymore money that if we still want to give them money give them money quit loaning it to them youre not going to get it back dont be indebted to anybody dont be the you know loaner nor borrower and its just not good we need to if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them but quit loaning all the money out which i dont think were loaning anymore now but thats how we got into a problem if we got them we have sink them in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars that common sense you could just look at it and say theyre not going to be able to pay us back   yeah also uh uh Mexico that we will loan the money in uh a lot of the higher the higher people were just stealing it and building these beautiful homes and nice ranches and things so we are were suckers   umhum right uhhuh Lo Mas yeah yeah we we are now its like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them you dont loan money to people like that i mean if you feel like you need to give them something to help them out fine but you dont go making billions of dollars of loans in to people that you can just look at the situation and yeah and know that they are not going to be capable of paying us back and   they know theyre not going to pay it back   that puts a bondage on them it makes you know pressure on the nation and on the people on the leadership and makes their inflation go up and its just a big mess so   you did you go to Mexico City uh anywhere near when the earthquake hit   no but i knew people i was there before that but i knew people i got a letter from a friend of mine that i had met there that who who the apartment building was destroyed and they were living in a tent so its kind of weird you know because these were people he was on the US dive the Mexican diving Olympic pool hed go watch them dive and all this so they were you know just normal people werent squatters or poor people or anything that um i did i knew all of my friends there but none of them that i know of got killed in it but um theyre all Christians though  God really protected them see that broke out a revival in Mexico City that CBS new s and ABC never told you about theres been a real revival in Mexico City since that earthquake because theres a lot of man theres a lot of sin in those nations and a lot lots of witchcraft a lot of witchcraft a whole lot of witchcraft   oh i could imagine   so a lot of it in the name of Christianity   oh really   so you know oh yeah theres a lot you know they call themselves Christians but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff and just a whole the lot of it generational things too like the Mayans and the Incas you cant find a trace of them because God totally destroyed them for how wicked they were and yet theyre revered and honored and almost worshipped by so many people even now in America you know everyones all intrigued with all of these Indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth because of how wicked they were ive been down to the pyramids and ive climbed to the top of the pyramid of the sun where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy and then hold it up to the sun God and thats pretty heavy duty you know   yeah is is there still blood stains on the altar or has it worn away all through the years   i dont think there are the little box is black on the top of the pyramid of the sun its black so yeah you cant really tell but it is kind of weird you know you think wow there is where they did human sacrifices to false Gods and   is it do you get spooked you feel or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there because   um at that time i kind of did it was a very oppressed eerie just you know feeling but i wasnt a Christian when i went there but uh i think that all those those you know generational things i think that God did im praying you know that keeps the Christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray because that does affect that things you know those in your background
