has been from people in the mainstream media who wereclearly part of the system I was writing about and thus respondedaccordingly Because                   Slate                and Jacob Weisberg dont in any wayfall into that category and deserve to be taken seriously I thought I shouldtry to respond seriously to some of the factual stuff Ill let readers decidefor themselves if the magazine is boring a knock that reminds me of lawyerswishful thinking when I started the American Lawyer             First I didnt leak thepiece to the New York Times a semiimportant point for a magazine likeours We blast faxed the piece to every major and minor I think pressorganization after first faxing it to Kenneth Starr Everybody got it at thesame time So the Times  decision to put it on the front page was notbased on having any kind of exclusive            Now to take Jacobs pointsin order            l Whether I prove Starrleaked grand jury information depends on ones definition of grand juryinformation I used the one used by the relevant court with jurisdiction Starrdisagrees with that No mistakes How about the stained dress Or the presidenttestifying that he never was alone with Lewinsky I never say the Timesmade mistakes by the way             Yes Sue Schmidt disputesthat quote That happens with reporters a lot But interestingly she didntdispute it the first time she was asked about the storyby Howie Kurtz for hisfirst story My notes have her saying exactly that and then saying it againlater on in our interview at the Madison Hotel coffee shop in almost the samelanguage             No selfcontradictionhere She volunteered that item about Jordan and where she had got the story inthe course of narrating that first weekend of the scandal When I later askedher directly about sources for her firstday story and stories beyond thatshe declined to comment             My point was thatLewinskys No answer was the thing that stood out the most to Mike Isikoffwhen I talked with him about the tapes And its a big part of whyNewsweek held the story I simply pointed out that this is somethingNewsweek might have remembered to put in and quote when it went onlinewith its first story In retrospect though it would have been fairer andfuller to note that Newsweek did indeed say the evidence was not atall clear that the president had instructed her to lie Nonetheless I thinkNewsweek should have included this important quote if it had wanted tobe fair             To take one examplelets look at the firstday reports from the networks            What did I know a Starrstop deputy had spent much of the day briefing these people Starr told methat and Bennett confirmed it but would not tell me specifics b The networkreports included material from tapes that could only be the tapes that Starrspeople had made because these tapes allegedly have Lewinsky saying that Jordanand the president told her to liewhich was not on the tapes Newsweekheard and Newsweek had supposedly heard the most incriminating tapesNeither Tripps lawyers nor anyone else even Tripp though she might obviouslyremember what was on thembut she was not accessible to the press at thispoint could have heard those tapes or briefed reporters about them So I dontthink its intellectually dishonest to say that this information must havecome from Starrs office Remember He says his guy briefed them for thesereports and the crux of the reports was what was supposedly on thesetapes            By the way this criticismis kind of refreshing in the sense that its so different from the everyoneknows prosecutors leak criticism that Ive got             Jacob is just plainwrong There are no court decisions in the relevant jurisdiction that supportStarr on the notion that leaking what people tell investigators before theytestify about what they will testify to is OK Sure there are some from othercourts elsewhere but they are few and far between and Starr really wouldntbe able to cite them properly in a brief in the District of Columbia             Oops forget my lastparagraph under Point              My point about anonymousquotes is made by Jacob Im against totally blind uses of phrases such assources that dont say how many sources or what ax they might have to grindExample Jackie Judds citing of several sources to substantiate herwitnessesinterruptedthepresidentandLewinsky scoop When a source cantbe named enough identification should be supplied so that the reader knows thesources potential bias This clearly worked here Jacob can see that Im usinga Times person as the source and correctly identifies the potentialbias Now go back and read my description of all the truly blind sources inthe article and see if you can tell the difference             Conflict Yes I shouldhave disclosed that in  I gave  bucks to the Clinton campaign Ivealso given money to Republicans like Rudy But how could I prohibit anyoneeven myself retroactively from making contributions That was  this is and since I sent out the initial direct mail for this magazine which Iknew would cover political stuff and politicians I havent made anycontributions to anyone let alone the president to whom again I made onecontribution in  The only political writing or editing I did around thetime of that Clinton contribution was the Paula Jones piece by Stuart Taylor inthe American Lawyer  which I instigated and edited and proudlypublishedand which as you know made the case against the president            Im proudof our magazine and proud of this piece Prouder in fact now than when wepublished it because nearly two weeks later everyone who could take a shot atit has and so far I can see that Ive misspelled one name screwed up onesequence the Journal decided not to wait for comment from the WhiteHouse on its incorrect stewardwitness story after hearing the WhiteHouse wanted a halfhour to comment not before and included two or threegratuitous adjectives that I now wouldnt There may be more and if there is Iwill be the first to concede it But I hope my willingness to admit mistakesisnt misread as being so much more fallible than othersbut only being morewilling to admit it             Steve BrillBrillsContent New York City                                             JacobWeisberg responds I appreciate the tone of Brills letter which is nicerthan my piece was Several of his points however demand a reply                                       a My criticism standsThe only thing thats clearly illegal is leaking out of the grand jury roomBrill doesnt prove that Starr has done that                                       b I didnt say therewere no mistakes I wrote that Brill didnt document any significant error offact by the Post  Times  Time  or Newsweek  Hedoesnt                                        If Brill used a taperecorder wed know whether he misquoted Susan Schmidt or not He doesntrespond to the complaint that he misquoted Jonah Goldberg                                        Still a contradictionin the article It would have been consistent if Brill had written that Schmidtdeclined comment on her sources except for the one she revealed                                        This is now a point ofsupernuance not a major criticism of Newsweek s journalistic integritywhich was how it was billed in the story                                        I strongly suspectthat Starr was the source for stories about what various witnesses have saidBut theres at least a plausible alternative explanation for where much of thisinformation could have come from As I say it would have been only fair tomention it                                        This whole argumentabout the relevant jurisdiction is new since Brills article Eventually thequestion of whats illegal is likely to be settled by the Supreme Court whichwill consider lower court precedents from various jurisdictions

President Clinton plugged into the machinery the moment he waselected            Examples include theuniversal use of accepted terms such as extreme right to describe any givenidea that emanates from

dogopposition to any and all school reform that does not result in massive amountsof additional money for the teachers unions And so on and so on            The lefthas for years started opposing

illconsidered and decidedly anecdotal            It is certainly true thatthe United States is the most powerful country in the world It is also truethat its erstwhile rival has collapsed rather utterly However even the merestglance at the history books will reveal that Talbotts dominatebutcooperatescenario has been played out over hundreds of years The wars were always theexceptions It is also worth pointing out that the United States has actuallydeclined in relative economic importance since World War II            In  the United Stateswas responsible for nearly half the gross world product However today eventhough the United States is far and away the No  economy the European Unionwith its  member states actually has a bigger share of the gross worldproduct Never mind Japan and Asia who arent exactly inconsequential Thentheres the rest of the world            It seemsto me that the world as a whole is an awful lot more interdependent than itever has been And I think thats a

Atul GawandesManning the Hospital Barricades with interest I understand hispremise that we should get along but my comments as a meddie will be muchmore parochial            I agree that surgeonsgenerally work very hard The question of whether a lot of what they do isreally necessary or appropriate is debatable as it is for all specialtiesThe virtue and responsibility aspect are more problematic There is thecommon ritual of medical clearance for surgery where the meddie basicallyblesses the operation and is allowed to share responsibility despite the factthat the note is rarely read and the recommendations are often ignored            A less than virtuous practicethat is not unheard of is to hustle the patient of a failing operation out ofthe OR to avoid dying on the table
