               okay   do i recycle cans thats about it   uhhuh aluminum cans   yeah my son   do you recycle newspapers or anything   no because theres no really place i think if they had more visible places for you to drop stuff   umhum   people would do it more instead of trying you know its because its hard its bad enough you got to save the stuff but then you got to go find somewhere to put it if they   i think they would right how about glass jars those are recyclable but   none of it  i mean see at at work all i do is paper and trash and cans   huh   and then at home i just save cans because i i know where that is thats like on the way to work but i dont know where the paper and the the bottles and all that stuff is but i think if like apartment complexes   uhhuh honey im on the phone long distance   how   had to yell at my kids had to yell at my kids   how many kids you got   well i have four   oh   and we try and recycle my husband is in the packaging business and um they use recycled newspapers shredded up   uhhuh   for the filler for uh its a pad that they put on top top of apples boxed apples when they ship apples and it absorbs some of the you know the when the apples get the shipping you know   uh yeah oh i know yeah my husband my husband hauls apples   oh he does for what company what trucking company   umhum uh hes independent he hauls them for anybody   oh thats great well he may have some of our apples then probably Washingtons a very big apple growing   yep   place especially Yakima youll have to look for Yakima Washington on some of the box labels and CVC Weyerhaeuser thats us   yep   uhhuh   thats us well so they have a recycling actually they its called Central Washington Recycling and they have a a whole center and they have it set up like a circus   yeah   where you know the green glass goes in this clowns mouth and the tin cans go up to the alligator and and so we uh we dont recycle as much as we should but we do recycle newspapers and cans and bottles   yeah i think if they would if they would have it more where you can get it   right   get to it you know like in different places like apartment complexes they got trash cans why not put the dumpsters for different things and uh and and that way people would find it better   right right i think thatd be a great idea were gonna right right   but if you cant find it   i would like to see them i would   whos gonna save it you know because after a while you get tired of saving newspapers i mean   yes you do you sure do in fact i put mine in my garage and im sick of them but   umhum   we take them my little girl she gets a collect the money you know since she has to haul them down there every day so i let her keep the money um i was thinking the other day about um   uhhuh   plastic gloves that the dentists and doctors and everybody has to wear now thatd be wonderful if they could recycle those you know as it is now they cant   yeah yeah but see those are they cant   well i think theyre nonrecyclable   yeah i think because of the the disease and all that going around they dont know you know theyre theyre calling them uh like what do you call it contaminated yeah   right contaminated is what they are you know they but that you know plastic just doesnt disintegrate   huhuh   and that thats major thing i mean how many pairs of gloves they go through in a day   they use pair of gloves for every patient they see   right and im just thinking about the orthodontist where i take my child you know for his braces   they use gloves for everybody i mean the the nurse you the the dentist his assistant everybody in there has on gloves and and then   yeah yep yep everybody yep well its too bad that they have to but be nice if those somehow could be recycled   uhhuh   you know thatd be better for everybody   yep but they dont recycle those so   and then the baby diapers you know i dont have anybody in diapers any more but gosh i used my share of disposable diapers   now i didnt use those i had a a diaper service   yeah well thats good   in the service because i couldnt my son was allergic to something in the plastic   oh yep   so i had  so it wasnt by choice   yeah but thats   that i couldnt use them its just he couldnt wear them for some reason i dont know what it was   uhhuh yeah i used them with my last two uhhuh   but he couldnt wear them because of the something was he was allergic to something   uhhuh   so i had to put regular diapers on him boy that was a you know for a while i had the service but then you know after i didnt have it the whole time but the first i think the first     yeah yeah it gets really expensive yeah but see i think if people go back to cloth diapers thats better for recycling i mean thats better for the environment   yeah because you can always you just wash those you know so   sure well i see in the future i see people uh being more conscious of were gonna be forced to recycle   yeah   you know i see even plastic shopping bags theres you can return those and our grocery bags our paper grocery bags has a five cent refund on them if you bring them back to the store do yours there   you can return those uhhuh   oh they do oh thats oh   no huhuh if they did that i would take them back all the time because i go to the same store all the time   well see and i always forget and you know with four kids and you know six people in this family our grocery bills pretty high and you know i get you know thirty or more than that yeah i get fifty   yeah but i think if theyd do it more with the with the money like a nickel or penny even though people think its not enough but if you have enough   yep   uh people dont understand a quarters a quarter it doesnt matter   thats right   you you know my son could take a quarter and go buy him a candy bar or something but i   you bet oh yeah
