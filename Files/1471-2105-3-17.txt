                    Background        The complete sequencing of several genomes including        that of the human has signaled the beginning of a new era        in which scientists are becoming increasingly interested in        functional genomics that is uncovering both the        functional roles of different genes and how these genes        interact with andor influence each other Increasingly        this question is being addressed through the simultaneous        analysis of hundreds to thousands of unique genetic        elements with microarrays Already analytical strategies        have subdivided into distinct omic domains such as        genomics proteomics and metabolomics This enables        researchers to examine not only genetic elements but also        the corresponding proteins and metabolites derived from        these genes All omic technologies share the need for        fresh innovative looks at data analysis To date        transcriptomics is the most widely studied molecular        approach enabling researchers to examine subtle        differences in thousands of mRNA levels between        experimental samples medical biopsies         etc  Although mRNA is not the end        product of a gene the transcription of a gene is both        critical and highly regulated thereby providing an ideal        point of investigation      Development of microarrays        has permitted global measurement of gene expression at the        transcript level and provided a glimpse into the        coordinated control and interactions between genes        Presently two technologies dominate the field of        highdensity microarrays cDNA arrays and oligonucleotide        arrays The cDNA array has a long history of development           stemming from immunodiagnostic work in the s        however it has been most widely developed in recent years        by Stanford University California researchers depositing        cDNA tags onto glass slides or chips with precise robotic        printers     Labeled cDNA fragments are then hybridized        to the tags on the chip scanned and differences in mRNA        between samples identified and visualized using a variation        of the redgreen matrix originally introduced by Eisen and        colleagues     The lightgenerated oligonucleotide        array developed by Affymetrix Inc Santa Clara CA        involves synthesizing short mer oligonucleotide probes        directly onto a glass slide using photolithographic masks             Sample processing includes the production of        labeled cRNA hybridization to a microarray and        quantification of the obtained signal after laser scanning        Regardless of the array used the output can be readily        transferred to commercially available data analysis        programs for the selection and clustering of significantly        modified genes        Differentially expressed genes will be defined herein as        gene data determined to be statistical outliers from some        standard state and which can not be ascribed to chance or        natural variabilty Various creative techniques have been        proposed and implemented for the selection of        differentially expressed genes however none have yet        gained widespread acceptance for microarray analysis        Despite this there remains a great impulse to develop new        data analysis techniques partly driven by the obvious need        to move beyond setting simple fold change cutoffs which        are out of context with the rest of the experimental and        biological data at hand        This has been the        case for many studies where the selection of differential        gene expression is performed through a simple fold change        cutoff typically between  and  There is an        inherent problem with this selection criterion as genes of        low absolute expression have a greater inherent error in        their measured levels These genes will then tend to        numerically meet any given fold change cutoff even if the        gene is not truly differentially expressed The inverse        also holds true where highly expressed genes having less        error in their measured levels may not meet an arbitrary        foldchange cutoff of  even when they are truly        differentially expressed     Therefore selecting        differentially regulated genes based only on a single fold        change across the entire range of experimental data        preferentially selects lowly expressed genes     This        commonly used approach does not accommodate for background        noise variability nonspecific binding or low copy        numbers characteristics typical of microarray data which        may not be homogeneously distributed Other approaches        entail the use of standard statistical measures such as a        students         t test or ANOVA for every individual        gene However due to the cost of repeating microarray        experiments the number of replicates usually remains low        leading to inaccurate estimates of variance            Furthermore due to the low number of replicates the power        of these genebygene statistical tests to differentiate        between regulated and nonregulated genes also remains very        low        The present article describes a model that considers        both expression levels and fold changes for the        identification of significant differentially expressed        genes This simple model allows the experimenter to        estimate the relationship between these two parameters in        the absence of large numbers of experimental replicates        where the inherent error of measures cannot be accurately        estimated Subsequently gene transcripts determined to be        outliers from the trend can be considered differentially        expressed genes An added strength to the model lies in its        ease of application to any data set This model should be        considered a progressive and cyclical process where the        data analyst can quickly and globally identify a list of        potentially differentially regulated genes with confidence        based on the inherent qualities of the data set under        evaluation        The model presented herein was developed with a data set        from a nutritional experiment in a mouse model using        Affymetrix MuK chips where the effects of four diets        were compared in a number of organs pool of five mice for        each sample in each organ  control diet A in duplicate        from the same pool  diet B  diet C and  diet D        Details of the dietary treatments will be reported        elsewhere The present article will take only the data from        the liver as an example for the development of a gene        selection model The model was validated by realtime        polymerase chain reaction RTPCR and indicates good        concordance between the two experimental techniques                    Results and Discussion                  Selection of differentially regulated genes and          data analysis          The method developed herein includes A          determination of the upper X of highest fold changes          within narrow bins of absolute expression levels in order          to generate a limit fold change LFC function and B          subsequent ranking of genes by a combined fold          changeabsolute expression calculation The following          discussions describe the development of the model within          the context of our nutritional study however a generic          protocol can be found in the Materials and Methods          section                          A Selection of the upper X of highest fold          changes within binned absolute expression levels          The principal parameter for gene expression data          stemming from a typical Affymetrix experiment is the          average difference intensity ADI which is a          representation of the absolute expression of a gene As          indicated in the literature it is common practice to          establish a minimal expression threshold below which data          are considered to be noise In the case of Affymetrix          data it is often necessary to discard minimal and          negative ADIs as these data are both biologically and          mathematically difficult to interpret          A number of previous reports have used an ADI          threshold            A                       t             value of  in the standard Affymetrix range                           ie probe sets with ADIs of less          than  would either be rejected or set to  as          meaningful differences in gene expression can purportedly          be evaluated above this level Although empirically          supported an           A                       t            of  is essentially an arbitrary selection and not          all groups select the same threshold value The exact          setting of this lower           A                       t            is not inherent to the LFC modeling process and the          reader is encouraged to set the           A                       t            value based on additional criteria such as that          previously published by Gerhold           et al     and Dieckgraefe           et al      However an           A                       t            of  will be used in the present work for which          the selection of differentially expressed genes in the          context of ADI dependent variance is the central focus          Therefore all ADIs less than  were set to  and any          probe set with a value of  across all dietary          treatments were discarded After eliminating the probe          sets which met these criteria there remained  genes          out of the original  genes represented on the MuK          GeneChip          An additional parameter highest fold change HFC          was then applied to these remaining genes HFC is defined          as                    where A B C and D represent the individual          microarray results for each gene The HFC is inherently a          ratio metric of the maximum change in measured gene          expression between any combination of experimental          treatments The present experiment has four dietary          conditions with microarray data however it should be          noted that the HFC equation could be expanded to any          number of conditions or experimental treatments          The determination of HFC is highly influenced by          absolute expression and trends can be readily observed          in our data set where HFC is negatively correlated with          absolute expression Figure a For example with          absolute expression values greater than  it is of low          probability to observe an HFC greater than  However          with absolute expression values near  an HFC of          greater than  is readily seen Although not shown in          Figure a this trend could be observed for any pair or          triplet of experimental comparison in the current data          set           ie AB AC AD BC BD ABC BCD          It has also been observed across multiple experiments          examined in our laboratory data not shown This          consistancy can be explained by the fact that there are          very few genes out of the entire transcriptome which are          differentially expressed due to treatment Therefore          most measured gene transcripts display a typical          coefficient of variation independent of treatment The          few genes which are differentially expressed do not          unduly affect the overall trend Therefore the trend          lends itself to characterization and may be used as a          metric for determining differential gene expression          across multiple experiments          This empirically implies that natural variation          expressed here as HFC tends to be much greater at low          expression levels This concept is supported in the          literature    and questions the appropriateness of          using a linear fold change cutoff in a system          characterized by heterogenous variance          As stated previously the selection of differentially          expressed genes is essentially a search for outliers           ie gene data lying outside some          standard distribution of differences relative to a          control state and which cannot be ascribed to chance or          natural variabilty To determine those genes which are          outliers it is necessary to measure either the          variability of the system or to make valid assumptions          regarding the distribution of variability In the present          model we assume that  as mentioned above variability          in the measurement of gene expression is related to the          ADI and  if a broad sampling of the transcriptome is          measured only a small number of genes will actually be          outliers even in the harshest of experimental conditions          Assumption  is a fairly general analytical concept           ie the closer data is to the          measurement threshold the higher the variability is in          that measurement      Assumption  appears to be          empiricaly valid when surveying the literature for          highdensity microarray experiments which evaluate severe          biological events from caloric restriction     to          apoptosis      In these experiments                 regardless of the gene selection method used less          than  of the total number of genes probed were          differentially regulated Therefore to develop the          present model of gene selection the validity of          selecting outliers was evaluated for a range of highly          variable genes using the top  as a benchmark Model          trends were then examined from  to           The model was developed by first binning gene          expression data into tight classes across the entire          range of absolute expression values where genes with an          equal absolute expression value were randomly ordered          and then selecting the upper  of HFC values for further          consideration Binning was carried out to divide the          entire range of absolute expression values into bins          containing an equal number           m  of genes where           m   Therefore bin widths          ADI were not necessarily equal yet the number of genes          contained in each bin was equivalent For the first round          of analysis the upper  or  thpercentile of HFC          genes in each bin were selected for further consideration          Figure a It was possible to search separately for the           of genes with the greatest HFCs in each class          however in order to simplify the overall selection we          plotted the relationship between absolute expression          defined as min ADI ABCD and HFC in order to set          the LFC function Herein the min ADI ABCD will          simply be referred to as min ADI This relationship was          then modeled using a simple equation of the form           LFC  a  bmin ADI  which is          fitted to the  thpercentile of each bin Figure a to          produce the LFC curve that best models the expression          data This modeled LFC curve  LFC model             min ADI fit the data well R   and further          analysis indicated the residuals were randomly          distributed data not shown The equation for the line          of best fit contains two parameters that have various          repercussions on gene selection both of which can be          defined in commercially available software using common          solve functions            eg  Microsoft Excel First           a sets the asymptote which          corresponds to the minimum HFC value that can be observed          at any given ADI Second           b raiseslowers the limit function          at a given ADI and is therefore highly influenced by          this latter value For example the smaller the ADI the          greater the LFC and vice versa Figure bshows that as          the selection criteria becomes more strict top             of genes the curve shifts  LFC model             min ADI and becomes more restrictive in the          selection of differential genes           ie at any given absolute          expression level a higher fold change must be observed          for a gene to be considered differentially expressed The          opposite is true when the selection criteria becomes less          strict top    of genes where the curve shifts           LFC model    min ADI and results in a          more permissive selection of differential genes          Using the aforementioned equations the selection of          genes for further consideration becomes simple and          global            ie across the entire range of          expression levels where a gene is selected with the HFC          approach if max ADImin ADI  abmin ADI After          applying the  LFC gene filter  genes remained in          the list out of the  candidate genes selected from          the original  genes on the GeneChip When interested          in the top  and  of significant genes the total          number of genes that meet the LFC requirements is  and           respectively          Lastly it should be noted that the LFC           ie the modeled trend of HFC vs          min ADI is based on binned data of hundreds of genes          across multiple conditions leading to a highly powerful          characterization of a given threshold In other words          there is a large amount of data available in order to          accurately characterize the trend The same argument          holds for the generation of a modeled confidence interval          based on low numbers of replicates as will be described          below This is in contrast to the relatively low          statistical power of conventional genebygene tests          such as the           t test or ANOVA often used for          the selection of differentially expressed genes                                       B Assignment of gene rank          Following gene selection a rank of importance or          interest level was assigned to each selected gene It          should be noted that the LFC is not dependent on the rank          calculation rather rank simply lends relative          importance to selected genes by incorporating both the          magnitude of fold change and absolute expression values          The rank number RN for each gene was determined by          first calculating a rank value RV which can be defined          as RV  HFC  max ADI  min ADI After calculation of          RV gene lists were sorted and then assigned a simple RN          of  where a gene with a RN of  corresponds to          the gene with the highest RV The RV is an arbitrary          value that simply lends importance to selected genes with          both high fold changes and high differences in absolute          expression Both RV and RN aid in the discussion of          differential gene effects by adding the concept of          relative weight or importance amongst selected genes          This concept aids in the choice of genes for validation          or followup studies as detailed below                          C Model validation                      Validation of the LFC model via characterization            of measurement variability            Hess and colleagues have recently examined the            concept that variability and absolute expression are            related however they examined only the variability of            replicate spots on a single slide     Herein we            extended this concept to examine the variability            between genes on different microarrays Measurement            variance was examined following the development of the            LFC model and was therefore used simply as a            confirmation of this model To further understand the            nature of measurement variability within the current            study duplicate MuK Affymetrix microarrays for the            controls were examined see Materials and Methods            section A pooled RNA sample from mice              n   fed the control diet was            hybridized to two different chips and the data was            analyzed to characterize measurement variability It            was apparent from the trend that as absolute expression            levels ADI increase the coefficient of variation            CV SDMAE decreases The trendline was calculated as            detailed in the Materials and Methods section This            trendline was overlayed on the entire data set in            addition to the  LFC selected data shown in red in            Figure c By overlaying the trendline of the within            variability data on those genes determined to be            significantly regulated by the LFC model the CV upper            confidence limit for these selected genes had a             p value   Thus the             LFCselected data lies outside the  confidence            interval surrounding measurement variability            reinforcing the validity of the results                                Realtime polymerase chain reaction            RTPCR            The results obtained from a microarray experiment            are influenced by each step in the experimental            procedure from array manufacturing to sample            preparation and application to image analysis                The preparation of the cRNA sample is highly correlated            to the efficiency of the reverse transcription step            where reagents and enzymes alike can influence the            reaction outcome These factors affect the            representation of transcripts in the cRNA sample            necessitating the need for validations by complementary            techniques Analyses by northern blot and RNAse            protection assays are commonly reported however the            emerging goldstandard validation technique is RTPCR                Microarrays tend to have a low dynamic range            which can lead to small yet significant            underrepresentations of fold changes in gene            expression     As RTPCR has a greater dynamic            range it is often used to validate the observed trends            rather than duplicate the fold changes obtained by chip            experiments                  Having chosen genes that lie across the range of RN            and therefore the range of model selection criteria            RTPCR was performed in triplicate for each            experimental condition Diet ABCD using the same            pooled stocks of liver RNA  mice per experiment            Genes were compared to the endogenous controls actin            and GAPDH which did not significantly change across            the dietary treatments As determined by our LFC            selection model the GeneChip microarrays indicated no            significant differences amongst the  diets for either            GAPDH or actin Subsequent confirmation that both            GAPDH and actin did not change was provided by            RTPCR where a simple students             t test with a predefined nominal             level of  indicated no significant differences            between the experimental diets BCD and the control            diet A RTPCR provided a means to confirm the effects            of the  dietary treatments on  genes Table  and            the concordance between these  microarray and RTPCR            results was examined Perfect concordance was not to be            expected due to the inherent differences in sensitivity            and dynamic range between the two techniques However            a good overall concordance of  for differential            gene expression was observed             ie the fold change for a given            gene seen by microarray was directionally consistent            with that seen by RTPCR regardless whether the            results were significant by either the  LFC model            for microarray data or a students Ttest for RTPCR            data When examining only those genes considered            significantly changed by RTPCR    starred            values in Table  concordance increases to             Therefore the value of  indicates the overall            concordance between significantly changed genes seen by            RTPCR and those microarray pairwise comparisons            treatment vs control that meet the LFC model            criteria  values in Table             What is noticeable through the color scheme Table             is genes with high RN low RV have relatively less            concordance between the two techniques where red            indicates no concordance and blue indicates only one or            two out of three of the results agreed However the            majority of genes are colored in green indicating            perfect directional concordance When specifically            examining fatty acid synthase FAS a highly expressed            gene microarray fold changes of less than  can be            corroborated between the two experimental techniques            reinforcing the strength of this fold change model            Furthermore it is clear from the RTPCR data that at            very low expression levels high fold changes are still            problematic to verify and remain questionable The            present model takes this into account by raising the            criteria appropriately at the low expression range             ie a higher fold change at low            expression levels is required for a gene to be            considered differentially expressed            As the selection criteria with microarray data was            that the HFC must be greater than the LFC model limits            the expectation was that the LFC function could be            validated by RTPCR underlined values in Table            indicate HFC for each gene This is predominantly the            case across the full dynamic range of data selected by            the model     concordance except for very            lowly expressed genes such as the RAS oncogene For            genes with a slightly lower RN higher RV such as            ABC member  some concordance is seen indicating            confidence is gaining as RV increases For genes with            an RN lower than  RV               eg USF concordance quickly            approaches  indicating high confidence when            discussing gene trends or individual gene results            These results reinforce the concept that RN is            correlated with confidence and validity when discussing            the gene set produced by the LFC model            Interestingly one might expect that genes with an            RN lower then  would be concentrated only at higher            expression levels however when the spread of genes            with an RN between  were examined these genes            were found to lie across the entire range of absolute            expressions data not shown This indicates that a             LFC model is confidently selecting differentially            regulated genes across the full range of absolute            expression Therefore the  LFC model appears to be            an appropriate selection criteria for the present            experimental data set however the fold change            percentage could easily be varied to meet other            acceptable levels of risk as is done with conventional            hypothesis testing              eg              p  and  values The X            selection criteria should then be reevaluated for            other experimental data sets in relation to the            variance and validation data at hand                                      Conclusions        The analysis of microarray data is a developing field of        study aimed at enabling the biomedical community to cope        with the waves of large microarray data sets Already an        evolution can be observed with respect to the methods for        selecting significantly changed genes Researchers are        moving away from simple fold change cutoffs and        incorporating the use of robust statistical concepts The        conclusion that highly expressed genes will rarely have a        fold change in mRNA levels and that lowly expressed genes        will commonly have a greater than fold change led to the        development of a model that would accommodate for this real        biological characteristic of gene expression measurements        The fold change model presented in this paper considers        both the absolute expression level and fold change of every        gene across the entire range of observed absolute        expressions In addition the concept of increased        variation in lowly expressed genes is incorporated into the        selection model through the higher fold change requirements        for differential gene selection at low expression levels        Following gene selection using an initial criterion of X        gene rank was introduced as a basis for choosing genes to        validate the model Therefore a limited but judicious        choice of model parameters to select genes across a broad        range of gene rank can then be used to reset the X in        order to correspond with the data at hand Figure  The        variance data characterizing measurement variability        supports the selection model indicating that selected        genes lie outside measurement variability at very high        confidence limits   CL Further validation of        this model in the current data set by RTPCR confirmed        these relationships reinforcing that genes with fold        changes even less than  can be measured assuming        adequate absolute expression levels This demonstrates that        biological changes in sample concentration of mRNA even at        low fold change levels can be confidently determined        In summary the X LFC model enables one to define        experiment specific selection stringency while maintaining        simplicity and ensuring global coverage for the detection        of differential gene selection                    Materials and Methods                  Mice and feeding conditions

All values below an ADI threshold              A                           t               are set to             A                           t                           If the values for gene

expression value for gene             k is defined as             min              Z                         k                Z                           kp                           The highest fold

change one            obtains a data distribution similar to that of Figure            a                                 Modeling a discrete limit fold change            model            The goal is to select the upper X of genes with            highest fold change across the entire range of            expression levels Therefore the following rules are            applied             Genes are ordered according to their absolute            expression value             min              Z                         k                Z                           kp               where equally expressed genes are randomly            ordered             The overall expression range is divided into bins            of different width but containing an equal number             m of genes             In each bin the Xpercentile fold change            corresponding to a fold change that is exceeded by X            of genes in the bin is determined For X between             and              m   appears to be            suitable            When visualizing the Xpercentile fold change in            each bin one obtains a data distribution similar to            that seen in Figure a                                 Modeling a continuous limit fold change LFC            model            A continuous model is derived from the discrete one            by relating the mean expressions of each bin with the            corresponding Xlimit fold change using a least            squares fit of the equation            XLFC              a              b Z minimum expression            This equation appears to fit the data very well and            the interpretation of the parameters              a and             b  is straightforward             Parameter             a represents the asymptote of the            curve For very large expressions the              X limit fold change tends to be            equal to parameter             a              Parameter             b is proportional to the            difference between the Xlimit fold change of small            and high expressions            When visualizing this continuous limit fold change            model one obtains a curve similar to that observed in            Figure a In addition increasing the Xpercentile            fold change shifts the curve up the             y axis and results in an            increased stringency for gene selection             ie fewer genes meet the LFC            requirement Figure b                                Validation by Coefficient of Variance            For experiments that are performed without            replicates the LFCmodel selects genes with the            highest betweentreatment variability previously            defined as fold change at any expression level If            replicates are available the inherent error of            measures the withintreatment variability can be            estimated Therefore it becomes possible to select the            genes with the highest ratio of            betweentreatmentvariability             withintreatmentvariability            In the data set that was used for illustrating the            development of the LFCmodel duplicate measures were            available for one of the four treatments The            withintreatmentvariability appears to be highly            dependent of the expression level of the gene            confirming the findings of Hess             et al                In order to estimate the CV without taking into            account extreme values of the duplicate we used a            robust estimator represented by the following            equation                        where the                            inverse              function returns the inverse of the onetailed            probability of the squared distribution            Applying the CV derived from replicate sample data                         eqn   to the quadruplicate            diet data enabled the calculation of the CV upper            confidence level by bins of absolute expression level            using the following equation                        where the                            inverse              function returns the inverse of the onetailed            probability of the squared distribution                        Eqn  allows one to identify            genes with a variance above measurement variability            This greater variability arose due to combined pool            biological and treatment variabilities            This confidence level could be raised or lowered            according to the level of confidence desired by            altering the             p value Therefore modeling the            variance data provides a complimentary method for            examining the variation of genes across the complete            range of absolute expression values            The upper  confidence limit CL of a robust            estimation of the coefficient of variance CV for            replicates withintreatment variability has been            modeled as a function of absolute minimum expression of            all treatments using the following model            Upper  CL              c              d mean expression            The selected genes are now those for which the CV of            treatment expressions betweentreatment variability            is larger than this limit Figure c By overlapping            those genes selected by the LFC model red dots on the            graph indicating the  CL blue line one observes            that the LFC model is considerably more restrictive            when selecting lowly expressed genes Figure c                                Validation by realtime PCR RTPCR            A subset of differentially expressed genes were            selected to confirm the LFC model where genes were            selected across the range of absolute expressions and            with varying fold changes Although not
