        well we dont do much eating out   oh well we wonder how these topics get chosen where was the last place you went out to eat   uh Bennys   well last place we went was uh       uh oh we went to uh Popeyes uh Fried Chicken well actually it was a drive through   yeah well uh ours usually consists of McDonalds ive got two young kids and they love McDonalds   well our our kids are a little older actually we got a a seventeen year old and a and a fourteen year old but but we still wind up i still i like fast food reasonably well   yeah well uh i know it put on some weight for us so we stayed away them or tried to but i love to take the kids they say uh what do you look for to bring them uh to look at to uh come back to   yeah   i was talking to my husband while i was listening to they was trying to find a call and uh i said its the toy uh uh the play yard out in the front yard you know that McDonalds has     well how old are your kids   four and two   oh so they really like that sort of stuff then   yeah they theyd rather go out there and play in the yard than eat   i can remember many times that when when its interesting though that that you know particularly when youre traveling and you go some place you can stop at a McDonalds thats thats a big playground uh when the kids you know when the kids really need to get out and run around after been driving a while   yeah well weve took a we was living out in Memphis and we used to drive back and forth to Louisville thats where we usually from Louisville Kentucky and uh you know wed stop at the fast foods there uh usually i like to go just to get the kids out have them in a confined space where i can uh sit down and relax and be able to watch them too   yeah that that thats really nice that they started doing that because its the problem is you take them to some place nice and and you know the um even a place where they have to to sit down even if they really get kids they get they get bored in a hurry   yeah   and uh yeah you know we now that were a little older we can go to i i still like um i like buffets   yeah they got a couple all you can eat down here and uh we havent went to them yet but ive been threatening my husband that well go   yeah well have you been in the area very long   no weve only well weve been in Texas for two years little a little under two years   oh   so uh not really i dont know it too well   you say you in Denison oh okay so we were i was in Sherman um   yes   hum last month of the i took a i sponsored a youth group up there and uh it was funny we went to a uh oh we must have had thirty of us and we went into a Pizza Hut and you wander into a Pizza Hut with that kind of crowd and they sort of hate to see you coming so theyre they get the business but with a crowd of people its uh it it it was kind of funny and we went in first and then it was so crowded and we went and im trying to think its right off anyway i dont know if its Pizza Hut or Pizza Inn anyway we went to another one and and uh they the rates there are fairly reasonable but uh you know even those places are starting to have you know video games and things for kids to your kids play video games   oh my son does he hes the four year old ive got a Nintendo that he plays with   oh well that gives him something to amuse him while there uh   yeah yeah well he likes those crane games you know where you try to win a toy   yeah   he likes every time we pass one he wants me to win him a toy   well do you have do you have any like Chucky Cheese or trying to   well i remember Chucky Cheeses was down in Lewisville uh i havent seen one here   well they got one um in Richardson probably me i try and think there there theres a couple of those that they combined and its a combination pizza parlor and all kinds of   in a game room and toy room yeah   and yeah and and they have the room full of balls and   yeah Show Biz Pizza   yeah yeah Show Biz thats the name of it   thats what it is Show Biz yeah uh   well do you like the pizza at Show Biz   yeah its alright uh i havent seen one down here i think where there was one in in Memphis when we was there   oh   uh and it was great Steven the only thing that Steven didnt like thats my son was uh you know they had those dancing bears and stuff it scared him to death   yeah yeah well you know theyre so large they animated it   yeah i think thats what it was but uh he hed rather go and ride on the rides you know they had airplanes that go up and down and stuff and   yeah thats really uh yeah we were until the kids got older wed go there and you know it was um that right ill date myself a little bit but its remarkable the number of those things they need merged or something but it still its still quite popular i have to im not sure the pizza was okay i mean   well we went one time uh one of my exboyfriends had taken me this was years and years ago and uh id taken my younger brother hes about twelve years younger than i am and uh   umhum   i remember eating their pizza and they had put anchovies and all this on it i mean they piled it up   umhum   and it was the nastiest  tasting pizza ive ever tasted       me i rather go Master Mister Gattis or theres a Godfathers down in uh Memphis and that was a good pizza ive never tasted a better pizza   well   well well do you ever go out to any of the higher higher end type more expensive places   uh no the last expensive place i went to it was a it was a  Shoneys huh and we went there every Tuesday night and or Saturday night when we was playing uh when i was playing softball with uh   hum   a softball league down in Memphis we went and uh thats the most expensive place we went to   um    well we got a lot of barbecue places around around the Dallas area Spring Creek Barbecue thats right in Richardson and it uh i i like the barbecue there um and it its fairly reasonable you can get um it i mean if if you know you go through the line and and pick up your food   yeah well its kind of hard to take two kids uh to a nice place  number one they bug all the other people and uh or so we think they do and   yeah it is theyre probably just being normal though     yeah but uh i dont know i every time i set up a baby sitter to uh go out and do something my husband uh nixes it and says well stay home this day and   well when the  you know its funny when the  when the when the kids get a lot older though you can you can you can do as you please our son graduates this year and were kind of looking forward to   yeah well i cant ill you know i say i cant wait for my kids to grow up but i believe im going to miss this age when theyre gone   yeah yeah theyre   uh but i i do want my freedom back im sure my husband does too   well the you know its its kind of like wanting to talk you know and um but and then they learned to say no and its kind of funny but they uh the the and now they get older our sons a senior in high school will talk to us but he you know you know its mostly um no it   not really anything really important in his life   no no no and its sort of i guess its a little disappointing but but i suppose its its just the way life is but   yeah i i cant you know i cant relate to that just yet uh you know i mean my daughter she doesnt know the word yes its no every time you turn around you know and my son i i cant de scribe him its i dont know why or you know   right   uh cant relate to a seventeen year old yet   well it it you know everybody all says youd be surprised how quickly it comes but it it uh we moved here in seventy six and daughter was six weeks old and and hard to believe in nearly fifteen years   uh you sound like you got a Louisiana accent   no i i i grew up in uh in Alabama   Alabama okay alright alright i guess close to the Louisiana border   well no actually and i was until i was eight i lived in in in south uh western Georgia and then we moved over into central part of Alabama   oh okay   but ive been away from there for goodness i havent lived in Alabama since nineteen sixty five thats been a long time ago i lived several places Europe and   yeah   in Asia yeah i spent   military yeah my my husband was in the Navy   but so i was in the Air Force   what were you in Air Force uh i he tried to get in there they wouldnt take him     yeah uh i was i went in in nineteen and sixty five when they were drafting people in fact my father was on the draft board so   yeah well uh i i was born in sixty five so i cant say that uh husband was only five years old then too     yeah well it things are different when uh everybody in in fact that it that was Vietnam era i was in fact i went to Vietnam myself   yeah well uh   it was its its a different world   yeah well i know uh i dont just just out of curiosity
