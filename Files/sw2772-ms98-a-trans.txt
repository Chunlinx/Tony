                all right   okay well i can go ahead and start and tell you mine um were from San Antonio and thats where i grew up so i was used to the heat and out here right now um gosh it gets to about seventies high seventies and it gets very cold at night   okay oh uhhuh uhhuh   and Monterey sits um right on the coast and i dont know if your familiar with the um the California coastline but were were about two hours about a two hour drive south of San Francisco   oh okay   and its uh really nice uh its a big area for people to come from the different uh countries mostly like Japan and Germany and England and they usually go to Carmel and vacation on the beaches so its its pretty nice uh year round but um cool always cool in the evenings and uh warm in the warm in the summer but its stays pretty cool even uh during the winter for as nice as it is   uhhuh   and um we usually get a fog uh right about oh i guess about four oclock and it kind of rolls in over the coast and uh then it usually breaks back off again uh the next morning and if you go just a little bit ways in id id say about a fifteen minute drive in towards Salinas uh it the weather completely changes and it gets very hot and dry and uh the fog never makes it that far but along here its uh very  very uh different from the the Texas type weather   hum   so whats it like down there   well right now were having the the little bit of spring that we have yeah   oh really well at least youve got some   we we dont have many seasons here it goes from winter to summer usually   uhhuh   uh spring usually consists of a lot of rain  excuse me especially thunderstorms i dont know weve got we had one of those blow through tonight   oh well thats good   and i think we got  the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days     uhhuh   so its   have yall been having any heat waves or   uh its gotten up to uh ninety a couple of times   like the ninety degree uhhuh   uh but basically been in the the low seventies and eighties   uhhuh oh well thats good for this time of year   yeah its not really been too bad because usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier   uhhuh uhhuh oh do yall have many bluebonnets and stuff up there   yeah quite a bit in fact the the season well the seasons just about over for that uh in fact we drove down to Corpus last week   oh i bet uhhuh   and uh there there were still some indian paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way   oh i miss i miss that   funny we drove through San Antonio and i spoke to somebody else this morning from San Antonio yeah were they had that we came back what day was that Sunday evening and they had a a big rainstorm come through there part of the same thing were getting now i guess   oh yeah well thats real nice because i can remember um two years ago that in about February the hundred degree weather started in San Antonio and just continued so at least yall are getting some rain up in Dallas im glad to hear that   yeah this thats the second or third year in a row that weve had a real rainy spring we had a pretty rainy fall last year as well   uhhuh yall werent getting any of the strings of uh the tornadoes and stuff were you   um we had a few down here but but not anything like Kansas and this is the season for that   uhhuh oh okay oh gosh   they do they do pop up occasionally around here   uhhuh oh  yeah i really dont miss all the heat here its im getting acclimated to having the cool evenings so we get a bit of a relief   yeah yeah im im from here originally so July and August im pretty well used to the hundred degree temperatures and stuff   uhhuh yeah     the the biggest problem with with the with the weather and the rain in this area is the the soil its that black clay soil   oh is that what Dallas is okay yeah   its kind of sandy you know its not sandy like most of the state is so it doesnt absorb the water real well i mean once it rains a little bit its   uhhuh   its filled up and everything else just runs off so   umhum yeah San Antonio has that same problem when the rains come its a complete its a complete mess everything floods all the under passes so i didnt realize that Dallas had that same problem   yeah yeah we have it especially especially as rainy as its been in the last couple of years theres a uh theres a section in South Dallas that has had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain   huh golly well we could use some rain up here were like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought   really   up here and they they had a pretty good early spring and we got quite a bit of rain but it wasnt enough to offset what they had lost over the last four years   huh   and uh so theyre still talking water rationing this summer so uh it would seem strange because in San Antonio um we had lived out um west of San Antonio in Castroville   uhhuh   and the water in Medina Lake and that area was really going down and they were considering um that they might have to do water rationing and then i thought oh gee im so glad to get out of there and get up here to the the California Pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers and theres no problem with water and then i came here and found out they were in you know in the four year drought so i said well gee this is pretty much like Texas and it pretty much is in the middle of summer they have rolling hills around here but   uhhuh uhhuh   um they they turn to golden dead grass for the majority of the summer just because there is no water to keep them green   hm yeah   but um its a really nice area uh its just its just such a change uh from Texas because i had grown up with uh the heat and was used to essentially like you said you have the cold winter and then you have the hot   uhhum   summer spring  and uh to come here its kind of the the temperate weather all year round its kind of like um spring i guess if you uh year round   umhum   except and then in the the winter and then it seems sort of like a San Antonio um early winter or fall year round so it seems like we only have two springs which is or two seasons and that would be spring and fall and we never really get any of the other ones   huh uhhuh yeah huh   but it is its a really nice uh change of pace   i guess id prefer that   yeah to the to the heat i really dont miss the heat um we do a lot of you know when you do a lot of outside like running and stuff out     yeah   its just so much easier up here and you dont have to worry about the high high humidity does Dallas get high humidity   umhum yeah we we its pretty dry we get some when its this rainy but its nothing like i guess San Antonio summers its nothing like Houston   or is it pretty dry uhhuh   for instance itd be or east Texas is a little more humid   yeah it seems like San Antonio has been increasing in humidity over the years because i had lived in San Antonio for about twenty years and it just seemed like every year it just got a little more humid a little more humid and here its uh well its right by the ocean but um its not the same as at Corpus at Corpus you you get that humid salty   huh   feeling in the air but here um the well the water is extremely cold up here you can lay on the beach all you want but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming you have to wear a wet suit   uhhuh um   and a thick wet suit at that because its just extremely cold and i for some reason i guess its because of that cold uh ocean uh water that the air is always cool its never humid or sticky or salty feeling so i really like that about this area and uh we just hadnt expected it we were used to what uh uh gulf coast uh weather was like and we came here to Pacific coast weather its just completely different and its much nicer   yeah yeah probably the Pacific breezes make a lot of difference in that   so uhhuh it does and the um the air doesnt feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region but um but we like it so its a nice change so well be here a couple of years and we thought well well take advantage of it and see what all the Pacific coast is like   thats nice   and uh so its been good   yeah my wifes originally from Virginia and we lived there for about nine months and that was a real change for me   oh i imagine that Virginia i imagine gets really humid doesnt it   um parts do we uh we were over in the in the western edge in the mountains   oh   and they have of course some pretty severe storms uh winter storms snow and that type of thing   uhhuh uhhuh   but theyre so good about clearing the roads that you know it doesnt usually bother you very much   uhhuh yeah  not like Texas where everything comes to a stand still you know uh   yeah and and their springs and summers are pretty mild too it never gets real real hot there   uhhuh oh yeah ill have to try that out because i had heard that North Carolina was sort of like that   uhhuh   and uh ive just never really been in that region of the country and i guess im going to have to try that area sometime and see what its like because a lot of people that are from that  North Carolina region really like it and uh they like they get the snow but they said it doesnt really get messy and it doesnt really hang around that long and   yeah   uh they the people i know that are from there uh they always miss it and they want to go back  nothing seems quite as good yeah but anyway   umhum well funny as we were talking the weather came on and theres a flash flood watch and   well oh gee whiz   more rain for the next three or four days   oh gosh oh well i hope it moves up this way but im sure it wont   yeah maybe we can send you some   yeah because we could sure use it okay well you think that takes care of the the time and   i think thatll do it   okay well i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in Texas and uh   well i enjoyed talking with you Lisa   yeah good luck to you okay well see you um bye   uhhuh you too bye bye
