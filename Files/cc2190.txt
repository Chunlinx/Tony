                    Introduction        Enteral nutrition is increasingly being recognized as an        integral component in the management of critically ill        patients having a major effect on morbidity and outcome        Early enteral nutrition has been demonstrated to improve        nitrogen balance wound healing and host immune function        and to augment cellular antioxidant systems decrease the        hypermetabolic response to tissue injury and preserve        intestinal mucosal integrity           In a        previous study     we reported that initiation of        enteral nutrition within  hours of surgery or admission        to hospital reduces infectious complications and hospital        length of stay LOS        These data suggest that enteral nutrition should be        initiated as soon as possible after admission to the        intensive care unit ICU Although the gastric route of        enteral feeding is easier to achieve and cheaper than        postpyloric nutrient administration many clinicians worry        that gastric feeding predisposes to aspiration and        pneumonia Thus many prefer to feed critically ill        patients via the postpyloric route believing that it        reduces the incidence of pneumonia Although the study by        Heyland and colleagues    suggests that gastrically fed        patients may have a higher incidence of aspiration than        those receiving postpyloric feeding other investigators        have not replicated these findings     In addition        many critically ill injured and postoperative patients        have gastroparesis which may limit their ability to        tolerate gastric feeding      Indeed Mentec and        colleagues    demonstrated that  of gastrically fed        patients in a mixed medicalsurgical ICU exhibited some        degree of upper digestive intolerance caused by impaired        gastric emptying Despite poor gastric emptying small        bowel function usually remains relatively intact and        placement of a postpyloric small bowel feeding tube may        allow for the administration of enteral nutrition in these        patients However placement of small bowel feeding tubes        may be extremely challenging and result in a delay in the        initiation of enteral feeding Although a number of        randomized controlled trials comparing gastric with        postpyloric feeding in critically ill patients have been        performed the results of these studies have been        inconclusive andor conflicting Thus the best route of        enteral nutrition in the critically ill and injured remains        unclear        In order to further our understanding of the clinical        effects of gastric versus small intestinal nutrient        administration in critically ill patients we performed a        metaanalysis of available studies to compare the pulmonary        complications clinical outcomes and success in achieving        caloric goals in patients randomly assigned to receive        either gastric or small intestinal tube feeds                    Method                  Identification of trials          Our aim was to identify all relevant randomized          controlled trials that compared gastric with small          intestinal tube feeds in critically ill patients A          randomized controlled trial was defined as a trial in          which patients were assigned prospectively to one of two          interventions by random allocation We used a multimethod          approach to identify relevant studies for the present          review A computerized literature search of the National          Library of Medicines Medline database from  to July           was conducted using the following search terms          enteral nutrition explode AND jejunal or postpyloric          or gastric AND randomized controlled trials publication          type or controlled clinical trials or clinical trials          randomized In addition we searched the Embase           and Healthstar  databases          reviewed our personal files and contacted experts in the          field Bibliographies of all selected articles and review          articles that included information on enteral nutrition          were reviewed for other relevant articles This search          strategy was done iteratively until no new potential          randomized controlled trial citations were found on          review of the reference lists of retrieved articles                          Study selection and data extraction          The following

achieved ICU LOS and        mortality are similar with gastric and postpyloric tube        feeding Although enteral nutrition was initiated sooner in        the gastrically fed patients patients fed into the small        intestine caught up with the patients fed into the        stomach and overall received a nonsignificantly greater        mean daily caloric intake  calories We previously        reported that enteral nutrition initiated within  hours        of surgery or admission to the ICU reduces the incidence of        infectious complications as compared with nutrition delayed        for greater than  hours     The time to the        initiation of enteral nutrition was significantly shorter        in those patients randomly assigned to receive nutrition by        the gastric route  hours  CI  to         hours         P   Although it is        possible that the short delay in the initiation of enteral        nutrition in the small intestine fed patients could        increase infective complications the results of this        analysis do not support that contention        This study has a number of limitations that must be        recognized A total of only  patients were included in        the metaanalysis the outcomes variables of interest were        not recorded in all studies and there was significant        heterogeneity between studies for a number of the outcome        variables Furthermore none of the studies included        patients who had undergone abdominal or major vascular        surgery These latter patients are at high risk for        gastroparesis and are best managed by a small bowel feeding        tube placed intraoperatively              The relative risk for pneumonia in the gastric compared        with the postpyloric fed group in this analysis was          CI          P   Although this may suggest        a trend toward an increased risk for pneumonia in the        gastric group this is questionable for a number of        reasons First there was significant heterogeneity in the        studies making extrapolation of conclusions fraught with        error Second ICU LOS was actually decreased in the        gastric group  days CI  to          P   If the risk for pneumonia        was significantly increased in these critically ill        patients one might anticipate an increase rather than a        decrease in ICU LOS In addition pneumonia was not        associated with any increase in mortality OR   CI                 P   However the study was not        powered to detect a smaller but still clinically        significant difference in the incidence of pneumonia        between the two groups of patients        Placement of small bowel feeding tubes by the blind        nasoenteric approach is technically challenging Zaloga           described the corkscrew method of achieving        postpyloric placement of feeding tubes with a success        rate of  Although success rates as high as  have        been claimed by others for placing postpyloric feeding        tubes at the bedside       most studies report a        success rate of         Success with        bedside placement of small bowel feeding tubes is        influenced by the technique and degree of expertise of the        clinician Furthermore unlike a nasogastricorogastric        tube which can be passed in less than a minute it can        take an experienced operator up to  minutes to achieve        postpyloric placement of a small bowel feeding tube In        order to improve the success at postpyloric placement        modifications have been made to the feeding tubes        including lengthening the tube altering the configuration        and profile of the tip and adding various types of weights              Innovative methods of placement have been        described that include using industrial magnets bedside        sonography fiberoptics through the tube gastric        insufflation and electrocardiogramguided placement                Prokinetic agents have also been used to        improve the likelihood of transpyloric passage of the        feeding tube         The number of variations        and modifications of the blind bedside technique attest to        the fact that none is ideal Furthermore misplacement of        the small bore feeding tube into the lung with resultant        pneumothorax is not a rare complication                       In order to improve the success rate of the blind        bedside technique small bore feeding tubes may be placed        endoscopically or radiographically Hillard and coworkers           compared the success rate and time to placement of        small bowel feeding tubes placed by fluoroscopy as compared        with placement at the bedside Of fluoroscopic procedures         were successful as compared with a success rate of         with bedside placement The average time delay before        initiation of feeding was  hours for the bedside method        and  hours for fluoroscopy Although both fluoroscopy        and endoscopy are highly effective for placement of small        bowel feeding tubes they require expertise that is not        readily available  hours a day and  days a week These        techniques frequently require patient transfer to        specialized areas of the hospital where the procedures are        performed In addition both techniques are expensive        An alternative to the use of a small intestinal feeding        tube is to place a regular orogastric or nasogastric tube        into the stomach and to use a promotility agent in those        patients who are at high risk for gastroparesis or in those        who develop high gastric residuals  ml        Although Mentec and colleagues    demonstrated some        degree of upper digestive intolerance in  of        nasogastrically fed patients only  were unable to        tolerate continuation of gastric feeding In the study        conducted by Boivin and Levy     all gastrically fed        patients received erythromycin as a promotility agent In        the studies conducted by Kortbeek and coworkers and by        Esparza and colleagues promotility agents were only used        in patients with increased gastric residual volumes              For economic reasons as well as to avoid potential        side effects it could be argued that only those patients        who are intolerant of nasogastric feedings residual         ml should receive a prokinetic agent        Erythromycin has been demonstrated to improve nutrient        delivery but the impact of this agent on antibiotic        resistance diarrhea and other complications has been        poorly evaluated        Although the present report indicates no difference        between gastric and small intestinal feedings with regard        to the incidence of pneumonia LOS or mortality the        trials that comprise the metaanalysis did not study        patients at high risk for aspiration Such patients would        include those with previous aspiration anatomic        abnormalities of the gastrointestinal tract and those with        high gastric residuals ie  ml or those        maintained in the recumbent position Small bowel feeding        may be the preferred route of enteral feeding in these        highrisk patients                    Conclusions        In this metaanalysis we failed to find any clinical        benefits of small intestinal feeding over gastric feeding        for the nutritional support of a mixed group of critically        ill medical neurosurgical and trauma patients Both        routes of enteral nutrition were associated with similar        rates of pneumonia LOS and mortality The studies        evaluated in this metaanalysis demonstrated heterogeneity        and the sample size was inadequate to detect small        differences between the groups the results should        therefore be interpreted with some caution However based        upon the results of this analysis and our experience        feeding critically ill patients we recommend that        critically ill patients who are not at high risk for        aspiration have a nasogastricorogastric tube placed on        admission to the ICU for the early initiation of enteral        nutrition Promotility agents should be considered in        patients with high gastric residual volumes Patients who        remain intolerant of gastric tube feeding despite the use        of promotility agents or patients with clinically        significant reflux or documented aspiration should have a        small intestinal feeding tube inserted for continuation of        enteral nutritional support Patients undergoing major        intraabdominal surgery who are at high risk for        gastroparesis should preferably be fed with a small bowel        feeding tube placed intraoperatively                    Competing interests
