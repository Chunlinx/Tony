                                 The Unraveling            In the presidential electionof  voters could choose from among three candidates George Wallace was asegregationist George McGovern was so impolitic he favored school busing eventhough  percent of blacks opposed it Sixty percent of the electorate judgedRichard Nixon the least of three evils But then voters that November didntknow that two weeks earlier the incumbent had detained a friend in the OvalOffice with the question How about the milk moneyand he wasnt talkingabout his schoollunch program The reference was to  million in campaigncontributions solicited from the dairy lobby in exchange for federal pricesupports for their industry            Journalists senators and special prosecutors have made sure that even themost illinformed among us knows that Nixon this complex man who invadedCambodia while opening up China and invented racial preferences while singingthe praises of the Silent Majority was a crook But in  even the SupremeCourt couldnt have proved that Nixon knew about the milk money Or that heonce ordered his chief of staff to blow the safe of one of the bulwarks ofofficial Washington the Brookings Institution Or that he sold ambassadorshipsat  apiece But we know now thanks to Watergate historian StanleyKutlers remarkable book of tape transcripts Abuse of Power  This is abook that tells two stories of Richard Nixons fall and of the tapes thatbrought him down            Both begin in June  The New York Times hadjust printed proof leaked by a disgruntled Department of Defense analyst namedDaniel Ellsberg that the government had systematically lied to the Americanpeople about the Vietnam War Nixons statesmanlike response was to fund asecret investigative team to bedevil Ellsberg and anyone else whom Nixon inhis overweening paranoia and narcissism deemed a risk to national securityThe most infamous escapade of these plumbers was their last a failedbreakin of Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate HotelThey were caught and Nixon and his aides became suspects in a conspiracy            Immediately the president and his Oval Office confidants began scheming toprotect what they portentously referred to as the presidency meaningthemselves from revelations that would surely issue from any seriousinvestigation of their administration where they got their milk money howthey used the IRS as their own Internal Retribution Service why they put TedKennedy on hour surveillance how they forged diplomatic cables to frameJack Kennedy in a political assassination Just keep it as small a littlecloud as you can Chief of Staff HR Haldeman advised his fellows earlyonwhich meant payoffs from money raised offthebooks to the hirelingsdirectly responsible for these enormities They were pressured into leaving thecountry testifying that they had done nothing swearing they had never beforeheard of anyone named Richard Nixon The bigger the sums though the moreintricate the coverup            Nixons presidency limped to its denouement byway of a grim paradox His lieutenants were soon suspected of conductingillicit operations of such high stakes and complexity that only a seniorofficial would have supervised them But the more senior the official who wassuborned into taking responsibility the farther he stood to fall and thebetter he knew the error of trusting this president to protect him It was onlya matter of time before someone who had seen how things worked inside of theOval Office would when called before the prosecution choose selfpreservationover loyalty            John Deanwas the first to break For months Deans claims that the president was likehimself guilty of obstruction of justice simply pitted his own word againstNixons Then in mid a midlevel aide casually mentioned to the SenateJudiciary Committeeassuming the senators already knewthat Nixon recordedhis Oval Office conversations Sixty hours worth of reels subpoenaed by theSupreme Court and carried to the courtroom in a single lockbox yielded asmoking gun In June  Nixon had ordered the loyal CIA to warn the not so loyal FBI off its Watergate investigation Not even offering up hischief aides Haldeman and John Ehrlichman could protect Richard Nixon from theincriminating testimony of Richard Nixon With the Senate shading toward aunanimous impeachment in August  the president resigned            The story of the tapes meanwhile was only beginningCongress whisked them immediately to the National Archives for safekeeping Butas Nixons twodecadelong campaign for rehabilitation gathered steamprotecting the  hours of unsubpoenaed tapes became his new obsession evenat an estimated cost of  million in legal fees Only last April did StanleyKutler author of The Wars of Watergate  and the advocacy group PublicCitizen reach the settlement that now gives us access to  hours ofconversations classified by the National Archives as touching abuse of powerOnly last November did Kutler get access to the actual recordings from which heedited Abuse of Power             Which brings us to the bookIts been a flush autumn for political voyeurs what with the publication oftape transcripts from JFKs Cuban Missile Crisis and LBJs momentous first yearas president Kutlers book alas is the most sloppily edited of the bunchWhen the cast of The Kennedy Tapes speculates whether Khrushchev ispulling a SuezHungary a quick glance at its introduction quickly reminds usof that dimly remembered corner of the Cold War When Johnson in TakingCharge cusses a damning newspaper editorial a favorite pastime afootnote tracks down the article and quotes from the offending passages Toread these books is to plant oneself firmly in their worlds            To readthis book on the other hand is to hold on for dear life while a tornado ofinvisible winks quadruple entendres and mystifying personages blows youbyunless you happen to know for example that the Hughes on Page  isbillionaire Howard Hughes with whom Don Nixon Sr that is the presidentsbrothernot to be confused with Don Nixon Jr the presidents nephew wasentwined financially in a way embarrassing to all concerned            If the Free Press hadnt been so eager to jointhe Christmas rush Kutler might have realized he had even more scoops on hishands than he thought Consider Ehrlichmans reference to a certain leftwingHarvard professor first name unknown Pomerantz or whatever his name iswhose generosity towards the George McGovern campaign raises Nixonssuspicions It would have required a minimum of effort and would been usefulto readers for Kutler to have pointed out that first name unknownPomerantz was probably Martin Peretz now editor in chief of the NewRepublic and at the time a leftwing Harvard professor and generousMcGovern donor            To pickthese nits is not to deny Kutlers heroic efforts to bring this material to thepublic Already newspapers and magazines have been filled with carefulparsings of the evidence presented here to reevaluate one more time the Nixonlegacy Conventional wisdom watch Richard Nixons funeral wouldnt haveamounted to a polypresidential lovein had these tapes come out in early This is vital work            But it is not the most vital work The statute oflimitations has run out on these crimes It may be that the best way to readthis text in the years ahead will not be with a magnifying glass but throughthe looking glassas a prism to discern what the political culture thatproduced Nixon shares with our own America after all elected Nixonand notdespite the paranoia and dread that runs through this book but in someways because of it What was his appeal to the silent majority but asubtle invitation to think like Nixon to believe that our neighbors might beour enemies and that our enemies might engulf us            Bob Dole who presided overthe Republican National Committee while it stood by its man until the lastsaid it best at Nixons funeral The second half of the  thcentury will be known as the age of Nixon May the next halfcentury speakbetter of us
