                                 The Leonard Cohen of World Lit            You could easily have gotthe wrong impression of Jos Saramago from the flood of press reports last weekwhen it was announced that hed won this years Nobel Prize for literature Thegist of the coverage was that Saramago a Portuguese novelist known for hisplayful excavations of Iberian history is the real thing  an inheritorof the majestic European literary tradition and the last best hope for theserious novel His life story enhances this image of fragile purity Hes alate bloomer who didnt publish a mature work until his s and didnt becomefamous until his s His picture in the New York Times had something todo with it too At  squinting and overcome with emotion he looked like amole emerging from an underground tunnelor with his thick eyeglasses andwhitefringed bald dome like Mr Magoo            EvenIve never heard of me is how a friend of mine meanly translatedSaramagos befuddled expression Thats a wee bit unfair of course AlthoughSaramago isnt very well known in the United States throughout the s hehas attracted a zealous international following Besides when journalistsreport that his sentences are long and obscure his stories intertextual andambitious they miss the real point of Saramago which is that hes reallypretty accessible Perhaps more than any living writer I know Saramago giveshis readers a taste of the exquisite high you get when you first fall in lovewith books No matter where you sit down with one of his novels you feel likeyoure up past bedtime reading with a flashlight taking a break from yourhumdrum life to commune with something magic and deep and eternal The irony isthat Saramago uses some very contemporary methods to whip up this madeleinereminder of classic literature Hes a good writer occasionally a greatwriter but mostly hes a pop star of a writer working the crowd into statesof childish longing and bliss            Saramago is often said to unite his native Europeanskepticism with the Latin American school of magical realism This is true upto a point Like Jorge Luis Borges he flirts with science fiction premises andinvents antique literary texts and then analyzes them His two most Borgesianworks are The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis  anhommage to the great Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa and The Historyof the Siege of Lisbon  in which a proofreader inserts a singlewordnotinto a single sentence in a book hes checking therebyquestioning every celebrated theme of Portuguese history As much as they areabout people Year of the Death and History are about writing andwhat it can and cannot do            Whatdistinguishes Saramago from Borges is his tenderness and his explicit evenobsessive curiosity about human emotion Conventional literary history saysthat the novel came into its own in the  th century alongsideindividual rights and a modern conception of marriage Saramago tries to figureout what it means to love when those conditions dont apply Baltasar andBlimunda  is a romance set in Portugal during the Inquisition Thesuspenseful and brilliant Blindness  his latest book published inEnglish tells the fantastic story of an epidemic that leaves the whole worldunable to see A quasiBorgesian conceit but Saramago uses it to ask howpeople love when disaster upsets the social norms The answer is atrociouslyalthough a few good souls do their best            Unlike Borges Saramago is an outspokenpolitical activist of a decidedly leftwing slant As a younger man he cheeredon the  revolution that liberated Portugal from a long sleepydictatorship Lately hes supported agrarian reform in Brazil and last Marchhe visited the Mexican jungle to express his solidarity with the Chiapasrebels The day the Nobel was announced Saramago was at the Frankfurt bookfair to deliver a speech on what it means to be a Communist writer today Hisparty affiliation made the Wall Street Journal so apoplectic that itpublished an oped this week declaring it all but a crime to give him the NobelPrize But he is a most modest militant At this point in history he saidcommunism is essentially a spiritual state a compassionate safeguard againstthe builtin injustice of capitalism            Hispolitics rare warmth and long and manyclaused sentences have earned Saramagoa second comparison this one to Gabriel Garca Mrquez But if hes too humanto be another Borges hes too intellectual and urbane to be another GarcaMrquez His characters dont have cousins and neighbors and colorfullabyrinthine histories In fact we often know next to nothing about hischaracters except that they are lonely bookish rolling stones who gather nomoss spending several hours a day wandering around Lisbon and daydreamingThe male characters anyway Saramagos women tend to be motherly souls whoeither sweetly have sex with the men or else show them how to settle down            Ithink a slightly less literary comparison is in orderTheres a revealing moment in The                History of the Siege of Lisbon when the shy proofreader hero a bachelor in his s is working at home Thetelevision plays silently in the background and the proofreader looks over andnotices that of all people in the world Leonard Cohen has appeared on thescreen Raimundo Silva bent over turned on the sound Leonard Cohen made agesture as if to thank him now he could sing and sing he did he sang ofthings only someone who has lived can sing of and asks himself how much andfor what someone who has loved and asks himself who and why and having askedall these questions he can find no answer not one contrary to the beliefthat all the answers are there and that all we have to do is to learn how tophrase our questions            Note the admiration for Cohenand the chanting musicality of this passage beautifully translated by GiovanniPontiero the echoes and variations circling around a bittersweet theme Notealso Saramagos detached melancholy his brainy antielitism his characterswho are lovable but archetypal and abstract All these qualities critics haveidentified as traits of the Great European Novel mixed with magical realism arealso the traits of the cool alienated allusiondropping singersongwriterCohen has always been praised as the poet laureate of songsters Why shouldntSaramago be the songwriter laureate of novelists            Which leaves me a caveatTheres a reason most good songs lasts between five and  minutes while anovel usually demands a few days At some point ideally the novel should godeeper than the song Saramago is never boringhis command over his materialis too impressive for that He can get a little precious though and hisconstant musing about fate can get repetitive less like Leonard Cohen and morelike John Mellencamp with his message that life goes on long after thethrill of living is gone I marveled at Saramagos ingenuity when I reread himlast weekend I also wondered at a few points if with his brand of cuteobscurity he was really Nobel material But I do know that the man can write atune or at least the literary equivalent and it sure is catchy
