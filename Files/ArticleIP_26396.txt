                                 The Whitney on Prozac            Each of New Yorks big artmuseums has its own distinct personality The Guggenheim is a noisy extrovertthat craves attention The Met is deep mysterious and aloofit takes yearsto really get to know it MoMA is a bit vain justifiably so The oddball ofthe group is the Whitney Museum of American Art which suffers from aninstitutional version of bipolar disorder One day it shouts obscenities inyour face The next its calm nearly to the point of affectlessness            Lately the Whitney hasbeen taking its medication in the form of new management Until November the director of the museum was David Ross who left to run the San FranciscoMuseum of Modern Art At the Whitney Ross created a glittery uptown showcasefor exhibitions of political and conceptual art that often took the form ofwhirring installations and blurry videos The most notorious of these was TheBlack Male in Western Art at which patrons were handed buttons reading ICant Imagine Ever Wanting to be White This was a museum that so angeredtraditionalists that one of the local weeklies used to run ads for aWhitneyshaped trash can The new Whitney run by a dapper fuddyduddy namedMaxwell Anderson who came from the Art Gallery of Ontario is just theopposite in almost every respect Andersons museum is traditionalarthistoryminded and eager to ingratiate itself with rather thanflabbergast and dumbfound up and outoftowners            The distillation of the Whitneys new sedateness is TheAmerican Century Art and Culture  the first half of a millennialsurvey scheduled to occupy the entire museum for the next eight months Drawingheavily on works in the museums permanent collection some of which are rarelydisplayed Andersons first attempt at a blockbuster eschews politicalcorrectness offers no historical revisionism and even includes work by NormanRockwell without quotation marks It is a bland textbook summary of Americanculture that eschews any explicit judgments at all for fear someone mightdisagree Broad surveys dont have to be dull Robert Hughes PBS series andbook American Visions managed to cover a much longer stretch of artisticwaterfront with verve insight and erudition The Whitney show by contrastmakes no sense out of American art or culture It merely drowns us in it            The phrase the Americancentury was the coinage of Henry Luce who in  declared the United Statesthe intellectual scientific and artistic capital of the world The firstquestion asked by Anderson in his introduction to the exhibition catalog iswhether Luce was right when it came to American art How does the art createdby Americans during the last century stack up against that created byEuropeans But having raised this issue The American Century never getsaround to proposing an answer Its as if such a massive assemblage is supposedto speak for itself Actually this exhibition does make a clear statement butI dont think its the one intended The message is basta             There are more than  works on display here includingnot only paintings drawings sculptures and photographs but also sheet musicmusic playing in the stairwells clips from movies movie posters novelsfurniture design objects architectural models and stills from danceprograms plays operas and musicals The Whitney presents this haulchronologically After finally getting through the line and into the museumvisitors get a brief orientation on the ground floor take the elevator to thefifth floor and work their way back down            By the time they reachedthe s on the third floor most viewers were exhibiting the deadeyedstares of the Dust Bowl farmers in the Walker Evans and Dorothea Langephotographs on the walls By Pearl Harbor it was like Bataan on MadisonAvenue People were collapsing on benches with advanced cases of artprostration The last section of the exhibitionAbstract Expressionismwasnearly empty the audience having surrendered To see this show at a briskclipsay  seconds per object and ignoring the banal wall textwouldrequire at least four twohour visits To curate is to choose and by failingto do so the Whitney has abdicated its essential responsibility            Nor does The American Century divide up this motherlodein any thoughtful or even coherent way The top floor covering the first twodecades of the century begins with works that  th century typessuch as Thomas Eakins John Singer Sargent and Augustus SaintGaudenshappened to produce after  It ends with Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp neverhaving given you much sense of how the vast distance from Point A to Point Bwas covered While the s the fourth floor do stand as a plausiblydistinct era in American culture the s third floor and the ssecond floor dont The various forms of politically driven realism thatflourished during the Depression continued to dominate American art through theend of World War II And the New York School of abstraction which becamepredominant after the war was near its apex not its end by the arbitrarycutoff date of  If youre going to bundle art into packages they shouldat least be tidy And whats the sense of imposing a rigid and arbitrarydeadline on the exhibition and then decorating the cover of the  catalogwith one of Jasper Johns flag paintings from             By shoveling so much inBarbara Haskell the Whitney curator who put together the exhibition seems tobe trying to build a case that American art in the first half of the th century was up to the standard of European art But for me theexhibition vindicated the conventional view that American art cant hold acandle to what was happening overseas until after World War II When you lookat the early American modernists such as Marsden Hartley Arthur Dove JohnMarin and Joseph Stella you see inventive and delightful things But youcant compare these guys to their European contemporaries such as PabloPicasso Georges Braque Henri Matisse Piet Mondrian Amedeo ModiglianiGustav Klimt Egon Schiele Wassily Kandinsky or Kasimir Malevich Or maybeyou can but the Whitney doesnt try It is content to examine the Americanmodernists in relation to their far less interesting domestic contemporariesand a broad cultural context that seems mostly irrelevant to their work Thisapproach may not make you homesick for the tendentiousness of the old WhitneyBut its an only slightly preferable alternative            So what should the Whitney have done for the millenniumIm not sure a modern art museum needs to celebrate the  thanniversary of Jesus at all But one better possibility would have been a realexamination of how the century in art did finally turn American by way ofvarious attempts to absorb European influences without being smothered by themThe raw material for that show is all here Walking through the galleries youglimpse a series of moments when an art both new and distinctly Americanappears One was around  when Paul Strand Morton Schamberg and CharlesSheeler rejected the gauzy pictorialism of Alfred Stieglitz for acubistinspired photography that also had a documentary purpose Anotherrelated bright spot was the s movement that has come to be calledPrecisionism which celebrated American industrialism as a new religionSheeler called one of his paintings of Henry Fords River Rouge plant MyEgypt  And finally the greatest and most distinctively American modernschool was Abstract Expressionism which blossomed after World War II and issnipped in midbloom by the end of the exhibition            Another way to do it would have been a look at theWhitney itself Such a show might have opened with the same Robert Henriportrait of Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney included here and brought many of thesame paintings she collected out of the vault for a fresh look But such a showwould have meant the museum taking a hard look at its own often controversialpart in the art world And I dont get the sense thats something the Whitneyor its conciliatory new director is very eager to do
