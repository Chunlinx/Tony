        so uh       where where do you get your current events   im i dont keep up on current events very well at all     okay   what i what i do on my i keep up on current events by as i walk by the newspaper stand if there is a headline that grabs my attention then i will stand there and look at it for a minute then walk into my office         maybe once every six months ill ill find something thats interesting enough that ill buy the paper and then usually i read end up reading a lot of it   uhhuh um do you watch any television   uh no oh yeah i do i watch i watch Star Trek and sometimes i watch the Equalizer i never watch the news   oh uhhuh huh   my roommates watch the news sometimes so sometimes ill get get interested in a news article so i guess a little bit leaks through there and uh sometimes on a on a plane or in a airport ill ill be sitting some somewhere and there will be a newspaper next to me and ill read parts of it   uhhuh uhhuh   but uh i dont make any deliberate effort to keep up on current events i probably about one of the least informed people  around how about you     well um i used to read the whole paper every day   wow   and uh when you when i did that i really knew stuff you know i mean if you read the whole paper every day you walk into work and youre like you want to talk to people about so what do you think about the situation in West Pakistan  like this the parliamentary governments not going not you know not going to stay in there and people sort of stare at you uh but now i have a child and i i read the comics every day   uhhuh           um and i sort of glance at the front page uh i also used to listen to um public radio tried to listen to that every evening for the news and every morning and when i when i was doing that and reading the paper i really i really felt informed uh especially having the two different viewpoints uh slightly different anyway uh   uhhuh   now i listen to the radio maybe five minutes in the morning and i dont get to listen evening some im pretty pretty uninformed uh but those were my two big ones the newspaper and the radio   yeah we have a news station here that i listen to sometimes on the way to work but its a short drive   uh uhhuh  yeah oh that was the other thing i used to drive to work i used to have a long commute and i would listen to every morning on uh   uhhuh   public radio theres a show called Morning Edition that lasts an hour and a half and   umhum   they repeat the main headlines every halfhour so i would listen to two segments of that and you know really really know stuff and now that im just walking and riding the bus um   wow   i i miss that uh the uh the well during the during the Gulf War we turned on the TV a couple times did you watch watch any more during that   in the Gulf War   yeah   uh that i have to say that during the Gulf War yeah i watched a lot of CNN   the whole Iraq thing uhhuh   i really did uh because i was pretty interested in that and i have a a an Iranian roommate   umhum umhum   and uh so he had on constantly   oh yeah ill bet     and uh so and actually i learned a lot from him about world situations and also i have a bunch of Persian friends because of him and so   oh yeah you probably learned a lot from them yeah   yeah and they are always telling me about countries i have never heard of and political political situations that totally amaze me   yeah yeah theres so much to know it is amazing   and so   um well uh one thing that was interesting during that whole thing was i would listen to the radio quite a bit and uh you know i started bringing a radio to work and i would listen a little bit at work and listen on the way home and on the way the way there and uh i really felt like i was keeping up pretty well and then i would watch CNN for you know fifteen minutes or a half hour and see a bunch of pictures and realize i hadnt really learned anything you know they sort of show planes taking off and uh like i i got more visual information but less   less content   real information in a way   they were kind of starved for real information i think at that point because all they had was was military clips and   uhhuh yeah and its almost as though that was stuff was more available to TV so they used it   yeah well they have to show something   you know they have to show something and thats all they could show on TV they could i mean on the radio they would bring in all sorts of you know experts from God knows where and interview them and talk to them about it and speculate uh i think  in part at least because they had to uh which is kind of interesting so i just found that they the information per hour was much higher on the radio although the TV was a little more compelling   i never thought about that the information per hour well technically the information on the TV is higher but the actual content is less   right its its an interesting question about you know the bandwidth of the television
