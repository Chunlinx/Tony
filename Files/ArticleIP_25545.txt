                                  Race Bait and Switch            More than a century afterfreeing AfricanAmericans from slavery Republicans are promising to liberateblacks from a newer type of governmentsanctioned exploitation SocialSecurity As part of their effort to seize the Social Security issue and inparticular their campaign for privatization they argue that the SocialSecurity system rips off blacks for the benefit of whites Sen Daniel PatrickMoynihan a Democrat has also taken up the cry And so have some of the mediaThe March issue of Essence magazine invites readers to visit acommunity activist Web site about Social Security and become involved toensure that we get our fair share The Fort Lauderdale SunSentineleditorialized recently The average black male can expect to work all his lifeto help finance a comfortable retirement in Florida for middle and upper classpeople then drop dead a month or two after he collects his first SocialSecurity check Ron Walters a professor at the University of Maryland and oneof Americas bestknown black political scientists has called Social Securitya form of reverse reparations             Their argument is simpleand plausible Everybody pays into the system during his or her working yearsthen gets a monthly check during retirement Since blacks have a shorter lifeexpectancy than whites they are getting a worse deal and in effectsubsidizing longerliving whites            So why is this wrong First of all Social Security isprogressive by design Everybody pays the same share of income into the systemeach year about  percent plus another  percent from your employer But theformula for benefit payouts isnt proportionate to what is paid in Lowincomepeople get more not in absolute terms but compared with their contributionswhile affluent retirees get less A February report by the General AccountingOffice confirms that this formula outweighs the effect of lower life expectancyfor all lowincome people including AfricanAmericans            Second Social Securitybenefits dont go just to elderly retirees The program pays benefits toyounger people with disabilities that prevent them from earning a living andalso to surviving spouses and minor children of deceased participants Blacksbenefit disproportionately from these aspects of the system Although only percent of the US population is black AfricanAmericans get almost a quarterof the Social Security benefits paid to surviving children            The main source for the Social Security Screws Blackscampaign is a study by who else the Heritage Foundation Its study has beenpretty well demolished by the GAOs actuaries and by a counterstudy by theCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities a liberal think tank Among otherdistortions it assumes that everyone retires at  although twothirds of allworkers stop paying in and start collecting benefits earlier than thatwhichreduces the disadvantage of a shorter life span            Heritage calculates thata lowincome single black male born after  would face a rate of return onhis investment in Social Security of  percent compared with a  percentrate of return for a random lowincome male from the general population Therate of return on Social Security is calculated by imagining that each of apersons payments into the system over the decades is deposited in an accountfrom which payments from the system are subsequently withdrawn Then youfigure what interest rate on that account would cause the payments inplusinterestto exactly cover the payments out and that is the rate of return onSocial Security as an investment            Even if Heritages calculations were accurate its choiceof year would be tendentious Almost all current retirees are getting apositive rate of return on the very low payments they made for most of theirworking lives even if some are getting a better return than othersConversely people in their s and s today will get a negative rate ofreturn though some will be more negative than others Heritage chose a yearwhen by its calculation the general population was still just barely inpositive territory while blacks had moved into negative numbers in order toclaim that blacks losses were subsidizing whites profits That would never betrue of the system as a whole even if it were true of people born around            The analogy to an investment with a rate of returnis only one way to think about Social Security and not necessarily the bestAnother is as insurance against poverty in old age or disability at any ageWhen you buy auto insurance you dont hope for a lot of accidents to improveyour rate of return on the premiums Social Security is also a transferprogram The reason the rate of return is so poor for people under  is thattheir money is going to todays retirees rather than being invested for theirown benefit Proposals to improve the rate of return for Gen X and afterthrough privatization and what not invariably omit the money current workerswill have to supply to current retirees one way or another from theircalculations            In any event a governmentstaffed study of the rateof return on Social Security the only one based on records of actual workersand retirees puts Social Securitys rate of return at  percent for whitesand  percent for blacks
