              good morning   good morning   uh okay go ahead yeah i understand the topic this morning is uh our policy in Latin America and you know what weve been doing down there so i dont know     no no go ahead   as you indicated you dont have too much input into the area it it just so happens that uh our daughterinlaw is Panamanian and uh we have been in Panama and i have worked in El Salvador and we visit Mexico occasionally so  yeah we we do have a little information on it here but uh   oh very good because actually um when i was in college i visited Mexico several times i was in the Peace Corps and um Peru but but recently i have been following the Middle East rather than   oh uhhuh yeah   Central America   it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit thats thats for sure no i the US policy uh towards Central America as far as uh well i kind of go back to to the El Salvador thing because Texas Instruments had a a plant down there for a while and i worked in there for a little while and at that particular time lets lets see that was seventy three seventy four kind of before the the uh the the uh Civil War really picked up down there and US policy at that particular time there was of course military assistance to uh to the government itself you know anything thats thats anticommunist you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro  it dont matter what their excesses were and i believe at the time that i was down there that uh the   right   that uh the government uh the Salvadorian government you know really gotten out of hand yet the uh right wing death squad type situation i believe that that was beginning to form but i dont i i wasnt really aware of its being you know terribly uh you know rapid at the time that that i was down there i think that really kind of developed a little bit later on but uh our policies seem to be pretty much one of uh you know trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource anyway that Salvador had  plenty of and that was people we didnt seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just its its labor   right umhum   because everything that TI did anyway we we shipped in and it was worked on down there assembled and then sent back here so i didnt feel that we really exploiting exploiting them any   did that have um so you dont you dont feel that that we were um exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting and they werent   no uh in the particular incidence that i was aware of now TI wasnt the only ones in there Playtex was in there was uh several other companies and uh   uhhuh   of course we kind of concentrate on there wasnt much to take out of the country i felt like were going in and taken all their um their gold or oil or bananas or coffee or anything like that because uh it just   umhum   the only thing that they had a great abundance of was uh you know human beings   uhhuh did did we tend to um change their attitudes attitudes like some times when Americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt American things Americanism um consumer products TV the whole works     yeah i understand what you say there was a uh the time that i was down there i stayed quite a a bit at the uh uh one of the big hotels San Salvador and at the time i thought there ought to be a law against American tourists because they for the most part tend to be the most obnoxious as a as a group and i saw this in Panama so uh oh you know its its the uh the almost stereotype   uhhuh   you know flowery shirt shorts camera hanging around their neck you know demanding this that and the other thing you know were were here and we want this and we want that and that sort of thing thats thats the stereotype thats very strong down there you know that uh the you know that sort of thing i i i believe those of us who were working down there got a little bit more appreciation for you know the local uh culture i really dont believe that we were quite that bad but yet they were having to deal directly with uh you know with the uh the local people   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh but boy there is a there is a bad uh uh you know the old brash ugly American type   uhhuh   situation and i saw incidences in the hotel where i just wanted to go over and crawl in the corner and say oh my God those are those are not Americans  they cant be but they are   right   and uh of course now i i do have to i remember one case where we had some Canadians in there who were every bit as bad but i mean it i think its just kind of the North American situation uh in Panama theyve been used to Americans down there for so darn long but i didnt see quite as much of that sort of thing as Panamanians are just about as  as uh as as Americans as far as uh creature comforts you know theyre uh theyre theyre every bit uh i i know when my my son was in the Air Force and he was stationed in Panama and he married a Panamanian girl and when she came up here uh you know shes you know except for the language situation some of the cultures shes just about an American you know is as far as TV and   uhhuh   and you know the the moneymaking part of it and all that matter of fact if anything shes worse  but uh uh it it just theres little enclaves down there where you know Americans have a lot of influence   uhhuh uhhuh   and the local population kind of um you know sort of accepts that but ive also seen the other side of it too   uhhuh   well you were in Peru   yeah i was in Peru Peru but um i there werent as i recall or at least i wasnt aware of that many Americans there except for a very heavy concentration of Peace Corps volunteers this was when the Peace Corps first are started and it was one of the big targets   uhhuh uhhuh   and um i dont i dont think at that time at least Peace Corps was uh an obnoxious group in the sense that that we were very controlled regarding number of days off and and you couldnt just take up take off and leave your group and go explore and and things like that   oh uhhuh   but and i was working actually in the savings and loan program so that was quite specialized although i was living in the slums i was really working with the middle class   uhhuh What uh what area did you live in   i was up in Arequipa   oh okay yeah   and um   ive heard of it   uhhuh so   well well is are they is Peace Corps still active down in there   i dont have any idea um probably not i mean there were thirteen i was uh Peru Peru thirteen which meant there were twelve groups before mine   uhhuh   that had gone in and and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development and they were building schools and doing coops and things like that health um inoculation and and things   oh has those influences lasted do you know whether the the things that that you and your groups before you did did those did those live on or were they reabsorbed or how   no no i believe they did because um some of some of the the Peace Corps uh that i knew of did marry Peruvians   uhhuh   and have been back and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things and of course the savings and loan program um that was that you know that that just continued to grow in fact after my group i mean we were just a very small specialized group too to get that going and spread and then of course Peace Corps bowed out of that because thats uh uh something that nationalized very quickly and the same with the coops   uhhuh well thats that was kind of the the aim wasnt it to get it started and then have it   right   taken up by the oh okay oh so you know well thats i had wondered sometimes i knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that and i just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know like yeah   uhhuh yeah ive you know some of the programs i would have concern about like um the language teaching you know i mean why should we push English and a lot of people were down there teaching English and when they talked about Hungary or someplace one of the eastern law countries requesting Peace Corps to teach language you know to me thats a little bit marginal i did teach economics at the university one night a week and the textbook was in English but basically i taught it in Spanish because i mean   uhhuh oh   i really didnt see the point in their knowing stuff rotely and writing it on a test   yeah yeah my brotherinlaw teaches at uh Northern Illinois University and they were in China here a couple of years ago and he was over there at uh the University of Shah and and teaching
