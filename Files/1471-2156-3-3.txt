                    Background        Congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles CFEOM        and Duane syndrome DS are complex strabismus disorders        that present with congenital restrictive ophthalmoplegia        with or without ptosis These disorders were traditionally        believed to reflect primary structural extraocular muscle        EOM anomalies and have been referred to as congenital        fibrosis syndromes     Neuropathology studies of DS            and one form of CFEOM CFEOM     and the        identification of         ARIX as the gene mutated in a second        form of CFEOM CFEOM     however support our        hypothesis that CFEOM results from maldevelopment of the        oculomotor nIII andor trochlear nIV nuclei and DS        results from maldevelopment of the abducens nVI nucleus        The continued definition of these phenotypes and        identification of the underlying disease genes will assist        clinical diagnostics and lead to a better understanding of        the unique developmental features of the oculomotor lower        motor neuron unit        Although several distinct CFEOM phenotypes have been        defined       each likely resulting from        maldevelopment of a unique combination of alpha motor        neurons in nIII andor nIV most reports of CFEOM families        describe a stereotypical clinical phenotype The affected        members of these pedigrees are born with bilateral ptosis        and restrictive ophthalmoplegia The primary vertical        position of each eye is downward and cannot be elevated        above the midline On forced duction testing there is        resistance to passive movement of the globe Although the        primary position of both eyes is infraducted there is        variability in the secondary position of each eye ie        exotropic esotropic or neutral and the degree of        residual horizontal movement within the lower quadrants        full to completely restricted This CFEOM phenotype was        first described in the medical literature in     and        was recognized to occur as a familial trait in             Subsequently families segregating this phenotype have        been published under myriad names                         We now refer to individuals with this        phenotype as having classic CFEOM and to families in        which all affected members have this phenotype as  CFEOM        pedigrees We previously mapped a CFEOM locus referred        to as         FEOM to a   cM region spanning        the centromere of chromosome  flanked by         DS AFMxf on the parm and                DS AFMbwd on the qarm                    In addition to families with CFEOM we have identified        several less common familial CFEOM phenotypes CFEOM and        CFEOM These phenotypes are classified as CFEOM based on        the presence of affected members with congenital        restrictive ophthalmoplegia affecting extraocular muscles        in the nIIInIV distribution By definition however one        or more affected family members do not have the classic        CFEOM phenotype In families with CFEOM the eyes of        affected family members are fixed in an exotropic or        outward position Thus far this phenotype segregates as        an autosomal recessive trait and maps to the         FEOM locus on chromosome q            and affected individuals carry homozygous mutations in         ARIX             ARIX encodes a homeodomain        transcription factor required for nIII and nIV development        in mice and zebrafish      In families with CFEOM        the CFEOM phenotype is variably expressed Some affected        members have classic CFEOM Others however are        unilaterally affected the primary position of the eye is        orthotropic rather than infraducted andor the eye can be        raised into the upper quadrants Thus far this phenotype        segregates as an autosomal dominant trait and maps to        either         FEOM on qter    or to         FEOM            In our attempt to understand phenotypegenotype        correlations between specific CFEOM phenotypes and         FEOM loci we noted that the CFEOM        phenotype in all pedigrees reported to date maps to the         FEOM locus To determine if CFEOM        is indeed genetically homogeneous we identified all        unpublished CFEOM pedigrees in our database analyzed them        for linkage to the         FEOM loci and found that most but        not all were consistent with linkage to         FEOM The two small pedigrees not        linked to         FEOM were consistent with linkage to                FEOM In addition to further define        the spectrum of human         ARIX mutations we identified all        CFEOM families consistent with linkage to         FEOM or sporadic individuals with        classic CFEOM and determined that none harbored mutations        in the         ARIX gene                    Results                  Linkage to FEOM          Genetic analyses of the two largest families BJ CZ          established linkage of their phenotype to the           FEOM locus Fig  Table           see Additional File  Maximum lod scores of  were          obtained at a theta value of zero for the fully          informative markers           DS and           DS in family BJ and the          fully informative markers           DS DS and           DS in family CZ          Linkage to           FEOM was ruled out in family BT          see Additional file  A lod score of  was obtained          at a theta value of  for the fully informative          markers           DS DS and           DS The           FEOM critical region is   cM          and a theta of  corresponds to a genetic distance of          approximately  cM thus eliminating linkage of this          familys CFEOM disease gene to the entire           FEOM critical region Exclusion of          linkage to the           FEOM locus is further supported by          haplotype analysis of this family Fig c The affected          sister and brother inherit different           FEOM haplotypes from their          affected mother and the brothers affected daughter          inherits her unaffected paternal grandfathers           FEOM haplotype thus proving          nonassociation between the           FEOM haplotype and the disease          phenotype          The eight remaining CFEOM pedigrees were too small to          produce statistically significant lod scores however          seven of the eight families displayed haplotype and          linkage data consistent with linkage to the           FEOM locus Fig  see Additional          File  Genetic and haplotype analysis of all nine          families consistent with linkage to the           FEOM locus did not reveal any          recombination events within the previously defined           FEOM critical region          The smallest family K revealed haplotype and linkage          data that was inconsistent with linkage to the           FEOM locus Fig a see          Additional File  A lod score of  was obtained at a          theta value of  for the only two informative          markers           DS and           DS These theta values          eliminate linkage to only  cM of the   cM           FEOM critical region and          therefore this locus cannot be formally ruled out          Nevertheless the minimum number of recombination events          in this family occurs only if the affected son and          daughter inherit different           FEOM haplotypes from their          affected mother thus strongly suggesting that the          disease gene in this family does not map to the          chromosome  locus          Genetic heterogeneity was tested taking into account          the eleven new families Admixture analysis of the          twopoint data with the HOMOG program showed evidence for          linkage to           FEOM with heterogeneity for both          markers tested            DS and           DS  Chisquares of           and  were obtained for           DS and           DS respectively which          resulted in significant likelihood ratios of             and     Alpha the proportion of linked          families was                           Linkage to FEOM          All families except BJ and CZ were analyzed for          linkage to the  cM           FEOM locus flanked by           DS and qter Of the seven          small families consistent with linkage to           FEOM only the largest AG can be          definitively excluded from linkage to           FEOM see Additional File  Five          of the remaining families AJ AH T BC CT showed          haplotype data inconsistent with linkage to           FEOM but the theta values          obtained at lod scores of  were insufficient to rule          out the entire           FEOM critical region          The two families whose phenotype did not map to           FEOM K BT had haplotype and          linkage data consistent with linkage to           FEOM Fig b d see          Additional File  In addition one of the small          families consistent with linkage to the           FEOM locus E had haplotype and          linkage data that was also consistent with linkage to the                    FEOM locus see Additional File                                    Linkage to FEOM          All families whose phenotype was not linked to           FEOM or           FEOM were tested for linkage to           FEOM Assuming autosomal dominant          inheritance with complete penetrance two families AG          E are not linked and five families are inconsistent with          linkage AJ AH T CT BT to the           FEOM locus see Additional File           Family BC is consistent with linkage to both the           FEOM and           FEOM loci maximum lod score           at both loci and family K is consistent with linkage to          both the           FEOM and           FEOM loci maximum lod score           at both loci                          ARIXmutation analysis          Genomic DNA samples from affected member of pedigree          BC and K and  sporadic individuals with classic CFEOM          were used as templates to sequence the three           ARIX exons and flanking introns No          mutations were identified                            Discussion        We have established clinical criteria for classic CFEOM        and CFEOM and have identified  sporadic individuals with        classic CFEOM and  pedigrees with CFEOM Of these         pedigrees  are linked or consistent with linkage to        the         FEOM locus Two small CFEOM        pedigrees are not consistent with linkage however        establishing that CFEOM is genetically heterogeneous        Eleven of the  pedigrees are large enough to establish        linkage to a specific locus we previously reported that        the CFEOM phenotype in  of these pedigrees maps to the         FEOM locus       and we now        demonstrate that the remaining two also map to         FEOM Our analysis of the remaining         CFEOM pedigrees demonstrates that  most likely result        from mutations in the         FEOM gene Five of these  are        consistent with linkage to         FEOM and are either not linked or        not consistent with linkage to         FEOM and         FEOM One is consistent with linkage        to         FEOM and not         FEOM and although consistent with        linkage to         FEOM ARIX mutations were not        identified Therefore although not proved the CFEOM        phenotype in these  families seems likely to result from        mutations in the         FEOM gene The phenotype of a        seventh family E is consistent with linkage to both         FEOM and         FEOM and will be screened for        mutations at both these loci        In contrast to the  pedigrees whose CFEOM phenotype        is consistent with linkage to         FEOM pedigree BT is not linked to         FEOM and pedigree K is inconsistent        with linkage to this locus It is notable that haplotype        analysis of both these small CFEOM families demonstrates        coinheritance with the         FEOM locus In the reported family        whose autosomal dominant CFEOM phenotype maps to the         FEOM locus  of the  affected        members had classic CFEOM Our current data now suggests        that at least in small pedigrees CFEOM can also map to        the         FEOM locus It will require the        identification of additional large CFEOM families to        determine if they too can map to this locus                ARIX which encodes a transcription        factor critical to nIII and nIV development in mice and        zebrafish      was recently identified as the         FEOM gene mutated in affected        members of CFEOM families     It was unknown however        if classic CFEOM may also result from mutations in this        gene We now find that we are unable to identify         ARIX mutations underlying classic        CFEOM in either sporadic cases or in individuals from        CFEOM families        This finding is consistent with our prediction that        compared to         ARIX the genes mutated in CFEOM may        have a more restricted function in the development of nIII        and that their expression may actually be regulated by         ARIX This prediction is based on the        CFEOM phenotype and on the neuropathological study of an        affected member of a CFEOM pedigree whose disease gene        maps to the         FEOM locus This study revealed        absence of the superior division of the oculomotor nerve        and the corresponding central caudal and medial nIII        subnuclei and marked abnormalities of the levator        palpebrae superioris and superior rectus muscles            These findings suggest that while         ARIX is necessary for both nIII and        nIV development the CFEOM genes may be necessary for the        development of only these two specific nIII subnuclei                    Conclusions        The genetic analysis of the  CFEOM pedigrees in this        report demonstrates that this disorder is genetically        heterogeneous While the phenotype of all large CFEOM        pedigrees analyzed thus far map to the         FEOM locus smaller CFEOM pedigrees        may harbor mutations in the         FEOM gene The CFEOM phenotype does        not however appear to result from mutations in         ARIX The CFEOM families identified        in this study contribute critical alleles toward the        identification of the mutated         FEOM and         FEOM genes Once identified we        anticipate that the study of the function of these genes        will contribute to our understanding of midbrain motor        neuron development                    Materials and Methods                  Subjects          We established inclusion criteria for this study as          follows First we established criteria for a classic          CFEOM individual as an individual with congenital          nonprogressive bilateral ophthalmoplegia and ptosis an          infraducted primary position of each eye with the          inability to raise either eye above the midline and          forced duction testing positive for restriction if          testing was performed We then established criteria for a          CFEOM pedigree as a family in which every affected          member met the criteria for classic CFEOM Second we          reviewed all participants enrolled in our ongoing CFEOM          study and determined which individuals and which          pedigrees met these two criteria For a pedigree to be          considered we required clinical examination records          andor photographsvideos of the primary positions of          gaze for all affected study participants Third from          these CFEOM pedigrees we identified those with a family          structure sufficient for linkage analysis Pedigrees were          required to have affected study participants in three or          more generations or affected study participants in two          generations with at least two participating offspring of          affected individuals or two or more affected study          participants within one generation In this way we did          not assume a mode of inheritance Lastly sporadic          individuals with classic CFEOM were screened for           ARIX mutations The study was          approved by the Childrens Hospital institutional review          board and all study participants signed informed consent          forms Our methods adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki          for research involving human subjects                          Molecular studies          Blood samples were obtained from all participating          family members and lymphocyte DNA was extracted using          the Puregene kit Gentra Research Triangle Park NC          Chromosome analyses of GTG banded metaphase cells at a           band level minimum resolution were performed on one          or more affected family members of each family whenever          possible to rule out cytogenetic abnormalities All          families were analyzed for linkage to the           FEOM locus Families not linked to          the           FEOM locus were also analyzed for          linkage to the           FEOM and           FEOM loci Linkage studies were          conducted using three or more locus specific polymorphic          DNA micro satellite markers for each family The           FEOM markers included           DS DS DS DS          DS DS DS DS DS and           DS      The           FEOM markers included           DS DS DS          DS and           DS     The           FEOM markers included           DS DS DS DS          DS DS DS DS DS and           DS     The

Perkin Elmer The radioactively labeled PCR          products were separated on  denaturing polyacrylamide          sequencing gels and the alleles were visualized by          autoradiography     For the fluorescently labeled          products  PdCTP was omitted fluorescent primers          were used and the products were analyzed in an ABI          PrismTM  DNA Sequencer Perkin Elmer following the          manufacturers specifications                          Lod score calculations          An individual was scored as affected based on clinical          examination records andor photographs of primary          position of gaze Lod scores were calculated using the          Fastlink version  package of programs              assuming autosomal dominant inheritance with complete          penetrance and a disease incidence of  in           births as described previously      Because of the          absence of specific allele frequencies for each of the          ethnic groups represented in the study we assumed ten          marker alleles of equal frequency To assess nonallelic          heterogeneity linkage data from two           FEOM markers spanning the           FEOM critical region            DS and           DS  were analyzed using a          HOMOG version  program                              ARIX mutation detection                    ARIX was PCR amplified from genomic          DNA using five primer sets and sequenced on an automated          ABI  DNA seqeuncer PEApplied Biosystems as          described previously
