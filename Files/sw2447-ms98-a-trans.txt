          probably uh the lifestyles and the size of the area we live in and an age can make a very difference in how credit cards are used um at this point in life i do not carry a credit card that i have to pay a service charge on   uhhuh none at all huh   right uh we used to have American Express and uh Visa that of course theres a yearly fee on   i see yeah has it   and we got rid of those we now have Discover we have a Visa that does not have a yearly fee and then we have a card that our bank put out on a promotion this year that uh of the first year there is no yearly fee and of course we dont plan on keeping it the second year   uhhuh uhhuh yeah that   because im pretty frugal about things like that   thats what we we got rid of an American Express card for the same reason is though we have a a credit union and we get our cards our other MasterCards for free so we dont have to pay a a fee at all   uhhuh     and thats what i i know people who dont have any credit cards at all and im always amazed  because i dont know how they can get by without them it doesnt seem like you can do anything anymore without a credit card   we find it especially useful because my husband retired over a year ago and we travel quite a bit and we we like to leave a credit card when we check into a motel in case we want to make a phone call or   uhhuh   whatever which we do pretty often and and uh fact in a lot of motels we noticed from our most recent trip they that you do not even get the telephone turned on in your room unless youve left a credit card at the desk   uhhuh uhhuh   so i suppose for that reason we will always have a credit card of some kind but   yeah i like them  too with with us weve got insurance of course but due to my husbands work but by the time like two weeks ago we all got sick all four us and one kid had to go to the doctor twice and then all the other the the rest of us did and he was like six hundred dollars yeah and it was we were we all had it was a viral pneumonia it was really bad and and we were just horribly sick but i mean six hundred dollars i cant come up with   oh my uhhuh can you do that on a credit card   yeah all the doctors here will take a Visa so that and you know and go to KMart and use the pharmacy to pay for the uh medicines and then turn it all into the insurance company and wait for it to come back   oh for heaven sakes for the drugs yeah uhhuh   you know and so our part of it was still twenty percent but twenty percent i can payoff in one month whereas you know then i got to wait for the rest the rest of it to come back from Aetna but it basically floats   uhhuh   you know during the the time because weve got a thirty day grace period on the credit card as long as you pay it you know within that time and thats usually enough time for the insurance to get back   oh uhhuh uhhuh   i try to make that our biggest use of credit cards i know people who are so in debt people who have five Visa cards i cant believe you know its like why did you go get they charged up one so then they but they were still paying their minimum so their credit rating was still good   uh yes uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   and and you would you know they get this in the mail say oh well we cant use that one anymore well just get another one and thats like who you   i have a girlfriend who has one that her husband doesnt know she has now uh she must rent a p post office box or something or i mean she couldnt beat him to the mail every month i wouldnt think   oh yeah   because they both work and they uh hes a fireman so hes home two days a week that she teaches and would not be there so i dont know how she manages it but she keeps that a secret and i would not want to pay her monthly   uhhuh   interest rate on the thing it just has to be awful because it   oh yeah but thats thats a good way to make a big problem in your marriage real quick gosh thats just dishonest   oh oh i would think so but theyve been married almost thirty five years so i think theyve done things like that to each other for a long time   oh well  maybe maybe theyll be all right i know in mine if i did something like that and then my husband found out jeez he would just       be well i i think i would feel the same way id id really feel like id been deceived you know that that wasnt the thing to do   uhhuh yes yes well many many many many years ago uh i bought wallpaper we have a large kitchen uh dining kitchen family room combination and i wanted to paper it  and i bought wallpaper from Sears catalog on my Sears card and at that time i was only able to pay about ten dollars a month which meant i was taking about eight dollars a month off   uhhuh   the balance by the time they got their interest out of it and it took forever to pay it off and at that point i promised myself i would never pay interest on a credit card again so thats kind of been my motto   um yeah weve tried to do that weve paid ours off you know all the way down to where we had everything down to zero and especially right before i i quit work two years ago to stay home with the kids       and right and before i left we had everything paid off we were in great shape we were putting money you know because we were both working we were finally putting money in   uhhuh   but weve gone back the other way to some extent because because just because there are times when you just cant pay it all   uhhuh uhhuh   because there are just too many bills   well as you say when youre taking children to the doctor and adults too it does make a difference our children are matured out of the home and uh our needs are much different than they were   yeah uhhuh   uh when we were raising a family i think back then we just now we feel like we might could live without one but uh we have a Discover card and i have to laugh about the cash back do you have one of those   oh isnt that silly i i sent that one back because we had used it for a year and we had used a thousand dollars worth during the year and what we and and i think we got back fifty cents or something it was like please what is this this is and the interest on it was was eighteen or nineteen percent   did you yeah yeah oh   and our Visa card was we could get through our credit union was like fourteen percent so we just we sent it back we   yeah   we keep gas credit cards and we have Visa and then i have started my own business i have a photography business and i went ahead and got a separate Visa just for that photography business because there are things that i have to buy   yeah   and with my photography when i when i take things to the lab to get developed its several hundred dollars at a time and i was using up all of our personal credit   uhhuh   with my photography business even though again its paying off every month because im im putting everything   uhhuh   im im uh you know im getting the pictures and im taking them back to the people i already have their money but i wasnt depositing them until i gave them the pictures back   uhhuh uhhuh   another practice i found im going to have to stop hot checks  you wouldnt think for a for a twelve dollar school picture that uh that people would write a hot check but they do   oh oh i see oh dear  well uhhuh i think those are the same people who have their credit cards uh charged up to the max and thats just a way of life i guess   i guess its just you know and when i think about that lady this this particular lady who wrote me a check for twelve dollars and it bounced and i sent it through you know sent it through the check through the bank once and she incurred at least a fifteen dollar fee   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   for a returned check so now shes already doubled the price of her check and ive s ent it through a second time because they said theres money in the account now   uhhuh   you know and and if it doesnt go through the second time that womans out thirty bucks   for one twelve dollar check its never quite made sense to me but then uh   for one twelve dollar check   when my husband was in business he had one customer who said that he had to use credit cards because he spent more than he made every month and he was perfectly serious about it   gosh   so i  dont know why he you know didnt go ahead and project to the fact that eventually that was going to catch up with him but   yeah hes going to have a debt going out the ear   uhhuh i was very glad my husband retired and got away from that kind of thing  so weve we have a little problem with our gas card were uh weve always used a Mobile card because he was affiliated with Mobile Oil and uh     uhhuh   we its very difficult to find their stations so i guess thats one reason why we use uh weve used Discover and Visa quite a bit for fuel even   uh uhhuh yeah well we have a lot of Mobile stations around here and i used to use that card almost exclusively but now theyre charging the extra five cents to use your credit card and Texaco and Chevron and somebody else is not anymore theyll take it you know at the cash price or you theyll now let you write a check if you have their card so you pay for it immediately instead of um you know putting it off for a month   uhhuh i thought that was illegal   whats that writing a check for gas   no no no to uh put a surcharge on a credit card of   well all of them down down here you had a cash price for gasoline and a credit card price   oh so what theyre doing theyre discounting for cash is the way theyre because i think it is illegal to add a surcharge so   right thats thats supposedly   thats that theyre looking at it differently it amounts to that you have to pay extra if you use your credit card but   uhhuh right and and theyve changed that now now  stop it go play and leave me alone yeah and so im using the other ones now because theyre just as easy to get to and then theyre nickel a gallon cheaper so   yeah so what were saying is that we use a credit card when it uh is convenient but if its going to cost us money we dont though   yes we try not to were probably the only two people in the United States the bank the banks dont want to hear from us because they want those people who charge it up to ten thousand dollars uh and then get all yeah and then pay fifty dollars a month and it all goes to interest   probably   and leave us uhhuh     oh i guess they must they must make a ton  theres not too many places you can make eighteen percent interest on things anymore   thats right thats right   thats what we need see you and i need to get in the credit card business we need to start our own credit card  if you can yeah because you sure cant get that interest anyway else gosh   i guess so  that would be wonderful wouldnt it huhuh huhuh not on those CDs were trying to live on  uh yeah   oh yeah ours are like seven percent weve got one and with with IRA stuff in it and uh   uhhuh   jeez you cant get any interest rates   yeah   my folks have just retired just in the last couple of months my dad has and uh theyre trying to figure out you know what theyre doing with stuff and my moms in there cutting up the credit cards  you know cant use these anymore and   umhum sure sure yeah well like i say the only reason we do in fact i when my husband and i were
