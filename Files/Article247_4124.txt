                                 Smells Like Team Spirit                        It isnt often that you actually get a look at corporate life as itsactually lived from the inside Thats part of what makes The Target ShootsFirst  a new video documentary by filmmaker Chris Wilcha so memorableclick here to buy a copy of the video In  upon graduating collegewith an evermarketable degree in philosophy Wilcha took a job at the ColumbiaHouse record club which was coowned by Sony and Time Warner as a marketingassistant mostly so he could buy time until he figured out what he was reallygoing to do with his life He brought with him a devotion to punk and indierock and a video camera that somewhat improbably he used to tape marketingmeetings design discussions conversations with his fellow employees and avisit to the plant where Columbia House actually manufactures and distributesits product            The result is a movie thats a remarkable document of the time when it wasmade Wilcha arrived at Columbia House in the middle of the alternativerockexplosion which at the time looked like it was going to reshape the musicindustry but would instead quickly fade away In the wake of the huge successof Nirvanas Nevermind  which was released in September of  andstayed on the charts for more than a year major record labels went on abandsigning spree adding to their rosters any act that seemed to offer eventhe faintest possibility of being the next Nirvana Of course since this was alot like signing a host of bands hoping to find the next Beatles the strategydidnt work            Still in  no one knew this All the people at Columbia House knew wasthat something important was happening and that they had no clue either what itreally was or more important how to make money off it In some sensealternative rock really did shake the industry because it came if not fromnowhere then nowhere that the major labels had previously cared about Themagnitude of Nirvanas successand the success of its lesser Seattle brethrenlike Pearl Jam and Soundgardenwas such that it couldnt be ignoredParallels could be drawn between the record industrys reaction toNevermind and the film industrys reaction to sex lies andvideotape             What all this meant was that people like Wilcha which is to say people whohad been listening to Nirvana and the Replacements and Minor Threat and HskerD long before Nevermind broke suddenly seemed incredibly valuable Ona smaller scale what happened to them was like what happened to people withInternet experience in  Doors that would normally have been sealed tightlyshut were opened and they were given far more freedom in the workplace thanyearolds typically enjoy The Target Shoots First begins withWilchas adjusting to the vaguely Dilbertesque world of Columbia House anddelineates the sharp division between the suits on the  th floorhome of marketing and the creative people on the  th floor andthen shows what happened when Wilcha and a colleague were given a mandate tocreate a separate alternativerock catalog that Columbia House could send itssubscribers            They essentially turned the catalog into the kind of selfawareinsidereferencelaced music magazine that they would want to read themselvesAnd it was a huge hit Except of course that no matter how clever it was itwas in the end still a catalog And its success mostly meant that Sony and TimeWarner would get to sell more CDs            In his voiceover narration Wilcha is open about his dismay at this factand the movie as a whole is embedded in a critique of consumerism that seemsultimately naive But naive or not that dismay certainly feels true to itstime as does Wilchas decision to stop filming after the suicide of KurtCobain lead singer of Nirvana It may seem odd to think of five or six yearsago as a different time but in so many ways preInternet preGingrichpreboom still expecting the recession of  to come back it was Andone of the things that was most different was the feeling that music reallymattered that Nirvanas having a No  record would make a real difference inthe culture as a whole The Target Shoots First is amazingly moving atleast for me precisely because it reminds me of what it was like to feel thatway and so of what it is like not to feel that way now            Having said all that the most interesting thing about the film is the wayit shows how changing the way people work actually makes a material differenceto the kind of work they do When Wilcha and his colleague were given the jobof starting the altrock catalog they explicitly adopted a team structurebreaking down the traditional hierarchical division between the  thand  th floors and integrating the marketing creative and designfunctions in a way that had never been done before at Columbia House Theresult perhaps predictably was a working environment that was both moreenjoyable and by all accounts more productive It was in other wordsexactly the kind of experience that Fast Company loves to writeabout            This matters because the critique of consumerism that animates The TargetShoots First is often accompanied by a critique of Fast Company Tom Petersstyle ideas about work that dismisses these ideas as covers forcorporate power But Wilchas movie ends up showing that at least at ColumbiaHouse people really can be happier and more engaged if theyre allowed to workdifferently This doesnt mean of course that team structures are the routeto paradise especially if you think making profits for Sony is immoral But itdoes serve as a nice reminder that not all fads are frauds
