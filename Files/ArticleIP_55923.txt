antitrust policy in the age offastpaced hightech industries that are moving and shaking the world economyparticularly the US economy It added that the hightech industries havecreated millions of new jobs in the United States No doubt much of the creditfor this goes to Microsoft However the ruling underscores the need offacilitating market access for newcomers and of respecting consumerinterests
