                    Background        Nonadherence to drug therapy can undermine the        attainment of therapeutic goals and contribute to the        occurrence of medication side effects Numerous adverse        clinical outcomes have been linked to nonadherence        including loss of blood pressure control      acute        cardiac events     renal transplant rejection            seizures     and elevated Human Immunodeficiency Virus        RNA levels     Efforts to enhance medicinal adherence        have met with varying levels of success              The detection of nonadherence to recommended treatment        can be problematic In the clinical setting asking patients        about their medication use is the most practical means of        ascertainment but it is prone to inaccuracy             Strategies to increase the accuracy of screening for        nonadherence such as considering as nonadherent all those        who do not respond to therapy can augment sensitivity        However this unfairly mislabels some adherent patients as        nonadherent     In general patients tend to        overestimate their adherence     and unless a patient        is not responding to therapy it may be extremely difficult        to identify underadherence In research settings pill        counts drug levels pharmacy dispensing records and        electronic medication monitors are available to measure        medicinal adherence but even some of these methods such as        pill counts may be susceptible to overestimating adherence               In many nonresearch situations these        approaches may be difficult to implement due to their        obtrusiveness cost or complexity        Although studies have been conducted to identify risk        factors for nonadherence itself     to the best of our        knowledge only one previous study has examined possible        risk factors for         overreporting of adherence            None has utilized electronic medication monitors to study        this area involving antihypertensive medications We        consequently undertook this present study among several        hundred individuals who were receiving antihypertensive        therapy in order to explore which demographic behavioral        and clinical characteristics might be associated with        overreporting of adherence The investigation was        exploratory in nature and was meant to identify possible        leads for future research Electronic medication monitors        were used to track actual medication use against which the        accuracy of patientreported adherence was determined                    Methods                  Study population          The study design of this investigation has been          described previously in detail     Briefly the          study was conducted at Harvard Pilgrim Health Care          HPHC a managed care organization located in New          England among members who were receiving          antihypertensive medication from  to  Automated          medical pharmacy and claims records of the study          population were screened to identify potential study          subjects and retrieve their outpatient blood pressure          data Patients were eligible if they had been HPHC          members for at least three months were at least  years          of age and carried a diagnosis of hypertension Only          individuals on singledrug therapy for high blood          pressure were selected to simplify electronic adherence          monitoring          Of  potentially eligible individuals           consented to participate and completed all phases of the          study The majority of those who did not enroll in the          study  declined mailed or telephone invitations to          participate In addition  subjects dropped out midway          through the study and  individuals were later excluded          because of indications of improper use of their          electronic medication monitor such as removal of multiple          doses at an opening or incomplete closure of the          medication vial The remaining  patients constituted          the study population for this investigation Individuals          who were eligible but did not complete this investigation          had a similar age gender and blood pressure          distribution as our study population However calcium          antagonists were prescribed slightly more frequently           versus  and angiotensinconverting inhibitors less          frequently  versus  to individuals excluded from          the final study population                              Collection of electronic and patientreported          adherence data          Individuals who consented to participate were mailed a          baseline questionnaire that covered their socioeconomic          background medications antihypertensive and other          drugs adherence health beliefs health status Medical          Outcomes Study Short Form SF     and social          support Responses to the questionnaire were obtained by          telephone interview conducted by a research          assistant          Selfreported adherence during the monitoring period          was obtained using the following question which was          adapted from the Brief Medication Questionnaire Svarstad          B personal communication           While you were using the special          medication bottle on how many days in an AVERAGE WEEK          did you forget to take a pill      or           days Our previous study    had indicated that          responses to this item compared with  other adherence          items correlated most closely with adherence as measured          by electronic medication monitoring          Social support was assessed using a item inventory          The inventory inquired about how often the participant          could rely on having someone to  listen to them           accompany them to the physician  show affection to          them  give them information  provide them with          advice that they would want  do things with them to          turn their minds to other things  help with chores           share worries and fears with and  do enjoyable          things with Responses to each question were recorded on          a Likert scale none a little some most or          all of the time          Electronic monitoring vials were dispensed with a          fresh supply of antihypertensive medication upon          enrollment in the study Participants were instructed by          pharmacists to keep all their medication in the          monitoring vial use no other source of antihypertensive          medication and to remove only one dose at a time from          the monitoring vial Participants were informed of the          purpose of the electronic medication monitor          Dosing events were recorded for approximately three          months using the Medication Event Monitoring System          MEMS manufactured by APREX Corporation Union City          CA MEMS is a microelectronic device housed within a          medication bottle cap that records the date and time of          each opening The device blocks repeated openings that          occur within  minutes of each other to prevent          artifactual inflation of the number of dosing events          Data were downloaded from the cap to a personal computer          using a manufacturersupplied communicator and          software          Two to three weeks after completion of electronic          monitoring a followup questionnaire was sent to          participants to update information on their socioeconomic          status prescribed antihypertensive therapy          selfreported adherence during the monitoring period and          health beliefs Responses were once again obtained by          telephone All aspects of the study protocol were          reviewed and approved by the Human Studies Committee of          Harvard Pilgrim Health Care                          Data analysis          Due to the highly skewed distribution of questionnaire          responses only  of participants reported missing          doses  or more days per week the average number of          days in a week when participants missed a dose of          antihypertensive medication was dichotomized at  versus           day per week Setting the breakpoint between adherent          and nonadherent days at one day per week represents a          frequency of misseddose days of   MEMS          records were used to derive the actual frequency of days          when  or more doses of antihypertensive medication were          omitted Adherence was defined to be overestimated by          the patient if they reported an average frequency of          nonadherence of  day per week ie  while          electronic monitoring indicated a higher frequency of          days with missed doses ie           Data analysis proceeded from an assessment of crude          unadjusted associations with overreporting of          adherence to stepwise logistic regression to identify          which associations remained after adjustment for other          potential risk factors Six categories of variables were          considered  socioeconomic and demographic background          age gender education marital status employment          income  clinical features blood pressure duration          of treatment number of doses per day  clinician          communication previous inquiry by clinician regarding          medicinal adherence  health beliefs perceived          effectiveness of treatment and susceptibility to adverse          health outcomes  health status SF indices and           social support a summary score derived from the          item support inventory These variables were chosen          either because their information might be obtainable or          inferred by practicing clinicians or they had been          evaluated in previous studies of adherence behavior                 Chisquare or likelihood ratio tests from          logistic regression models were used to evaluate crude          associations between overreporting and possible          predictor variables In executing the stepwise logistic          regression procedure a selection criterion of           p   was selected to allow for          the evaluation of the joint effect of multiple variables          The rejection criterion was also set relatively high at           p   to permit identification of          all potential associations with overreporting of          adherence As described later in this paper all          variables that were ultimately retained in the final          logistic regression model amply met these retention          criteria All data manipulations and statistical analyses          were conducted using SAS release  SAS Institute

blood pressure in        the previous year number of daily doses and perceived        risk in a single logistic regression model did not        materially affect our findings results not shown The        link between  daily dose and overreporting of        adherence was blocked OR    CI           p   by adjusting for actual        adherence as measured by MEMS in the final selected        model indicating that the association between dosing        frequency and overreporting was most likely mediated by        actual adherence                    Discussion        The main purpose of this exploratory analysis was to        identify potential risk factors for overreporting of        adherence We observed that frequent daily dosing reduced        risk perception from nonadherence and lower annual income        were associated with overreporting in our study        population Not surprisingly less adherent individuals        were also more likely to overreport their adherence than        other more adherent individuals a pattern that has been        reported by other investigators             The exploratory nature of this investigation makes        cautious interpretation of our findings necessary Multiple        comparisons were made in this study and consequently the        results may have been chance findings Use of a very        conservative standard of significance based on the        Bonferroni adjustment would require a pvalue of           where  represents the traditional standard of        significance and  the number of comparisons made By        these criteria only dosing frequency would still be        considered statistically significant        The association between dosing frequency and        overreporting of adherence was apparently mediated by        actual adherence behavior because adjusting statistically        for electronically measured adherence blocked this        relationship This is not surprising because frequent        dosing usually predicts lower adherence     and lower        adherence is associated with overreporting As a        consequence frequent dosing would be expected to correlate        with overreporting via its connection with actual        adherence        On a more conjectural level the observed connection        between decreased perception of health risk from        nonadherence and overreporting of adherence may indicate        that health belief models that posit a direct relationship        between perceived risk and adherence may also apply to the        accurate recollection of past medication use               In addition the association with lower household        income in our study population may indicate that a more        stressful if not disorganized life situation as suggested        by lower socioeconomic status may increase the likelihood        of inaccurately believing that missed doses were taken        Furthermore some individuals may report what they believe        that clinicians or researchers want to hear This behavior        might be more likely when the perceived difference in power        as measured by wealth and income is maximal        Several factors that may contribute to the inaccurate        recounting of adherence by patients were not evaluated in        this study The research instruments did not cover        participants attitudes towards the healthcare system        their healthcare providers or the research staff involved        in this study The quality of the patientphysician and by        extension the participantresearcher relationship may have        a significant impact on what patients will discuss with        their healthcare provider     Furthermore formal        psychological and cognitive testing were not performed on        study participants to permit evaluation of the effect of        memory judgement mood and personality on adherence and        the accurate reporting of noncompliance                    Conclusions        This investigation is one of the first to evaluate        possible risk factors for overreporting of adherence by        patients The findings suggest that factors related to        socioeconomic status the dosing regimen and perceived        risk from nonadherence may influence how accurately        patients recall and report their adherence Additional        investigation will be needed to confirm and extend these        findings as well as elucidate the possible underlying        behavioral mechanisms that are involved
