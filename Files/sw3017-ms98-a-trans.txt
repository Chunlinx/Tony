        okay well i worked out today            well i didnt   you didnt do you do you ever   yeah yeah i end up being um   a lot   were fixing to go on vacation so im running here and there and everywhere and   oh yeah well thats a workout in itself getting ready to go huh   yeah it the the recorder came on i went oh boy do how do i miss today because i thought if id be there right now i couldnt have taken this call       so my guilt feelings come rushing through but   yeah do you go every day   uh usually yeah i try to um go to i have a membership at Fitness Fitness and Figure World here   yeah oh really   umhum   is that is that male and female   yeah   yeah mine is just female im too big of a wimp to go to the male and female   well its its its kind of like oh your splitlevel house its got the male stuff on one side     oh really   uh and then it has a Nautilus equipment that male or female can use and then its got your aerobics room which is coed and then its got the female side which has all their Nautilus that they can use by theirselves and their own sauna   yeah do a lot of the guys do the aerobics   uh no not most of them most its mostly female   just mostly female have they been have you done the bench bench aerobics yet   oh yeah the steps   do you like it   im still not sure about it yet   yeah ive a   um i yeah im too busy concentrating if im going to twist my ankles or something yeah   fall off the bench   yeah because i have broken both my ankles so im real leery about   oh no   you know   yeah well i i read an article that its really not that good on your knees   stepping and looking and well i didnt i dont know how it could be   yeah   um   so i havent i havent ventured with that yet   im im thinking it may be just a fad and will pass with everything else   yeah but in our classes theres a ton of people that do it   oh yeah   and they do it i think they only have it like three times a week because i think thats what they pretty much recommend but still uh i think that would be so hard on your knees   yeah um   so   and you know the boxes get pretty tall and i um   yeah   i dont know i havent got to the tallest one yet and it hasnt the i did uh when i first started it bothered my knees behind my knees   huh thats strange   thats the only place i was sore and i thought well i must not be doing them right or       or something because that i have no need for that muscle back there   yeah really i cant ever think of when you would use that huh   so so im you know i can see where it because it effected my knees   wow   and i did regular aerobics like last night with without the boxes and i got more of a workout   uhhuh yeah   and it was a no bounce class   yeah oh really   and i still got more of a workout as far as in you know stamina etcetera   huh well i was a cheerleader for a long long time so i dont get into the aerobics at all because its too much like cheerleading so i mostly just ride the bike and do the weights on the machines   yeah   but i do they have aquacise which i like that quite a bit   Now ive been to that i havent been to that yet uh ive ive it just it just doesnt move fast enough for me i dont think   yeah well i mean you know it varies from instructor to instructor but if you get a good one you can get a pretty good workout yeah   ive got to have something hyper really ive never tried it so i guess  ive i ought to try it before i think its not fast enough   well yeah youd think with broken ankles that would be a good way to go because you dont get that friction when you land   yeah yeah   huh  well   ive never       i guess i ought to try i dont know it just never appealed to me as much as as   yeah   as uh just for real hard aerobics does for some reason and and then the weights and im really and and then the weights and im really um like in the the step machines   yeah oh yeah thats great do you is it a Stairmaster   uh im not sure what it is   because see the one that we have isnt Stairmaster so its not quite as good i dont think but um its its real good for you but boy they say that youre supposed to go twenty minutes and i cant do that   no   ive been trying to work up to it but i cant   oh when they first started me i had a girl who was training me and shed only been there three weeks and she says well you just push this button and you turn the dial and you just go and im like one side would go down and then the other side and i thought i and these guys on each side of me are just pumping it like you know       and im going theres got to be something wrong here and the guy looks over and says hes got you started on ten   oh no   so lets turn it down and then i was keeping up with him you know but it was funny because i thought       i am like in slow motion compared to everybody around me what i and i felt like way out of shape and it just happened to be the dial was wrong but   yeah   you mostly go the evenings   yes   yeah   yeah   i attempted going in the mornings and it was really good because then it was out of the way and you know and nothing interfered but its just so much harder to get up that much earlier   yeah i am more i used to do i used to run in the mornings   oh i hate running   and in im just much more stretched out by the evening   yeah   from work and everything because i was really having uh backaches and stuff when id get halfway through the day i couldnt figure out why   yeah i hadnt thought about that yeah huh i hadnt thought about that well my other problem was id get to the club and id be getting ready to go to work and id realize i didnt have my blouse or something   oh yeah     so that was always kind of traumatic   yeah it could be of course i dont know it could be great for business     yeah i wonder i did i literally went in one day in my linen skirt and a sweatshirt   oh my gosh       so   so anyway well enjoy your vacation   well im looking forward to it   where you
