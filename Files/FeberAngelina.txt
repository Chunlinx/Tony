dont know if I remembered everything         I tried to jot everything down         So then I look up I find out where Ramonas at and I call her over there         Shes like Well I did that for him like at least two years ago         And Im like Damn great         Shes like But you need to look here look here shes gives me like three different places to look in the computer                     Uhhuh                     And um its different like under each client is all their files         Like whatever weve done for them its in there         So I have to go she gave me like three or four clients to look up and then under each one of those I have to like open up all like the Excel spreadsheets and I dont even know what Im looking for         Im just trying to have an idea of what it kind of looks like         So it took me like an hour to two hours just to find what I needed         Then I get it and Im like great What do I do with it         Its like one file with a whole bunch of tabs of different you know each tab has like a different spreadsheet on it                     Whats up Angelina                     Were talking about my                              Recording me                     Yeah its recording                                                     So finally I get the thing and it has like eight different parts to it and Im just there trying to figure how the thing goes together how one number flows to another sheet and how that goes you know         Everything is linked and gosh I dont even know how long         I was just there just trying to figure it out         Then I was spinning my wheel for about I dont know it seemed like all day that day         It wasnt till like  or  that I actually got to start on the on the project         And I um I didnt know how much detail he wanted         I didnt know you know when he needed it by         He acted like he needed it soon but the way she had everything done I would have had to I would have had to start from the very beginning and most of it was just like data entry to start off with         And then once you get everything entered you can go on from there         Well the rest of the day I was just entering entering entering entering information         It wasnt until like before  that I had finished entering something and I was able to look and see OK where do I go from here now that I have this done where do these totals go to on another sheet         So Im like OK he hasnt called back or anything so Im figuring I can do it on Monday         Well I get there this morning and um I forget how I think either I asked a question and he came in there or whatever         Anyhow he tells me Well I need it by today because such and such is coming coming in and we need to take it to the bank         And Im like Oh         Im like I know how far Ive gotten         So anyhow I call Ramona back because I had a question about I was like All right let me hurry up on with it and I had a question about something I was doing         Well she tells me shes like That doesnt sound right         She was like um you know because the company she gave me was different from the company that I had there were little things different slight different things with it like one didnt have the same kind of inventory as the other one         Little things like that made a big difference in what I was trying to do         So shes like Well look look up this in such and such company         And I did         Now what does that look like         And how about it looks like exactly what Im trying to do         Its like more simplified like the one that she had given me was all detailed and complicated and the second one is all simple         So here I am now I have the thing that Im supposed to have and he wants it today and I wasted all that time on Friday just wasted time because I was doing the wrong thing         So now here it is he wants it today         I didnt have time to enter in all kinds of whatever         So I just had to take the totals and try and figure it like that         Well I get to a certain point where Im like confused         I dont have enough information         So I go in there and I havent even told him yet that I had to start from the very beginning because I was like I didnt want to tell him         So and let me tell you I got to the point today where I was about to quit         I was like Thats it         Im getting up         Im leaving because when he had come in it was like he was short with me and Im asking him a question and hes not answering it and hes his final thing was Well I need it by such and such meeting so just telling me I dont give a damn that youre having trouble         I dont care how you get it done he just wants it         Well theres nobody there to help me         The girl that can help me is all the way across town         So with that I was I was frustrated         I was spinning my wheels trying to figure out how I can make it work         If there was anything I could do         Lana came over and sat with me for a little bit but she didnt know what to do and um you just get to the point where you know youre like you know youre slamming things down and youre just I was pissed I was really upset and um got to the point where I just wanted to cry and but I didnt want to get that upset because you know if anybody came in there or I knew I had to tell him that I would I might not be able to finish it today or you know I have to start from the beginning but then again I didnt know how much detail I still didnt know how much detail you know I talked to him early in the day its like you talk to him and its like he completely avoided my questions         So anyhow I think I spoke to Ramona again         No it was just that one time in the morning and she said that she was going to come back to the office         Well I wasnt even thinking about that but I was so frustrated and I ended up talking to him again         Again he didnt answer my question but at least I got a little bit out of him         He told me what exactly he needed and that he did need it by today         He didnt say a time again so he just got me over there stressing out and I really dont even know when its needed         But I was like forget it Im going to eat lunch I was hungry         Usually you feel like you have to work through like you just have to keep working because he needs it even though it wasnt your fault that he gave it to you at the very last minute you know I was like   and then Lana calls me in the kitchen telling me Ramona had gotten here and I didnt even know she was coming for sure         This time I wasnt even happy that she was there because I was so stressed out         I was like OK well thats good you know like that         Well anyway I went back to my my desk         I ate real quick as fast as I could and then she came in there and she ended up helping me with it         It was like a little bit close to five when she came in there and um I had two companies that I had to do the same thing for so once I was finished with the whole first company then I had to do the second one and it was like  and he hadnt asked for it or anything so um         I emailed him because hes always on the phone         And I asked him you know could I do it um Do you need me to stay and do it tonight or I could have it done by lunchtime tomorrow if thats OK         Well what happens the client walks through the door that needs it         So Im like Oh my gosh and Ramona was standing there         She was still in there         I didnt ask him till after she left but anyhow um um she told me that he had come in she basically um no that was after         Anyhow the man comes in         She had gone already and she told me just dont worry about it         Shes like Dont worry about it you know just take your time         Whatever         Yeah well the guys here         He emails me back         Bruce is here         I need it now         And I only had one of them done and I just kept on doing what I was doing because I heard them talking or whatever and I kept on doing what I was doing I dont know how he did it but he basically told him that he didnt have it right now or whatever         And then I heard him leave so Im still finishing what I had to do         And here I am thinking hes going come in there and be like you know just have it out with me you know just tell me off like how could I not have this done         Even though I dont see how he could have expected me to have it done         I already told him I tried to explain to him that I was frustrated I didnt have all the information I needed         But he didnt care         I spoke to him twice that day and it was like         So anyway um he ended up coming in there and he was like Hows it coming along         And I was like Im almost done         He was like All right well Im going go out and run some errands and um just put it up on my shelf and um if I have any review notes Ill give them to you in the morning         And I was like OK and that was it         So all that stressing and I mean I had every reason to stress today it was like youre giving something you dont know how to do and its like here do it         I dont care how you do it         I dont care how you get it done         I dont care if you dont know anything about it         And it makes you feel just awful         Anyhow so I finished came home at  today and that was my day         That was my messed up         Boss he was like with split personality man         One minute hes banging on the desk the next hes OK have it on my desk dah dah dah dah dah         Thats my story         I didnt talk long                     Is it like that all the time                     Yep whenever he there um which hes not there hes there most of the time but he is gone a lot but whenever he is there and especially if he gives you something to do its like you dont even want it because you know its going to be that way and its like other people hesitate to come through because they dont want to have said something wrong and then you go back to him well like you know such and such helped me and its not like youre ratting anybody out youre just saying you know such and such helped me and thats how I got to this number but its like people are hesitating basically and its really frustrating                     So what is it that they wanted you to do                     We were doing um          we were doing today it was um projections it was financial statement like balance sheet and income statement projections for a company that um this guy was looking to buy well he gave us the information that he had projected numbers for   and we had to put those numbers into financial statements basically saying they are going to have this much um this many assets and liabilities at the end of  going to have  and then going to have so much income and you know like that
