                    Background        The effects of the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid        RA are mediated by two classes of ligand dependent        transcription factors the retinoic acid receptors RAR        and the retinoid X receptors RXR     The RARs are        activated by all trans RA and cis RA whereas the RXRs are        activated by cis RA only There are three known members        of each class termed   and  encoded by separate        genes Each gene may express several different isoforms        because of alternative splicing and differential promoter        usage     Both the RARs and RXRs contain functional        domains for DNA and ligand binding dimerization with other        transcription factors and transactivation of RA responsive        promoters RARs and RXRs function as heterodimers that bind        to response elements in the promoters of target genes to        regulate RA dependent transcription RARRXR binding to        nuclear receptor corepressors such as NCoR and SMRT in the        absence of ligand inhibits activation of RA responsive        genes      Ligand binding displaces the repressors and        recruits coactivator proteins such as CBP which have        histone acetyltransferase activity     Histone        acetylation allows for chromatin unwinding and        transcriptional initiation of target gene expression                   Previous studies have demonstrated that        posttranslational modifications of RARs and RXRs are        critical to the biological activity of the receptors In        the RAR amino terminus a consensus mitogen activated        protein kinase MAPK phosphorylation sequence was found to        be a target of cyclin H and cdk     RAR was shown to        bind the cyclin Hcdk complex in vitro and phosphorylation        of serine  enhanced the transactivation function of RAR        This phosphorylation was required for the RA mediated        differentiation of F cells into parietal endoderm            These studies point to the importance of phosphorylation in        the proper functioning of RARs        Mutation of serine  to alanine in RAR has been shown        to inhibit the basal activation function of the receptor            Other mutations have also been shown to decrease RAR        function RAC cells an RA resistant clone of the        pluripotent P embryonal carcinoma line express a        truncated RAR that lacks part of the ligand binding domain            As a result of this mutation RAC cells do not        differentiate when exposed to RA An RAR clone truncated        after amino acid  was effective in repressing reporter        gene activity and blocking wild type RAR function             A single amino acid change in RAR GE impaired RA        binding affinity and significantly reduced reporter gene        activity from responsive promoters These studies        illustrate the usefulness of dominant negative RAR mutants        in elucidating mechanisms of RA signaling        In the present study we show that RA by inhibiting        cyclin H and cdk expression reduces phosphorylation of        RAR We examined the role of hypophosphorylated RAR by        mutating the cdk phosphorylation site in the receptor        amino terminus SA The SA RAR mutant decreased        proliferation of human cancer cells consistent with        inhibition of the GS phase transition Decreased        proliferation of the mutant clones was associated with        inhibition of EGFR mediated AP expression and ERK        activity similar to the effects of RA This study        illustrates a novel mechanism by which RA inhibits        proliferation ie by decreasing RAR phosphorylation        and that in the absence of ligand hypophosphorylated RAR        can mimic the molecular and cellular changes associated        with retinoid treatment                    Results        The mechanisms which regulate cyclin Hcdk        phosphorylation of RAR have not been elucidated To        determine if RA itself could affect the phosphorylation        status of its receptor we treated SCC and SCC lines        with  M all trans RA for  hours As shown in Fig A        RA treatment decreased expression of both cyclin H and cdk        in SCC and SCC cells by  fold To determine if reduced        cyclin H and cdk expression correlated with decreased RAR        phosphorylation we immunoprecipitated the receptor from        vehicle and RA treated SCC and SCC cells As shown in        Fig B relative phosphorylation levels of RAR decreased        by  fold similar to the reduction in cyclin H and cdk        expression Previous studies have shown that the amino        terminus of the estrogen receptor is phosphorylated by MAPK        proteins     To determine the participation of MAPKs        in RAR phosphorylation we performed RAR        immunoprecipitation on SCC cells treated with the MEKERK        inhibitor PD or p inhibitory drug SB        Treatment with these drugs did not change relative RAR        phosphorylation levels Fig B We concluded that RA        repressed cyclin Hcdk expression which correlated with        reduced RAR phosphorylation levels        RA is a potent inhibitor of cellular proliferation            To determine the effects of hypophosphorylated RAR on        the growth of human cancer cells we expressed an SA RAR        expression construct in SCC cells The serine residue at        position  was previously shown to be the target of cyclin        Hcdk phosphorylation     As shown in Fig         expression of the SA mutant resulted in decreased        relative phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated RAR in        stable clones compared to G resistant control cells To        confirm that this effect was due to expression of the        hypophosphorylated RAR mutant we also created stable        clones expressing either HA tagged RAR or the SA mutant        As shown in Fig  only clones expressing HARAR and not        the HASA mutant showed phosphorylation on serine        residues These experiments indicate that the relative        amount of phosphorylated RAR in SCC cells was decreased        by the SA mutant SCC cells expressing the SA mutant        RAR proliferated at markedly reduced rates compared to        control clones Fig  The SA RAR mutants grew at only         of the rate of G resistant controls in culture        By comparison proliferation of clones expressing HA tagged        RAR was  of G resistant control cells We concluded        that decreased RAR phosphorylation produces inhibition of        proliferation in SCC cells        To determine if decreased proliferation of the mutant        RAR clones correlated with inhibition of cell cycle        progression we performed BrdU incorporation analysis As        shown in Fig  less than half the percentage of SA        mutant cells incorporated BrdU compared to the G        resistant control clones By comparison there were no        significant differences in BrdU incorporation between HA        tagged RAR clones and G resistant control cells These        results indicate that the G to S phase transition of the        cell cycle is inhibited in SA mutant clones To        corroborate this conclusion we examined expression of the        G phase cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p        WAFCipand p Kipin G resistant and SA mutant        clones We also determined the expression of the S phase        marker cyclin A in these cells As shown in Fig         expression of the G phase markers p WAFCipand p        Kipin the mutant RAR clones was up to  fold higher        compared to control cells In contrast expression of the S        phase marker cyclin A was decreased by  fold in two clones        RAR and  and was undetectable in  others RAR and         when compared to G resistant control cells These        results indicate that the decreased proliferation observed        in SA RAR mutant clones is due to inhibition of cell        cycle progression at the G to S phase transition        The antiproliferative effects of RA have been attributed        to its inhibition of AP transcriptional activity            While the SA RAR mutant has been shown to inhibit        transactivation of RA response elements     its effects        on AP activity have not been characterized We first        addressed this issue by transiently transfecting a        heterologous promoter containing a consensus AP site        fused to the luciferase reporter gene    along with        wild type RAR or SA mutant expression vectors In the        absence of ligand the SA RAR mutant inhibited AP        activity from this construct by  similar to treatment        with  M all trans RA Fig  The wild type receptor        possessed slight antiAP activity in the absence of        ligand  reduction compared to control cells transfected        with blank expression vector These results indicate that        hypophosphorylated RAR can mimic the effects of RA by        inhibiting AP activity        To determine if reductions in AP protein levels could        account for the observed transcriptional inhibition by the        SA mutant RAR we compared expression of fos and jun        proteins in G resistant control clones and SA RAR        expressing cells As shown in Fig  Fra expression was        undetectable in  of  RAR mutant clones Expression of        cjun was reduced by  to  fold in the SA RAR cells        compared to G resistant control clones JunB expression        was also decreased by up to  fold in mutant RAR        expressing cells Expression of cfos Fra FosB and        JunD was not detected under normal growth conditions in        SCC cells These results indicate that decreased AP        protein expression correlates with AP transcriptional        inhibition by hypophosphorylated RAR        Upstream of AP transcription factors RA has been        shown to inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR        expression     To determine if hypophosphorylated RAR        could inhibit EGFR expression we examined expression of        the growth factor receptor by western blot in control and        SA mutant cells As shown in Fig  EGFR expression was        undetectable in  of  mutant RAR clones and was reduced        by  in the remaining clone RAR To determine if this        dramatically decreased EGFR expression could inhibit        downstream components of EGF signaling we also examined        activation of ERK a terminal effector in the mitogen        activated protein kinase pathway Activated ERK in SA        mutant cells was expressed at less than  of the levels        found in G resistant control clones Overall ERK        expression was not affected by hypophosphorylated RAR        These results indicate that components of the EGFR        signaling pathway upstream of AP transcription factors        are inhibited by hypophosphorylated RAR        Activation of growth factor receptors has been shown to        induce expression of AP proteins     To determine if        EGF signaling correlated with AP activity in SCC cells        we first incubated cultures in  depleted serum for         hours to inhibit AP protein expression We then        stimulated these cultures with  ngml EGF for up to         hours As shown in Fig  EGF produced dramatic induction        of AP protein expression within  minutes after its        addition cfos expression peaked at  fold over        unstimulated levels at  hours following EGF addition        Following a similar time course cjun expression increased        by  fold following stimulation by EGF Induction of Fra        and JunB expression was also noted although the increase        was of less magnitude than that observed for cfos and        cjun The effects of EGF on AP protein expression were        completely blocked by the EGFR kinase inhibitor tyrphostin        AG data not shown indicating that growth factor        receptor signaling directly correlates with AP protein        expression These data suggest that in the unliganded        state hypophosphorylated RAR can mimic the effects of RA        on EGFR expression ERK activity and AP protein        levels                    Conclusions        The antiproliferative effects of RA have been recognized        for many years This important chemotherapeutic property of        RA has been attributed to a number of molecular mechanisms        Decreased growth factor and growth factor receptor        expression has been proposed as a potential growth        inhibitory mechanism     Additionally RA mediated        inhibition of AP activity is believed to be important in        cellular growth control by this ligand     AP        inhibition via direct interaction between RARs and AP        proteins has been proposed     RA inhibition of jun        Nterminal kinase was shown to prevent cjun        phosphorylation resulting in decreased AP activity            Competition between RAR and AP for limiting amounts        of the nuclear receptor coactivator CBP may also account        for decreases in AP transcriptional activity     In        the present study we have described a new mechanism by        which RA can inhibit cellular proliferation RA inhibited        cyclin H and cdk expression which correlated with        hypophosphorylation of RAR on serine  To separate the        specific role of hypophosphorylated RAR from the        pleiotropic effects of the ligand we expressed a        nonphosphorylatable SA mutant protein in human cancer        cells The SA RAR mutant inhibited proliferation of        SCC cells even in the absence of RA thereby mimicking        the growth inhibitory effect of the ligand This growth        inhibition correlated with a delay in G to S phase        progression EGFR expression ERK activation and AP        activity were inhibited by the mutant RAR effects which        are also achieved by RA treatment alone We determined that        decreases in AP protein expression observed in the RAR        mutant clones were primarily due to diminished EGFR        signaling Therefore while ligand bound RAR has been shown        to activate a large number of RA target genes the        hypophosphorylated form of the receptor created in some        cells following retinoid treatment may be important in        transcriptional repression In support of this hypothesis        RochetteEgly et al    described decreased        transactivation function by the SA mutant RAR        Previously we characterized another RAR mutant in which        the receptor protein was truncated after amino acid         thereby deleting the AF domain     This truncated        receptor exhibited similar properties to the SA mutant        growth inhibition and repression of RA responsive gene        expression including EGFR Repression of RA responsive        gene expression was believed due to the inability of this        RAR to interact with CBP via its shortened carboxyl        terminus     By the same token this mutant receptor did        not affect RA inhibition of AP activity presumably due        to its inability to compete for CBP     We observed        decreased AP activity in transient transfections using        the RAR mutant likely due to decreased EGFR expression        However the mechanisms by which the SA mutant inhibits        RA responsive gene expression is unknown The RAR amino        terminus is not known to interact with CBP or its        associated factor PCAF      Additionally RARs bind        to the interaction domains of repressor proteins such as        NCoR via region D of the receptor rather than the amino        terminus     Despite the lack of obvious interaction of        the RAR amino terminus with nuclear receptor cofactors the        SA mutation may alter the three dimensional structure of        the receptor This altered configuration may prevent the        mutant receptor from releasing repressor proteins or        recruiting coactivators in the presence of ligand The SA        mutant receptor was shown to inhibit ligand dependent        transactivation of RA responsive promoters     but the        mechanism of this reduction eg competition for binding        sites cofactor interaction ligand binding has not been        determined        In summary decreased RAR phosphorylation correlating        with RA mediated inhibition of cyclin H and cdk expression        illustrates a new mechanism by which ligand can indirectly        regulate receptor activation This raises the question of        how RA initially downregulates cyclin H and cdk        expression whether by AP inhibition or through negative        retinoid response elements in the regulatory regions of the        genes The characterization of potentially altered        interactions between hypophosphorylated RAR and its        cofactors will provide unique insight into how        posttranslational modification of nuclear hormone        receptors regulates repressor release coactivator        recruitment histone acetylation and transcriptional        activation                    Methods                  Cell culture and stable transfection          The human
