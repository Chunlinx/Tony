                                 Hail Australia            Its a fine time to bewriting a Victorian novel The last year has been one of Jane Austensbrightest PBS and cable TV have given fresh life to Hardy Scott and allthree Bronts even Dickens got a Hollywood makeover this winter hisGreat                Expectations transported from Kent and London to New Yorkand Florida We have renewed our fascination with the close spaces of th century England and it is with those close spaces the dimhallways and yellow glooms that the Australian novelist Peter Careys JackMaggs reacquaints us            Already abest seller in England and Australia Maggs marks Careys second forayinto Victorian England His first the Booker Prizewinning Oscar andLucinda  is now a major motion picture Carey specializes in thepicaresque in oneman novels about largerthanlife social misfits who mustcope with rotten childhoods loveless families hideous disfigurements andsecret shames Orphans with tics and dwarfs without lips or teeth  JackMaggs and The Unusual Life of Tristan Smith  yearold parricidesand sexually abused teenagers  Illywhacker and The TaxInspector Carey documents their stories in exhaustive loving detailThere is plenty of humor in his books some of it sharp and much of it justplain funny and bizarre bits of magic that though not always comprehensiblecompound a real sense of menace            Jack Maggs offers many of these Carey staples It openswith the return to England of its eponymous hero and uses a combination oflinear narrative and flashback to tell a story that spans several decades Inbroad outline it echoes Great                Expectations  Dickens story ofPip the waif who is befriended by Magwitch the convict though Careys book isalso partly a reflection on how Dickens novel came to be written There arequite a few correspondences between the two novels of which the play on namesis only one Like Dickens Abel Magwitch Jack Maggs has been exiled to theAustralian backwaters Both men have protgs Maggs is Henry Phipps a muchyounger man who we think may be his son Maggs returns from New South Waleswhere he is now a citizen of good repute and considerable wealth to Englandwhere he is still a wanted man to find Phipps whose foppish lifestyle he haslong subsidized It is with Maggs search for Phipps that the story begins            Soon afterhis return Maggs encounters Tobias Oates a novelist and selfstyledcartographer of the Criminal Mind of which Maggs is soon forced to becomethe hapless embodiment Oates cuts a deal with Maggs He will help the convictfind Phipps if Maggs will agree to undergo a series of experiments inMesmerism Their terrible sessions click for a sample anchor the tale andprovide a framework for its telling Through themplus a cache ofinvisibleink letters Maggs writes to Phipps in order to acquaint the protgwith his protectorwe look into Maggs tortured soul and witness an Oates inall but tumescent pursuit of Maggs life story which he will exploit for hisnext best seller            Though there is much that Carey takes fromDickens he manages to separate his story from its archetype quite easilyCareys is a metanovel Great                Expectations  the Australianversionthat takes on the master and his work by first tenderly tucking theminto its pages then slowly exposing their vulnerabilities What we end up withis a sharp postcolonial critique not just of one writer but of novelwriting asa whole            Careylays his trap by hewing close to Dickens in style and mood Maggs London is Dickens London only darker a city whose humanity has long sincerun dry and whose juvenilesthe Twists and Dorrits and Chuzzlewits andMaggsesare forced into lives of crime The year is that of Victoriasaccessionbut we get a sense not of empire or of politely crumpeting tearoomsbut of decay and disease of the moreDickensianthanDickens underside ofrapid industrialization and urban growth            Carey does an impressive job as time traveler and tourguide Maggs is delightfully atmospheric and full of peelaway detailsshitrimmed cobblestones and stinking  The quaintly elaborate namesPercivalClarence Buckle Mercy Larkin

bound thenarrative to Dickens and his doings Carey gives the novel and its themes afull life outside them If youve read the Victorian author you get yourinsiders chuckle If not you still get a good yarn            Careyscareful separation of  th century England from modernday anywheremay be the key to our appreciation of the Victorian world but it is hisportrait of Maggs that allows you to collapse that distance and to reallysettle into his novel Carey gives us the flawed utterly romantic antihero ofhigh Victorian fictionabsurdly tall absurdly shy absurdly proud absurdlytrusting Maggs is a sighted Edward Rochester a kinder Heathcliff His scarredback and missing fingers his tragic isolation from those around him howeveralso make him identifiably Careyesque Of course Carey isnt the first authorto use castaways to dramatize a world gone wrong If anything he makes aremarkably unsubtle play for your sympathies            Careys cheerful hamfistedness turns out to bejust what is called for to correct Dickens lugubriousness Suffice it to saythat when Carey rewrites Dickens endingMaggs unlike the late lamentedMagwitch does not die a miserable deathit is a perfectly delightfulsolution Maggs is given an out In fact all the sympathetic characters in thenovel are given outs They are allowed to transcend their particularpovertiesof class gender or nationalityin a way Dickens granted preciousfew Micawbers Carey even reclaims that slighted continent Australia It isntjust a convenient dumping ground for convicts he tells us with the ticklishpride so typical of the expatriate Carey lives in New York Jack Maggsburgeoning dignity and the choices he makes at novels end give th century Australia the bourgeois stature it lacked in Dickensnovel allowing the country to become a place of hope rather than of exile Bythe same token Jack Maggs  triumphal march burnishes the literarymoment to which its author lays proud claim restoring the th century English novel that muchmaligned instrument ofcolonial oppression to a welldeserved place in the sun
