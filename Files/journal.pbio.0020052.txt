                            The AIDS crisis has brought to public notice what has always been generally truethat        the existing business model for drug development leads to high prices and unequal access        There is now widespread dissatisfaction with drug prices in both the developed Families        USA  and developing world Correa  Governments and health insurers are finding        ways to deny access to the newest and priciest products In the United States and other        countries without a universal public health system the uninsured simply cannot afford the        newest medicines In developing countries lifesaving medicines are priced beyond the        reach of most people a morally offensive outcome TrueVisionTV  Huge publicity        surrounds negotiated price reductions for specific drugs in specific developing countries        yet the effect on the overall access problem is tiny        Todays high drug prices are a direct consequence of a business model that uses a single        payment to cover both the cost of manufacture of a drug and the cost of the research and        development RD carried out by manufacturers to discover it A year patentbased        marketing monopoly is then granted to the drugs developers to prevent their prices being        undercut by generic copies produced by manufacturers who do not have RD costs to        recover Preventing such free riding on RD has become a global trade issue at the        World Trade Organisation WTO Drahos and Braithwaite  The implementation of the        TRIPS TradeRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement and a growing        number of regional and bilateral agreements on intellectual property require most countries        to implement tough patent systems that discourage or eliminate competition from        manufacturers of generic medicines Box         Unfortunately monopolybased business models have unpleasant side effects Since the        primary responsibility of any company is to maximise return on investment it is        unsurprising that there is pressure on pharmaceutical companies to set drug prices to        whatever level gives the highest return excluding those individuals who cannot afford to        pay rather than maximising the number of patients treated There is also pressure to        misuse the power given by patents using them as anticompetitive weapons to block        innovation and extend marketing monopolies And there are growing fears that the huge        growth in the use of patents is in itself starting to inhibit research CIPR         Anonymous  Royal Society  Something that is less well recognised is that this        system is an enormously inefficient way of purchasing RD There is a considerable lack        of transparency in pharmaceutical RD investment but the available data indicate that        only about  of drug sales go towards RD on new products Only about onequarter of        new drug approvals are rated by the United States Food and Drug Administration FDA to        have therapeutic benefit over existing treatments NIHCM  see Figure  Measured by        investment only about onefifth of the  is invested in innovative products Love        a There is also very little research for diseases that primarily afflict the poor        Trouiller et al  WHO         Propping up the present structure for financing RD Figure A is the widely held        belief that the private sector plays a key role in the development of new medicines and        that it is necessary to grant patents to incentivise privatesector financing If this were        true it would make sense to tolerate all sorts of bad outcomes because the fruits of        RD eventually benefit everyone But granting a year marketing monopoly on a        patented invention is only one way to finance RD and the shortcomings of the present        system are increasingly hard to ignore Suggestions for alternatives are beginning to come        from many quarters Baker and Chatani  CGSD  Hubbard and Love  Weisbrod         In this essay we present practical proposals to modify trade rules based solely on        intellectual property so that alternative policy instruments can be used to encourage        innovation                    A New Trade Framework        Analysis of worldwide drug expenditure shows that spending varies but is close to  of        the gross domestic product GDP in most developed and developing countries Love b        Assuming that about a tenth of the revenue from the sale of drugs is ploughed back into        RD on new products that means that countries already indirectly contribute about         GDP to support this This contribution is enforced by trade agreements which require the        granting of patents to prevent free riding via the purchase of generic drugs see Box         Suppose the World Health Organisation WHO developed an RD contribution norm based        upon this or a more appropriate figure and that there was international agreement that        countries evaluated as meeting this norm would no longer be regarded as free riding        Trade rules could then be modified to allow countries to meet this norm         by any means  not just by the implementation of strict TRIPS        intellectual property rules as at present        Countries that met the norm would then be free to decide whether they wanted to follow a        strictly patentbased system as at present with high drug prices for  years or        experiment with new models based on the creation of separate competitive markets for sales        and RD Figure B Countries adopting the latter system would remove patents on final        drug compounds placing them in the public domain This would allow them to become a freely        traded commodity creating a competitive manufacture and sales market with low generic        prices At the same time in order to meet the required RD contribution norm they        would have to create an efficient RD virtual market alongside However the costs of        this would be more than offset by the reduction in drugs prices making substantial savings        for that country overall                    Business Models for an Effective Virtual RD Market        The existing system Figure A despite its failings does lead to the development of        new drugs The challenge in creating a virtual RD market is to find viable business        models for successful drug development in the absence of marketing monopoly incentives        One obvious approach is direct funding of drug development For example the National        Institutes of Health NIH the national agency in the United States already spends         billion per year on research a substantial amount of which is directed towards drug        development including clinical trials The NIH already has a track record in developing        important drugs for severe illnesses such as cancer or AIDS showing that this is a viable        model It is also widely recognised that much of the research carried out across the world        by similar agencies underpins the existing commercial research that leads to new drugs        Governments could expand direct funding for drug development either through the        existing structures in academia or through funding RD arms of existing companies to        carry out specific drug RD Such directed drug development funding could be similar to        existing nonprofit development projects such as those currently resourced to address        treatments for neglected diseases like malaria and tuberculosis TB Examples of such        projects are the Medicines for Malaria Venture wwwmmvorg the Global Alliance for TB        Drug Development wwwtballianceorg the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative        wwwiaviorg the Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative Butler b wwwdndiorg        and the Institute for One World Health wwwoneworldhealthorg        Many are doubtful that increased direct funding would generate sufficient incentives or        be managed efficiently enough An alternative marketbased approach is one in which RD        organisations compete for rewards for specific RD output referred to by economists as        a prize model Wright  Kremer  Shavell and van Ypersele  In a simple        formulation governments would place large sums into a fund that would be allocated every        year to firms that bring new products to market This could work with or without patents        If products were protected by patents or other intellectual property claims the government        could grant compulsory licenses a procedure allowed by trade agreements to override        monopoly rights on a patent in return for compensation to rights owners see Box  and        permit rapid introduction of generic competition The reward system could be a lumpsum        payment eliminating any incentive to continue to market the product or a longterm payout        structure which would depend upon evidence of both usage and efficacy Prize systems could        be designed to be fairly similar to the current system with big payoffs for successful        entrepreneurs but even with this approach there would be huge opportunities to improve        welfare The reward system could be more rational than the existing system allocating        greater rewards for innovative products and less for me too products that do not work        better than existing products Premiums could be given for therapies that address treatment        gaps or for inventions that pave the way to new classes of drugs        Organisations competing for prizes might be expected to behave secretly to ensure that        they are the ones to obtain credit for the fruits of their work However progress in        research is also driven by free exchange of information It may be possible to design        models that both reward RD outputs and at the same time encourage complete and        continuous openness with intermediate research outputs There are now a number of examples        of open collaborative public goods models Cukier  such as those used for the Human        Genome Project The proponents of such models point to the success of GNULinux in the        software field as evidence that major projects can be undertaken with radically different        business models One of the benefits of complete openness is that it allows independent and        open evaluation of RD outputs which helps in the allocation of credit whether in        the form or prizes or new research grants The openaccess publishing movement Brown et        al  has the potential to help in this process by allowing independent analysis of        published science which will help research funding agencies measure research outputs                    Competitive Intermediators        An RD contribution norm established by treaty would ensure that the amount of        money being spent on RD is maintained However new mechanisms would be needed to        collect the money to finance the RD as it would no longer come via drug sales This        could be via general taxation although in countries with a private health insurance system        this may be anathema Many will also worry that a centralised national drug development        agency taking decisions on RD priorities and allocation of funds via prizes or grants        as discussed above could easily become bureaucratic and inefficient        As a possible alternative we propose a competitive financing scheme that would work        through RD investment intermediators These RD funds would be licensed and        regulated like pension funds Their role would be to manage RD assets on behalf of        consumers Individuals or employers would be required to make minimum contributions into        RD funds much as there are mandatory contributions to social security or health        insurance or to pension funds Government would set the required contribution but the        individual or employer would be free to choose the particular intermediator that received        their contributions Intermediators would compete to attract funds to invest in RD on        the basis of their prowess for drug development and upon their priorities Different        business models for financing RD could be tested in such a market with intermediators        experimenting with prize systems direct investments in profit or nonprofit entities open        collaborative public good models or other approaches                    A Change for the Common Good        We believe the economics of a change in the paradigm for funding RD are highly        favourable Taken together the two core steps of changing the trade framework and moving        away from marketing monopolies can change the world in a positive way We can raise global        RD levels as a matter of policy and ensure that resources flow into the areas of the        greatest need and we can do so knowing that the poor and the rich will have access to new        inventions at marginal cost Policymakers will be weaned from their current unhealthy        addiction to everhigher levels of intellectual property rights as the only instrument to        raise RD levels a path that has increasingly reached diminishing returns or become        counterproductive With new instruments to address the overall levels of RD        investment policymakers can more constructively address the wellknown inefficiencies in        the patent system without the fear that global RD levels will suffer and explore        alternative models Butler a At the same time the system of prescribing medicines        will be transformed by a substantial reduction in the distorting influences of the current        multibilliondollar industry of marketing medicines to doctors and increasingly directly        to the public Similarly without marketing monopolies to protect there will be far less        spent to influence the governments that set the rules that regulate such monopolies If        implemented worldwide one of our most vexing ethical dilemmas can be resolved in a manner        that actually promotes the Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health mandate to encourage        access to medicine for all
