              i think you got it   okay uh my first thoughts on capital punishment is i the first thing i want to say is is no just simply because we as human beings dont have the right to take another human beings life   umhum   uh we are punishing someone for taking someones life or in some cases we are punishing someone someone a person for taking someones life and so in effect were committing that same crime   well it sounds like you have really strong views on it   umhum   and i can see that point but i also have this you know i i question i guess i can look at it both ways and just to play devils advocate   right   it never seems right to me that uh we take in people that are criminals and people that are you know   umhum   low income or even middle income that are struggling to provide for their families   umhum   our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people and it just   exactly   that that i find very difficult to swallow sometimes   uhhuh one thing i dont understand is the the whole concept of death row   umhum   okay these people are supposedly i guess waiting to die right okay and there are thousands upon thousands of people on death row and im not saying that   i agree with you there umhum umhum   well i guess i am kind of saying what what are we doing i mean i guess thats the same thing you were saying what what are we doing with these people   it   theyre theyre there we should either take some kind of action   right   or take enough or or go a different route but theyre just   exactly and then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs   oh exactly   you know we could be paying feeding poor people and helping you know   umhum   helping the environment i mean prison is such a waste of a human being it doesnt do anyone any good yes people need to be punished and i do agree with your statement   umhum exactly umhum   that to take a human life is wrong   right   um but you know locking someone up and not getting   but   you know any benefit from that for the person or for society to me is wrong too   and i guess i see both sides in that at the at the same time that im saying that you know were committing the same crime   umhum   i also agree that i mean if theres somebody out there thats crazy and cruel enough   umhum   to kill somebody or in some cases kill several people at one time uh there was a case in Dallas well im sure they havent gone to court yet but   oh exactly well   uh apparently two teenage boys held up a Taco Bell they put four people in a freezer and shot them all now to me that is inhumane and for two people to be out in the world like that i dont i dont want them in my world   thats right thats right   you understand what im saying i im i mean im not for killing anyone   umhum   but i dont want these people around at the same time   we want a safe environment for ourselves and we want to remove them   exactly   but but i think that the whole crux of the problem is no one has come up with a solution   umhum right   that is acceptable that does you know   and   basically you know i i think you know that the whole idea of uh a a death penalty was invented for two reasons it removes removes them from society   umhum   and number two its its kind of uh its the punishment its the ultimate punishment   right   because you know theyve harmed someone and and you know you want to appease the people that have suffered   right   but it it really doesnt take their pain away   umhum and at and at the same time like you said it drains society   umhum but its a   we i think we should be we the same money that were using to build more prisons and make more prison space and put keep these people in prison that same money or half of that money could be used towards uh rehabilitation programs of some sort something to get to to put these people back in society but prepare them first   exactly exactly but that the pob the problem is so incredibly complex i have a friend who works on the pardon and patr parole paroles and she interviews   umhum   inmates all the time that are coming up for parole and she says it is just really frightening   umhum   how easy it is to you know have the prisons release people because theyre overcrowded   exactly   and these people have not benefited from the stay there she says just their emotional state and their way of thinking is so incredibly wrong   umhum   and theres not anything she can do to keep them in you know if they meet certain guidelines   umhum right   you know and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work   umhum and you you want people out of prison you want people to get jobs and and live happy lives   so its umhum   but they cant just walk out of prison and do that they cant just walk out of prison and say okay im going to go a different route   thats right thats right   there has to be some sort of buffer in there some sort of program or and i know this costs money but it couldnt cost anymore money than were already spending   umhum i know i know i i would like to see the money thats been budgeted budgeted for new prisons being put into the research of of an alternate solutions to the problem   umhum   how are we going to fix that Tanya how are we going to make that happen           really how what can we do   what power do we have   oh goodness i mean you know everyones trying to make it   oh   you know in their own little world you know im trying to make it with my job and make you know myself okay and make my family okay   umhum thats right   and its so hard to you know try and be one of the movers and shakers i guess you would call them   hum oh i know i know   umhum   but it it it sounds like you are uh you know interested in whats going on around you and   oh yeah   and uh you know when you have a a voice you do contribute and i guess thats you know what what were meant to do and maybe an opportunity will come by that   right   we will have a chance to make a real change   and i im a broadcast journalist and so i feel like one day i probably will write a book or or something you know and some of these views will be able to come out i work at channel six   oh where where do you work oh you do   here im a im a news reporter   thats great   and so i  i guess im im pretty emotional about crime things like that now ive only been in it for a year but i get to see pretty much uh close up   umhum   you know a lot of things that happen that people dont see uh i got to see get to see a lot of crimes and i get to see you know peoples   exactly   uh pain and things and so when we talk about   right most of us are so sheltered you know   yeah   and a few people in the news that bring it to us and make us see whats out there   exactly umhum   well that youre youre really performing a a benefit to society in doing that   umhum a service yeah but still you know we cant shut we cant i dont i i guess i would like to probably editorialize more we have to just report whats happening we cant say well this is what i think about you know the situation sometimes   um uhhuh   you really want to say that you really want to say what you think or what you think should be done or how you think this court case should have gone or you know thats a   i im just im just agreeing with you when i think of it how difficult it must be to just to give the facts because usually on an issue that you really care about uh you want you want to you know persuade people to your viewpoint   umhum   and youre right that has got to be a challenge sometimes   especially when you are dealing with a a subject like uh capital punishment or something or abortion   right   or something where theres an an no or yes side and you have your side and you have to report both sides   umhum right   but you really dont want to because you have your side   and you have to walk right down the middle with it   yeah yeah so sometimes thats hard but   yeah im sure   umhum   well thats that sounds interesting and ill read your book some day   umhum okay good       all right well it was nice talking to you   i enjoyed it thanks for calling byebye   okay okay byebye
