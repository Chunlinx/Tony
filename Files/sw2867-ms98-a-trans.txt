                do you have any interest in gun control do you would you like to start first uh go ahead oh yeah thats right   well i thought it was interesting that they gave us a scale um i have to kind of think about that as to exactly where i stand im more uh more against gun control than pro i think probably   yeah i guess i would pick a five im not quite sure i i share an interest of of of guns and i have some guns and i have two brothersinlaw who when we get together we go plinking and and one of them hunts and so its talked about it   umhum   i dont quite understand the NRAs uh CIA type stand it seems to me theyd be guns can become an a hobby and it they they take the approach of uh too too hard nosed on it and i dont quite understand i dont i i i mean i my brotherinlaw hunts and and he doesnt need a automatic or semiautomatic gun to hunt   agreed agreed   and i dont quite understand the the Uzis and all that i think those should be banned i think that uh you oh yeah hunters uh should get whatever they think they need but heck weve had hunting rifles rifles for a hundred years and so uh   the military type things   theyre certainly not Uzis and things like that you know   no no i come from a family of hunters and and lots of brothers i have five brothers and and theyve all hunted and and my uh in fact i didnt ever even hardly ever even eat beef until i was about five or six years old as my daddys theory was if you hunt it you better eat it until its gone and then you go to the grocery store and buy what you need and so we always ate venison and its still just about my favorite meat   oh thats uh oh yeah that i think thats great thats a great attitude   and my husband has bow hunted through the years as well as uh hunt with a gun but pretty much now our theory is you know well shoot with a camera unless we need to we you know we both know how to hunt and take care of meat if that occasion should ever arise for our family and we own guns we really have not uh         this isnt just really great hunting country i mean you know theres not a lot of access you almost have to go like to an indoor range or something to to be able for your children to learn gun safety   no right   in a safe situation because you assume have to assume in my mind that anyplace thats out far enough where you could shoot somebody else can be out there plinking at you and your kids you know ive never allowed my boys to have BB guns which by the time my brothers were my sons ages   right   you know they had plenty of BB guns and used them and everything on you know and it was kind of that you know same kind of theory then you know that uh if you shot it you better figure figure out a way to bring it home and eat it or better not ever let mother know that   they had twenty twos yeah well i agree   you know that you were out you know indiscriminately taking out birds or squirrels or whatever   right youre absolutely there there you go i think thats a thats a i   but on the other hand weve eaten a lot of raccoon and possum and turtle all kinds of   youve eaten raccoon and possum   all my i have a little grandmother in Oklahoma and you know thats shell cook anything if you bring it in and you know thats and so my brothers would always hunt those things and   oh my goodness and     you know were a little more but on on the other hand i i dont have a whole lot of patience with people who who dont want to talk about that kind of the end of animals and yet theyre more than willing to go up to Skaggs or you know   oh yeah   Kroger or whatever and buy their chicken and their meat and come home and cook it And you start talking about hunting and they just cringe and you know ooh you know i i i dont go for that you know i that to me is the other end of the coin thats hiding your head in the sand   yeah oh yeah and i i   you know i i have a respect for life and for meat i eat it sparingly but when i eat it i know that you know something something had to die for it so even if it was in a butcher lot   i uh i dont i dont i dont know why the NRA i always said im uh probably a five although i havent really thats not a very well thought out uh since they gave a number system uh my brotherinlaw one of them hunts and the other one is a real collector and we get together we go shooting and ive been a lot of plinking and uh as a kid you know as a teenager wed go to the rifle range and everything and shoot twenty twos and everything   umhum hum yeah yeah   problems we have in society is like today some teenager locally here in the Metroplex used a a twenty two whatever and uh you its on the news if you listen to the news tonight and went after his teacher and fired three or four shots uh at the school now to me gun control is not going to control it but the parents you know a teenager you know below eighteen or whatever the age should be right uh guns should be an adult should be responsible now i think that if you have a gun an adult   thats right how do they get access to that kind of thing you know where   then you have a responsibility for whether you call it locking it up or putting it somewhere where absolutely no teenager can get to it   or a little child i mean think of the times weve seen   thats oh well that includes little kids too yeah   you know a criminal a criminal element is kind of out of my realm i mean personally   yeah   you know i i dont i dont have anybody in my familys ever gone to jail i ive never  known anybody personally who used a gun against themselves or you know or or someone else except well i guess i have in a couple of cases of suicide but still thats not exactly the criminal element that i think of as you know what i am saying go down to the local Eleven and   right im not sure it should be part of a crime bill i think i i i think guns need controls intelligent controls but i dont think it has maybe a one percent relationship directly to crime uh buying Uzis and all that may you know i think that the cops should have the best weapons and whatever they need but i dont think the average uh plinker or hunter needs to go out and buy be able to buy that i dont think he should uh be allowed to buy an Uzi or something   and and i understand that these magazines you know and whatnot that cater to that crowd are very uh you know the mercenary kinds of   oh yeah   things i cant think of some of the names right off but ive heard them that theyre just replete with advertisements for these really uh militarily sophisticated types of weapons mercenary type things is what i think of   i know its its shooting against people you know they go out i ive seen them on TV and they actually have these little clubs where they go out and practice shooting each other you know i mean uh yeah and i i think uh it should be in the hunting realm   and targets yeah yeah   i dont know why the NRA doesnt have nice range you talk about a range youre right ranges are hard to we have them here in Arlington i have one here in Fort Worth i go to but uh i would think the R NRA would take the positive side and open up some nice practice ranges and teach it you know and rather than just uh try to  lobby for it you know they they ought to be come out in the open uh and open up some maybe they do have a lot of good ranges but the ones i go to are just ranges you know i dont   well there used to be uh i grew up in Irving we live in Plano now there used to quite a few along the Trinity River Bottom and whatnot that you could go to and out in Euless and uh area uh um out off one fifty seven and you know those are just es extinct now not even available you know theyve been built up so much around its no longer   yeah well my my my brotherinlaws in San Antonio and he uh theyre theyre closing the the ranges theyre slowly but surely closing so when i go here in Fort Worth its in south part of Fort Worth it is run very well of course it has guns uh to buy   umhum umhum   but they have a state trooper i guess hes in his spare time hes always there with a forty five automatic on his side so that thats the only range ive been to that has a cop there   and yet you know i would think that a practice shooting range the kind of people that it would generate is the last place you probably really have a problem with guns   right no i think thats the ive seen him there are some real amateurs that yeah theres some real amateurs that come i saw one one time when somebody came with with a   but its a nice thought you know   nonhunting one of these and he was just swinging you know swinging moving it around waving it around well pardon me   so is he there for instruction then is he there for instruction the trooper   no hes just there to uh tell everybody hey this is where you aim and watch it youre putting youre endangering the rest of the people   ward off trouble yeah yeah yeah   and of course when you go and take your targets down hes there to make sure that people uh thats what it was people did not totally totally unload their guns when you you when you take your targets down you walk in front of your own guns and he would just look over everyones shoulder and say hey your your guns not unloaded you know you have to unload because you walk out there uh in this particular range uh uh in Fort Worth now the other ranges its always somebody else but   oh      the the inspector would come by and say or the rifle range uh owner would come by and look at everyones gun before he would step in front of you and so you need some sort of common sense as well as expertise with a gun before you put a bunch of dummies out there in front with guns now   thats true well ive been very happy with uh you know the the education that my boys have gotten uh through scouting uh theyre and my husband theyre all scouters and you know a lot of times those things are encouraged you know at uh   oh yeah thats great yeah thats a good question yeah the i own i have girls so they havent been in scouts does does scouting have a gun section where they they teach them twenty twos and all that oh thats great thats great i think thats the way it should be   umhum umhum see theres scout camps and whatnot but once again you know they dont run a range you know that uh but that still is you know all of that i guess is secondary to   they just plink   to that criminal mischief element theyre always going to create and find something to do   yeah yeah i again thats why i dont think it should be part of a criminal or a crime bill because they   a legislative type thing i i  the ones that want them are always going to get them and the ones that the ones that might need them sometime i mean its probably just going to make it more difficult you know for   yeah but we have to look ahead because we weve had the two hundred years worth of uh or more longer rather we came over with guns four hundred years i guess you might say and i think we have to look at it as its not going to solve it next week we just got to look uh   not now  not now   for the next ten or twenty years you know what kind of gun uh not controls gun uh legislature should we have and then itll slowly change its going to take twenty five years or so         maybe to get the the the the guns into a controlled atmosphere where the true hunter you know it has a registered gun and people that allow other children to to get access to a gun should be fined you know
