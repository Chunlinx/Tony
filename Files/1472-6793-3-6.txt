                    Background        Loss of myocytes is thought to contribute to the        progressivedecline in left ventricular function and the        development of congestiveheart failure Recent studies have        proposed that myocyte loss incardiomyopathy can occur by        apoptosis without an inflammatory response reviewedin              In heart failuregrowth stimulation initially        occurs as a compensatory effort tomeet chronically altered        hemodynamic demands and is mediated by systemicandor local        upregulation of mediators of adrenergic pathways andby        various cytokines      However cytokinescan be        directly toxic to cardiac myocytes and result in        increasedapoptotic cell death      Local        upregulationof angiotensin II induces immediateearly        genes which may leadto increased protein synthesis and        myocardial hypertrophy or alternativelymay upregulate        expression of apoptotic proteins such as p incardiac        myocytes The initial increase in circulating        norepinephrineis thought to maintain cardiac function        through inotropic mechanismsHowever a direct cardiac        myocyte toxicity from norepinephrine iswell recognized             Furthermore pressureoverloadand stretch associated        release of angiotensin II has been shownto induce myocyte        apoptosis      In an elegant paper by Telger et al        it has clearly been demonstratedthat cardiac hypertrophy is        initially preceded by a wave of apoptosisof cardiac        myocytes followed by cell growth and a decrease in        programmedcell death     Apoptosis maytherefore be        the consequence of prolonged growth stimulation        adrenergicand reninangiotensin axes of adult cardiac        myocytes which areterminally differentiated Similarly        certain cytokines such astumor necrosis factor can induce        growth as well as apoptosis     As proposed by Telger        et al it isbecoming clear that cell growth and programmed        cell death are infact two linked processes            Over the last five years blocker therapy has become        one ofthe main treatment modalities for heart failure Of        particular interestis the use of carvedilol               Carvedilol is a novel multipleaction neurohormonal        antagonistIts primary activities are nonselective        adrenoceptor blockadevasodilatation mediated through        adrenoceptor blockade andantioxidant activity            In many clinical studiescarvedilol has been shown to        improve left ventricular function andsymptoms in patients        with ischemic heart disease or idiopathic        dilatedcardiomyopathy       andto dramatically        reduce mortality    However it remains unclear how        carvedilol improves ventricular functionin heart        failure        In an animal model of cardiomyopathy that has many        similaritiesto human heart failure we tested the        hypothesis that a reductionin apoptosis may be responsible        for the beneficial effects of carvedilolAs such        attenuation of apoptosis in the myocardium may representa        novel and important mechanism that contributes beneficial        effects onthe myocardium                    Results                  Baseline Characteristics of Dilated Cardiomyopathic          Animals          We have previously shown that removal of furazolidone          from thefeed after three weeks results in progressive          cardiac dilatationand heart failure     At the time          ofrandomization of the DCM group into three groups ie          DCM            notreatment DCM            lower dose carvedilol or DCM            higherdose carvedilol fractional          shortening

   body weight per day to controland DCM turkeys for four          weeks We studied two dosages pharmacologicaland          nonpharmacological as a difference in dosedependency          forcardiac function improvement has previously been          demonstrated byus with another nonselective betablocker             Furthermore we wanted to determine if carvedilol          might exert beneficialeffects independent of heart rate          effects The lower dose  mgkgdid not reduce heart          rate However the higher dose reduced HR byapproximately           for  hours                    In vivo contractile performance of          the heart was assessed bythe determination of fractional          shortening of the left ventricleAs shown in Table and          Figure  fractional shortening was increasedby  and           in DCM            and DCM            animals respectivelycompared to          nontreated DCM animals DCM             Comparedwith baseline values at

incidence of apoptotic          nuclei see below          The body weight was significantly decreased in DCM          animals comparedto control animals p   compared          to control Table  This animal model is associated          withcachexia Carvedilol treatment resulted in a slight          gain of bodyweight  in the DCM            group and  in the DCM            groupcompared with the nontreated          DCM group DCM             Carvediloalso increased the body          weight of control animals p  These data          indicate a favorable effect on cachexia In          nontreatedDCM animals the hearts weighed significantly          less than control heartsp   DCM animals treated          with carvedilol showed a significantincrease in HW          compared to hearts

characterizedexperimental model of dilated cardiomyopathy          with features verysimilar to those found in human heart          failure       Decreased contractile function          reduced fractional shortening ofthe left ventricle and          morphological changes increased heart volumesleft          ventricular dilatation and myocyte hypertrophy are          characteristic featuresof this model               blocker treatment has emerged as an effective          treatment modalityfor heart failure Both in animal and          human studies of heart failure adrenergicblockade          intervention appears to have beneficial effects on          cardiacmyocyte function       Of          particularimportance studies using carvedilol have shown          remarkable improvementsin cardiac performance                andreduction in mortality in humans    We have          previously shown that propranolol a nonselective          blockeris cardioprotective and prevents the          development of heart failurein turkeys when given          concurrently with furazolidone     Similarly          carteolol a nonselective blockerresulted in          improvement in ejection fraction reduction in          ventricularvolumes an increase in developed pressure as          well as an increasein rate of survival in our turkey          model     Improvementin cardiac function was          associated with cellular remodeling of cardiacmyocytes          Cardiac myocytes from hearts treated with a nonselective          blockerie carteolol had normal calcium cycling          normal myocardial energeticsnormal             receptor density as well as          regression of myocytehypertrophy and reduced connective          tissue content     Furthermore administration of          carteolol hasbeen reported to prevent the development of          virally induced cardiomyopathyin a murine model              In a canine modelwith left ventricular dysfunction          produced by multiple sequentialintracoronary          microembolizations long term treatment with metoprolola                      selective blocker has been          reported to preventthe progression of LV systolic          dysfunction and LV chamber dilatation     Similarly          our present findings onthe effect of carvedilol indicated          improvement of left ventricularfunction and smaller LV          volumes Carvedilol prevented progressionof LV systolic          dysfunction and LV dilatation as previously reportedin          other models using blockers               Animals with dilated cardiomyopathy which received          carvedilolshowed significant improvement in LV systolic          function after  weeksNotably the improvement of LV          systolic function in animals treatedwith carvedilol was          associated with a decrease of LV volumes comparedwith          nontreated DCM animals Importantly both doses of          carvedilolimproved LV contractile performance Fractional          shortening  wasincreased by an average of          approximately  and impressively by in some          individual animals These data seem to agree with the          resultsof human clinical studies and are suggestive that          carvedilol notonly slows deterioration of cardiac          function but also improvescardiac function          The trend that the  mgkg body weight dose might not          have beenwell tolerated was demonstrated by some animals          becoming moribundfor a short period after dosing which          might be due to a reductionin heart rate and cardiac          output with resultant reflect tachycardiaWe have          previously shown a negative forceinterval relationship          ienegative treppe in failing hearts with this model              This is in line with data from humanstudies          which showed that when first administered blockers          actually slowheart rate and diminish ejection fraction             The higher dose of carvedilol significantly reduced          heart rate andblood pressure for up to eight hours          Animals that tolerated thehigher dose did nevertheless          benefit from the treatment This issimilar to human          clinical studies where greater benefit is derivedfrom          higher dosages if tolerated                              Apoptosis in Animal Models of Heart Failure          Heart failure is characterized by progressive          deterioration ofglobal left ventricular function over          time The mechanisms responsiblefor the worsening of          cardiac function are not clear Loss of cardiacmyocytes          has been suspected to be a feature of the          cardiomyopathicprocess that contributes to progressive          decline in left ventricularfunction and the development          of congestive heart failure     Evidence supporting          the concept ofmyocyte apoptosis occurrence and          contribution in the progressionof heart failure has been          obtained from a variety of observationsincluding           in vitro studies experimental          animal modelsof cardiac dysfunction and studies on          cardiac tissue obtainedfrom patients with endstage heart          failure                  We sought to evaluate the incidence and the extent of          apoptosisin our animal model of heart failure Using the          TUNEL techniqueas a means of detection we were able to          document the occurrenceof apoptosis in ventricles from          failing hearts which was characterizedby a higher          percentage of apoptotic nuclei when compared to controls          vs  These apoptotic indexes are within the          range of valuesin heart failure reported in the          literature  to          The high          degreeof variability reported in the literature in the          magnitude of apoptosis maybe due to the diversity and          specificity of methods used to quantifyapoptotic          nuclei          When reporting apoptotic nuclei using the TUNEL assay          two observationsshould be considered  although          apoptosis occurred in our modelof heart failure we might          have missed in random histologicalsections evidence of          apoptosis thereby under estimating the severityof          programmed cell death due to the fact that apoptotic          cells undergorapid phagocytosis with the entire process          lasting less than twohours in some cell systems              and  apoptosisin the present study was evaluated at a          single time point when theheart was still undergoing LV          remodeling Hence the documentationof apoptosis at this          stage may not reflect the true magnitude ofits occurrence          during the initiation and transition to heart failureIn          a rat model of pressureoverload hypertrophy produced by          aorticbanding apoptosis appeared to peak at four days          and gradually subsidedafter one month of aortic banding             Therefore a longitudinal study of apoptosis in          failing hearts frominitiation to transition to failure is          worth pursuing In this waythe incidence of apoptosis          can be documented as the heart movesprogressively from          normal to compensated hypertrophy and finallyto overt          decompensated heart failure These animals were in          compensated heartfailure and often in the nontreated          group went into decompensatedheart failure when stressed          during echocardiographic examination          With improved cardiac function there should be a          reduction inactivation of the          adrenergicreninangiotensin axes as well as adecrease in          activated cytokines such as tumornecrosis factorIn          our model of heart failure cardiac function correlated          withthe incidence of apoptosis As described in Table          and Figure there were a higher number of apoptotic          cells in hearts with a reductionin fractional shortening          In contrast control hearts with normalventricular          function showed low rates of apoptosis The extent          andoccurrence of apoptosis may partially explain the lack          of an overallincrease in heart weight in hearts from          nontreated DCM animalsdespite a pronounced increase in          heart size These observationsand the results from          several animal models demonstrate that apoptoticcells          are present in failing hearts suggesting that apoptosis          mightbe a mechanism involved at least in part in the          progression ofheart failure and the reduction of myocyte          mass                          Carvedilol Inhibition of Apoptosis and Improvement          of VentricularFunction          The extent of apoptosis in cardiomyopathic animals was          significantlyreduced by treatment with carvedilol Both          the lower and higherdoses of carvedilol were effective in          decreasing the rate of apoptosisapproximately a           reduction This observation represents animportant          finding in demonstrating the effectiveness of a          cardiovasculardrug to protect against continual cardiac          myocyte apoptosis in failinghearts           in vivo  Furthermore the          inhibition of apoptosisby carvedilol was accompanied by          signs of improvement in left ventricularfunction and          heart size ie reduced LV volume in the          myopathicanimals Whether the improved function small          heart size and decreasedwall stress were responsible for          a reduction in apoptosis is notknown However the          derived cardiac benefit was independent of heartrate          effects because benefit was obtained at both dosages          Our data support the conclusions of Rossig et al in          endothelialcells They reported levels of apoptotic cells          for control andNYHA IIIIV hearts that were similar to          our observations     We similarly believe that the          suppressionof apoptosis by carvedilol is likely due to          its antioxidative propertiesrather than the blocking          effects     Webase this on our observation that a          similar reduction in the incidenceof apoptosis was seen          at both a nonpharmacological no effect onheart rate or          blood pressure as well as a pharmacological doseof          carvedilol In a canine model of chronic heart failure          producedby multiple sequential intracoronary          embolizations metprolol a             selectiveblocker reduced the          incidence of apoptosis supporting our          experimentalobservations with carvedilol    The          incidence of apoptosis was    in heart failure          animalsthat were not treated which is similar to our          findings of   in hearts from untreated animals          with heart failure RecentlyLi et al have demonstrated          that spontaneously hypertensive ratsSHR with symptoms          of heart failure had significantly higher levels          ofapoptotic myocytes than control myocytes    When          treated with an angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitor          thenumber of apoptotic cells in the SHR with symptoms of          heart failurewas dramatically reduced to control levels          controls were SHR withoutsymptoms of heart failure              Kajstura et alhave also reported that angiotensin II          increased the percentageof apoptotic cells in isolated          adult rat ventricular myocytes andthis effect was          mediated by AT receptors    Although ventricular          function was not assessed in these studiesthe          observations raise the possibility that like our          findings withcarvedilol the beneficial effect of          ACEinhibitors or AT receptorblockers in heart failure          may in part be attributed to an inhibitionof myocyte          apoptosis with a resultant improvement in           in vivo cardiacfunction a concept          that needs further study          The data presented suggest that attenuation of          apoptosis mayunderlie the beneficial effect of blockade          on ventricular functionand that the inhibition of          apoptosis can possibly lead to improvementin ventricular          function This represents a novel mechanism to slowthe          progressive deterioration of myocardial function that can          occurin patients with cardiac failure Because reactive          oxygen radicalsplay a role in inducing cell apoptosis             andthe potent antioxidant property of carvedilol              we speculate that the beneficial effectsattributed          to carvedilol ie inhibition of apoptosis and          improvementof LV function are mediated in part by its          prevention of oxygenderived freeradical damage               Our data supportsthis idea                          Therapeutic Significance          With the clear demonstration that cardiac myocyte          apoptosis ispresent in our heart failure model strategies          for prevention ofapoptosis can be tested The clinical          consensus has been that higherdoses of blockade should          incur more benefits on ventricular remodelingHowever          our studies demonstrated similar benefits at a          therapeuticand subtherapeutic dose In light of the          beneficial effect of carvedilolon the progression of          heart failure and its unique multiactionsthat are not          shared by any other blocking drug or by any otheragent          currently used in the treatment of heart failure our          findingsrepresent an important new mechanism of improved          cardiac function          The development of animal models of heart failure in          which apoptosisis an important feature will allow the          modulation of cell deathpathways through targeted          interventions Understanding the roleof specific          signaling pathways in cardiac myocyte apoptosis          anddeveloping strategies to manipulate these          intracellular pathwaysmay provide in the near future          novel therapeutic approaches forthe management of heart          failure                            Conclusions        In conclusion our model of heart failure which shows a        highlevel of congruence with the human condition has been        shown tohave a high level of apoptosis that corresponds        with cardiac failureCarvedilol a nonselective blocker        with blocking propertiesas well as antioxidant        properties significantly reduced the incidenceof        programmed cell death while improving cardiac function        Thiseffect was independent of heart rate lowering effects        ie blockadeThe beneficial effects of carvedilol can        therefore be obtained withsubtherapeutic doses This is a        novel observation and importantin treating patients who may        not tolerate higher doses heart rateand blood pressure        lowering of carvedilol The apoptotic processis linked to        the development and progression of heart failure aswell as        the improvement in cardiac function seen with        blockade                    Methods                  Experimental Design          One dayold broadbreasted white turkey poults          obtained froma commercial breeder were wingbanded for          easy identificationAt seven days of age they were          weighed and randomly divided intotwo groups using a          random number generator The control group n  was          maintained on a normal ration free from any          additivesand the experimental group n   was fed           parts per millionfurazolidone Fz for three weeks          Furazolidone was stopped afterday twentyeight and the          animals were randomized into three groupsone group did          not receive carvedilol treatment DCM            n  whereas the other two          groups DCM            n   andDCM            n   were treated with          carvedilol in the samedosages as respective agedmatched          control animals see followingSimilarly age matched          control animals were randomized into threegroups one          group received no pharmacological agent Con            n   whereas the other two          groups

 However the higher doseof carvedilol resulted in a          significant reduction in heart rate and blood          pressure  for up to eight hours We performeddose          range studies using nine

cardiac cycleswere recorded on a videotape and          the two dimensional images subsequentlyplayed back for          analysis Diastolic left ventricular internal dimension          LVIDdand systolic left ventricular internal dimension          LVIDs were alsomeasured and used to determine the          fractional shortening Fractionalshortening  of the          left ventricle was calculated as LVIDd LVIDs LVIDd                                     TUNEL          Randomly selected hearts from control and          cardiomyopathic turkeypoults were rapidly removed          flushed with PBS and infused with atissue embedding          medium TissueTek OCT Compound Miles Inc ElkhartIN          and frozen in liquid nitrogen Serial  m crosssections          from heartblocks were cut and fixed to coated slides          Frozen heart sectionswere fixed in  neutral formalin           formaldehyde for  minutesat room temperature and          postfixed in MethanolAcetone  for minutes at          C Detection of apoptotic cardiac myocytes was          achievedby direct immunofluorescence detection of          digoxigeninlabeled genomicDNA using the ApopTag Plus in          Situ apoptosis detection kit  FluoresceinIntergen          Purchase NY This method used the TUNEL techniqueto          stain DNA fragments in nuclei of apoptotic cells Tissue          sectionswere then counterstained with Hoechst           stain  gml Sigmaand viewed with an          epifluorescence microscope Zeiss Axiophot equippedwith          filter sets for fluorescein and Hoechst staining To          quantify apoptosisfour to five randomly selected          microscopic fields per section wereexamined The          percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by          countingthe total number of nuclei and TUNEL positive          nuclei apoptoticmyocytes Samples were numbered to          conceal the identity of differentgroups during counting          Sections of interest were
