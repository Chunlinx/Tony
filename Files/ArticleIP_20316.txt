                                 Middle East Stew            A rebuff to PresidentClinton by Saudi Arabias Crown Prince Abdallah at the funeral of King Husseinof Jordan last week was heralded in the Saudi press Thursday as evidence thatthe country wasnt a pawn or a puppet of the United States AbderrahmanalRashed the editor of the leading Saudi daily Asharq alAwsat  wrotethat the heir apparents rejection of Clintons attempt to get him to meetsecretly with Israeli officials in Amman Mr President I think friendshiphas limitsnews of which broke Wednesday in the same paperwas a cause forSaudi pride Perhaps Clinton thought that all Arab leaders could be boughtor coaxed or intimidated he wrote But Saudi policies could not be boughtsince Riyadh was not indebted to Washington The friendship between the twocountries is strong indeed But theres no reason why Saudi Arabia shouldabandon its commitments to the Palestinians Syrians and Lebanese as well asto its own citizens just to please the American president Rashedconcluded            Turki alHamad anothercommentator in the same paper said that the Amman incident confounded thosewho believed that Saudi Arabia was just another pawn on Washingtons chessboardand therefore had probably already established secret links with Israel Hewrote that the crown prince the effective ruler of Saudi Arabia could havemet secretly with Israeli officials as Clinton asked and struck deals withthem behind closed doors subsequently to denounce Israel in the strongestterms as many Arab leaders did But he has consistently applied the principleof transparency and candor believing this to be the best guarantee of soundpolicy His rejection of Clintons proposal is consistent with Saudi Arabiaspolicy of not officially recognizing Israel until the Middle East peace processhas reached a successful conclusion at which point Riyadh will make theappropriate decision Hamad added Saudi Arabia has already said all thesethings So what would have been the point of a secret meeting That isundoubtedly what Crown Prince Abdallah had in mind when he turned down the USpresidents proposal            A lKhaleej  a daily from the United Arab Emiratesclaimed Thursday that the United States helped Turkey capture its most wantedman the Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan in exchange for Turkey abandoning itspolicy of rapprochement with Iraq Commentator Mohammed Idriss wrote in thepaper that the betrayal of Ocalan had been preceded by another betrayalthatof the Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz Aziz went to Ankara at the invitationof Turkeys proIraqi Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit to discuss closer economicties and the problem of Kurdish separatism which both countries feel is beingfueled by the United States mismanagement of the Iraqi crisis            Baghdad also saw the visit as an opportunity topersuade Turkey to withdraw logistical support for American bombing raids onIraq and to speed up the erosion of international sanctions against it Yetwhen Aziz arrived in Ankara President Suleyman Demirel bluntly refused to meethim and he found himself boycotted by Turkeys political parties Theexplanation for this had to be collusion between the US and Israeliintelligence services both of them highly active in Kenya to deliver Ocalanto the Turks            Idriss wrote that Greecemust have been put under enormous US pressure to have agreed to be involvedin Ocalans abduction And for the US to be prepared to exert so muchpressure on Greece on Turkeys behalf the price must have been worthwhile headded At this juncture in particular what better price could there have beenthan sabotaging any attempt to effect an IraqiTurkish rapprochement ThePanArab alQudsalArabi also saw the delivery of Ocalan to Turkey as its reward fortoeing the US line on Iraq In the Gulf state of Bahrain the dailyalAyyam said that Ocalans abduction boded ill for Osama bin LadenAmericas most wanted man He too had the intelligence agencies of severalcountries on his trail            Without directly addressing the question of Israeliinvolvement in the abduction of Ocalan the moderate Israeli paper Haaretz said in aneditorial Friday that the affair had shown the narrow and verydangerous line that Israel walks in its ties with Turkey It said there wasno doubt that the military alliance with Turkey is one of the most importantIsrael has ever signed with any country and that this type of allianceinherently involves targeting common enemies or at least fosters theexpectation that an agreedupon map of common threats and dangers be drawn upThe Kurdish question has naturally found its way onto this map of commoninterests But Israel has always had very good relations with the Kurds whoalso see the Israelis as their friends Consequently Israel must make a verysharp distinction between Turkeys war with what it defines as a terroristorganization and its ideological and cultural struggle with the Kurdishpeople the editorial concluded In the aftermath of the tragic incident inBerlin this distinction must now be expressed openly and publicly in such amanner to make it clear to the Kurds that we are still their friends            The Italian paperswhich see Turkeys human rights record as a serious impediment to its ambitionto join the European Union reacted with outrage Friday to a photograph issuedby the Turkish government showing Ocalan blindfolded and manacled in front ofthe Turkish flag LaStampa  in a frontpage comment called it a punch in the stomachcomparing it to other sadly unforgettable photos such as those of the dead CheGuevara the napalmburnt little girl during the Vietnam War and thedespairing Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro as a prisoner of the Red BrigadesThe difference in this case though was that the photo was propagandamaterial of a government which calls itself democratic a government of ourtimes the paper said
