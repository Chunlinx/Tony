                                 Mad as Hell                         Antonin Artaud suffered hisfirst depressive breakdown at  at  he was diagnosed with hereditarysyphilis his parents in addition were first cousins He was treated withlaudanum which initiated a lifelong drug addiction Although in nearlyconstant physical painhe had contracted meningitis when he was five and theheadaches continued for the rest of his lifeand mental anguish he functionedreasonably well until the age of  when a number of psychotic incidentscaused him to be confined in a psychiatric hospital He suffered from what wasdescribed as incurable paranoid delirium and left that asylum only to enteranother In all he spent roughly  of his  years in institutions of onesort or another            For all that he wasextraordinarily productive His collected writings fill  volumes in theFrench edition He was trained as an actor and went on to direct found hisown theater and write a set of visionary theoretical essays collected asThe Theater of Cruelty  that have continued to influence theatricalpractitioners to this day He also acted in films his performances are few butindelible from his matineeidol turn as the empathetic monk in Carl TheodorDreyers The Passion of Joan of Arc  to his part as Marat in AbelGances Napoleon  in which at one point he breaks off adiscussion by getting down on all fours and barking like a dog He was an earlymember of the surrealists and director of the groups Central Research BureauHe was drummed out by Andr Breton after two yearsnearly all members wereexpelled sooner or laterbut Breton eventually repented calling him a man ofprodigies and perhaps the truest surrealist of all            Artaudswork in his many fields is consistent and interwoven but it is not easy todefine It is above all a monument to frustration one long scream of protestat the inadequacy of language of human society of the body and the mindArtaud was a revolutionary who was fighting for the overthrow of theconstraints that define consciousness It is as if he could just make out thepenumbra of some spiritual essence on the far edge of his perception and wasmaddened by his inability to seize it He described all his work asdocumentsthat is not the poems essays polemics they seem to be andcertainly not art but mere records of his flailing attempts to reach theelusive substance of Truth            The drawings currently on exhibit at the Museum of ModernArt he likewise qualified as documents These drawingsthere are roughly itemsare products of the last decade or so of his life he died in  arenot well known and have never before been shown in this country They aresingular and powerful works gathered together they possess a clobberingforce They seem to come out of nowhere while prefiguring all sorts of latertendencies in art It seems absurd to think that the evolution they presentcovers only  or  years rather than an entire career but then Artaudhardly thought in terms of a career            Theearliest works are described as spells These are blessings and curses hewrote on charred or otherwise manipulated bits of paper and sent to friendsenemies and a few public figures Hitler for one in the late s in thewake of a disastrous trip he took to Ireland wielding a cane that he believedwas the staff of Saint Patrick from which he returned in a straitjacketThese spells are nowhere translated or transcribed and the handwriting isoften indecipherable One of the few I could make out addressed to the actorRoger Blin reads in part All those who have acted to prevent me from takingHEROIN all those who have laid a finger on Anne Manson a friend on account ofthat Sunday illegible May  I will illegible them alive on a square inPARIS and I will cause them to be perforated and burn their marrow            Artaud began drawing in earnest around  By he was making large tableaux of what he called hieroglyphics fields ofhuman figures symbolic objects and words many of them in invented languagesSome of these drawings in precise pencil with hints of color have adiagrammatic quality that seems oddly evocative of Saul Steinbergs workindeed divorced from context some might at first be mistaken as whimsicalThere are multiple breasts various penile objects including cousins of Dalspenisoncrutch and details that might derive from alchemical symbology            In the pencil work became heavier and more insistent the colors more assertivethe nightmare aspects harder to miss A work entitled The                Theater               of                Cruelty  for example shows a number of women apparentlyencased in glass coffins an exceedingly cryptic stew of geometric andbiomorphic elements is called The                Sexual                Awkwardness               of                God  In May  he produced his first selfportrait It isso heavily scored that it looks nearly sculptural and it is covered with dotsthat look like smallpoxan essay in the catalogue cites Freud by way ofGilles Deleuze on the schizophrenic aptitude for perceiving the surface andskin as if it were pierced with an infinite number of little holes ABlue                Head made around the same time is even scarier caught inmidscream all covered with those diseased dots with occluded eyes and abanana neck It is convincingly a face from hell            In  Artaud moved from the psychiatric hospital atRodez to a sort of halfway house at IvrysurSeine where he had more mobilityand was able to receive visitors These he drew in a series of penetrating andquite varied portraits Rolande Prevel for example is given almost a Matissetreatment Colette Thomas is rendered with a delicacy that amounts totenderness while Jacques Prevel seems to have been sawn in two and restitchedany old way Mania Ofer turned into an owl Arthur Adamov fashioned from flungmud with a penis for a nose Adamov was the author of Ping                Pongand other plays the other portrait subjects are mostly unknown to me Artaudwas clearly an excellent draftsman but as he notes you must look at thedrawings and see whats inside  He also writes that the human face isan empty force a field of death and that the alignment of form and contenthas never been farther off than in the contrast between facial features andwhat lies beneath them His portraits are so uncompromising they make Picassosor Giacomettis look polite            By the end just before hisdeath from rectal cancer a grimly appropriate fate for the author of TheSearch for Fecality in which he asks Is god a being If he is he is one ofshitshit being in Artauds view of human essence and the sole alternativeto the void he was beginning to draw complex heavily laden constructionsthat look like architecture made from headsin the very last drawing they arestacked as in so many totem poles They are anything but morbid though theypossess a vivid throbbing life These drawings appear to synthesize all thepreoccupations of the phases of his previous three years they fluidly combinethe diagrammatic the nearlyrical and the excruciating Here again Artaudsferocity anguish and hallucinatory paranoia are matched and joined by hisintelligence and paradoxical control            Artaud may have been mad buthis art is hardly confined to madness The portraits in which he used calmobservation and academic skill to depict external reality while representingthe interior through distortion and papertearing physical force are moretroubling than many of the interestingly sciencefictional renderings of hisvisions for example His work can no more be dispatched into some rubric likeoutsider art than that of Blake or Hlderlin Artauds art is insidious itspenetration of what we know is so acute its lucidity so much the equal of itsdelusion that deciding where the one leaves off and the other begins can seemmerely a measure of our own delusions
