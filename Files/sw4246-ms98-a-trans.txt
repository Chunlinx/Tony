        okay       so what do you think about space flying   uh well uh i was just reading something on it as a matter of fact uh just got uh latest copy of uh Analog magazine and it had an article in it on uh uh a new   oh yeah   a new version of propulsion that theyre looking at um are you familiar with uh the solar sail idea   umhum yeah i i i have read a couple articles on it yeah   uh well this is apparently what they call a magnetic sail   oh okay   um basically they just uh set up a large uh magnetic field and uh its works a lot like sailing on the ocean uh and is a lot more flexible than using solar sails   right hm so basically would they uh would they essentially in terms of magnetism magnetism would they go like reverse polarity there so youd actually get pushed along or would it be actually a draw   um thats the thing about it is you can switch it depending on the circumstance   oh interesting   um and it also works uh you can use it to uh pull yourself out of like a low earth orbit uh by using the earths magnetic field and moving from there and it also acts like um   umhum right   like a uh uh uh i dont know its called its a its a shield against uh radiation and and flare and that sort of thing because it builds up um   static charger   it builds out a a magnetic barrier around it uh kind of like the earths magnetoshpere and uh protects the people that way yeah   right oh thats pretty interesting yeah yeah personally i think that uh we dont spend enough on space exploration and i think we probably should spend more just because it you know it it not only benefits uh   yeah   space per se but it also benefits technology you know you start to develop things specifically for space use and you know the offspring technologies can benefit a whole lot of different aspects of society so thats   its that and you also have the benefit of the things that you just dont know about yet i mean the biggest the biggest uh thing that comes from   yeah   space exploration i think is not uh those developments we make in order to accomplish it but those things that we discover that we have no idea were going to discover its its all the surprises the problem with that is you cant   sure yeah its it   preach that as as a political statement you know in front of congress saying we should fund it because we dont know what were going to discover     yeah thats kind of thats kind of hard to defend in some ways but you know also you got to consider that       its this space exploration could give us a lot of different view points on on current problems um primary of which in my mind right now is uh the whole thing with uh the depleting ozone ozone layer you know i was reading an article about that the other day and its amazing really amazing how much were losing uh how much of the ozone layers really disappearing theres an article in Time magazine about it but you know things like that can be very well uh studied from space you know and using satellites and space technology and things like that   umhum   uh i think thats real important and if we if we dont look at that closely we could be really screwing ourselves uh i dont know its its its an its an interesting thing because its like you said some of the positions seem untenable at least when youre trying to defend them in in congress and things like that people tend not to have a very long term view like to look at more uh more short term problems which you know theyre logical and theyre and theyre very prevalent you know things like world hunger yeah thats a big uh thats a big problem um but youve got to have a long term view as well   yeah the problems with things like world hunger are that throwing money at it doesnt make it go away it just it just it stop gap um   yeah yes exactly most people will will try to to solve the symptoms without really looking at the uh the problem itself   yeah with space exploration its a lot like um like trying to jump into a new industry youve got huge start up costs uh lot bigger in this case than in most others but once youre established there   umhum   i think it would you know i think its obvious to everyone that it would be highly profitable uh once youve reached a certain level it just takes   right you start   that rather substantial long term commitment you know for a for a number of years or or even several decades in order to to get it up to the standard where you need it uh in order to go from there um   sure where where do you work   where do i work um i used to be uh an auditor uh for one of the big six accounting firms im currently uh   uhhuh oh okay   uh running uh a game or one of the three principal partners in a game company   oh okay great yeah i was just i was asking because its interesting to see where were both coming from i personally am kind of biased  because right now im working for Honeywell   um umhum
