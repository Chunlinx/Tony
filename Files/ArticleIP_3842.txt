                                                            ThePlague Cheer                        Hey wait a minute Despitewhat Jon Cohen asserts in AIDS Isnt Over nothing in my New York Times               Magazine article stated that AIDS is over There are two full paragraphson the unknowables and imponderables of the new drugs There is an explicitstatement early on that in one sense obviously it is not over by which Imean the fact of many many more deaths from HIV including eventuallyprobably my own and a clear assertion that nothing I am saying here ismeant to deny that fact or to mitigate its awfulness The quote he keepsusing as his smoking gunthis ordeal as a whole may be overis wrested froma fuller sentence which reads Perhaps this is why so many of us find it hardto accept that this ordeal as a whole may be over It follows a sectiondevoted to the description of someones gruesome death Blithe optimism Giveme a break The very title of the pieceWhen Plagues Endis deliberatelyand carefully conditional            Cohen isobsessed with the idea of a vaccine This is understandable since he hasdevoted a good deal of his journalistic career to the notion that AIDS willonly be cured by a vaccine He may be right although the obstacles to asuccessful HIV vaccine are enormous but he shouldnt let his own agenda blindhim to a simple fact HIV may not be cured but it may be successfullytreated for decades For those of us with HIV theres not a lot ofdifference                           AndrewSullivan                                       Jon CohenReplies                        Andrew Sullivan steers clearof my main criticism of his articlethat it overstates the hope that nowexistsand instead resorts to unfounded suggestions that Ive ignored hischecked tone taken his writing out of context andmost absurdlynitpickedhim because I am obsessed with AIDS vaccines and have an agenda            Sullivans article as itssubhead states is an exploration of the twilight of an epidemic thatreflects repeatedly on why it is difficult for HIVinfected gay men inparticular to consider the possibility that new drug regimens will allow themto survive this plague The ideas he examines often with insight and delicacyhave to do with things like past vs future loss of community and excessiveskepticism The passage he accuses me of having wrested out of context isjust such a musing And he gives short shrift to another more pertinent ideaPerhaps many infected people find it hard to accept that this ordeal as a wholemay be over because they have yet to see evidence that these drugs will extendtheir lives beyond a year or two And the gruesome death he recounts prior tothis musing is not as far as we can tell about someone who responded well tothe new treatments only to die too young and too painfully Rather hedescribes the death to set a marker in time raising the possibility that suchhorrible experiences now may be in the past            When Sullivan writes hereabout the caveats his article contains he is taking himself out of contextThe one sense he is referring to about the epidemic not being over isdirected at newly infected people and those who cant access or afford thedrugs Although he does describe attending a meeting where physicians detailseveral unknowns for people taking the drugswhich I state in my articlelisting further several other unknowns that he doesnt mentionhe does soalmost wearily There were caveats of course he writes The dismissive toneis critical to his entire argument because if he squarely reflected on thegreat uncertainty that now exists about the impact of the new treatments hewould undermine the foundation of an exploration of The End His analysis wouldseem in a word premature and that is essentially my problem with thearticle            As for Sullivans claimsabout my obsession and agenda give me a break True I have written agreat deal about AIDS vaccines and I have a particular interest in thesubject Ive also written thousands of column inches about most every othertopic relating to the disease And I have written and continue to write aboutmany things that have nothing at all to do with AIDS You could look it up            FinallySullivan mixes up cure and prevention The AIDS vaccines Im speaking ofare designed to prevent an infection and thereby stem an epidemic If drugs doextend the lives of infected people for say decadesand I hope they do andthat Sullivan is wrong about his own fateI too would use the word cureBut unfortunately we have to sit and wait for studies that are underway tofinish before we can predict the future with something more statisticallypowerful than hope                           The LockIs a Crock                        I just wanted to addsomething to Jacob Weisbergs Republicans in Denial his amusing commentary on theRepublicans unseemly bout of whining blaming and rationalizing followingthis years elections            One otherrathercuriousexplanation for the Republican defeat in the  presidential racewas proffered by a member of Bob Doles polling staff During an electionpostmortem televised on CSPAN she suggested that it would have been verydifficult for Bob Dole to win the presidency in the Electoral College sinceaccording to her Bill Clinton went into this election with some electoralvotes already locked up based on the results of the  election As evidenceof this she painstakingly detailed Clintons electoral assets state by statein the Northeast Midwest and West By the time she was finished one couldonly conclude that Bill Clinton was predestined to win reelection            It was quite interesting tohear this said out of the blue about a Democratic presidential candidate Itwas a mere five years ago I recall that conservative commentators werecrowing about the supposed lock that the Republican Party had on theElectoral College based on its the partys strongholds in the South andMountain West This was supposed to guarantee Republican presidential supremacyforeveror at least until the name Ronald Reagan had slipped into the wellsof history            Well amere eight years after Reagan uttered his last valedictory words it would seemthat the Democrats did in fact have a chance at the presidency onceagain                           John Treumann                                       FightNight at Slate                        As much asI get a cheap thrill from exploring the world of scholarexpert rivalry in yourmagazine the Thanksgiving issue was beyond the pale Krugman vs WanniskiWright vsGould and particularly Krohn Plotz vs Hackworth were all heavy on the feuding and light on the facts Iprobably agree with all your writers assessments its just that Id hate tosee the
