                    Background        Much has been written in the last decade about the        potential of transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS as a        new diagnostic and therapeutic tool in clinical        neurophysiology       TMS is a painless and        noninvasive technique for stimulating cortical tissue by        means of magnetic induction TMS has been used to map the        motor cortex by recording evoked responses and appears to        show potential for treating certain brain disorders from        Parkinsons disease to depression A disadvantage of TMS        however is its inability to localize the site of        excitation in the brain to a volume less than several tens        of cubic centimeters at best This is because the spatial        distribution of the magnetic fields cannot be effectively        concentrated or focused In fact because the fields obey        Laplaces equation it is impossible to create local maxima        in the field intensity no matter what the configuration of        source coils in a homogeneous conducting medium the field        strength will always be largest at the surface and fall off        monotonically at greater depths        In this paper we propose a different method of        stimulating cortical tissue which in principle could        permit much greater localization of the site of excitation        as well as deeper penetration into the brain The idea is        to induce electrical currents by propagating an ultrasonic        wave in the presence of a strong DC magnetic field The        currents are generated by Lorentz forces on moving ions        produced by the oscillating sound wave         We present here an analysis of the distribution of the        electric field induced by an ideally collimated ultrasonic        beam in a homogeneous conducting medium The analysis        allows us to calculate the magnitude of the electric field        strengths that can be expected and shows that the highest        practical fields that can be induced by ultrasound up to        about  Vm are about an order of magnitude lower than        those associated with TMS Such fields have been reported        in the literature to range between about  and  Vm            We note however that the spatial and temporal        character of the ultrasonicallyinduced fields are quite        different from those induced by magnetic induction One        such difference is that the spatial variations of the        ultrasonicallyinduced fields are much more rapid than the        fields associated with TMS since in the former case the        fields change on the scale of the ultrasonic wavelength        eg less than a millimeter Thus the magnitude of the        gradients of the ultrasonicallyinduced electric fields can        be comparable to those associated with TMS depending on        the ultrasonic frequency eg at  MHz a gradient of        about  kVm is attainable This may be significant        since activation models predict that the gradient of the        field rather than its strength is primarily responsible        for neural stimulation      However researchers have        also speculated that field gradients induced by        cellularscale inhomogeneities in the tissue conductivity        may play a more important role in neural stimulation than        the spatial variations of the impressed fields                The latter question is important in deciding whether        the potentially large impressed field gradients induced by        ultrasound are truly an advantage in effecting stimulation                A second difference between ultrasonic stimulation and        TMS that may have some practical significance for exciting        neural tissue is related to our greater freedom in        controlling the time dependence of an ultrasonic pulse        compared to a TMS pulse We show below that the temporal        dependence of the electric field and the induced current        density follows that of the ultrasonic waveform Although        the duration of a TMS pulse is typically on the order of a        few tenths of a millisecond and the ultrasonic variation is        on the order of microseconds or less roughly the        reciprocal of the ultrasonic frequency considerable        control over the shape of the ultrasonic waveform is in        principle possible For example one can transmit an        ultrasonic pulse train at essentially any repetition        frequency or modulate a continuous ultrasonic wave in a        variety of ways        For neural excitation to take place the magnitude of        the induced electric field or its gradient must exceed an        activation threshold It is generally believed that        excitation that is oscillatory in time makes this process        more difficult For example simulations carried out by        Reilly suggest that using a sinusoidal stimulus the        activation threshold increases monotonically with frequency        beyond a few kHz     However Reilly also reports that        a series of rapid pulses where the repetition period is        short compared to the depolarization time constant the        latter being a few tenths of a millisecond is a much more        effective stimulus than a pure sinusoid Reilly describes        this as the integration effect of multiple pulses If the        individual pulses are monophasic the activation threshold        is considerably reduced compared to a single monophasic        pulse For example Reilly reports that the integration        effect of a series of rapid pulses each  microsec in        duration with a repetition rate of  kHz reduces the        activation threshold by a factor of  relative to a single         microsec pulse        A key question is whether a series of pulses of this        kind can be generated ultrasonically Certainly the  kHz        rate is feasible A second question is whether one can        create an ultrasonic pulse that is approximately        monophasic With some ingenuity the answer appears to be        yes For example although an ultrasonic pulse must have a        zero DC component the pulse need not be symmetric that        is the positivegoing excursion of an ultrasonic pulse        can under certain conditions significantly exceed the        negativegoing excursion which would approximate a        monophasic waveform A simple example of the latter can        be achieved with the aid of an ultrasonic transducer that        is nonsymmetric eg a transducer whose length is much        greater than its width In this case there is a large        positive excursion followed by a much longer but weaker        negative excursion an ultrasonic wake Another way to        alter the shape of an ultrasonic pulse is by transmitting        it through a dispersive medium that acts as an ultrasonic        filter or by using multilayered transducers        Although in our analysis we shall for simplicity        assume a static magnetic field an alternative approach is        to use an optimallydesigned magnetic pulse produced by a        conventional TMS coil to bring the neural tissue close to        its activation threshold but not exceeding it TMS coils        create fields although transient in the range of  T to         T An ultrasonic pulse or series of pulses if properly        timed could then push the membrane potential past        threshold In this way the locus of activation would still        be determined by the ultrasound although deep stimulation        might still be difficult because the field intensity        produced by a TMS coil falls off rapidly with depth a        problem avoided by using a static field It is worth        noting that the idea of using a conditioning pulse of this        kind was suggested by Reilly     but in a somewhat        different context Reilly proposed using two coils one        that produces a conditioning pulse Reillys phrase to        achieve  of the excitation threshold then a second        nearby coil excited by a sinusoidal waveform of frequency         kHz in Reillys example would push the membrane        potential beyond threshold His idea was that the        combination of coils is more effective in achieving greater        focality or localization of the stimulus than a single        coil Using a mathematical model of neural activation        Reilly predicts that this combination of signals the        conditioning pulse plus the  kHz sine wave will achieve        activation One could speculate that instead of the  kHz        sinusoidal signal the conditioning pulse could be        accompanied by a series of ultrasonic pulses at a rate of         kHz or whatever rate is determined to be optimal It        may turn out that these questions can only be settled by        experiment or by sophisticated modeling of the neuron in        the presence of a realistic ultrasonic wave                    Method                  Concept          Localized electric currents can be induced in tissue          by propagating ultrasound in the presence of a magnetic          field Consider for example an ultrasonic pulse          propagating in an electrolytic fluid such as soft          tissue in the presence of a static magnetic field          oriented in a direction perpendicular to the propagation          path The longitudinal particle motion due to the          ultrasonic wave moves the ions back and forth through the          magnetic field this results in Lorentz forces on the          ions that give rise to an electric current density that          oscillates at the ultrasonic frequency This idea was          used as the basis of Hall effect imaging proposed by          Wen    in which Lorentz forces are employed to image          the electrical conductivity of tissue Montalibet et al          also noted that propagating ultrasound in the presence of          a magnetic field will generate electric currents in          tissue     They also proposed using this effect to          measure the electrical conductivity of tissue          Here we propose a new application localized          stimulation of active nerve or cortical tissue by          ultrasonicallyinduced electric fields Our objective in          this paper is to compute the magnitude and the spatial          distribution of the these fields We shall show that          analytical solutions for the field distribution can be          derived for an ideally collimated ultrasonic beam                          Theory          Consider an ion in a conductive medium with charge           q  The longitudinal particle          motion of an ultrasonic wave will cause the ion to          oscillate back and forth in the medium with velocity           v  In the presence of a constant          magnetic field           B             the ion is subjected to the          Lorentz force                    F            q           v            B                       This produces an electric current density given by                    J                        n                      u                       n                      u                       F            where           u            and           u            are the mobilities of the positive          and negative ions assumed to have charges of           q and            q  respectively and           n            and           n            are their concentrations Combining           and  gives                    J                       q            n                      u                       n                      u                       v            B                       But the electrical conductivity  of the medium is          given by                      q            n                      u                       n                      u                       so that

be regarded as a complex quantity to account for          polarization or displacement currents at higher          frequencies From  the equivalent electric field          is                    E                       v            B                       The field           E             and the current density           J             oscillate at the ultrasonic          frequency in a direction mutually perpendicular to the          propagation path the direction           v  and the magnetic field           B                      For convenience we assume harmonic excitation of the          ultrasonic wave of the form exp           i            t  Since all our equations are          linear an arbitrary time dependence can be treated by          Fourier synthesis In the following the time dependence          of all quantities both ultrasonic and electromagnetic          will be exp           i            t  so this factor is dropped The          ultrasonicallyinduced current density           J            can be regarded as an impressed          current density that gives rise to scattered or          secondary electric and magnetic fields           E                       s            and           B                       s            that obey the Maxwells equation                     B                       s                                    E

replacing  everywhere with             i  where  is the tissue          permittivity At a frequency of about  MHz and using          typical values for tissue the quantity  will be one to          two orders of magnitude less than           Substituting  and  into  we have                     B                       s                                    E                       s                       E                       In this equation the impressed electric field is           E             given by  and           E                       s            is the induced electric field whose source is the          Lorentzinduced current density  The total electric          field is the sum                    E            E                       s                       E                       and the total current density is                    J             E                       s                       J                        E            Here our objective is to compute the induced

       and           c            is the ultrasonic wave speed          Although this beam is idealized eg it neglects          spreading  is a reasonable approximation to a          focused ultrasonic beam in the region of its focus In          the presence of a magnetic field           B                       B             the resultant Lorentzinduced          current density is predicted by  to be                    J                       r             B                      v                       p            r             When this current density is substituted into  one          can solve for the induced electric field           E                       s             using standard techniques As shown in the          appendix the components of           E

of          the first and second kind At this point for an          arbitrary beam profile           p            r  one must resort to a numerical          integration of  However the integrals can be          evaluated analytically for the special case of an ideally          collimated ultrasonic beam whose radial profile is          defined by                    where           a is the beam radius Substituting           into  we find                        Inserting this result into  we obtain the          components of the induced electric field           E                       s

      P                       r                       a  and           Q                       r                       a  however we see that the          radial component of the field is discontinuous on the          boundary indicating charge accumulation there This          charge of course oscillates at the ultrasonic          frequency The radial electric field discontinuity is          seen to be                     E            B                      v                       Q                       r                       a             P                       r

        Let us evaluate these functions on the beam boundary                     r            a  The arguments of the Bessel          functions are           k                      a             a  so that for           a greater than a few wavelengths          we can use the large argument asymptotic approximations                                 which gives                    where we have defined           E                       B                      v            as the magnitude of the impressed          electric field as seen from           Several comments about this solution are worth noting          First for a beam with a perfectly and unrealistically          sharp boundary at           r            a  the radial component of the          electricfield gradient is infinite on the boundary This          is a mathematical artifact of our solution since the          electric field is discontinuous at           r            a  For a real beam the transition          is much more gradual on the order of an ultrasonic          wavelength or more and charge distribution on the beam          boundary will be distributed over this transition region          A second point is that a numerical integration of           for a more realistic beam profile           p            r  that falls off more smoothly          than  such as a Gaussian profile results in an          electric field smaller in magnitude at the beam boundary          than that given by  and  Thus the above          analytical solution provides a useful but very          qualitative picture of the field behavior at the beam          boundary It can also be seen from the expressions           that the induced field is near zero at the          center of the beam            r   In fact  predicts that          the           z component of the induced field          is exactly zero at           r   and that the other components          are very small compared to           E            at           r   The latter statements also          hold true for a Gaussian beam profile as a numerical          integration shows This is a consequence of the fact that                    E                       s            arises essentially due to charge accumulation in the          vicinity of the beam boundary Thus on the beam axis          the total electric field           E                       E                       s             is close to the Lorentz induced field           E                      We next consider the gradient of the electric field          For activation we are interested in the rate of change          of the component of the electric field along the          direction of the axon If we regard the significant field          as           E            only then we note that this field          is perpendicular to the beam axis while the largest          component of the gradient points along the beam axis and          is given by the derivative of           E            with respect to           z  If the axon is oriented at an          angle  with respect to the beam direction then the          component of the electric field along the direction of          the axon is           E            sin  Now the rate of change of          this component along the axon direction is the derivative          of           E            sin  with respect to the distance          measured along the axon which is            ik            cos            E            sin  The magnitude of this          quantity is largest for     and equals           k                      E                        k                      B                      v             In the next section we estimate          the size of           E            and the gradient           k                      E             for a practical example                            Results and Discussion        Here we estimate the peak electric field that can be        safely induced using ultrasound at the upper range of        diagnostic intensities A key parameter in computing the        field strength is the particle velocity generated by the        ultrasonic wave The peak particle velocity         v           can be related to the peak pressure                p           of the wave using the relation                where  is the tissue density and         c          is the sound speed Measurements        performed by Duck    using two modern commercial        ultrasonographic scanners have demonstrated instantaneous        peak pressures in excess of  MPa at the focal point of the        transducer Although this pressure translates into an        intensity that considerably exceeds the         temporallyaveraged FDA limit of         Wcm for diagnostic systems the instantaneous intensities        are generally far higher than the latter value        Using the values of         p and         c          for water the above formula gives a        peak particle velocity         v           of  ms To estimate the        magnitude of         E          for a typical set of parameters we        assume a magnetic field strength of  Tesla which is        typical of whole body MRI magnets This gives         E            Vm The electric field strength        can of course be enhanced by increasing the magnetic        field         B           Although  T is a typical MRI        field strength  T systems have recently become available        This field strength would double the peak electric field to                E            Vm It may be worth noting that a        highfield magnet with a smaller bore designed to        accommodate only the head would be much less costly than        the wholebody machines with much larger bore diameters In        general smaller bore magnets are also more suitable for        highfield applications Finally the very high magnetic        field homogeneity needed for imaging is not required in        this application which would further reduce costs        We next estimate the maximum gradient of the electric        field given earlier by         k                  E           The particle velocity quoted above        was measured for an instrument operating at an ultrasonic        frequency of  MHz     Using         E            Vm we obtain an electric field        gradient of         k                  E             kVm at this frequency This        is of the same order of magnitude of the activation        thresholds computed by Hsu and Durand                        Conclusion        Although the strength of the ultrasonicallyinduced        electric fields is about an order of magnitude below that        of TMS generated fields there are differences in the        spatial and temporal character of these fields that may        have some practical consequences The first point is that        the ultrasonicallyinduced electric field gradients are        comparable to typical TMS gradients because the        ultrasonicallyinduced fields pass from maximum to minimum        in a much shorter distance ie approximately half the        ultrasonic wavelength a fraction of a millimeter A        second point is that one can exercise greater control over        the temporal shape of the ultrasonicallyinduced electric        fields compared to TMSinduced fields For example the        excitation can be oscillatory polyphasic or not        approximately monophasic with a sharp upgoing excursion        followed by a weaker but longer negative going excursion        Pulses can be applied in very rapid sequence or a        continuous wave can be modulated in a variety of ways        We also mentioned the possibility of using a        conventional TMS coil to generate a strong but transient        magnetic field that could be applied during the        transmission of the ultrasound That is the function of        the TMS pulse would be to bring the membrane potential near        threshold but not to exceed it The ultrasonic pulse or        pulses would then push the potential past threshold One        could speculate that near threshold where the membrane        nonlinearity is strong a sinusoidal stimulus may be        effective in achieving activation due to some partial        rectification of the sinusoid            We conclude by noting that the same technique could be        used in principle to stimulate any type of excitable        tissue not just cortical tissue including for example        peripheral nerve tissue Finally it may turn out that the        ultrasonicallyinduced fields are simply too weak for        effective stimulation although this remains to be        established Answers to these questions may have to await        experimental work or further modeling of the        electrophysiology of neural activation                    Appendix Derivation of the Induced Electric        Field        Here we wish to solve the

where         J          is given by  The problem is most        easily solved by writing the magnetic and electric fields         B                   s          and         E                   s

Substituting A and A into A and using the        identity           A            A            A  results in                  A            A          i                    A                                 J           A        It is convenient to use the Lorentz gauge defined by                          which results in two uncoupled equations for the        potentials         A and  Substituting A into A        we obtain                 A            A                    J           A        where           i            and A becomes upon substituting        A                The solution to the vector Helmholtz equation A is        given by the following volume integral                where            i  and is the electromagnetic skin        depth in the tissue The exponential term in the integrand        of A can be replaced by unity when            r          r  For example at a frequency of         MHz and conductivity of  Sm we find    cm Thus        to an excellent approximation A may be replaced by                We now argue that the first term on the righthand side        of A is much smaller than the second term In fact the        magnitude of the first term is smaller than the second term        by a factor of the order   where  is the ultrasonic        wavelength and  is the electromagnetic skin depth in        tissue This can be demonstrated rigorously for the case of        the ideallycollimated ultrasonic beam treated in the main        text but a plausibility argument can be given as follows        The term           A  in A indicates terms that are        second derivatives of the spatial dependence of the        ultrasonic beam which will be of the order         A  Then the ratio of the first term in        A to the second term is                 where is the skin        depth and            k          is the ultrasonic wavelength At an        ultrasonic frequency of  MHz this ratio is on the order        of   Thus neglecting the first term in A we        have                Next substituting  into A we see that the only        nonzero component of         A is its         y component ie         A          A                   y           so that A becomes on writing the variables in        cylindrical coordinates                We now employ the expansion of          r          r  in cylindrical coordinates                           where         I                   m           and         K                   m           are the modified Bessel functions of the first and        second kind of order         m  In A         r          is the smaller of         r and         r  and         r          is the larger Substituting A        into A interchanging orders of integration and        performing the  integral only the         m   term survives giving                Next the integration with respect to         z is performed by noting that                where  is the Dirac delta function Substituting        this into A and integrating with respect to         k gives                For brevity we write this as                A                   y                   r          z           B                  v

 we obtain                     Footnotes        Fry appears to have been the first person to propose        using ultrasound to stimulate the brain although by means        of a very different mechanism     His idea was to        transmit ultrasound in the presence of an oscillating        electric field of the same frequency The periodic        variation of the electrical conductivity of the tissue        created by the slight variation in thermal expansion        arising from the oscillating sound wave would in        principle produce a partial rectification of the applied        field resulting in a small amount of unidirectional        electric current The resulting unidirectional charge        transfer Fry speculated could stimulate neural tissue        However to succeed the method requires extremely intense        ultrasonic pulses from  to  kWcm  and a very strong        electric field producing current densities on the order of        ampscm  As far as this author is aware Frys method        has not been tried        A great deal has been written on the subject of what        temporal and spatial features of the stimulating fields are        responsible for activation Early work by Rattay suggested        that the activation function essentially the gradient of        the electric field along the axis of the axon is a key        contributor     Other researchers pointed out that this        gradient is determined not only by the variations in the        impressed field but also by conductance variations in the        axon due to bends terminations and other departures from a        straight line that may perturb the local boundary        conditions Also the shape and duration of the stimulating        pulse play an important role It has been noted that the        time and space dependence of the activating function        mutually interact in a way that may make the effects of        each difficult to treat independently             Note that we are assuming that the maximum intensity        occurs at the focal point of the transducer This is        generally true if the ultrasound is sufficiently focused        but may not be true for a         weakly focused transducer when the        beam passes through an intervening medium that is very        attenuating such as the skull
