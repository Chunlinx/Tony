                    Introduction        Steroid hormone receptors SHRs are members of a family        of ligandactivated transcription factors that regulate        many biological processes including metabolism        reproduction and development In the absence of ligand        such as androgen glucocorticoid progestin and        mineralocorticoid the SHR maintains a cytosolic inactive        state by association with heat shock proteins andor other        proteins such as corepressors Upon ligand binding the SHR        undergoes conformational changes that involve releas e from        the repressor proteins and translocation to the nucleus        where it can bind to specific hormone responsive sequences        in the DNA of genes regulated by steroid hormones             The mechanism by which SHRs affect the rate of RNA        polymerase IIdirected transcription likely involves the        interaction of receptors with components of the        transcription preinitialization complex This interaction        may be direct or it may occur indirectly through the        action of coactivators which act as bridging factors To        date numerous coactivator molecules have been isolated and        characterized encompassing several different families             Most of these cofactors are expressed in a wide        variety of cell types and can interact with more than one        type of nuclear receptor The recent findings that members        of the several different families of coactivators possess        intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity suggests that        activated SHRs and nuclear receptors in general may also        recruit these cofactors to remodel chromatin structure for        better accessibility of the transcriptional machinery to        DNA             The JAKSTAT signaling pathway is involved in many        cytokines hormones and growth factors mediated signaling        pathways to regulate a variety of biological responses        including development cell differentiation proliferation        and survival      Once STAT proteins are activated by        tyrosinephosphorylation form homo or heterodimers that        are translocated to the nucleus where they can bind to        specific sequences in the DNA thereby stimulating gene        transcription Similarly to nuclear receptors and to other        transcription factors STAT proteins can interact with        coactivators to modulate their transcriptional activity               Other reports have shown direct interactions        between several members of the JAKSTAT signaling pathway        with SHRs        Stat is one of the seven        members of the STAT family of proteins that has been shown        to modulate the expression of several genes related to        control cell cycle proliferation and apoptosis such as        Cyclin D cmyc and BclxL respectively            Accordingly alterations in the activity of STAT have been        associated with cell transformation and cancer progression                     Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer        and the second leading cause of death from cancer in North        American men Prostate cells are dependant on androgen to        keep their normal functions Activation of androgen        receptor AR in prostate cells is a key step in developing        and progression of prostate cancer Most patients respond        initially to androgen deprivation or antiandrogen        regiments but eventually the tumor relapses in an        androgenindependent stage with a poor outcome Several        possible mechanisms have been suggested to explain this        activation of AR including mutations in the gene encoding        AR that alter the specificity for androgens overexpression        of the AR protein itself crosstalk to other signal        transduction pathways and altered levels or activity of        coactivators       Several groups including ours        have demonstrated a role of activated Stat in the        proliferation and survival of prostate cancer cells by a        mechanism that involves the AR                In this study we examined how Stat activates the SHRs        including AR We studied whether Stat a transcription        factor itself could act as a coactivator for AR and for        other SHRs We report here that a constitutively active        form of Stat stimulates transcriptional activity of SHRs        in a hormonedependent manner We also report that active        Stat can act synergistically with other coactivators to        stimulate SHRs transcriptional activity Moreover while        Stat did not affect specificity of AR to other steroid        hormones rather than androgen or binding of AR to other        HREs Stat significantly increased the sensitivity of AR        to androgen These results can add more light to the        mechanism by which SHRs and AR in particular regulate        gene expression                    Results                  Effect of Stat on ARmediated transcriptional          activity          Stat has been shown to enhance ARmediated PSA          expression and AR transcriptional activity in prostate          cancer cells       We used two          wellcharacterized androgenresponsive luciferase          reporter plasmids to study the effect of Stat on          ARmediated transcriptional activity Both reporter          plasmids contain several AREs that are required for          androgen induction As comparison we used a saturating          dose  nM of a synthetic androgen R CV cells          do not express endogenous AR therefore all experiments          were performed in the presence of ectopic wildtype human          AR CV cells showed a strong response to R compared          to vehicletreated cells with both androgenresponsive          reporters used Fig  Cotransfection of a plasmid          expressing a constitutively active mutant Stat StatC          that forms homodimers and translocates to the nucleus          without tyrosine phosphorylation affected AR          transcriptional activity in a doseresponse manner Fig          A but only in the presence of hormone Fig Band C          Constitutively activated Stat also activates another          androgenresponsive reporter contained the fragment           of the rat Probasin PB promoter Fig C          Wildtype Stat that is in a latent cytosolic state          without tyrosine phosphorylation nor dimerization showed          no additional stimulatory effect over the          androgentreated cells Fig                           Effect of STAT on transcriptional activity of          other SHRs          Having demonstrated that Stat enhance ARmediated          gene transcription we next investigated the role of          Stat on transcriptional activation with other SHRs For          GR and PR we used the same reporter plasmid as for AR          ARETATAluciferase since it shows promiscuous response          to all three SHRs     For ER we used          ERETATAluciferase reporter that is specific for          estrogen CV cells were also cotransfected with          plasmids expressing ectopically GR PR or ER Like the          AR Stat enhances all three other SHRs tested in the          presence of the corresponding hormone Dex for GR R          for PR or E            for ER Fig  Taken together          Stat enhances four different SHRs transcriptional          activity in the presence of their corresponding ligand          suggesting that active Stat acts as a coactivator for          nuclear receptors          We next compared the coactivator activity of Stat to          that of other known coactivators for AR CV cells were          transfected with the same amount  g of plasmid          expressing StatC SRC CBPp TIF or PCAF          respectively Cells transfected with either coactivator          or StatC showed comparable and higher luciferase          activity in response to R than cells treated with          hormone alone in the presence of empty vector Fig           None of the coactivators tested showed any luciferase          activity in the absence of hormone data not shown          Stat is comparable to other coactivators on AR          transcriptional activity SRC CBPp TIF          PCAF          It has been reported that coactivators in combination          can enhance transcriptional activity of SHRs compared to          when they are delivered to cells individually               Recently Giraud et al    reported a direct          interaction of Stat with SRC and CBPp We          determined whether Stat could act in a          synergisticadditive way when administered to cells          simultaneously to other coactivators As Fig shows          coexpression of active StatC simultaneously to SRC          CBPp TIF or PCAF resulted in a more efficient          enhancement of the reporter transcription activity driven          by AR as compared with any of the coactivators expressed          separately A similar enhancement in luciferase activity          with simultaneous delivery of coactivators was observed          with PR and ER data not shown                          Stat did not affect the specificity of AR for          nonandrogen steroid hormones or nonAREs          Altered responses of AR include activation by          nonandrogen ligands or recognition of other hormone          responsive elements different from AREs      We          studied if active Stat could be responsible for this          behavior of AR CV cells were cotransfected with a          reporter plasmid responsive to androgen          ARETATAluciferase in the presence or absence of AR          and constitutively active StatC Fig top and cells          were treated with different steroid hormones StatC did          not alter the specificity of AR for other steroid          hormones since it showed transcriptional activity only          in response to androgen but not to Dex R or E            Fig  top          To test whether Stat could alter the specificity of          AR to other HREs CV cells were cotransfected with          reporter plasmids responsive to androgen          ARETATAluciferase or to estrogen          ERETATAluciferase in the presence or absence of AR          and constitutively active StatC Fig bottom With          ARETATAluciferase reporter luciferase activity was          dependent on the presence of AR and androgen without any          effect of StatC on the basal levels of transcription          Fig  bottom left StatC did not modify the          sensitivity of AR for other hormone responsive elements          since there was no response on the AR transcriptional          activity when we used an estrogenspecific responsive          reporter plasmid ERETATAluciferase Fig  bottom          right                          Stat does not prevent inhibition of AR by the          antiandrogen flutamide          Another altered response of AR is manifested in the          socalled flutamide withdrawal syndrome or more          recently broadened to antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome          In this condition it is shown a decrease in serum levels          of PSA after removal of flutamide or other antiandrogens          from the treatment regiment     We studied if active          Stat could be involved in this paradoxical effect of          antiandrogens CV cells cotransfected with an androgen          responsive reporter plasmid ARETATAluciferase AR in          the presence or absence of constitutively active StatC          were treated with androgen and flutamide Fig  As          expected flutamide blocked substantially the induction          of ARETATAluciferase activity by R in the absence          of active StatC Similarly the inhibitory effect of the          antiandrogen on AR was not prevented by the presence of          constitutively active StatC                          Stat affects sensitivity of AR for androgen          Other mechanism by which AR could show an altered          response results from an increase in its sensitivity to          very low levels of androgen      We tested the          role of active Stat in this possibility cotransfecting          CV cells with an androgen responsive reporter          ARETATAluciferase AR in the presence or in the          absence of constitutively active StatC Cells were then          treated with different doses of androgen Maximal          transcriptional activity of AR was at  nM R both in          the presence and absence of StatC Fig  StatC          enhanced luci ferase activity driven by AR even at the          minimal dose of R tested  pM which showed no          luciferase activity in the absence of StatC                            Discussion        Regulation of gene transcription mediated by        hormoneactivated SHRs involves interaction with components        of the transcription complex Coactivators are members of        the transcription complex which act as bridging factors to        achieve optimal transcription activity Coactivators are        probably present in the nucleus in preassembled        multicomplex units ready to associate to activated SHRs        The role of the coactivators could be just as bridging        factors although some of the members of the p family        and CBPp present histone acetyltransferase activity             Stat is a member of the JAKSTAT signaling        pathway which is a transcription factor itself that after        activation binds to specific sequences in DNA to regulate        expression of genes related to proliferation        differentiation and cell survival Constitutive activation        of Stat has been associated with cell transformation and        cancer progression Previous data including from our group        showed activation of AR in prostate cancer mediated by        activation of Stat                Here we show that constitutively active Stat enhances        transcriptional activity of SHRs AR GR PR and ER in a        comparable extent to the stimulation elicit by other        coactivators and even more in a synergistic manner to        these other coactivators This stimulation is independent        of the DNA binding activity of Stat since none of the        luciferase reporters responsive to SHRs used throughout        this report contain the DNA sequence responsive to Stat            We cannot rule out however that Stat is affecting        an independent event that in turn activates SHR        transcriptional activity Nevertheless direct        proteinprotein interaction has been documented by        coimmunoprecipitation experiments between Stat and AR             GR      PR     and ER            suggesting that Stat might be involved directly in        transcriptional activity elicit by SHRs Moreover Stat        has also been directly associated with several        coactivators such as SRC and CBPp             Recruitment of coactivators to nuclear receptors takes        place via a common motif in the coactivators containing a        core consensus sequence LXXLL L leucine X any        aminoacid     Most of the coactivators contain more        than one of these motifs raising the question regarding        specificity of these motifs to specific activating domains        in the nuclear receptors Stat also contains in its        Nterminus one of this motifs  LAGLL             Moreover Stat also presents a Ser at  position of the        LXXLL sequence which in the case of the coactivator TRBP        defines selectivity for nuclear receptors            Phosphorylation of Stat has been reported to occur only in        Tyr and in Ser allowing dimerization and full        transactivating activity     Whether this Ser next        to the LXXLL motif is involved in the coactivator activity        of Stat and the interaction of Stat with other        coactivators only takes place in the context of Stat        transcription factor activity or also can be part of the        general mechanism of the transcription complex formation        requires further studies        Activation of AR is a driving force in development and        progression of prostate cancer Several mechanisms could be        involved in this AR activation       Changes in        the specificity of AR broadening the responsive spectrum to        other steroid hormones different to dihydrotestosterone        can be caused by genetic mutations affecting different        regions of AR We studied if active Stat could be        sufficient to alter the specificity of a wildtype AR to        nonsteroid hormones Our results indicate that native AR        with no mutations is responsible only to androgens being        Stat not sufficient to alter this feature of AR Activated        Stat d oes not affect the specificity of AR to bind to        other HREs different form ARE Other altered response of        mutated AR is the paradoxical agonistic effect of        antiandrogens Also in this case Stat could not reverse        the antagonistic activity of flutamide on a wildtype AR        These results point to mutations in AR as a necessary step        in some of the altered responses of AR seen in advanced        prostate cancer        Another possible mechanism by which a prostate cancer        circumvents the low levels of androgens resulting from        androgen ablation therapy is by increasing the sensitivity        of AR to very low levels of androgens     Stat        increased the sensitivity of AR to a dose of androgen that        showed no activity in the absence of Stat in the absence        of a mutated AR The constitutive activation of Stat found        in prostate cancer     could be an initial step in        the clonal selection of malignant cells affecting not only        Statregulated genes but also AR as part of the        transcription complex recruited in response to activated        AR Recently overexpression of SRC and TIF has been        found in prostate cancer recurrence after androgen        deprivation therapy     providing a molecular basis        for AR activation that could be similar to the one        displayed by Stat in its role as coactivator        In conclusions we report here that  a constitutively        active form of Stat stimulates transcriptional activity of        SHRs in a hormonedependent manner  active Stat can act        synergistically with other c oactivators to stimulate SHRs        transcriptional activity  Stat did not affect        specificity of AR to other steroid hormones different than        androgen or binding of AR to other HREs  Stat        increases the sensitivity of AR to androgen These results        can help to elucidate the mechanism by which SHRs in        general and AR in particular regulate gene        expression                    Methods                  Plasmids          Luciferase reporter plasmids containing specific          responsive elements for AR
