                    Background        The Cre         loxP site specific recombination        system   is widely used for production of        tissuespecific and conditional knockout alleles in mice           Recently a Credependent         lacZ reporter strain RR was        produced by targeted insertion of a lacZ gene preceded by        a loxPflanked floxed strong transcriptional termination        sequence tpA into the ubiquitously expressed ROSA        locus    The         RR allele terminates transcription        prematurely but when the mice are crossed with        Creexpressing transgenic mice the Cremediated excision        of the floxed termination sequence leads to constitutive         lacZ expression Thus these doubly        transgenic animals express         lacZ only in the cells that have        expressed Cre as well as in all of their daughter cells        Similar Cre reporter strains have been produced using        different promoters to express         lacZ         Another        variation on this theme has been the development of the        ZAP reporter strain which switches from lacZ to alkaline        phosphatase expression upon exposure to Cre recombinase        activity   All of these strains are useful for        monitoring the expression of Cre recombinase as well as        for cell lineage tagging experiments                        Here we describe the production of two similar Cre        reporter alleles that express enhanced yellow or cyan        fluorescent protein EYFP or ECFP two color variants of        the green fluorescent protein GFP GFP and its variants        are autofluorescent proteins that can be visualized in        living cells and are therefore particularly useful for        monitoring gene expression in whole embryos animals or        cultured cells and organs   EYFP and ECFP were chosen        because their emission spectra overlap minimally so they        can be distinguished when used simultaneously whereas the        emission spectra of EYFP and ECFP overlap to a greater        extent with that of EGFP           httpwwwclontechcomgfppdfLivingColorspdf        During the course of this work three new Cre reporter        strains that conditionally express EGFP were reported Two        transgenic strains    use the actin promoterCMV        enhancer to express EGFP following Cremediated excision of        a stop sequence and in one of these lacZ is expressed        prior to the Cremediated excision event In the third        strain which is similar in principle to the YFP and CFP        alleles reported here EGFP was inserted at the         ROSA locus   The availability        of different Cre reporter strains will be valuable not        only because of the advantages of different reporter        proteins but also because the efficiency of Cremediated        excision may be dependent on the target locus                    Results and Discussion        Considering the utility of the         ROSA locus for expressing various        sequences in a ubiquitous manner     we generated        a generic targeting vector pBigT into which any sequence        of interest can easily be inserted downstream of a floxed        neotpA cassette and then subsequently cloned into a        plasmid with the         ROSA genomic flanking arms         ECFP or         EYFP was inserted into pBigT and the        resulting sequence was inserted into a vector containing         ROSA genomic sequences to permit        homologous recombination Fig A The targeting vector was        electroporated into ES cells and  Gresistant        colonies were analyzed for each construct Three RREYFP        and two RRECFP colonies carried the targeted allele as        determined by Southern blot hybridization Figure B The        targeted ES cells originally derived from strain XSvJ          were injected into CBLJ blastocysts and the        resulting chimeric mice were bred to CBLJ females to        pass the mutation through the germ line Thus the        resulting mice were a mixture of strains XSvJ and        CBLJ        No background expression of EYFP or ECFP could be        detected in the RREYFP or RRECFP mice as expected        data not shown due to the strong transcriptional stop        sequence inserted between the promoter and the coding        sequences However when the reporter mice were crossed to        actinCre transgenic mice   which express Cre        constitutively in most or all cells including those in the        early embryo the resulting doubly transgenic embryos        displayed apparently ubiquitous expression of EYFP or ECFP        Figure  indicating efficient excision of the floxed        stop sequence The expression of EYFP vs ECFP could be        clearly distinguished using appropriate filter sets Fig         This ubiquitous expression of EYFP or ECFP was        heritably transmitted to the following generations data        not shown resulting in ubiquitously expressing lines of        mice that will be useful for lineage tracing in chimeric        mice or embryos analogous to the original ROSA lacZ        promoter trap strain          The specificity of the RREYFP and ECFP lines was        tested by crossing them with strains of mice that express        Cre in a tissuespecific fashion Isl is a LIM homeodomain        transcription factor expressed in motor neurons and dorsal        root and cranial sensory ganglia   IslCre mice were        produced by targeting         Cre into the         Isl locus see Materials and        Methods Heterozygous IslCre mice were viable and        fertile while homozygous mice died at EE as has        been previously described with mice in which the exon        encoding the second LIM domain of Isl had been deleted          Figure Ashows an experiment in which the RRYFP        mice were crossed with the IslCre mice resulting in        expression of EYFP in motor neurons and dorsal root ganglia        in the doubly transgenic offspring Thus RRYFP mice        faithfully report the cellspecific patterns of IslCre in        subsets of neurons As a control the IslCre mice were        also mated to the original         RR lacZ allele   resulting in a        similar pattern of expression of         lacZ         Engrailed En is a homeodomain protein expressed        specifically at the midhindbrain junction of the early        somite stage embryo as well as in a number of sites later        in embryogenesis Figure shows an experiment in which        RRYFP mice were crossed with a strain of mice in which        Cre was knocked into the         En locus   resulting in the        expression of YFP specifically at the midhindbrain        junction in an E embryo For comparison we also crossed        the EnCre mice with the original         RR lacZ allele   resulting in        lacZ expression in the same region at E Fig C        The expression of ECFP proved more difficult to detect        in fixed and sectioned tissue data not shown although it        was clearly detectable in unfixed embryonic tissue Fig        C This is not surprising given the higher quantum yield        and extinction coefficient of EYFP as compared to ECFP        both of which result in higher fluorescence intensity                    Conclusions        We have constructed two reporter lines of mice that        express EYFP or ECFP only in cells expressing the Cre        recombinase and their daughter cells by targeting these        cDNAs into the ubiquitously expressed ROSA locus        preceded by a         loxP flanked stop sequence Crosses        with a general Cre expressing strain actinCre and two        tissuespecific Cre strains IslCre and EnCre showed        that the reporter strains function as expected based on        their similarity to the well characterized RRlacZ        strains In contrast to         lacZ expression which cannot be        easily detected in living tissue the EYFP and ECFP        reporter strains together with the GFP reporter strains        currently available will be very useful for monitoring the        expression of Cre in living tissues or tracing the lineage        of these cells and their descendants in cultured embryos        or organs Furthermore by using modified forms of Cre        whose recombinase activity is inducible one can use these        reporter mice to perform detailed analysis on the lineage        of cells at different time points during development                    Materials and Methods                  Sources of Plasmids          The components of the           ROSA targeting vectors were a          gift from Philippe Soriano The adenovirus splice          acceptor SA and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation          sequence bpA were from plasmid pSAgeo   The           loxP flanked neo cassette and          trimer of the SV polyadenylation sequence tpA were          from plasmid PGKneotpAlox   The           ROSA genomic sequence and the          diphtheria toxin DTA expression cassette were from          plasmid pROSA   and the template for the external          probe used to genotype ES cells was from plasmid          pROSA            The plasmids pEYFPN and pECFP containing cDNA for          EYFP and ECFP were purchased from Clontech Laboratories          Inc                          Targeting Constructs          The plasmid pBigT consists of the adenovirus splice          acceptor sequence followed by a           loxP site neo expression cassette          strong transcriptional stop sequence triple SV          polyadenylation sequence another           loxP site in the same orientation          as the first a multiple cloning site MCS and the          bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence A PacI          site was included  to the SA and an AscI site  to          the bpA These two enzymes are rare eight base pair          cutters and result in sticky ends upon digestion and can          be used to excise the entire construct for insertion          into the plasmid with the           ROSA genomic arms The XbaI site          used for insertion into the           ROSA genomic locus   was          replaced by a linker PacI SwaI AscI so that it could          be digested with PacI and AscI and receive the bigT          sequence          To make pBigT plasmid pSAgeo was digested with ClaI          and XbaI to remove the           geo and bpA sequence but leave          behind the SA the ends were Klenow filled and the          plasmid selfligated The resulting plasmid was digested          with SacI and PstI to remove the  MCS which was          replaced by a PacI linker The resulting plasmid was          called pPacSA          Next pSAgeo was digested with SacI to remove the SA          and           geo sequences but leave behind          the bpA and selfligated The resulting plasmid was          digested with XbaI and ApaI to remove most of the  MCS          except for the terminal KpnI site which was replaced          with an AscI linker The resulting plasmid was called          pbpAAsc          The           loxP            neo tpA           loxP was excised from plasmid          PGKneotpAlox by cutting with NotI Klenow filling and          then cutting with KpnI This was inserted downstream of          the SA in pPacSA digested with SalI Klenow filled and          then cut with KpnI A MCS containing the restriction          sites for XhoI ApaI SacII NotI SacI EcoRV and KpnI          was synthesized and inserted downstream of the second           loxP site by digesting the DNA with          XhoI and KpnI and ligating in the MCS which had been          synthesized to have compatible cohesive ends This          plasmid was called pSAleotpA The bpA sequence along with          the  AscI site was excised from pbpAAsc by digesting it          with SacI and KpnI and inserted downstream of the MCS in          pSAleotpA by digesting it with SacI and KpnI The          resulting plasmid was called pBigT and its MCS contains          sites for the restriction enzymes NheI SalI AccI XhoI          ApaI SacII NotI SacI and BclI          To make the           ROSA genomic sequence compatible          with the pBigT plasmid pROSA was digested with XbaI          Klenow filled and a linker PacI SwaI AscI inserted          This plasmid was called pROSAPA          To make the RRYFP targeting construct the           EYFP cDNA was excised from pEYFPN          with ApaI and NotI and inserted into BigT digested with          ApaI and NotI BigT was then digested with PacI and AscI          to release the entire floxed           neo tpA and           EYFP assembly and inserted into          pROSAPA digested with PacI and AscI This plasmid was          subsequently linearized with KpnI and used for          electroporation          To make the RRCFP targeting construct pECFP was          digested with AgeI Klenow filled then digested with NotI          to excise the           ECFP cDNA This was inserted into          BigT digested with XhoI Klenow filled and then digested          with NotI BigT was then digested with PacI and AscI to          release the entire floxed neotpA and CFP assembly and          inserted into pROSAPA digested with PacI and AscI This          plasmid was subsequently linearized with KpnI and used          for electroporation          An appreciable amount of recombination was observed          while trying to grow up the final targeting vector          resulting in an aberrant plasmid of smaller molecular          weight Therefore the mixture of theses two plasmids was          digested with KpnI which linearized both plasmids and          the correct targeting vector was gel purified It was          subsequently confirmed to be the correct targeting vector          by diagnostic PCR restriction digests and sequencing          data not shown                          Targeting of the ROSAlocus in ES cells          JM ES cells   were expanded by culturing on          feeder cells in medium supplemented with LIF          Approximately    cells were electroporated with           g of each targeting vector and grown without feeders          under selection in  gml G for seven days           colonies were picked and  screened for          electroporations with each of the two constructs RRYFP          and RRCFP Genomic Southern blot hybridization was          performed on DNA from ES cells digested with EcoRV The           probe used detects a  kb wild type band and a  kb          targeted band due to the presence of an extra EcoRV site          in the targeted allele          Mice carrying the targeted allele were genotyped by          the PCR as described                            Construction of the IslCre mouse strain          Isl genomic DNA had been previously isolated from a          mouse Sv genomic library Stratagene as described by          Pfaff et al   A PacI site had been introduced into          an EcoRI site in the exon encoding the second LIM domain          of Isl A cassette coating IRES Cre SV pA and          pgkneomycin was cloned into this PacI site to create a          targeting construct with flanking  and  genomic DNA          arms of  kb and  kb respectively ES cells were          targeted and screened as described in Pfaff et al                                    Mouse strains          EnCre mice En           Cki allele were a gift of Dr          Alexandra Joyner and Dr Wolfgang Wurst
