                    Background        Sequencing of Expressed Sequence Tags ESTs has        resulted in the rapid identification of expressed genes            ESTs are singlepass partial sequences of cDNA clones        from a large number of disease and normal tissue libraries        ESTs have been used extensively for gene discovery and for        transcript mapping of genes from a wide number of organisms              Even with the finished working draft of the        human genome the generation of a complete and        nonredundant catalog of human genes is still a big        challenge facing the genome research community Fulllength        cDNA data are currently available for only  human        genes     less than onethird of the total using the        most conservative recent estimates of human gene numbers             Evidence of differential expression is one of the        most important criteria in prioritizing the exploitation of        genes in both academic and pharmaceutical research                     While identifying individual differentially expressed        genes attracts most of the interest a genome wide        transcriptome map may not only provide a tool to identify        candidate genes that are overexpressed or silenced in        certain disease tissue but may also help to understand the        structure and organization of the genome Genomes are the        blueprints of life and they should not be considered as a        simple collection of genes In fact the organization of        genes into operons complex regulons     or        pathogenicity islands    suggests that related        functions usually share physical proximity Different types        of transcriptome maps can help to identify different types        of transcription domains Those domains can now be analyzed        as to how they relate to known nuclear substructures such        as nuclear speckles PML bodies and coiled bodies                     Two strategies have been commonly used to evaluate        largescale gene expression experimental and        computational The former is represented by DNA microarray        technology     Computational methods consist of        generating a large number of random ESTs from        nonnormalized cDNA libraries The variation in the        relative frequency of those tags stored in databases are        then used to point out the differential expression of the        corresponding genes this is the so called digital        Northern comparison Digital Northern data can be used to        provide quantitative assessment of differential expression        within a certain limit     Velculescu et al           introduced another digital method called serial analysis of        gene expression SAGE The SAGE method requires only nine        nucleotides therefore allowing a larger throughput In        both protocols the number of tags is reported to be        proportional to the abundance of cognate transcripts in the        tissue or cell type used to make the cDNA library        The recently announced first draft of the human genome            holds in it an unprecedented wealth of information        available for public study and scrutiny How are genes        organized in the human genome Is there any distribution        pattern of tissue specific genes in terms of chromosomal        location In this study we combined the concept of digital        Northern and transcript mapping for all public and Incyte        LifeSeq ESTs to evaluate the tissue specific transcriptome        The goal of this paper is not to evaluate the digital        expression of individual genes instead we are looking at        the tissue enriched digital expression level for a given        chromosomal region Particularly we looked at the        distribution pattern of brainenriched genes in the genome        and how that pattern changes in brain tumor tissues We are        well aware of the fact that this method and associated        approaches are quite primitive However the tissue        specific transcriptome data strongly suggest that human        genome organization is correlated to the tissue type and        its dynamics                    Results                  Distribution of brainenriched genes along the          chromosomes          With the unavailability of the complete annotated          human gene catalog it is not practical to document each          individual gene that is expressed in brain within one          chromosome region Since the number of sequence tags is          reported to be proportional to the abundance of cognate          transcripts in the tissue or cell type used to make a          given cDNA library the number of ESTs within a          chromosome region should reflect the abundance of the          cognate transcripts in that region Therefore comparison          of the abundance of brain tissue derived transcripts          relative to those from other tissues within the same          chromosome region can highlight regions that have more          brainenriched gene expression          We performed digital expression analysis of          brainenriched genes across the human genome with a          window size of  Mbp and an interval of  Mbp The          transcript density factor for normal nontumor brain          libraries TDF           NB  was calculated as described in          Methods Figure is an example of the distribution of TDF                    NB over chromosome  using publicly          available EST sequences from dbEST and reveals a number          of peaks that represent transcripts that appear to be          preferentially expressed in brain tissues To check the          validity of these peak regions and make sure that the          difference is not due to random picking or partial          sequencing of cDNA libraries which is the common random          fluctuation caused by digital Northern approach              the analysis was repeated using ESTs and the associated          library information from the Incyte Genomics LifeSeq          database The distribution pattern of TDF           NB shows an overall correlation          coefficient of  for the whole genome between these          two data sources If we only analyze the region with          Zscore   ie peak regions the correlation          coefficient is  which suggests that the peak regions          resulting from the analysis of public data are most          likely not artifacts Figure shows the comparison of the          distributions of TDF on chromosome  calculated from ESTs          derived from brain tissue libraries vs ESTs derived from          breast tissue libraries The overall pearson correlation          coefficient for these two tissues is  which suggests          that the peak regions observed in Figure are brain          specific          There are  high TDF           NB regions enriched with brain          specific expression with Zscore   Table  To          assess the validity of our finding using public data          similar analysis using Incyte LifeSeq data shows that the          same peaks can be derived data not shown Table          summarizes all the low TDF           NB regions lack of brain specific          expression over the whole genome with Zscore            Its interesting to note that the majority of high TDF           NB or low TDF           NB regions have close to average gene          density indicating that those regions are not biased          toward extremely high or low gene density                          Expression profile change of some chromosome          regions with extreme TDF NBin brain tumor          Our analysis strongly suggests that brainenriched          genes are distributed throughout the genome in a          nonrandom fashion Some regions are dense with          brainenriched genes or brain specific expression It          would be interesting to know if any of these patterns          change during tumorgenesis A similar analysis was          performed using ESTs generated from brain tumor libraries          and their digital expression profile relative to the          pooled tissue was plotted against the genome The          chromosomal distributions of these putative brain tumor          enriched transcripts and the normal brain enriched          transcripts are quite different Table lists all the          chromosome regions with high TDF in nontumor brain          libraries TDF           NB  which become low TDF or neutral          TDF in brain tumor TDF           TB  Chr  Mbp Chr           Mbp and Chr  Mbp Figure  are some of the          examples While most of the low TDF regions in normal          brain remain low in brain tumor a few regions did become          high TDF regions in brain tumor tissues Table  Chr           Mbp and Chr  Mbp Figure  are two          examples The digital expression profile in those regions          was further confirmed by using data from Incyte LifeSeq          data not shown                            Discussion        A genome is not a simple collection of genes It has        been reported that significant correlation exists between        the distribution of genes along the chromosome and the        physical architecture of the cell in bacteria     The        human genome is much more complex and a complete        understanding of its organization awaits completion of the        finished sequence as well as a definitive annotation of the        human gene catalog Considerable evidence has already shown        that related genes tend to exist as clusters in the genome        For example  of the over  olfactory genes are found        in clusters of  genes     The  Mbp human major        histocompatibility complex MHC on chromosome p is a        critical repository for the immune response genes            Extensive analysis of the genomic organization of the MHC        region has revealed that at least  of its resident genes        possess duplicated copies in at least one of the three        other restricted chromosomal regions qq qq and        qp For another example ABC transporter gene        family members are located on p q and q as        clusters        The development of distinct tissue and cell types is a        fundamental characteristic of growth in higher organisms        Tissue and cellular differentiation in turn is highly        dependent on specific patterns of gene expression and        transcript accumulation Many studies have been        successfully used to pinpoint genes exhibiting tissue or        disease specific expression This study suggests another        approach that focuses on the tissue specific transcriptome        map study and attempts to study the genomic proximity of        tissue specific genes We show here that some regions on        specific chromosomes are enriched with brainenriched gene        expression Given the chromosome window size  Mbp used        to calculate the TDF and the average size of the gene         Kbp each  Mbp region should contain on average about         genes In addition we report here only regions that have a        normal level of gene density Therefore the very high TDF         NB regions are most likely contributed        by the high level expression of brainenriched gene        clusters or the regions containing a high density of        brainenriched genes        We are aware of the importance of those brainenriched        genes that scatter across the genome whose brain specific        or differential expression is diluted by the large volume        of neighbor genes within the  Mbp window region Another        limitation of this approach is the inability to reveal some        regions with equal updown differential expression The        goal of this study is to pinpoint the chromosomal regions        with the most significant brainenriched gene expression        and to elucidate the nonrandomness of the tissue specific        expression over the chromosome Naturally gene proximity        within chromosomes is already known to be significant        Finding neighbors of a given gene can shed light on that        gene especially when the neighbors contain objects with        similar features Therefore this tissue specific        transcriptome map study may not only help us to understand        the genome organization in the future but may also provide        means to gain leads to the functions of many genes for        which this information is not currently available                    Methods                  Resources for databases and computer          programs          GenBank release  was downloaded from          ftpncbinlmnihgov ESTs and their associated tissue          library information and clone information were extracted          and organized in a relational database Sybase SQL          Server Release  CA Sybase Inc The EST cDNA          libraries were manually curated and catalogued into          nontumor brain libraries and brain tumor libraries We          obtained  dbEST ESTs from  nontumor brain cDNA          libraries  ESTs from  brain tumor cDNA          libraries We also extracted  ESTs from  Incyte          LifeSeq nontumor brain cDNA libraries and  ESTs          from their  brain tumor libraries All noncommercial          software used in this study was written in PERL                           Transcript mapping          Transcript mapping was done based on the October           Freeze of the University of California at Santa Cruzs          working draft sequence httpgenomeucscedu which          presents a tentative assembly of the finished and draft          human genomic sequence based on the Washington          UniversitySaint Louis clone map          httpgenomewustledugsc We mapped all the public          ESTs  millions ESTs from dbEST as well as the ESTs          from Incyte Genomics LifeSeq database  millions          ESTs using a local alignment software package AAT AAT          is a local alignment software which extended the BLAST          algorithm by assigning fixed penalty to long gaps              To reduce the number of undesirable matches due to          interspersed repeats the DNA sequence is screened for          interspersed repeats using the RepeatMasker program          Smit AFA  Green P et al          httpftpgenomewashingtoneduRMRepeatMaskerhtml          Only those ESTs that have over  identity to the          genomic counterpart over half the length of ESTs length          or  bp whichever is longer are included                          Calculation of the transcript density factor          TDF          The TDF for normal brainenriched gene expression TDF                    NB  is calculated using  Mbp window          moving along the chromosome with  Mbp interval and          defined as          TDF           NB  lnR           NB RT           NB T          Where          R           NB is the number of EST clones derived          from nontumor brain tissue within a window of  Mbp          R is the number of EST clones derived from all          nontumor tissue pooled libraries within a window of           Mbp          T           NB is the number of total mapped EST          clones derived from nontumor brain tissues          T is the number of total mapped EST clones derived          from all nontumor tissue pooled libraries          The distribution of TDF           NB of all the  Mbp regions should          approximate a Gaussian distribution Theoretically TDF           NB should approach  if the expression          level of genes in brain tissues has no difference from          that in pooled tissues within a  Mbp chromosomal region          We define all the regions with high TDF           NB Zscore   as brainenriched          regions Those chromosome regions that have high          brainenriched gene expression are referred as high TDF           NB region Those chromosome regions          that have low brainenriched gene expression are referred          as low TDF           NB region          The calculation of transcript density factor for brain          tumor TDF           TB  is similar to the calculation of          TDF           NB           TDF           TB  lnR           TB RT           TB T          Where          R           TB is the number of EST clones derived          from tumor brain tissue within a window of  Mbp          R is the number of EST clones derived from all          nontumor tissue pooled libraries within a window of           Mbp          T           TB is the number of total mapped EST          clones derived from tumor brain tissue libraries          T is the number of total mapped EST clones derived          from all nontumor tissue libraries                          Correlation analysis of distribution pattern of TDF          using public and Incyte data          The Pearson correlation coefficient r represents the          degree of similarity strength of correlation between          two sets of data The correlation coefficient is          calculated as follows                    where X           i is TDF values derived from public          data and Y           i is the TDF values derived from the          Incyte data Values for the Pearson correlation          coefficient range from  to  where zero indicates no          correlation  indicates a perfect negative correlation          and  indicates a perfect positive correlation                          The calculation of gene density          Using  Mbp window moving along the chromosome with           Mbp interval the gene density ratio is defined as          UniGene Version      count divided by the          average UniGene count in each  Mbp region Average gene          density ratio is equal to
