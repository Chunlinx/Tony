              well lets see if i can recall all those questions um well first off i have one daughter whos two   uhhuh   and the question i think focused primarily on how people spend time with their children and is it adequate   uhhuh     i think thats so varied depending on um what what your life is all about you know i i was just about to say priorities but it really has more to do with um the things that influence your life as opposed to just your priorities   right   i work as well as um spend as much time as i can with my daughter my husband so   uhhuh   its always a challenge um i think that probably we like to spend our time together doing um recreational things as much as possible   right   i mean thats sort of obvious i guess when you have a young child anyway theyre not       theyre not off on their own theyre going where youre going   right   um so we enjoy things like camping and spending time together on weekends and going for walks and bike rides and things like that   uhhuh cool i think thats what its all about thats i the things i remember most when i was growing up were the same that anytime we did something with the family it was boring or something active we rarely went to any movies or and and im glad we took that time that we were together to to really spend in communicating and talking with one another and enjoying each others company   uhhuh did you have a lot of siblings   i do i have seven brothers and sisters theres eight of us   wow   so it was a challenge you know to find time especially as we got older um to find time to where we all could could do it but it was also a lot of fun it really   uhhuh uhhuh   this i think for us it made it that although we didnt spend a whole lot of time together as a complete family   well thats probably a challenge considering the age span   yeah well theres a huge age span for example my oldest sister is twenty four and my youngest brother is six so   yeah oh           most the activities we did do together were were sports when one of us played in a sporting event it everyone who was available would go to that or once somebody sang in a choir   oh uhhuh well i would imagine at a certain point too you were probably able to care for each other in in like pseudo parent roles so that you had a chance to   so I think thats what i remember most yeah yeah and a lot of uh you know that was a big thing i remember when i was growing up that as soon as i could drive my job was to take over moms car responsibilities and drive everybody all around But that was cool because it gave us a chance to to get to know the other kids and really see how they were like instead of just what they were like at home   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh   which was really neat   interesting   and my little one wants to talk on the telephone right now         she sees me talking   how old is the little one   shes two   oh boy keeps you busy i guess           pardon me   i would guess she keeps you pretty busy   yeah yeah its its a its an age of um extremes to some degree very loving and very sensitive and and yet sometimes just so overwhelmed by the emotions that uh hard to keep them in check   uhhuh right i can imagine       well lets see what else   but the question of was it enough you know it think thats a really hard thing for people to answer i think that it depends on each individual   uhhuh yeah i agree a hundred percent   if you feel as though youre spending enough i mean some people can work full time and feel like theyre able to spend enough time with their kids and other people cant imagine how that could be truth   yeah and i think its true i think a lot of times people get caught up on the quantity instead of the quality   uhhuh huh   and id just as spoon soon spend you know thirty minutes with my dad talking and just being with him than i would an hour and a half being at a movie with him   uhhuh did you have times when you were  um like going on a date or having an opportunity to spend one on one with parents given that there were so many siblings did you have much one to one time   um when i was growing up there wasnt a whole lot most of our one on one was was with other brothers and sisters   uhhuh   um more now than ever i im home for school right from school right now just for Christmas and ive probably spent more one on one time with my dad since ive been home than i did in the year when i was here     uhhuh uhhuh   which was at times that was difficult you know we he made time when we needed it but hes a very very busy person He works his job and a half and hes on the school board and everything so hes hes rarely home   uhhuh uhhuh   but when he is he makes sure that its quality time with us and he wants to you we always knew that that he was there for us if we needed him   uhhuh thats an important element of a relationship even if its not always contact   yeah and i   must have kept your mom busy   yeah       they they were both run wild there i dont know how they did it   really its pretty amazing when you look on so many families some time back that were larger its very much the unusual today   uhhuh yeah and i think its interesting too You know i think to me at least to have a big family is something that i personally will want when i get married   umhum umhum   just because i i was able to see the what happens with other siblings you know and be a i had to learn to be responsible real quick being the second oldest   uhhuh oh is that right you were second   yeah so I got to   yeah besides the fact that you really uh learn to function in the social system you know its the family unit is a is a microcosm   absolutely
