                all right uh what did you look for when you were looking for child care   well we uh we needed you know something that was kind of convenient to uh to getting you know because uh usually in the mornings things are pretty rushed so that that was a consideration um uh my wife and her mother went over to the uh to the ladys ladys house who keeps uh Helen and uh they you know before uh took her over uh actually took her over but before we signed up for it and uh just kind of looked around you know and talked to her for awhile watch how all the children the other children interacted with her and they all seemed to like her so we uh we went with her and weve been weve been really happy with her   i guess thats an important uh uh uh i havent thought about that as much as i it uh when we did it  we we didnt really have child care we had uh like uh day school   uhhuh yeah   so theyre kids before they went to school and well what what we had done was talk to the parents and of the kids that were there and uh all the parents were very enthusiastic so we thought well thats a thats a good point and then we visited once and seemed like they were pretty uh but i guess there is a difference between uh day care for kids that are couple years away from school and and uh child care for now you you and your wife both work right   umhum yeah yeah the uh  the lady who keeps she keeps uh six children and uh she she really recommends to that uh   so   when when like when Helen gets a little closer to starting kindergarten that shed be you know put into a regular um day care so that they can they can learn more uh uh like the alphabet and the numbers and all that stuff uh although shes shes really good she uh uh she makes little uh like handprints you you know Helens hand and then puts little designs on them you know and you know so she uh she takes a pretty active role and and uh   oh yeah   um our little girl she was uh premature and so she had um she was on a monitor uh heart monitor and uh that was no problem you know with the uh with the babysitter she you know took it right in stride   uhhuh   she   i i guess with the right person if uh as opposed to some of these day care centers where they have two hundred kids or something like that or i dont know how many kids theyve got but where they have lots and lots of kids its  its much tougher to uh   umhum   to rely on its much easier to rely on one person if theyre good theyre good and if theyre bad well you know   yeah thats thats thats the the finding a good one thats thats the hard part um i think you probably have a better chance with a day care theyre theyre probably its more of an average so that that theres less chance of having a a bad one yeah   well on the average on the well on on the average they might do uh uh gosh how should i say this youre going for the average the average kid is going to be treated better but   yeah   but you wont have the the uh you wont have the risk of getting a real bad one everybody everybody knows that theyve got a a bad one on the other hand uh thats with uh with a person whos taking care of them in their own home thats   yeah   if theyre good like i say you can be pretty sure that theyre good and uh so i if theyre not so good if theyre kind of lazy why the kids probably   yeah   uh could tell you i i personally would rather have my kids uh stay with uh you know with an individual than i would with a school because with a school if they lose if they have two or three good people and they lose one youll never know it you just pick your kid up from school and   yeah yeah   and uh and see the other question i had is uh so do you plan on on uh keeping her in day care until she goes to school   i think uh well i think were going to keep her where shes at now until shes about uh three and a half or four and then move her into a regular day care that has uh more children and uh and also where they have like the pre kindergarten type of uh environment   does does this lady have any help or does she do it all herself   uh she she has like uh occasional help that comes in   okay i i wondered about that because uh i know some people that do that and   uhhuh   you know moms can never get sick well a  a day care mother  uh can never
