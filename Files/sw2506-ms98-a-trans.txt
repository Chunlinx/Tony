              so tell me about your home   my home all right my home is about fifteen years old   all right   its a two story house it its a first home and it looks like its going to be the last i think were going to demolish it weve got two children and its they have scraped the uh plaster off the walls you know with riding their little toys through it and stuff you know   yes   put dents in the tiles just multitude of them i mean even places its its past the dent stage were talking some of its been peeled away you know i dont know what they   were talking from from dents into holes   yeah dents into holes right   i understand weve got ive got a daughter   weve got two one of them s eleven and one of them s seven and then the carpet you know we need to replace the carpet   oh   i mean it sounds like its just the pits but its not all that bad i guess but you know theyre just real hard on it   kids are hard on houses   definitely i can see why people wait until they get like in high school or maybe junior high and then they get another one   yeah yeah uh we live in a mobile home and thats probably not typical America but     i know theres a lot of them   its what we have its what we can afford   yeah     and uh seems like were always working on it as im sure it is with your house   because theyre always because theyre always ruining something   yeah   how old is your child   ten girl   well   so so you know just like yours ours is always you know were something else goes wrong always you know its   some appliances breaking or something   no appliances we had a couple plumbing problems weve   oh  who knows you know its always something with homes   and you said you were in Colorado Springs   yes   are there a lot of trailers around there   yeah there are theres uh big military constituency   and is that what youre in   oh no no im i work for TI   well then thats why youre doing this then isnt it   oh yes       okay well   what division are you in   im not in TI   oh   i had a friend that had a roommate that worked for TI and she saw this come up on the computer screen and ran it off       and passed it on to people that were interested   its not a hobby you know its something to do i get to hear about Texas again a bit get to talk to people all over the country the other night i talked to someone in Maryland i believe it was   i know ive been talking to people in Ohio and uh Virginia and i think California   its interesting isnt it   yeah it is   you know the gal i talked to in Maryland didnt own a car shes never traveled anywhere shes never been anywhere she you know i talked about one of the biggest problems in the United States being our roads and she didnt understand   she doesnt drive   how does she get to work   uh she uh lives on campus a college student buses and and uh public transportation   uhhuh i had a room   her her parents live by the public transportation   and i wish we could down here   well it would be nice but i kind of like the freedom too dont you   well sometimes but i tell you id sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work but if i did it itd take me about an hour and fifteen minutes i would have to get on one and drive or walk to a bus you know theres one terminal close to us and then theyd drive me to the main terminal here then id have to go to downtown Dallas and then walk over a couple of blocks and get on another bus to go to my school   right if its anything like uh   so thats too much   Dallas always has been no one wants to be at downtown Dallas much   yeah but there sure are a lot of people that work down there   is the crime rate still bad   definitely and i went down there a couple maybe three weeks ago for a trial   and i mean all these people were standing up that was you know during the workday all along the curve streets you know just   oh   all around these vacant buildings theres a lot of vacant buildings and theyre just being demolished   huh   and and they stink and beer and wine bottles all over the place huhuh   yeah huh thats terrible   umhum   so Garland how nice is it now its been a while since ive been there   you know i think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand its gotten big   yes it has   i think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty something like that and i didnt realize when i moved here that it was a separate town from Dallas   well yeah it is   you know i know now   where you from   but i didnt im from Kilgore Texas its in east   Kilgore i know where Kilgore is   oh where are you from   im im originally from Lubbock   are you   yeah   so whyd you move up to Colorado   seemed like the thing to do at the time   well its real pretty up there i have a friend in Denver   oh i love it the mountains i love the mountains   what do you going   uh back to the topic   what   it seems that uh more and more people are not owning owning traditional homes these days   theyre not owning homes period   yeah yeah uh everyone says you know when i bought this several years ago w hen our local economy was good everyone said no no youre crazy to buy a mobile home   uhhuh   but now it seems that uh with the local economy bad and TI and straits it seems that uh   it wasnt such a bad idea   oh theyre doing some backpedaling   so have you got uh land   no im renting at the time so   i did that one year i lived with two other girls and we all taught it was a two bedroom so we took turns you know   turns   having sharing the bedroom   yeah   i got to where i decided i wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom and then we had two baths it was just one the little bathroom were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in   well mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one ours is wood sided ours is wood sided   that was in the seventies uhhuh   and it has uh a traditional V top roof   im sorry   and uh its nine hundred and eighty square foot one two bedroom one bath   uhhuh   rooms are nice sized well you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms one bath its its comfy     so have have you got it underpinned   yes   are you required to by law   i dont know whether it is or not   we were down here     it was already setup when we bought it   yeah   well i bet its not bad   oh yeah its wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere and uh you know so its quieter than you remember mobile homes to be   okay but how much is yours when we bought ours we were paying two uh three hundred and twenty nine dollars   oh our payments are like two twenty   for how many years   fifteen   oh so it was still a lot cheaper   and uh what     so it was still a lot cheaper than what we did because ours is thirty years   and we bought one of the cheapest houses you know a tract house   yeah oh yes a mobile homes a heck of a lot cheaper and well actually whenever we got ours we picked it up used you know three or four years used and uh   which probably didnt make much difference   well yeah did   have a  on it   no no no what i meant not in quality what i meant was four years equity costs five hundred dollars   in the price gee nice huh   that sounds good   so you know theres not that much time left on the loan and   so if the economy gets better are you going to get another one another house   i dont know   no   uh to tell you the truth right now it feels kind of comfy to have our mobile home and have it so close to paid for you know i need to pickup and move somewhere else somewhere else is easy   but you wouldnt take that mobile home right   sure   you would   sure absolutely   itd be cheaper to move that than buy another one   oh absolutely when i you know when you talk about the deal like i got yeah yeah it would be cheaper uh especially if it were a paid move or something you know theres some paid moves occasionally   TI would pay move you   i dont know but they did when i when i moved up here so they might want to move away   so how many years you been up there   uh six or seven   do you snow ski   uh a little bit little bit mostly i just love walking the mountains driving in the mountains   its real pretty i went rock climbing one time   oh thats exciting   my friend talked me in that  im a real um scaredy when it comes to heights but once we got on top of the rocks it was quite
