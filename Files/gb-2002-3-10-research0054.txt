                    Background        Genomewide structural analyses in terms of patterns of        protein folding have been useful in revealing functional        and evolutionary relationships      Given the        abundance of membrane proteins it would be highly        desirable to have a similar analysis for this major        category of structures however the number of known        membrane protein structures remains small Here we exploit        the fact that membrane proteins can be classified into        families on the basis of sequence similarities and        topology and use the family groupings to analyze genomic        characteristics of membrane protein families        Most transmembrane proteins are formed from bundles of        helices that traverse the membrane lipid bilayer It is        estimated that  of the proteins in known genomes are        of this type      The most general description of        the transmembrane helical regions TMs is that they        comprise a region of  or more amino acids with a largely        hydrophobic character This sequence feature can be        identified in primary sequences using hydrophobicity scales            The most abundant amino acids in transmembrane        regions are leucine isoleucine valine phenylalanine        alanine glycine serine and threonine Taken together        these amino acids account for  of the amino acids in        transmembrane regions     Analysis of the        distribution of amino acids has revealed patterns in TM        regions for example GxxxG which are thought to be        important in helixhelix interactions                    We took advantage of the classification of protein        domains provided by others PfamA and PfamB   to        identify families that appear to be polytopic membrane        proteins and augmented these lists with additional family        members based on aminoacid sequence comparisons        Furthermore we identified additional families on the basis        of clustering of aminoacid sequences resulting in         distinct families We used these families to analyze        aminoacid compositions in the helical regions pair        motifs domain structures and patterns of families and        arrive at a number of generalizations Among these are that        glycine tyrosine and proline appear frequently in        conserved locations within family transmembrane helices and        that the specific pair motifs are found in families that        seem to be transporters symporters and channels The        number of kinds of domains and families seems to increase        with the number of open reading frames ORFs in most        genomes Here we present our analysis and discuss these        findings                    Results                  Classification of polytopic membrane protein          domains          The procedure used to classify polytopic membrane          domains is based mainly on family classification schemes          PfamA and PfamB and is shown in Figure a We          identified families of polytopic membrane domains in Pfam            by allocating TMhelices annotated in SWISSPROT            to proteins in Pfam After conservatively picking           PfamA and  PfamB families we conducted an analysis          of loops that connect TMhelices It was shown that the          loops tend to be short with most of them            having fewer than  amino acids We therefore took           residues as the maximal intradomain loop between          TMhelices to define polytopic membrane domains Though          the residue cutoff may not apply to a small portion          around  of integral membrane proteins it diminished          the chance of including soluble domains within membrane          domains given that the average soluble domain has about           residues            Using TMHMM a membrane protein prediction program          based on a hidden Markov model   TMhelices of          membrane proteins in  genomes were predicted Polytopic          membrane domains were identified using the loop size          between TMhelices as a guide These domains were then          classified into  PfamA and  PfamB families either          by direct SWISSPROT ID matching or by sequence          similarity matching using FASTA   Of the aligned          domains most of their TMhelices also aligned well          especially in PfamA families which have alignments          based on manually crafted hidden Markov models          Unclassified domains were clustered into  families by          their sequence similarities For each family a profile          was constructed as shown in Figure b This included an          averaged hydrophobicity plot of all members in the family          based on the GoldmanEngelmanSteitz GES scale   a          consensus sequence of the family represented by a          sequence logo plot   and consensus sequences of the          TMhelices By analyzing the hydrophobicity plots we can          locate TMhelices in the aligned sequences in protein          families and assign a number of TMhelices to each          family Some families including  in PfamA and  in          PfamB were eliminated at this step owing to the          ambiguity of TMhelices observed in the plot From this          process we identified  PfamA  PfamB and           clustered families for our analyses with approximately           domains classified in Pfam families                          Analysis of the number of TMhelices in PfamA          families of polytopic membrane domains          After assigning a number of TMhelices to each family          we conducted a survey of the assigned numbers of          TMhelices in  PfamA families of polytopic membrane          domains Figure  PfamA families are manually          classified families that have wellaligned protein          domains and most of them have a welldefined number for          TMhelices We also picked families in solute transport          systems that are annotated as transporters symporters          and channels and analyzed the number of TMhelices for          these families Figure           In general most PfamA families tend to have a small          number of TMhelices For those with seven or fewer          TMhelices the number of families does not vary          significantly with helix number although there are more          families with two or four TMhelices than with three          five six or seven For families with more than seven          TMhelices the number of families decreases sharply as          the number of TMhelices increases Families with           TMhelices are the exception however they have a small          peak in numbers against the overall downward slope of the          plot We also carried out the same kind of analysis on          PfamA families that are annotated as transporters          symporters and channels and found that TMhelix          families are preferred by transporterlike families In          addition most  out of  PfamA families with           TMhelices are transporterlike families There seems to          be a tendency for the transporterlike families to have          an even number of TMhelices because families with              and  TMhelices have a relatively higher          occurrence than those with a neighboring odd number of          TMhelices                          Analysis of aminoacid distribution and pair          motifs          We selected  families from PfamA that had more          than  members For each of these families we then          generated consensus sequences with conservation value R           sequence  using the Alpro program            Relatively conserved amino acids in the consensus          sequences R           sequence value   representing          the top  R           sequence value of all amino acids and          in TMhelical regions were analyzed for their composition          as well as for pair motifs          We compared the aminoacid composition of the          TMhelices in general with the composition of only the          conserved positions in TMhelices in the  families          Figure  We noticed that some amino acids are          considerably more prevalent in the conserved positions          such as glycine  average composition in TMhelices          versus  composition in conserved positions of          TMhelices proline  versus  and tyrosine           versus  In contrast isoleucine  versus           valine  versus  methionine  versus  and          threonine  versus  are less prevalent in conserved          positions          As might be expected the changes in prevalence of          certain amino acids reflect their conservation in the          consensus sequence Therefore glycine proline and          tyrosine are relatively conserved residues in TMhelical          regions and isoleucine valine methionine and threonine          have relatively high mutability This result correlates          very well with the mutation data matrix MDM for          multispanning transmembrane regions in membrane proteins            In the MDM of multispanning transmembrane           helices isoleucine methionine and valine are found to          have relatively high mutability as hydrophobic residues          and serine and threonine also rank high in mutability as          polar residues In the matrix proline appears to be          highly conserved Our results confirm these findings in          addition we find that glycine and tyrosine are also          highly conserved residues in polytopic TMhelices          We also analyzed the consensus sequences of  PfamA          families for significant aminoacid pair motifs and          compared our findings with previous studies Table shows          three pair lists one includes the top  pairs of Senes           et al with their significance            the second includes the top  pairs with their          occurrences from randomly generated pairs and the third          includes the top  pairs with their occurrences using          Senes           et al s top  most significant          pairs Of the three lists the GxxxG pair always ranks          first highlighting its significance in TMhelices              In the last list which contains topranked          pairs in the first two lists we observed some          interesting pairmotif patterns that are associated with          glycine Aminoacid pairs such as ZxxxZ and ZxxxxxxZ Z          represents glycine alanine or serine  residues with a          small side chain are highly ranked in the last list It          is known that amino acids are positioned with an average          of  residues per turn in TMhelices   Two          residues that are separated by three or six residues are          thus oriented in the same direction Therefore it was          suggested that these motifs are favored for TMhelix          packing    Our results are in good agreement with          the pair motifs that are formed with small residues but          do not favor pairs with branched aliphatic residues          isoleucine and valine This is probably because          isoleucine and valine are highly mutable residues in          TMhelices          Of all the  PfamA families of polytopic membrane          domains we studied  are classified as transporters          channels and symporters representing  of the total          families We studied GxxxG and GxxxxxxG pairs and found          that they tend to be associated within          transporterchannellike membrane proteins Table           When one or both glycines is mutated to a small residue          such as serine or alanine this association is weakened          Therefore GxxxG and GxxxxxxG pairs are relatively          conserved in transporterchannellike membrane proteins          By comparing the aminoacid composition of conserved          residues in the TMhelices of the transporterlike          families with that of the rest of the PfamA families          Table  we found that glycine is two times more          conserved in the transporterlike families reflecting          the favored GxxxG and GxxxxxxG pairs in these families          Proline and asparagine are also among the conserved          residues favored in transporterlike families whereas          cysteine histidine isoleucine leucine methionine and          valine are unfavored                          Genomewide analysis of families of polytopic          membrane domains          Classified polytopic membrane protein domains          represent from  to  of the total polytopic membrane          domains in the genomes studied with an average coverage          of  Figure a We kept the family classification          relatively conservative instead of aiming for a high          overall coverage with a less careful classification To          avoid including falsely predicted families we based our          analysis on families with no fewer than four members          However a higher proportion of polytopic membrane          domains could be classified if smaller families were          considered Figure a          We classified polytopic membrane domains into PfamA          PfamB and selfclustered families Figure bshows the          distribution of these three kinds of families in all the          genomes Most of the classified polytopic membrane          domains belong to PfamA and PfamB which cover  of          classified domains          Classified polytopic membrane domains and their          families were studied in relation to the number of ORFs          in each genome Figure ashows the number of classified          polytopic membrane domains versus the number of ORFs in          all the genomes and Figure bshows the same relation in          genomes of singlecelled organisms A rough linear          relation seems to exist between the number of classified          polytopic membrane domains and the number of ORFs in each          genome However it is interesting that           C elegans is an obvious outlier in          the trend To try to explain this we took a closer look          at the biggest families of polytopic membrane domains in           C elegans Figure c The three          biggest families in           C elegans are PF PF          and PB which are described as TM chemoreceptor          families The annotation of PB is from PD in          Prodom   These families are almost unique to           C elegans as most of their          members in Pfam are from           C elegans These families contain          wellamplified membrane domains with total numbers of            and  respectively Those numbers are more          than double the biggest family in           Drosophila melanogaster which is          PF Sugar and other transporter with  members          By removing the number of proteins in these three          families a total of  we can see a better fit of           C elegans to the trend line So          the unusually large number of polytopic membrane domains          is likely to be caused by protein amplification in a few          families          This hypothesis was supported by analysis of Figure          d which shows the number of families of polytopic          membrane domains in relation to the number of ORFs in          studied genomes The number of families seems to have a          logarithmic relation in all studied genomes including           C elegans Given that           C elegans has an unusually large          number of polytopic membrane domains but a normal number          of families the amplification of polytopic membrane          domains is limited to a few families                            Discussion        Polytopic membrane domains of integral membrane proteins        in  genomes have been classified into  families which        include  PfamA  PfamB and  clustered families        Only families that are reasonably big   members were        selected The classified families were used for aminoacid        distribution and pattern studies for genomewide        analysis        Our studies on aminoacid distribution and patterns were        conducted on PfamA families We also analyzed PfamB and        the clustered families but found fewer conservations        probably because the PfamB and the clustered families are        not as carefully aligned as PfamA families In the        analysis of aminoacid positions glycine proline and        tyrosine were found to be the most conserved residues in        TMhelical regions whereas isoleucine valine methionine        and threonine were identified as the least conserved        residues relative to average occurrence This result is        mostly consistent with previous results from an MDM          Although hydrophobic residues such as leucine and        isoleucine are among the most abundant residues in        TMhelices they are not well conserved in position The        observed conservation in position for residues such as        glycine proline and tyrosine raises the question of        whether these residues are associated with the functions of        integral membrane proteins        We also studied aminoacid pair motifs in the conserved        sequences in classified families We show that pairs        consisting of a glycine and another small amino acid        glycine alanine or serine and facing the same direction        in TM helices are common in conserved positions As those        pair motifs have been shown to be important for packing of        TMhelices     conservation of those motifs        probably implies their importance in folding stability of        integral membrane proteins as is the case with hydrophobic        residues found in the core regions of soluble proteins        Our results have some interesting implications for the        classified PfamA families annotated as transporters        symporters and channels First there is a preference for         TMhelices among these families As there is no TM        transporter protein structure available we do not know        exactly why a  TMhelix bundle is preferred for        transport The structure of MsbA from         Escherichia coli   an        ATPbinding cassette ABC transporter homolog was        recently solved It contains  TMhelices in a homodimer        of two TMhelical bundles which form a central chamber        to translocate substrates However it is unlikely that        polytopic membrane domains in the TM PfamA families        have a structure like that of ABC transporters as there is        no obvious sequence similarity within the sequence        containing the  TMhelices it is unlikely to form two        TMhelical bundles By looking at structures of other        transport proteins including the potassium channel          the mechanosensitive ion channel   the aquaporin water        channel   and the glycerol facilitator channel          it is apparent that  TMhelices are needed to form a        tunnel and transport molecules This means that proteins        with a small number of TMhelices must oligomerize to form        a proper tunnel to translocate molecules through the        membrane In addition families of these proteins tend to        have GxxxG and GxxxxxxG instead of related motifs that have        one or both glycines changed to alanine or serine While        this preference is interesting we do not know its origin        Perhaps it reflects especially tight packing among helices        in transporters permitting the CHO hydrogen bonding        that has been discussed          We also studied the distribution of classified families        in  genomes Although the classified families of        polytopic membrane domains do not provide complete coverage        of the total potential polytopic membrane domains we think        they include most membrane proteins that have essential        functions in these genomes The excluded domains are either        unique in function for the organism or falsely predicted        In most genomes the number of classified polytopic membrane        domains seems to have a linear relation with the number of        ORFs However         C elegans is an outlier to this        trend By studying the families in         C elegans we found that it has an        exceptional number of TMhelical membrane domains most        of which are annotated as chemoreceptors As         C elegans cannot see or hear but        must search for food chemosensation is key to survival         C elegans mediates chemosensation by         neurons that are mostly arranged in bilateral pairs on        the left and right sides and it is estimated that there        are about  Gproteincoupled receptors that act in        chemosensation   We have now identified many        chemoreceptors  classified into three large families        Therefore classification of polytopic membrane domains        into families gives us another way to look at the        distribution and functions of integral membrane proteins in        genomes                    Materials and methods                  Databases          In this study the following databases were used          SWISSPROT release  and updated to  December             which contains  protein entries Pfam          release    which contains  protein          families in PfamA and  families in PfamB

 Classification of polytopic membrane protein          domains          Figure ashows our complete classification procedure          We extracted  protein entries in the SWISSPROT          database containing no less than two TRANSMEM annotations          in the FT field In these proteins a total of           transmembrane TM regions were allocated to proteins in          the Pfam database By analyzing the location of TM          regions in protein domains of each Pfam family we were          able to identify families that contain polytopic membrane          protein domains We went through a relatively          conservative procedure to identify potential families of          polytopic membrane domains First a Pfam family needed          to have a significant number of proteins containing no          fewer than two TM regions to be identified as a polytopic          membrane domain family Second all families in PfamA          and some in PfamB that have more than seven members are          analyzed as the PfamB database is under development and          contains thousands of small protein families Finally we          identified  PfamA and  PfamB families Proteins          in these families contain  TM regions representing          approximately  of the total TM regions extracted from          SWISSPROT We analyzed sizes of the loops between all          the TM regions as shown in the inner chart of Figure           By Pfams protein domain classification most loops            are short peptides containing less than  amino          acids          Proteins from  genomes were submitted to TMHMM          server for TMhelix prediction   Predicted membrane          proteins were searched for polytopic membrane domains          using a rule generated from the above result that the          intramembranedomain loop sizes must be less than           amino acids To identify domains that are included in the          Pfam families that have been identified we searched the          defined polytopic membrane domains for SWISSPROT ID          matches and regional matches Unmatched domains are          further classified on the basis of Pfams classification          and additional  PfamA and  PfamB families are          identified small size PfamB families with no less than          four members and no less than three matches are          selected In total we identified  PfamA and           PfamB families as polytopic membrane domains As not all          proteins from the  genomes are included in Pfam we          then tried to assign the unclassified polytopic membrane          domains to the identified Pfam families by sequence          similarity matching to proteins in these families We          used the FASTA program   to search for matches and          matches with           E values less than  were          considered positive Obviously one can assign PfamA          domains using the HMMer software   which they are          closely associated with However we chose to take a          somewhat simpler tack using FASTA This is a somewhat          more conservative approach finding fewer homologs which          has the advantage of using consistent thresholds that can          be applied to all the searches Query domains were          assigned to Pfam families that their best matches belong          to          As for those that have not been classified into Pfam          families by either ID match or by sequencesimilarity          match we tried to cluster these into families on the          basis of their sequence similarities This procedure was          done by an allagainstall sequence similarity search            E value   using FASTA          and polytopic membrane domains were clustered by applying          a multiple linkage clustering method   to the FASTA          results           N family members must have more          than            N            N  links to other members with          tolerance of  missing links among members We selected           clustered families that contain no fewer than four          members and aligned protein sequences in each family          using the CLUSTAL W program   For a complete list of          assigned polytopic membrane domains see Additional data          files and                            TMhelix identification in the families of          polytopic membrane domains          We assume that all protein domains in a classified          family have a defined number of TMhelices To identify          the number of TMhelices we made a hydrophobic plot for          each family of polytopic membrane domain We took the          aligned sequences in Pfams families and in clustered          families and calculated the averaged GES hydrophobic          values   of all the residues at each aligned position          Deleted and inserted residues represented by  and           respectively are given  individual values The          plot for each family was generated by the averaged GES          values along their corresponding aligned positions Most          hydrophobic regions were clearly defined as most          TMhelices aligned well in each family By identifying          hydrophobic regions in the plots we assigned numbers of          TMhelices to classified families of polytopic membrane          proteins We also eliminated  PfamA and  PfamB          families as they did not contain multiple hydrophobic          regions in their hydrophobicity plots Therefore we have           PfamA  PfamB and  clustered families for          further analysis                          Analysis of aminoacid distribution and pair          motifs          We analyzed  PfamA families with more than           members and generated consensus sequences with their          sequence logos of all aligned sequences in these families          using the Alpro sequence logo program   The selected          family size threshold of  members is somewhat          arbitrary We chose it because first a significant          portion  of the  classified PfamA families had          more than  members and second the potential bias from          small families could be reduced as they tend to have more          conserved residues than big families However we can          show that our results remain unaffected by changing this          threshold In particular we analyzed PfamA families          containing more than    or  members and got          essentially the same results Amino acids with sequence          conservation values R           sequence  of no less than  top           of all values were considered as conserved residues          For all the families we counted the occurrences of amino          acids in the consensus sequences and in all aligned          sequences in hydrophobic regions which are defined to          have no fewer than  continuous amino acids with GES          hydrophobicity value greater than           We used the pair definition from a previous study            For example a pair XY           n X and Y represent amino acids          and           n a number corresponds to amino          acids X and Y separated by            n  residues We analyzed          occurrences of pair motifs of all combinations of amino          acids separated by  to  residues This result was          compared with a previous study of the  most          significant overrepresented pairs                             Analysis of the families of polytopic membrane          domain in genomes          Using simple crossreferencing based on the above          procedure proteomic entries in each genome were searched          for matches of polytopic membrane domains of classified          families Numbers of membrane domains in classified          families were counted and analyzed in all genomes          studied                            Additional data files        A complete listof assigned
