                    Background        Fabry disease is an Xlinked disorder resulting in        reduced activity of the lysosomal enzyme galactosidase A             This results in the systemic accumulation of        Dgalatosyl conjugates particularly globotriosylceramide        Gb      Although the disorder is heterogeneous        patients suffer renal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular        complications     Enzyme replacement therapy has        recently shown to have an effect on resting cerebral blood        flow abnormalities and on other organ systems functions             In the cerebrovascular system there is an increased        incidence of stroke together with vessel ectasia            This may be related to the progressive accumulation of        storage material in the cerebral vessel or possibly may be        due to an abnormality of vessel function      The        cerebrovascular complications are distributed predominantly        in the posterior circulation with a progressive increase        over time in the posterior distribution of small vessel        disease as found on T          weighted images or fluid attenuated        inversion recovery FLAIR MR       It likely that        such high signal lesions on MR images represent ischemic        small vessel disease however there are no        neuropathologicalradiological correlative studies        confirming this assumption Since ischemic brain lesions        are irreversible and accumulate over years demonstrating        a reduction in incidence is likely to require prolonged        therapy in a relatively large cohort of patients following        this disease endpoint Previously in Fabry disease we        have reported resting cerebral hyperperfusion in a        predominantly vertebrobasilar distribution together with        abnormalities of vascular nitrotyrosine staining This was        reversed by enzyme replacement therapy      The        current study examines the cerebrovascular system in Fabry        disease in response to functional and pharmacological        activation        We hypothesized that the cerebral vasculopathy of Fabry        disease is associated with abnormal cerebrovascular        responses and furthermore that these would normalize with        repeated intravascular infusion of galactosidase A             We compared the functional cerebrovascular responses in        Fabry disease to those in age and sex matched controls        using both visual stimulation and acetazolamide challenge        by  OH          O and positron emission tomography        PET to measure rCBF The patients were then reexamined        following a month doubleblind placebocontrolled trial        of enzyme replacement therapy ERT Functional activation        by visual stimulation was chosen to examine the        vertebrobasilar diathesis of Fabry disease Acetazolamide        on the other hand was hypothesized to identify areas of        decreased cerebral perfusion following maximal cerebral        vasodilation in Fabry disease compared to controls Such an        abnormality if present might then be used to assess the        therapeutic efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy        We define our usage of the term cerebral         vasomotor reserve as CBF         res  the CBF response at  or         minutes postacetazolamide challenge minus the resting CBF        for each subject We define cerebral         vascular reactivity as the functional        CBF response to a stimulus minus the resting CBF CBF         react  while the maximal response to        acetazolamide challenge provides an index of the        cerebrovascular capacity The CBF response curve to        acetazolamide can be considered like a high pass filter        with an onset time constant to a steady state           and an offset time constant of            Alteration and prolongation of           will correspond to         prolonged cerebral vascular response        time  An important concept of a high pass filter is        that the system response is dependent on both the resistive        R and capacitative C elements Hence the steady state        value as well as time constants           and           depend on both the R and C components        Therefore the value of CBF         res also depends on the RC component of        the cerebral vascular system so that if there is an        increased R component then CBF         res will be reduced a situation seen in        cerebral vasoocclusive disease If on the other hand the        RC components are approximately equal in the comparison        groups similar steady state values of CBF and CBF         res values will be seen The magnitude        of the steady state response by itself gives an index of        the cerebrovascular capacitative component C                    Patients and Methods                  Patients          The methodology for this work has been described in          detail     Twentysix male hemizygote patients with          Fabry disease age range  mean age             years and  control subjects age range  years          mean age    years were enrolled in the study          The Institutional Review Board of the National Institute          of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the NIH          Radiation Safety Committee approved the study and all          patients and healthy volunteers gave their written and          informed consent All patients recruited to this study          had neuropathic pain main inclusion criterion no focal          or global neurological deficits and normal clotting          function Radiological evidence consistent with small          vessel disease was noted primarily on the FLAIR MRI as          hyperintense signal areas in  patients Four patients          had one lesion on FLAIR imaging three patients had           lesions and three patients had   lesions There was          no significant progression of the lesion burden over the          month trial period No significant radiological          abnormality was found on magnetic resonance angiography          in the Fabry patients with no report of dolichoectasia          One patient randomized to the placebo study arm          withdrew from the study for personal reasons and three          further patients  from the ERT group and  from the          placebo group declined the followup acetazolamide          challenge arm of the study at completion of the trial A          further patient had suffered a lacunar infarct ten years          prior to commencement of the present study The          doubleblind placebocontrolled randomized trial of ERT          consisted of intravenous infusions of  galactosidase A                     Replagal  every two weeks          Transkaryotic Therapies Inc Cambridge MA with          fourteen patients receiving ERT and twelve placebo for          six months                          PET Procedure          PET was performed with a Scanditronix PCB          tomograph tranverse resolution of  mm A radial          arterial line was placed in all participants for          measurement of the  OH            O input function and arterial blood          gases Subjects were aligned in the scanner with slices          parallel to the orbitalmeatal line with at least one          slice obtained within the posterior fossa The head was          restrained with a thermoplastic facemask Transmission          scans were obtained with a rotating Ge Ga pin          source and were used to correct emission scans for          attenuation          Emission scans four minutes duration were obtained          after intravenous injection of  mCi of  OH            O and were begun automatically          following arrival of radioactivity in the brain Each          study commenced with a sham scan in order to acclimatize          the subject to scanning procedure which was followed by          two resting cerebral blood flow scans during which the          subject maintained eye closure Two scans during visual          stimulation were also performed  minutes apart During          visual activation the subjects were asked to focus on a          black and white pattern reversal screen The reversal          frequency was  Hz This stimulus frequency is known to          induce the maximal change in the striate cortex blood          flow     The visual stimulus was commenced           seconds before radioactivity reached the head Following          the visual activation scans intravenous acetazolamide          was injected at a dose of  mgkg body weight and two          further scans were obtained  and  minutes later                          Data Analysis          The time shift between arterial blood and brain data          was determined by aligning the scanner count rate data          sampled at  Hz to the blood data with the slice count          data fitted to a onetissue compartment twoparameter          model The CBF images were constructed from a          pixelbypixel least square fit for blood flow and          partition coefficient      The MRI T template was          downloaded from the Montreal Neurological Institute          httpwwwbicmnimcgillca     This served as a          template for spatially registering the PET data Prior to          spatial registration the MRI template and PET rCBF images          were resampled to   mm isotropic voxels          Pixelbypixel averaging of the replicated visual          activation PET scans was performed Spatial registration          of the PET images and T MRI template was performed using          SPM httpwwwfilionuclacukspmspmhtml                       The analysis is divided into a comparison of the          baseline Fabry group with the control group and the          comparison of the ERT group with the placebo group A          straight comparison was made between the control group          and the baseline time zero Fabry group visual and          acetazolamide coregistered PET data using SPM allowing          appropriate multiple comparisons analyses In order to          isolate a potential treatment effect following ERT a          mixed statistical model was used This analysis of          variance model divides the total variance into fixed and          random effects with the treatment effect attributable to          the fixed effect A twostep approach was adopted The          first allowing isolation of the fixed effect by forming          subtraction images for each patient by subtracting the          pretrial response from the posttrial response forming a          contrast image The second consisted of direct comparison          of the ERT and nonERT subgroups contrast images In this          way the attributable treatment effects were compared for          the analysis of the visual activation and acetazolamide          responses on a patientbypatient basis This gave for          each patient a difference image representing an          independent estimate of each subjects response to visual          activation and acetazolamide after ERT or placebo          Statistical parametric maps SPMt were then calculated          on the spatially registered PET images by obtaining a          setlevel statistic of p   after setting the          voxel threshold at p   or less and the cluster          extent at  or greater The cluster extent threshold          represents  cm of brain tissue The setlevel          statistic represents the statistical significance of the          compared data volumes All the pvalues given in the          Results section are the setlevel statistic          In order to characterize the visual activation          response further a specific region of interest ROI was          used that included Brodmann areas   and  as          determined from the TalairachTournoux electronic brain          atlas     The visual ROI was derived from T MRI          template which was then used to mask the SPM registered          CBF images prior to calculation of the visual CBF          responses The mean visual cortex CBF and global CBF          values were calculated on a pixelbypixel basis after          setting a CBF threshold value of  mlmin g of          tissue below which the pixels were excluded from          calculation This CBF level represents the lower limit of          CNS tissue viability The ROI consisted of both gray and          white matter areas associated with the visual cortex and          association areas                            Results                  Visual Activation Studies Table           Mean absolute CBF in the visual cortex

found in          the visual area CBF           react between patients and controls          After enzyme replacement therapy there was no significant          change in the mean absolute CBF response

 or thirtyminute time point Following the enzyme          replacement trial no significant change in the global          CBF was found at the minutes postacetazolamide time          point in the ERT

       minutes postacetazolamide in the ERT group compared          to the placebo group No difference in the global          vasomotor reserve was found between Fabry patients and          controls before or following ERT                          Regional SPM Analysis of Visual Activation and          Acetazolamide Challenge Studies          There was a significantly increased blood flow in the          Fabry patients during visual stimulation compared to          controls Figure  p   The increased rCBF was          found predominantly in the posterior circulation area and          visual cortex but some voxels increases in rCBF were          found in the anterior circulation No rCBF voxels were          found to be significantly greater in the control group          compared to the Fabry group data not shown Restriction          of the rCBF analysis to Talairachdefined visual cortex          ROI showed no significant difference in visual reactivity          CBF           react  between the patient and          control groups          Following acetazolamide at the minute time point          the rCBF in the control group was significantly elevated          in a more central and anterior distribution p            while the distribution of the higher rCBF voxels in the          Fabry group was more posterior data not shown p            At the minute time point the

  cerebral vascular response time No difference in          regional CBF           res between the Fabry and control          groups was found indicating normal regional cerebral          vascular

      significantly decreased areas of rCBF were found in the          placebo group A reduction in rCBF was also found when          the analysis was restricted to the visual cortex p            with no areas of significantly decreased rCBF in          the placebo group ERT led to decreased rCBF after          acetazolamide infusion at both time points time            minutes p   time   minutes p            Figure  No significant decrease in rCBF was found at a          comparable cluster extent and voxel threshold in the          placebo group                            Discussion        Our data indicate the presence of an abnormal functional        response to visual stimulation both in global and regional        CBF analysis in Fabry disease This however was not due to        an alteration in vascular reactivity Previously we        demonstrated that the resting rCBF in Fabry disease is        elevated compared to controls particularly in the posterior        circulation     In view of the normal visual area        reactivity in Fabry disease these findings indicate that        the Fabry group response to visual activation is largely        explained by the elevated resting rCBF However the more        generalized cerebrovascular response noted in both the        carotid and vertebrobasilar circulation suggests stimulus        spread in Fabry disease possibly due to a decreased        response threshold in nonvisual cortex vasculature        Following ERT this resting rCBF abnormality was reversed                   The cerebral visual stimulation paradigm used in the        current study is known to induce maximal cerebral blood        flow    and is therefore a useful stimulus for the        study of neurovascular coupling Visual stimulation was        chosen in particular because of the known predilection of        the cerebrovascular abnormalities in Fabry disease for the        posterior circulation      The lack of an increase or        decrease in visual rCBF reactivity in Fabry disease        suggests normal neurovascular coupling mechanism                    Acetazolamideinduced maximal cerebral vasodilatory        response is often used to assess cerebrovascular reserve            The greatest difference between our patients and        controls occurred at the minute time point rather than        at the minute time point of the acetazolamide challenge        This finding is consistent with a prolongation of the        cerebral vascular response time in the Fabry disease ERT        significantly decreased the prolonged cerebral vascular        response time The vasodilator effect of acetazolamide on        the cerebral vasculature has been characterized by both PET        and transcranial Doppler TCD studies      At a        dose of  mgkg the effect of acetazolamide is thought to        be supramaximal with maximal cerebral vasodilation induced        within about  minutes By TCD a maximal doseresponse was        found to occur with an acetazolamide infusion of between         and  mgkg with maximal vasoreactivity occurring between         and  minutes post acetazolamide     Using  OH                 O and PET a further study of rCBF        following  g of acetazolamide demonstrated the peak        response to occur at  minutes while the plateau phase        occurred during the twenty to thirty minute time period        post acetazolamide     The measurements in the current        study obtained at twenty and thirty minutes post        acetazolamide injection therefore probably corresponds to        the plateau phase of reported acetazolamide responses        The CBF response to supramaximal acetazolamide        challenge consists of a phase of increasing CBF followed by        a plateau phase with a terminal recovery phase This can be        considered in terms of cerebrovascular resistance and        capacity analogous to a high pass filter where high        frequency components of the system response are removed        The importance of this analogy is that the plateau response        is dependent on both the systems resistive and        capacitative components In the present study it was seen        that the vasomotor reserve in Fabry disease was within        normal limits despite the elevated resting rCBF The        cerebrovascular capacity in Fabry disease was also within        normal limits suggesting absence of clinically significant        vasoocclusive disease in the cohort of Fabry patients        examined This finding is supported by the absence of        abnormalities on magnetic resonance angiography in the same        group Reduced CBF         res would be expected when the resistive        component is increased reducing the amplitude of the        acetazolamide induced plateau response        The hyperemic cerebrovascular response to hypercapnia or        acetazolamide is not inhibited by nitric oxide synthase        inhibitors such as         N GmonomethylLarginine LNMMA        suggesting that NO does not mediate vasoreactivity             The mechanism of acetazolamide vasodilation beyond        smooth muscle intracellular and extracellular acidosis due        carbonic anhydrase inhibition is unclear Abnormalities of        the peripheral vasculature responses to acetylcholine have        been previously described in Fabry disease together with        nitric oxide pathway dysregulation     suggesting        participation of nonNO regulation of vascular tone A        similar vascular hyperresponsiveness has been noted in        caveolin knockout mice     raising the possibility        that the accumulation of Gb          results in overactivity of uncoupled        endothelial nitric oxide synthase within endothelial cell        caveolae generating superoxide and other reactive oxygen        species     The latter may have a vasodilatatory        effect     Predominance of vascular abnormalities in        the vertebrobasilar system in Fabry disease suggests        fundamental biologic differences between the anterior and        the posterior circulation Such difference might for        example result from the neural crest origin of pericytes        and vascular smooth muscle in the anterior circulation as        opposed to paraxial mesoderm in the vertebrobasilar or        posterior circulation                        Conclusion        The current study indicates that ERT normalized        acetazolamideinduced prolonged cerebral vascular response        time in Fabry disease This finding suggests that the        underlying abnormality is present at the luminal side of        the bloodbrain barrier BBB complex and is due to an        abnormality of the cerebral vessels since it is unlikely        that galactosidase A crosses the BBB to any appreciable        extent Further the treatment effect appeared to be        uniform across all cerebral vascular distributions
