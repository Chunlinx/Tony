                       In theBible Belt WWJD Can Mean Willy Wonka Just Died                        After reading AlfredGingolds July  article Onward Christian Clothiers my first reaction was that ol Alfieshould take a breath Who doesnt go through everyday life and see things thatdisturb ones aesthetic sense Our culture is a sloganeering one Why shouldChristianity be any different Every companys marketing strategy has anunderlying secondary messagedrink Mountain Dew and youre extreme  buyTommy Hilfiger Gingolds example and youre young attractive and not afraidto look like every other frat boy in the country            My guessis that Gingold doesnt get out of New York much Here in the Bible Belt wevelearned to desensitize ourselves to the crass underbelly of organized religionMy daughter comes home from school and tells me that other kids have come upwith alternative meanings to the WWJD acronymWe Want Jelly DoughnutsWilly Wonka Just Died etc There will always be people who wear this crapand others who get to make fun of them Fair trade             EdwardGoggin Tulsa Okla                           Ill Takethe Bait                        I wasoffended by the article Onward Christian Clothiers even though I am not religious Theidea that someone wearing their religion on their sleeve is someone to belooked down upon is antiAmerican at best I am happy that people of faith arefinally coming out of the closet so to speak Articles like this one invitereactionism which is I suppose what the writer wants Too bad             Matt Denny                                       DoubleStandards                        I find itinteresting that Alfred Gingold in Onward Christian Clothiers doesnt have a problem withproabortion Tshirts or vulgar Tshirts shit happens coed nudebasketball bitch on wheels etc but finds it necessary to tee off onevangelical Christian apparel Why do overtly Christian messages bother him somuch Could it be that the claims of Christ make him uncomfortable It seemsthat the only time liberals get excited about censorship is when it comes topreaching Jesus Hmm             Jim Ost                                       Get WithIt Ye of Little Faith                        RegardingOnward ChristianClothiers I often wonder if the peddlers of religious schlock haveactually read any Scripture beyond the gory heres hell in your facepassages But please The Christians are at it again There is more toChristianity than the Christian rightboth Roman Catholic andevangelicalfundamentalist The broad brush paints a picture ofselfrighteousness whoever

Brown                        Now Im well aware that itsTina Browns world and the rest of us are just living in it but really folksenoughs enough                   Slate               s coverage of Browns departure to La LaLand has been a tad shall we say excessive It was bad enough that thesubject was covered ad nauseam and I mean ad nauseam in The Breakfast Table this week and treated as a serious newsdevelopment in Culturebox But when I saw this mornings teaser                  Slate               s Tina Brown Roundup I had to wonder whether you peoplehave lost all perspective            Perhaps Im wrong and otherreaders are as endlessly fascinated with Brown as                   Slate                itselfis But I suspect many agree with me that Browns job change is essentially anindustry insider story that holds little interest for those of who  dontwork in the magazine trade and  dont hang in New Yorks trendiercircles                           Laffaire Brown was worth

Washington                           And WhoGives a F About Linda Tripps Motives                        I am at a loss to explain themedias and publics desire to understand the motives behind Linda Trippstape recordings as exemplified in the Linda Tripp Victimized orVicious dialogue between Jonah Goldberg and Margaret Carlson What do hermotives matter in the context of either the investigation of the president orthe investigation into her own taping            The importance of Trippsmotives is not the same as for say Paula Jonesbecause Tripp is not thepresidents accuser She has passed along tape recordings that allegedlyimplicate the president by the words of a third party Now whether Lewinskyswords are truth and whether they were drawn out through Tripps entrapmentwhich would also be on the tapes are valid issues But not Tripps motives inmaking the recordings            Maybe shes good and maybeshes bad Maybe you or I would not tape a friend or maybe we think thatTripps friendship is not what we would call friendship but her motives inmaking the tapes are irrelevant to the charges against the president While Ihave been a staunch Clinton supporter and to some extent defender the factthat we are allowing our debate over Tripps character and motives to enterinto our debate over whether the president perjured himself or encouragedothers to do so shows the effectiveness of the White House spin doctors            Pleasestop worrying about Tripps motivesif there is a debate over this it is adebate over the limits of friendship when confronted with potentiallycriminal acts on the part of the friend This is a valid question but Trippsmorals per se are irrelevant Stop wasting your editorial bandwidth andreporters time on this

nerd When I was an undergraduate at RennselaerPolytechnic Institute about  years ago it was widely believed that knurdthe pronunciation was the same was simply drunk spelled backward            The usage was similar tocurrent usage A knurd was someone who spent too much time studying and notenough time socializing This was in sharp contrast to the stereotypical fratboys who in a time when the word party was exclusively a noun wouldconsume excessive amounts of alcohol as part of their recreational activitiesThe two campus archetypes were considered to be such polar opposites that theword knurd emerged In those days in addition to the illfittingpermanentpress clothes that didnt seem to work the pocket protector and thethick glasses held together with electrical tape the protoknurd wore a sliderule on his belt The stereotype was so pervasive and pejorative that even atRPI one seldom actually saw a beltmounted slide rule a pocket protector orglasses repaired with tape            I

on astory written a year or more ago takes a certain bending of reality Is this alow cost means for creating the appearance of beefedup content I would muchprefer that                   Slate

LawrenceKorbs July  statement in The stCentury Military that Reserve ground combat units at the brigade leveland above cannot be maintained at any reasonable level of readiness on aparttime basis because of the complexity of combined arms He accuratelystates the current situation for US Reserve and National Guard combat unitsHe also implies that it would be impossible to maintain combat readiness insuch units I believe this is wrong            The current Army Reserve andguard units typically conduct their training one weekend each month and twoweeks each year For combat and combat support units the weekend training isusually a waste of time In my six years as a member of a US Army Reservemilitary intelligence battalion in the s we did useful field training onat most a dozen of the more than  weekend drills I attended Even on thoseoccasions most of the time was spent traveling to and from the training areasThe two weeks annual training was much more useful but even that gave us atmost a week of field training since there were several days of preparationsfor the move to the training site and several more days of equipment cleanupafter training            I believe that reserve andguard combat and combat support units should eliminate the weekend drills andinstead have a single one month annual training AT The benefits of thiswould be to            Increase the number ofeffective field training days from seven to  This assumes that the number ofpreparation and cleanup days could be kept the same            Reduce the effect ofpersonnel turnover In a man unit about every four months we lost a persondue to enlistment expiration and gained a person There was no way to set upa stable team to build skills because we constantly had to train someone new inthe basic tasks During AT the teams could be restructured once at thebeginning and then remain stable through the remaining portion oftraining            Reduce the geographicdependence of units Since unit members must go to weekend drills every monththey must be close enough to the reserve center With a single AT evenpersonnel from across the state or country could be flown out and back once ayear to the reserve center Estimated cost to fly  reservists at each is  million The cost could be even less if Air Force Reserve unitstransported the Army reservistsand not every reservist would have to beflown The cost would also be offset by the lower personnel costs  days payinstead of the  days pay the typical reservist receives each year            Pleasenote that I am not advocating a change to the training for combat servicesupport maintenance personnel and logistics units Many of these units areable to conduct meaningful training on weekend drills since their trainingdoes not rely as heavily on being in the field             Randy Heath                                       Address your email tothe editors to lettersslatecom Please include your address and daytime phonenumber for
