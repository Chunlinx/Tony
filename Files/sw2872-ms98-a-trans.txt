                okay   perhaps uh maybe we were a little unsure because we were looking at something broader you know nationwide worldwide or something maybe we should look city wide   okay   you know or school board wide or you know what im saying narrow the topic a little and see if if we dont uh recognize some trends there   oh okay okay   um one thing that i definitely have noticed in our area as far as the school system at least uh token wise  im not sure that uh really truly uh   umhum   uh were effectively counting but at at least for a show were involving more parents in input and   more parent input   umhum umhum um like i say this all may be in name only   umhum   kind of thing at this point but at least its a step in the right direction i think   well do you have school age children   i have five school age children   oh so youre youre definitely more involved at least in the schools school system my children are grown so   umhum yeah   so   well we uh we try to keep abreast of it uh of some of the things that are that are going on and weve uh weve just gone through some city elections here in in Plano for our city council   for city council do you all have a mayor or   yes yes   you do yeah we we do in Houston too   uhhuh uhhuh Whitmire is is she still the   yeah yeah shes still shes still there but it looks like uh she may have some the opposition or theyre theyre trying to beat them shes been in for so long so we may hear some interesting things about her before election time comes up   umhum   this time but shes uh uh okay i dont know is  would a trend does it seem to be were having more minority type people women in government   yes   as far as in the local like our  our our our our chief of police is a woman our our mayor is a woman our superintendent superintendent of of schools was a woman shes just now you know been pushed out   umhum umhum   but i dont know if you would consider that a trend or not   oh i definitely think its a trend uh you know this morning on the way to school we just uh it just so happened that we saw a lot of buses and i usually dont have all my children in the bus in the car at once but id taken them all to the chiropractor this morning one big fell swoop and then we were going on to school but just a tad late long enough for the buses to be going back and   you uh   the kids said gosh look how many of these bus drivers are women and i said you know that really is a good indication of some of the jobs that have been   uhhuh   you know that trend that has swung you know one profession that you know there are a lot of women now and i think its good because   umhum umhum   those women sometimes pick up on those kids emotional needs and might you know be aware of those things coming or going from school where maybe the men dont always you know theyre just there to drive the bus you know and the women are more     well i saw uh the the superintendent that weve had was being considered for the superintendent in the Boston area   uhhuh   and they just she just lost out to someone from the Dallas area like assistants somebody whos an one of the assistants in your im not sure what the name maybe it was another woman   uhhuh uhhuh   so   must have been from uh DIS   maybe so yeah maybe so   but i definitely think think that administratively in the schools women are are a show of force now that we did not see even five years ago certainly not you know ten years ago up to that point they were allowed to be teachers secretaries nurses so forth even your uh heads of uh you know like your food services that kind of thing   uhhuh   your your deans you know they werent women um you know thats   lots of school principals seem to be women in the at least in the Houston area   yes   ive noticed over over the years that my kids were in school   uhhuh uhhuh more and more   fact i dont even remember any uh school that they went to that there there wasnt a women principal from elementary school on up   on   uhhuh   oh thats excellent excellent you know that theyre getting a chance   so yeah but but then again you know it would be nice to have more you know the majority of teachers seem to be women it would be nice to have but the problem is the pay scale probably its because you know women go into teaching probably not so much for the money but uh for the satisfaction and thats just what they want to want to do whereas uh i think if youre a college professor   the type of uh   probably the pay is much better and you tend to see more i think you see more   uhhuh   well i dont know it seems like there there are a lot of a lot more men at least in the the college level so   well and that comes once again you know is that you can teach in elementary school you can even substitute in elementary school in the state of Texas without a uh without a certificate   you can teach   yes you can substitute teach without a certificate or a degree   substitute right   and then you know work on that and if you want to work on up but you still can make good money you know   uh   parttime parttime money as a substitute whereas you know to teach on college level you have to have a PhD almost always sometimes you can get by on a fellowship program or something where you might be teaching but   uhhuh do you do you have any idea how much uh uh a substitute teacher would make per day im sure they pay them by the day   uhhuh here in Plano they pay about fifty dollars a day   well i mean thats good parttime money   thats good parttime money for but its not career money   yeah but its not no   you know but it uh   course it you know   you know for a parttime situation   just somebody   and once youve gotten your foot in the door for several years substituting and then take on a degree you know youre pretty well assured of a of a job in the system eventually that you know that youve been subbing in a lot of times you know i think thats uh i think uh one thing that uh that were seeing you know a trend in uh politics is that our cities are taking a lot more responsibility for uh citizens becoming involved in the environment uh   yes its true   recycling uh clean up programs refurbishing you know historical and and uh park land   uhhuh   um your uh city you know where they they adopt a highway kinds of things those are becoming more and more   uhhuh   government uh originated and not just private enterprise   uhhuh   you know generated   which i think is something that has to happen in order to   to make people do it probably   to make it happen right   which you know i thought Texas would be the last place to ever um get people to do those things voluntarily and i think their dont mess with Texas campaign has been very effective because Texans dont like to be told what to do theyre very proud of their state so theyve psychologically theyve done a number on us there   well a couple weeks ago i was at the Houston International Festival which is you know in the downtown area and     uhhuh uhhuh   uh the friend a friend of mine that was with me uh commented on on how clean uh you know when you have an event like that of course everybody you know theres just food and everything else and of course they have the the you know the places to throw the stuff but you really they were really use they really use it   uhhuh   because in the past you know it seemed like i can remember people just just throw it down they dont care but youre youre finally getting to the point where its just kind of second nature to find some place to to throw it   umhum umhum   uh  can you remember driving down the highway i could as a kid you know you just get rid of it you roll the window down and you throw it out but you wouldnt   well my mother was always real picky about that kind of thing i think id probably have my fingers cut off if id ever thrown out a candy wrapper or anything but   well youre probably younger than i am because i you know um but i can remember uh probably probably uh in the early seventies uh going out on you know taking our boat out and stuff like that and looking for places for trash bins and stuff and that was very new at that time you know   uhhuh umhum that that   so its uh yeah it really hasnt been that long i mean its probably twenty years or so that you know it really began   yes yes   so yeah   i agree for it to and to be adopted and funded   uhhuh   you know by cities and you think the incredible amount of you know money that we vote for our cities to spend on these kinds of things so you know its definitely uh you know you have to consider that a political trend because were the ones voting for those people       you know to that are in favor of those kinds of programs and make them you know campaign issues   thats true   so   how about the representation that you have on the city council is it uh you know were were i think were to vote going to have increased the number so that we will be able to represent uh like the Mexican Americans dont feel like theyve had enough representation and stuff like that   uhhuh well of course Dallas is in a great upheaval right now over the fourteen one and ten four one you know programs and its you know going back and forth between courts to you know   what is that im   um   have to be plead ignorant here   the um
