                                 Headline                        You raise an interesting point If we consider the rightwing politiciansand media people on your list as actually believing their professed ideologywhich Im not sure they all do I think yes orthodoxers of one sort or anotherare often fighting the return of the repressed astopmebeforeIdivorceagain kind of a thing Theyre like gaybashers who arein flight from their own homosexual impulses Except in the case of the peopleyou mention they do get divorced all they want to Thats what getsmethey permit themselves a freedom they seek to deny to others Instead ofbeing made more understanding by their own frailties and failures they justforgive themselves and condemn others            In any case I dont think marriage works as a preserver of relationshipsAt least not for longjust a few weeks in the case of John Podhoretz Whatwas the story there I wonder Having children often does make people try hardto make their relationships work but I dont think marriage in and of itselfdoes that although I know that is an argument often advanced in its favorPeople just get mean and depressed and drag about sullenly hoping their spousewill be swept away by El Nino Or become obsessed with work Or havewhippedcream nights out when the cats away Or all of the above            About NOWYes I have disagreed with their policies publicly on manyoccasions Not just about Paula Jones where I dont think their actualposition is as bad as its been made to look in the media but also theirenthusiasm for electoral politics the Democratic Party and Clinton            I have to say though that I dont blame them for not signing on to PaulaJones appeal The whole thing has become such a circusand Jones and herpeople are no friends of women either Look what theyve done to MonicaLewinsky The real victim in all this if you ask me            CheersKatha
