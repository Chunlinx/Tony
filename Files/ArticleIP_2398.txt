                                 Blood Simple            The Negro problem wroteNorman Podhoretz in  would not be solved unless color itself disappearedand that means not integration it means assimilation it meanslet thebrutal word come outmiscegenation Coming after a lengthy confession of histortured feelings toward blacksand coming at a time when  states still hadantimiscegenation statutes on the booksPodhoretzs call for a wholesalemerging of the two races seemed not just bold but desperate Politics hadfailed us he was conceding now we could find hope only in the unlikelyprospect of intermarriage            Podhoretzs famous essaywas regarded as bizarre at the time but  years later it seems likeprophecy We are indeed intermarrying today in unprecedented numbers Between and  the number of mixedrace marriages quadrupled Blackwhiteunions now represent  percent of all marriages involving at least one blackup from  percent in  Twelve percent of Asian men and  percent ofAsian women are marrying nonAsians Fully a quarter of married USbornLatinos in Los Angeles have nonLatino spouses We are mixing our genes withsuch abandon that the Census Bureau is now considering whether to add a newmultiracial category to the census in the year  This orgy ofmiscegenation has not yet brought the racial harmony for which Podhoretzlonged But recent publicity about the intermarriage figures has stirred hopeonce again that our racial problems might be dissolving in the gene pool            TheCensus Bureaus multiracial proposal has provoked strong reactions fromcivilrights activists who fear that many African Americans will defect to thenew category thus diluting black political power But the debate properlyframed is not just about light flight from the black community The debateis about our very conception of race For a multiracial box would be anadmission that the five points of our modernday ethnoracial pentagonblack white Asian Hispanic Native American are not fixed or divinelyordained but fickle and all too manmade            Race you see is a fiction As a matter of biology it hasno basis Genetic variations within any race far exceed the variations betweenthe races and the genetic similarities among the races swamp both The powerof race however derives not from its pseudoscientific markings but from itscultural trappings It is as an ideology that race matters indeedmatters so much that the biologists protestations fall away like Copernicanclaims in the age of Ptolemy So the question as always is whether it ispossible to break that awful circle in which myth and morphology perpetuallyreinforce one another            Theleaders of the fledgling multiracial movement say that their category and morebroadly their lives represent the way out By marrying across the color lineby raising mixedrace children without regard to labels they promise toobliterate our antiquated notions of racial difference As a newlywed who hasrecently joined their ranks I hope theyre right When the time comes I wontwant to infect my ChineseScotchIrishJewish children with bloodline fever Iwont force them to choose among illfitting racial uniforms That saidthough there are plenty of reasons to wonder whether intermarriage can everas one partisan put it blow the lid off of race            Foremost is this reality Racialism is highly adaptiveThat is no matter how quickly demographic change proceeds we seem to find away to reinvent and sustain our jerryrigged pigmentocracy A case in point isthe term Hispanic Ever since this category was added to the census in weve been told that Hispanic is merely a linguistic category that Hispanicscan be of any race Today amid a boom in the Hispanic population we hearthat caveat the same way smokers read the surgeon generals warning The storyof the last  years is the way heterogenous Hispanicswho ought to haveexposed the flimsiness of racial categoriesbecame just another homogenousrace The square peg by our thinking had been rounded off            Willthis happen to multiracials Their numbers are still small Despite thequadrupling of multiracial marriages since  only  million people todayqualifyand thats counting racially distinct parents as well as theirmixedrace kids This may not be enough of a critical mass for multiracials tobecome a race of their own Moreover multiracials have less reason to coherethan Hispanics ever had they include every conceivable combination of racesand they are not bound together by language Still in a nation accustomed tothinking of official races theyll feel pressure to form an interest groupmulticulturalisms latest aggrieved tribe            One possibility is that all multiracials over time willfind themselves the intermediate race a new middleman minority lessstigmatized than pure blacks however defined but less acceptable thanpure whites Their presence like that of the coloreds in old South Africawouldnt subvert racialism it would reinforce it by fleshing out theblackwhite caste system Again however the sheer diversity of themultiracials might militate against this kind of stratification            Yetthis same diversity makes it possible that multiracials will replicate withintheir ranks the whitemakesright mentality that prevails all around themThus we might expect a hierarchy of multiracials to take hold in which a mixedchild with white blood would be the social better of a mixed child without suchblood In this scenario multiracials wouldnt be a distinct groupthey wouldjust be distributed across a continuum of color            Sociologist Pierre van den Berghe argues that such acontinuum is preferable to a simple blackwhite dichotomy Brazilians forinstance with their mestizo consciousness and their many gradations oftipo  or type behold with disdain our crude bifurcation of race Yetno amount of baloneyslicing changes the fact that in Brazil whitening remainsthe ideal It is still better for a woman to be a branca light skinhair without tight curls thin lips narrow nose than a morena tanskin wavy hair thicker lips broader nose and better to be a morenathan a mulata darker skin tightly curled hair Subverting raciallabels is not the same as subverting racism            Stillanother possibility is that whites will do to multiracials what the Democratsor Republicans have traditionally done to thirdparty movements absorb theirmost desirable elements and leave the rest on the fringe Its quitepossible as Harvard Professor Mary Waters suggests that the ranks of thewhite will simply expand to engulf the lighter or more culturally white ofthe multiracials The Asian American experience may offer a precedent Asgrowing numbers of Asian Americans have entered the mainstream over the lastdecade it is increasingly saidsometimes with pride sometimes withscornthat they are becoming white            We could thus end up with three reconfigured races In theblack box blackblack offspring In the mixed box blackLatinoblackAsian blackwhite and LatinoAsian kids In the white boxwhitewhite whiteAsian and perhaps whiteLatino issue Absurd One need onlyrecall the baroque lexicon of quadroons and octoroons to know the absurduses to which our powers of taxonomy can be put            These cautionary scenariosdemonstrate that our problem is not just race in the abstract Our problem isthe idea of the white race in particular Scholar Douglas Besharov may beright when he calls multiracial kids the best hope for the future of Americanrace relations But even as a multiracial category blurs the color line itcan reaffirm the primacy of whiteness Whether our focus is interracialadoption or mixed marriages or classclimbing so long as we speak of whitenessas a norm no amount of census reshuffling will truly matter            We return then to thequestion of politics Perhaps we should abolish all racial classificationsPerhaps we should supplement the fiverace scheme with a NoneoftheAbovecategory Perhaps we should replace affirmative action with a classbasedalternative Perhaps we need a leader of mixed heritagesay Colin Powelltoeducate the public about the realities of race Whatever it takes though weneed to do more than marry one another if we are ever to rid our minds ofcolorconsciousness The way of politics Podhoretz lamented a generationago is slow and bitter Indeed But it is the only lasting way Our ideologyof blood like blood itself is too fluid too changeable and too easilydiverted to be remade by lovers alone
