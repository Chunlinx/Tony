        we could talk about my favorite subject     cooking and foods huh what do you like to cook   food uh i dont cook a lot actually ive just started baking so im kind of interested in cakes and muffins and stuff like that but i cant seem to get them exactly right so just trying to perfect some things i dont know i tried to make an apple sauce cake which i will never ever try to make again   umhum     it was horrible i dont know if the cake was horrible or if i made it horrible   oh dear oh probably not i have uh a bread recipe thats real easy that everyone always really does like that uh doesnt require kneading the dough   hum oh hey   and its oh it is its wonderful its and whats funny is that you use uh bran All Bran and it looks like its a wheat bread  but its actually All Bran and flour and uh   umhum hum umhum   you know its regular types that you know you use and that sort of thing and you let it rise and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and you can punch it down and then uh make your rolls and they really are good and theyre so easy to do   umhum wow umhum   that it seems like every time that we have a dinner party or that uh were going some place where everybodys supposed to bring something and theyve had my rolls before they always ask me to bring those rolls   umhum they request it i havent gotten any requests yet actually we i had a Christmas party at uh my office and i made the tuna fish sandwiches and everyone i mean im i think everyone knows how to make tuna fish so thatd be easy for me to make and i cant go wrong with it and so i made it and i used celery seed in my do you use celery seed in your tuna fish   no i havent   uh and i i just thought it was so strange because ive never i thought that thats what celery seed was for was for tuna fish   oh how funny   and so but everyone really really loved the tuna fish and they just couldnt get over the fact that i used celery in it and it just surprised me celery and and onion and   uhhuh well see i ive always used celery i mean ive used celery before but ive never used the celery seed in it   umhum oh yeah its great uh just like um really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed   well what else do you put in it besides the celery seed   and i used like uh Miracle Whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise because i really dont like mayonnaise the Helmans mayonnaise   umhum   but if you use a salad dressing which is kind of uh you know kind of a i guess a tart taste then it comes out really good but i was uh it was the first time ive   umhum   ive ever found out that that nobody else used celery seed i feel so silly but   well see ive never put bell pepper in tuna fish either   yeah i   isnt that funny   yeah thats weird   i was brought up with tuna fish it was made where you put in uh oh chopped hard boiled eggs which it now is a no no with cholesterol   umhum right uhhuh oh   and uh you know chopped up uh dill pickles and that sort of thing the standard old tuna fish   right yeah yeah i would i would put that too i just didnt have those things like i dont think i had eggs that night or something but i would have put eggs i would have put in eggs in there also   umhum but isnt that interesting so you you use bell pepper and onion and celery seed ill have to try that   but thats strange and celery seed do you use a regular mayonnaise or   sometimes i do sometimes i use Miracle Whip it depends on what i have  and sometimes if im using like regular mayonnaise to spice it up a little bit ill use a little bit of mustard with it   the salad the Miracle Whip yeah umhum yeah i do that also umhum just to put a little zing in it or something   umhum yeah but not a bunch but enough to make it have a little bit more flavor   oh no what what else do i like i love barbecue anything barbecue ill eat      umhum i like uh barbecue baby back ribs   um um   and uh and and theyre so easy to do if you uh have a good barbecue sauce and you just cook them very very slowly in the oven and its not hard to cook like some meals are   umhum umhum yeah hum   and its not of course its messy to eat thats the disadvantage and uh i make lasagna from scratch and people really like my lasagna and   yeah yeah i like to make that too i make that once in a while   and so um sometimes im requested to make that   hum   or and thats and thats not too hard to do because you can do it in advanced and just bake it   its not really as long as you have all the ingredients its just the layering really and and not breaking the uh the the uh pasta is the hardest part probably   umhum yeah umhum then i have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie it just takes forever but its uh when the strawberries are nice and big and fresh and yummy   but um yeah um do you make a cheese cake     um umhum i do but this one is basically its like a normal pie crust but then you use this sort of uh its a cream cheese um   hum umhum   uh layering but you use thin it out a little bit uh or make it a little fluffier and you put uh line the whole pie crust with that   um umhum   and so its sort of like in a way uh using cheese cake and you know but but its not a real cheese cake and then you   um yeah and you just put the strawberries
