        okay do you vote regular     yeah i do i try and vote in every single election   every one   but uh  thats just since in the past say about six years before that i really didnt pay any attention at all   well see thats me ive never paid any attention to voting   oh you havent   humum   yeah i didnt use to but now i really because i get so angry about what goes on and then i feel like i cant really complain too much unless   unless you have something to do with it  right   yeah but the problem is that i am very liberal politically and so i hardly ever have anybody that wins that i vote for   oh liberal by what do you mean by liberal um   liberal politically im you know like pretty left wing Democrat Democrat so   well see i dont know anything about politics   oh you dont   uh whats the main whats the main difference between Republicans and Democrats   okay well  theres a lot of them um depends on what issue youre talking about but Democrats are on a lot of issues are more liberal than Republicans and well it used to be its kind of hard to say now especially after Desert Storm but um i think back in the eighties times when uh my political opinions were being formed like in Vietnam during the Vietnam war and stuff   uhhuh   the Republicans were more you know what they called Hawks which is more like aggressive in war and more prowar and proaggression and um   uhhuh   the Democrats were the doves they were more for peace and im not sure how much that holds true anymore i think you know the issues are   okay and you vote for the Democrats or   yeah yeah and Democrats usually are supportive more supportive of public assistance programs and and programs to   usually okay uhhuh   um the the big Republican thing is that they dont they vote for less government they want less government involvement in society and so theyre more less apt to vote in you know more aid to people or more   uhhuh   more uh theyre less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things   huh   so so have you ever voted at all   okay no i never have   you havent   humum   how old are you   im twenty six     oh gosh   i know i should i   well   well i dont know much that much about it i dont keep up on it and i dont feel like i have   uhhuh uhhuh   have enough knowledge on it to even you know to pick the right person   yep yeah well   so thats what they need well   uhhuh   it uh they said something to improve voting   uhhuh   if they could make it more oh easier to find out you know whats going on do you know what i mean   yeah yeah   like uh like to me i dont i didnt know what would have been wrong with i cant even remember who ran for president against Bush i think it was uh that woman wasnt it a woman   Dukakis no it was Dukakis   Dukakis   from Massachusetts   okay didnt he have a woman or wasnt or was that Reagan there was a woman that was running for vice president for a while Ferraro   oh yeah that was yeah Ferraro that was a while ago that was a couple elections ago yeah   okay   yeah  thats okay     well well thats what i mean like i didnt know what the difference between Dukakis and Bush was     umhum   you know i didnt know anything about Bush or Dukakis   so what do you think about uh what do you think about what you see on TV about them like in the news or on the ads do you kind of just   okay i dont remember anything about Dukakis   you dont   but well theyre all saying that theyre going to do you know whatever is best for their campaign anyway   uhhuh uhhuh   thats what i mean if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and i dont know like you know in school they didnt teach you about Democrats uh the government not really   umhum right you didnt get any government classes   humum   yeah its really hard too because before they used to have um a lot of it seems like the stuff that they put out now it i mean i doesnt just seem like it i know for a fact that the any kind of stuff that if you wrote and asked for material well what do you believe in what do you believe in they dont take any stands on anything they kind of say well what do you want me to believe   yeah   or they word it so that its really hard to tell where theyre standing on certain issues   well im not sure theyre yeah i know how they do it it like it with the abortion issues and stuff   umhum umhum yeah they have to kind of take a stand on some things like abortion and   uhhuh   things like that so thats kind of how i judge theres a few things where they have to say yes or no like abortion or gun control or let me see i try to look at   right   what  if some of the newspaper articles or the i dont trust TV as much but newspaper articles can show whether how they voted in the past   right   and but you get you know it all depends again on whose writing it and who theyre for because they can slant that too   right and like i said most of the politicians the politicians im the also the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway   umhum yeah yeah   and everybodys got you know stuff they dont want known   right  everybodys got a secret   well anyway im sorry i didnt i didnt have         so   much knowledge i dont even remember this being on there   well thats okay do you think do you think um i mean what would it take like that this is really good actually that for to talk to somebody who hasnt voted i mean what kind of how would it how what kind of stuff would they would you like them to do so that that you would know more about it like send stuff in the mail or have it at the library or   incentive you i guess that would be good now im sure theyve got it at the library   umhum   you know   umhum   i mean if i get to the library ive got two babies so i dont   oh do you yeah thatll tie you down a little bit   yeah but i i dont know   or do you just not do you feel like its not really going to make that much difference if you dont vote or   oh i know if enough people think like that it you know would make a difference if people stopped thinking like that   yeah yeah   um well a lot of people theyll vote the way their family votes you know if since youre what Democrat   uhhuh umhum yeah   then then like your kids or whatever will follow you and just vote Democrat right   umhum well  not in my family were kind of  really independent   i mean no all split   but a lot of families do that i know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote   right   and that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved  golly   i lie hm   but well   i dont know if i did understand politics i probably would vote more but like i said if i voted  for Bush or like when uh Gary   umhum Hart   Hart was running   uhhuh   a lot of women would have voted for him just because he was nicer looking not that i think he was good looking but   yeah   he was young   yeah   and then i didnt think that was right because he may have been a good president or whatever   umhum   but because it was he had an affair   yeah   and it just threw him out of the whole running   yeah yeah   and a lot of people go by their uh personal life when they vote   umhum yeah   and which i guess if you got turmoil in your personal life youre going to let it come into work but   umhum   im sure theres a lot of people that have had   i think everybody does it just depends on how well you can hide it   yeah   you know and i thats very true i i think that doesnt really have that much to do with um unless theyve done something really horrible you know or something real abnormal   well criminal or something like thats different but   yeah right but otherwise   if him and his wife werent getting along i mean   umhum   what is what effect does that have on him running for president do you know what i mean   yeah yeah   its all so secretive see we really dont see the   thats right   true person anyway   i think thats thats having a big effect on how poorly that the countrys being run is that um the the election the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that  you know that really dont have anything to do with how well they do the job but see theyre trying to find an excuse not to deal with what   right   you know the issues that people really want to know about because on those issues you have to say yes or no and if they dont say yes or no then maybe somebodyll vote for them that wouldnt have if they had come down on the wrong side do you know what im saying so they just try and make it a personal thing i mean if you remember   right   any of the TV commercials from the last presidential campaign they all had uh pictures of Bush with his grandchildren walking around with his grandchildren and even from Reagan it was all just like looks like a McDonalds commercial you know   uhhuh  well what did you think of Reagan as a president   thats about what it looked like i just thought he was really inept i dont think he did anything at all he they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet and the people that were   do you think he won from Carter  because of the um the hostages that were held at that time   well i think that was part of it i think theres a lot of the the economic problems that the country was having at the time and the the recession and stuff people just had a picture of Carter as not being real capable   umhum   but he actually all right this i thought he was great   i thought Carter was good too and that was yeah   did you i always liked him i thought he was great at the time and i i just couldnt get over the fact that Reagan beat him i you know that i just couldnt believe that he got voted out   but i think i wasnt well lets see thats been about ten years ago right   umhum yeah   okay so i was only fifteen or sixteen but i remember Carter and i liked him yeah   yeah you did have you heard stuff about him lately do you know what hes doing   no i sure dont   well he is just he is really active still politically hes been overseas you remember when he was in office he did a lot of stuff for the Middle East for people
