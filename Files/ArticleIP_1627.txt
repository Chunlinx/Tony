Times  two Americanphysicists reported that polarized light moves through space according to apredictable but previously undetected corkscrew pattern This means theyinferred that light flows through the universe in one direction along anidentifiable axis of orientation Which end we want to call up is up to usDr John Ralston of the University of Kansas and DrBorge Nodland of the University of Rochester made this discovery byanalyzing radio waves from  faraway galaxies Critics are combing throughthe data for errors The findings could have more than just topographicalimplications Questions

contributions to the theory of consciousnesshas turned his attention to toilet paper A year ago the wife of the Oxforddon noticed that the pattern on Kleenex quilted tissue uncannily resembled thePenrose Arrowed Rhombi tilings pattern which Sir Roger had inventedandcopyrightedin  Penrose licensed the pattern to Pentaplex Ltd whichmanufactures puzzles and games and now both parties are suing KimberlyClarkthe original makers of Kleenex for copyright infringement The plaintiffsclaim Penroses design is distinguished by its aperiodicity the pattern almostbut never quite repeats itself and its fivefold symmetry a trait that at thetime was thought not to exist in nature but has since been identified incertain crystal formations As the London                Independent put itThis nonrepeating aperiodic pattern was no trivial solution to relieving theboredom of tiling the bathroom floor nor some mathematical doodle It was amindboggling preconceptionshattering illustration of fivefold
