                                 Hits and Misses                        Dear Jack            Im glad you picked up on the alternative newspaper question for tworeasons One it spotlights the frustrating limits of Rosens definitions ofjournalism and journalists There is nary a mention in this thick book of anyof the leading alternative weeklies which are often stuffed with materialthat one might expect to intrigue Rosen Theres also little mention ofnational magazines whether specialized political ones or big generalinterestones Theres almost no attention paid to radio where hundreds of of excellentAmerican journalists work and only at the end does Rosen acknowledge thedevelopment of the Internet as a news medium Even television doesnt get muchplay here at least not compared with the audience it garners in real life Inother words For someone with as sweeping and academicseeming a criticism asRosens hes done a poor job of defining the terms of what journalists dowhere they work and how they operate            Two as you indicate alternative newspapers have been thriving many fordecades by providing readers with exactly the kind of service Rosen says hewants reporting with perspective reader inclusion making stories intocrusades etc Their success in doing so is of course debatable but it makesyou wonder Has Rosen simply never read those papers Or is he avoiding usingthem as models My guess is the latter Ill bet its a prestige problem Thefolks at Pew Charitable Trust and the other purse strings of public journalismwould scream We didnt cough up several million dollars so you could tell themedia to behave like the goddamned Village Voice             That said I think youre being awfully sanguine about the state of Americanmedia I find most American newspapers to be quite bad to argue that theymight once have been worse is neither reassuring nor really the point Mosttelevision journalism is horrendous and some is actually harmful bymisinforming viewers about crime for example Either you want that situationto change or you dont but denying it seems silly            Youre also arguing against straw men of your own creation A journalistdoes not need to have a lunchpail and straphanger audience in order to beout of touch Pick up a copy of the Miami Herald or for that matterthe San Francisco Chronicle  and tell me with a straight face thatthose papers are doing the best job they can to reflect and report life inthose cities Remind me which primetime network news show it is that dealswith immigration public education workplace discrimination and how to solvehealth and childcare problems Seems to me that whenever I tune in I am askedto contemplate The Miracle of Sextuplets            As for presidential politics we agree that poor coverage is not exclusivelythe medias fault or even principally its fault But it also seems a copoutto say that if the candidates dont disagree then theres no way to cover theissues I dont think that some of the experiments in this book are all thatbad for that kind of coverage That is start with local issues in myneighborhood they include AIDS homelessness housing prices and the need fora Second Avenue subway Then look to what candidates can offer skeptically ofcourse since the real story may be that these problems elude solutions on thepresidential level If they dont disagree one iota then maybe theres apolitical problem but I dont think there would be a problem producing good orinteresting journalism I suspect by the way that the better New York paperswill do something like this as the primary approaches though they wont callit public journalism
