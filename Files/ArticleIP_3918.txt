Malcolm Brownes dispatch The Times says the discovery wasannounced by  physicists at a neutrino conference Hooboy bet thebartenders and hookers go on vacation during that one            Science reporting in theUnited States is hampered by the deepseated conviction that the press knowseven better than the people that its just a bunch of pinheads nattering aboutnothing Well these little nothings called neutrinos have a lot to say ifonly we could find a press willing to pass on the message I applaud the NewYork Times for trying to convey some of that excitement and say woe to youfor dipping to such cynicism Uncharacteristic I might add            Oh andby the way scientists get lots of sex                           Rob Pike BellLabs                           OrganMusic                        I have several problems withRichard Epsteins June  comments on organ peddling Dialogue             Epstein writes Betterthat we have  people alive with one kidney each than  people alive withtwo kidneys I mention that point to my medical students  presumablyhealthy young people every year in an effort to get them to agree to autilitarian plan making it mandatory to remove one kidney from each of them tobe made available for donation Every year they reject this plan Somethingabout personal autonomy being more important than utilitarian calculus incertain situations It just may be they are rightthat utilitarian math maynot be the highest virtue when dealing with organ procurement one murder couldnet two kidneys as we are likely to find out from the Chinese prisonersituationshould we trade one life for two             Epstein writes Look itup on the Web  If it is possible to do this kind of research with standardillnesses it should be possible to do it with organ transplants The pointbeing that access to good information fosters legal markets The Web exampleproves just the opposite Much of the information people get about illness onthe Web is incomplete imprecise or just plain wrong There is absolutely noguarantee that good information will create legitimate markets for organ salesThe likelihood is the oppositethat bad misleading coercive informationwill be disseminated to entice people to sell their organs and ignore the veryreal risks that people incur when they give up their organs Donating organscan bring consequences to the donor far more momentous than buying a fake Rolexon Fifth Avenue             Howwould such markets ever be regulated No regulation Without some screeningwho will the brokers and middlemen be not only will donors suffer seeabove but some recipients will receive unsuitable organs While Epstein canargue that this happens currently consider what wholesale expansion of anunregulated market would bring in terms of the number of complications Infact there are reports that in some countries where organs may be sold and theprocess is not monitored closely the numbers and types of infections inrecipients are much worse             CM FranklinMD                                       Microsoft ber Alles                         In Monopoly ShoppingSteven E Landsburg sings a paean to the vertically integrated monopoly Heargues mainly that including the Internet Explorer browser as a free part ofthe Windows  operating system will ultimately benefit the consumer since arival browser would be sold as a separate profit center            I happen to agree that onepredominant browser architecture would ultimately benefit the consumer but fora different reasonit would create a market standard for developers andconsumers to focus their investments I expect Microsoft to prevail despiteNetscapes better technology and implementation and despite the governmentswellintentioned efforts to intervene I would certainly hope however thatresources would continue to be dedicated to innovation in this arena until thetechnologies had matured to the point where they were clearly superior andworthy of becoming a standard            Its odd to read this wholeeconomic argument in light of Netscapes pledge to distribute Navigator andits source code for free in perpetuity But even if Navigator were to be soldat some point the ultimate cost to the consumer would come not from the costof the browser itself but from the ramifications of Microsofts control of theemerging desktop software interface to the internet The focus in the browserwars and legal wranglings has already begun to move away from browser choiceand toward the more important issues of gateways and the branded services theyfeature            Theconfiguration of computers when sold will determine to a large degree whichservices a consumer encounters Note how the cable companies have profited fromcontrol of the channels that they carry some of which they own fully or inpart Note also how the Baby Bells have profited from charging for advertisingin their Yellow Pages Consider then the value of a gateway when it containsnot just a few dozen TV channels or local business listings but the emergingbroadband multimedia marketplace only a few years away Do we want to allowMicrosoft to parlay its control of the desktop architecture into control of thecontent that appears on the desktop             Mark Safire                                       How AboutWindows                         In his article Monopoly ShoppingSteven Landsburg notes that Windows  costs about  and suggests what wouldhappen to Microsoft if it tried to raise the price            A better topic to examine iswhy the price of Windows  hasnt come down in three years on the market            Myunderstanding of the economies of scale suggests the Windows iterations beingproduced today should be costing less to produce than the first ones thatentered the pipeline Prices of Intel processors laser printers fax machinesetc all drop as the learningproduction curve results in lower costs Why notWindows  Could the lack of competition have anything to do

isa sharpwitted visually layered gorgeouslydesigned meticulously directed piece of formula pablumif I hadnt beenbludgeoned by preemptive raves in Esquire  Time Entertainment Weekly  and the New York

surrounding TheTruman Show in the first paragraph no less and concludes that while itis a good film it has been lauded excessively by critics Maslin gives noindication she thinks the film is a masterwork of any kind             Dan Flynn                                       David Edelsteinreponds Its too bad that Slate doesnt pass along letters critical ofits contributors before posting them I share the general disdain for lengthytitfortat replies but when facts are at issue its only fair to give a guya chance to set the record straight Dan Flynn suggests that I misread JanetMaslins review of The Truman Show in the New York Times  whichindeed begins in much the same vein as mine In fact her review and mine werepublished the same day so I didnt read hers The preemptive rave to whichI referred was by columnist Frank Rich it came more than a week before thefilm opened I saw no reason to name Rich whose work I respect but hiscolumnalong with those of critics in Esquire  EntertainmentWeekly  and Time sure fit the description in my review                                       DontKnock the Rock                        In God He  Brent Staples review of Titan The Life of John D Rockefeller Srperpetuates a few misconceptions about Standard Oils business practices            For example he repeats themyth that Standard pursued a predatory pricing strategy though that wasindeed among the charges brought against Standard by the US governmentThough Standard did indeed buy out many of its early competitors that was duechiefly to their tremendously inefficient processesStandard ended upmothballing most of the refineries it bought while expanding output from itsown efficient facilities Furthermore if Standard did pursue a predatorypricing strategy it sure didnt work Standard faced constant competition bothin America and abroad throughout its corporate existence causing the price ofoil to slope ever downward            Second Staples claims thatthe trust system disallowed genuine competition Far from it As Chernowhimself puts it With additional oil strikes in California Indian Territorylater Oklahoma Kansas and Illinois in the early s the industry becametoo vast and farflung for even Standard Oil to control It might not be toomuch of an exaggeration to say that the antitrust cases brought against thetrust in the early s were not just belated but were fast becomingsuperfluous In other words the marketplace was already bringing Standard toits knees and Rockefeller did indeed end up eclipsed by otherswithoutgovernment intervention            The reasonmonopolies are bad is that in theory they lead to high prices and lessproduct Staples points out though that Standard Oil provided a product whichwas consistently goodand cheaper to boot In other words it acted exactlyas a theoretical monopoly should not While Standards practices may have ledto in Chernows words misery all around for producers the low prices andimproved product they brought to the refining industry meant nothing but goodnews for consumers             AnandaGupta Research assistant Competitive Enterprise Institute                           Address your email
