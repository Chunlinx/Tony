                    Background        Genomics sequencing projects have rapidly generated        tremendous amount of information At the time of writing        the NCBI UniGene database           httpwwwncbinlmnihgovUniGenecontained  Homo        sapiens clusters and  Mus musculus clusters        Predictions from the Human Genome Project    and Celera        Genomics    suggest there are about  human        genes Other recent studies suggest that these numbers may        be an underestimation and that the human genome appears        more complicated     Understanding the functions of        such a large number of genes has been an unprecedented        challenge for functional genomics research As the array of        hope in recent years gene expression array technology has        quickly grown into a powerful tool to chart a gene atlas in        various biological sources and under various conditions in        a massively parallel manner       Facing the        challenge of annotating such a huge amount of genomic data        increasing array information density and improving analysis        algorithms have become two critical research areas to        ensure that gene expression profiling proceeds in an        efficient and cost effective manner        Take an Affymetrix highdensity oligonucleotide GeneChip        httpwwwaffymetrixcomfor example Firstly its human        U series chip consists of  chip types with  coding        clusters each which makes it expensive to profile all the        human genes in samples of interest Can a gene chip take        more genes Comparing its U chip and Human  chip        Affymetrix has already increased chip information density        by  by reducing the number of probe pairs per gene from         to  Since demand for higher information density has        still not been met it is of interest to study the probe        number effect in detail Secondly most optional research        efforts focus on the downstream statistical and clustering        analysis However on the upstream side Affymetrix chip        users are still dependent on the Microarray Suite software        that comes with the measurement system to interpret raw        data The Affymetrix algorithm implemented in its        Microarray Suite  package referred hereafter as MAS        uses empirical rules derived from its internal research        data to assign absolute calls for the significance of gene        presence and assign fold change calls for the significance        of expression variations Such discrete categorizations are        not the most appropriate language to describe quantities of        continuous nature Although it is well known that fold        change numbers have defined behaviors of uncertainty there        are very few studies in this area How does one assign        statistical significance to expression analysis results        This work presents our preliminary research results for the        two questions raised above        The Affymetrix gene chip layout used in this study        contains the same number of perfect match PM probes and        mismatch MM probes MAS uses differences between these        two types of probes for gene expression signals The        primary goal of MatchOnly Integral Distribution MOID        algorithm is to discard mismatch information which allows        immediate doubling of the chip information density In this        study the performance of both algorithms were benchmarked        using  known fold change values derived from  spiking        experiments Their false positive tendencies were assessed        by nochange expression experiments Computer simulations        were used to study their noise tolerances and to determine        the minimum number of probes required for chip        analysis        The idea of using PMonly information is based on the        following observations MAS essentially discards the        oneone correspondence between a PM and its MM partner for        details see materials and methods on MAS algorithm for        absolute analysis and still gives satisfactory        interpretation which suggests the contribution of MM        probes might be approximated in a nonspecific manner        overall After we designed the first mismatchfree gene        chip GNFHS in July  the matchonly expression        analysis idea was proposed in other independent studies as        well Li submitted  adjusted their previous        modelbased analysis of oligonucleotide arrays    to        PMonly calculations and found their results correlate well        with that of using PM and MM information In addition the        idea is endorsed by recent studies of Naef         et al    and Irizarry         et al  in prepare        httpbiosunbiostatjhspheduririzarrpapers        One difficulty in comparing algorithms for gene        expression analysis is the lack of known results Here we        overcome the problem by resorting to a spiking set and set        of nochange experiments where results are unambiguous        Modelbased methods    generally require a reasonable        numbers of training experiments of the same chip type        among which probes under study give significantly large        signals in at least some experiments Considering the fact        that the  spiking experiments used were obtained by three        different chip types and in addition some experiments are        replicates under different concentrations and hybridization        conditions it is impractical to sufficiently train        modelbased algorithms in this study We limit our study to        MOID and MAS where training is not required        In the materials and methods section we summarize        Affymetrix chip technologies and describe the MOID        algorithms in detail MAS algorithms for both absolute        expression analysis and comparison analysis are included        afterwards The benchmarks used for algorithm comparison        were explained and comparison results were shown in the        results session Issues such as noisetolerance of both        algorithms and further reduction of the probe set size are        also included We discuss generalization of the        normalization algorithm which may be of interest to other        researchers Finally the main differences between MAS and        MOID are summarized in a tabular form as conclusions                    Results and Discussion                  Spiking experiments          Spiking experiments were done by adding to tissue          samples a certain number of control genes with known          concentrations Since signal intensity is not exactly          proportional to gene concentration across different probe          sets only the fold change values of each gene between          comparisons are considered reliable and used to benchmark          both algorithms We are fortunate to have access to           spiking experiments done previously in GNF for a          hybridization protocol study where  independent known          fold change numbers were derived These experiments          covered three Affymetrix chip types HukSubA Hu          and MukSubA True experimental fold change values           f           exp  range from  to  The raw          data  CEL files and experimental fold change values          are available from          httpcarriergnforgpublicationsMOID          We applied both algorithms to these array data and the          fold change numbers calculated were compared to known          experimental values Because of the way we defined the          base and experiment           f           exp are always no less than  For          MAS we used all the default parameters used by the          Microarray Suite  program in the calculation For          MOID we found using  percentile for           both pct and           pct                       f            defined in materials and methods gave optimal          performance Figure shows the comparison results data          available from httpcarriergnforgpublicationsMOID          Two algorithms give virtually similar performance          In the comparison we defined relative error           R           err  as the following to benchmark          each algorithm                    R           err             f           calc            f           exp            f           exp            all pairs                     R           err             f           calc             f           exp             f           exp            all pairs           and                    R           err             f           exp            f           calc            f           calc            f           exp            all pairs           Where           f           exp and           f           calc are fold change values from          experiment and calculation respectively           R           err and           R           err are defined symmetrically for          relative errors of           f           exp and            f           exp  reflecting the fact that base          and experiment can be defined arbitrarily and the final           R           err is defined as the average of the          two Each relative error number is an average over all          the  data points          It seems the two algorithms have very close          performance Table  They all have greater error margins          for calculating downregulated fold changes captured by           R           err  than upregulated ones          captured by           R           err  MAS is more asymmetric than          MOID in this aspect                          NoChange experiments          Another set of experiments used for benchmarking          algorithms is the comparison between two experiments          where mRNA prepared from the same tissue sample was          hybridized twice under slightly different conditions          Those fold change numbers that deviate largely from           are considered to be false positives When we applied the          algorithms to ten experiments done with either human          brain or human lung replicate samples same mRNA          slightly different hybridization conditions the results          were all similar Figure shows one of the typical          comparison results When only Present genes defined by          MAS were taken into account  of fold change numbers          were spread across  for MAS and only  for MOID          Clearly MOID assigns much less false positive fold          changes than MAS does in this comparison If all the          genes were counted the spreads of MAS and MOID results          would be  and  for the same data sets This test          suggests MOID is more robust than MAS                          Reduced Probe Set Simulation          In the studies above we demonstrated the feasibility          of a matchonly gene chip design based on the MOID          algorithm In order to further increase chip information          density it is of common interest to understand how many          probes are sufficient for expression analysis and push          for the lower limit of the size of a probe set This is          done via computer simulations          In the simulation for each probe set a subset of           n                       r            probes were randomly chosen to be used in the          calculation Both the spiking and nochange calculations          presented above were repeated with the selected subset          as we gradually reduced           n                       r             Figure and figure show the results for the          spiking calculation and nochange calculation          respectively As the graph suggested accuracy of MOID is          essentially unaffected while reducing the number of          probes down to ten This result enables us to almost          triple the amount of clusters one can put on a gene chip          using MOID design Combined with other new design ideas          MOID lays the foundation for the first universal human          chip that contains  UniGene clusters release           The results have recently been validated and led to many          interesting discoveries which provides indirect support          for MOID to be submitted                          Noise Tolerance of both Algorithms          Computer simulations also enable us to study the          behaviors of both algorithms under noise disturbance In          simulations a subset of           n                       n            probes were randomly chosen their PM values were          multiplied by ten to mimic the effect of serious noise          effect We repeated the calculations for both spiking          experiments and nochange experiments while gradually          increasing           n                       n             Figure and figure show the results for spiking          calculation and nochange calculation respectively As          the graph suggested both MAS and MOID can resist noise          perturbation up to  cells out of  the test favors          MOID slightly                          ProbeSpecific Effect          MOID is based on the assumption that the background          for probes is mainly nonprobespecific The results          indicate that this assumption is sound overall However          it is clear that by better understanding probespecific          behaviors the analysis accuracy can be further improved          For instance probe response factors might be derived by          accumulating and studying many experiments If there are          a sufficient number of experiments where the target gene          is significantly present probe response factors may be          retrieved by some statistical modeling A recent study             provides an important example in this direction          Researchers at Corimbia httpwwwcorimbiacomalso          developed some proprietary methods to identify good          probes and assign different weights to them to improve          data analysis Efforts can be made along similar lines          with the MOID algorithm in the future If probe response          factors can be calculated the bad but stable probes          can be scaled and the distribution may be expected to be          closer to normal therefore expression levels and their          uncertainties can be calculated in a more statistically          sound manner          Future studies for more accurate background          subtraction models may also improve the fold change          distribution therefore yield better statistics for fold          change evaluation as well The relative error in spiking          experiments  suggests that there is room for future          improvement                          LogP and Absolute Calls          In the derivation of LogP see materials and methods          Figure  it is assumed that the statistics of any          absent probe can be described by the general background          curve           B The           P value should not be literally          interpreted as accurate probabilities since it is only          as good as the underlining assumption Users should also          bear in mind that a           P value is for the null hypothesis          that the discrepancy between observables and generic          mismatches is generated by noise which is different from          the likelihood of gene presence conditioned on the          observed discrepancy However LogP values more or less          serve as a statistical indicator for the sorting of genes          by their significance The discrete absolute calls in          MAS are determined in a completely different empirically          manner Although higher LogP values have a higher          tendency of being assigned Absent in MAS the exact          correspondence between the two varies from experiment to          experiment Roughly LogP values above  have a          greater chance to be called Absent than Present by          MAS Users should be aware not to over interpret this          correspondence One interesting observation we had in          this study was that discrete calls by MAS are not as          stable as LogP values Sometimes a gene can be reassigned          to Present from Absent by MAS due to a small          perturbation in the underlying quantities without going          through a Marginal transitional stage                          Curve Normalization          It is clear by observing various experiments that the          response of intensity to signal varies in different          intensity regions Occasionally the normalization          constant           n                       f            does not cover well for all intensity values A more          generalized normalization procedure should use a          normalization curve instead of a constant factor The          MOID normalization algorithm can be easily modified to          the following see    for a similar approach          Step  include all genes in the normalization gene          list          Step  using the           E                       k            values for all the genes in the list generate          integral intensity distributions for both experiments A          normalization curve           NFI is constructed in such a way          that the two integral distributions are identical after          normalization          Step  normalize the data sets using           NF obtained in the previous step          refine the gene list by further excluding those genes          whose intensity values changed by more than a certain          fold            f           max or             f           max  between the two data sets          Step  repeat Step  and update           NF to           NF until one of the following          conditions is met           the maximum number of iterations           Itr           max  is reached           max           NF            I            NF            I               max  where           max is a small predefined          threshold           size of the normalization gene list drops below a          predefined threshold           Sz           min           This algorithm offers a chance to correct          nonlinearity in the chip system to a certain extent To          demonstrate the algorithm we applied the procedure to          two measurements where genomics DNA sample of yeast          sc strain were hybridized onto Affymetrix YGS          arrays The second experiment was a repeat of the first          one after about  days where some of hybridization and          scanning parameters had been changed over the course It          is shown in Figure that the curve normalization          procedure outperformed constant normalization as          expected                            Conclusions        MOID algorithm allows at least double or even triple the        information density of current U human chip Affymetrix        highdensity oligo nucleotide arrays without compromising        analysis accuracy Table summarizes feature comparisons        between MOID and MAS        It should be noted that at the time of this study        Affymetrix U chip uses  probe pairs per set As        Affymetirx is planning on further reducing probe set size        in their next design the density improvement by using MOID        may be less than the estimation given above                    Materials and Methods                  Affymetrix Oligonucleotide Chip          At the time of this study Affymetrix synthesizes          mer oligonucleotides on a    array with  m          feature size using photolithographic fabrication          techniques some data used in this study were collected          from some previous generation arrays of    cells          and  m feature size Each cell also called a probe          in the array contains the same oligonucleotide sequences          As shown in Figure  typically a set of  probes are          designed for each targeting cluster called a probe set          or sometimes a gene An expression value will be          derived per probe set as the result of analysis Probes          taken as fragments from a target sequence are called          perfect matches PM Multiple matches per set serve as          independent signal detectors and provide a possibility to          capture statistical uncertainties For each match there          is also a corresponding mismatch MM probe whose          sequence differs from its match by a single base in the          middle Mismatches are meant to detect cross          hybridization components of their corresponding matches          and are used by MAS for probespecific background          subtraction There are also several Affymetrix control          sets on each chip used for quality references which were          used in the spiking experiments to validate and refine          hybridization protocols                          Intensity Distribution          In an ideal case all the probes in a set should give          similar signals and serve as replicate measurements One          common rule in probe design is to select probes with          similar melting temperatures to minimize the variances          among probes The chemistry involved in a hybridization          experiment is often too complicated to be predicted          computationally at the current stage therefore in          reality probe intensity distribution for a set is usually          fairly wide and has a long tail which causes all kinds          of difficulty for data analysis          One usual attraction in expression analysis is to          assume a normal distribution for probe intensities This          hypothesis can be examined by the following calculation          For each probe set we applied a linear transformation to          probe intensities so that the mean and the standard          deviation of the intensities in the set were normalized          to zero and one respectively Then all the resulting          match intensities were used to generate an overall          distribution Our calculation shows the normal          distribution assumption is not an appropriate one When          similar analysis was applied to mismatch intensities and          mismatchsubtracted match intensities the conclusion          stays more or less the same          Despite the fact that the intensity distribution of a          set is nonGaussian it is still crucial to find out the          distribution function for match or mismatch intensities          to generate meaningful statistics tests if such          distributions actually exist The authors tried several          analytical functions on match and mismatch probe          intensities Unfortunately the distributions seemed to          be quite bad the tail portions even fade out slower          than the extreme value distribution It was found that          distributions of mismatch signals also significantly          depended on the sample and experimental conditions One          may reasonably suspect that cross hybridization          intensity saturation overall sample concentration chip          production irregularities and miscellaneous noise may          all cause a change in the signal distribution The study          seems to suggest the distribution of cross hybridization          should be taken from each experiment as a result of          measurement instead of using an           a priori determined analytical          expression This guideline is used in MOID algorithm                          MOID algorithm hypothesis and principles          As mentioned in the intensity distribution analysis          MOID assumes cross hybridization behavior of probes is          mainly nonprobespecific and therefore all the match          cells can share the same cross hybridization background          MOID primarily aims at saving  of the chip space          currently dedicated to mismatch cells in the Affymetrix          design under this study It was also discussed before          that cross hybridization distributions should be taken          from experimental data instead of from some analytical          function Based upon the general belief that there is          always a significant amount of genes unexpressed in any          mRNA experiment we will use the match cell signals from          the  darkest probe sets in the current public          Affymetrix arrays to prove the point that it is possible          for MOID not to use any mismatch signal For the next          generation gene chip designed based on MOID algorithm          some designated probes may be used as generic mismatches          to collect nonprobespecific cross hybridization data          In fact on GNFHS  probes from  viral genes          are used for such a purpose          As discussed the distributions of quantities in          expression analysis are usually asymmetric and contain a          long tail regardless whether it is match intensity          mismatch intensity or average intensity difference For          such abnormal distributions concepts like mathematical          average and standard deviation are not the most          appropriate statistical terms to use Prefiltering the          data like what MAS does certainly helps reshape the          distribution but by no means this can bring the          distribution back to normal without throwing out a          significant portion of measurements The MOID algorithm          is specifically designed to avoid these problems by using          percentile instead of mean and using confidence intervals          instead of standard deviation in all possible cases                          MOID algorithm for significance of gene          presence          A nonprobespecific integral background distribution          representing noise cross hybridization and possible          other factors           B            I  is derived from the          intensities of the  darkest probe sets or from generic          mismatches in the future           I stands for intensity           B satisfies boundary conditions           B    and           B    For each probe set           k the match signals are sorted and          the integral distribution           S                       k                       I  is generated as well Figure          is a schematic diagram          If the gene represented by a probe set is absent the          intensity data from matches are due to pure background          contribution therefore           S                       k            is likely to be close to           B We choose the KolmogorovSmirnov          test to determine likelihood that the observed signal          distribution           S                       k             could be explained by           B If we define           d                     k max as the maximum vertical          distance between           B and           S                       k             according to KS statistics the probability of          observing discrepancies greater than           d                     k max is determined by a P          value                        where                              n                       k            is the effective number of data points in the KS          statistics which is the number of PM for gene           k in our case           P carries the meaning of          probability therefore is a number between  and           Practically Log                      P  a negative value is used as          our final representation In this way MOID uses a          continuous LogP criterion to replace MAS absolute calls          Those signal sets that can be easily explained by noise          are assigned a LogP value closer to zero                          MOID algorithm for expression level          calculation          MOID uses the horizontal distance between           S                       k            and           B to represent gene expression          level Figure  Since the darkest probes may be more          likely caused by their poor binding properties to the          target gene and the brightest probes may be more likely          caused by serious cross hybridization issues different          parts of the integral distribution tend to have different          qualities Therefore the MOID algorithm uses the          horizontal distance measured at a certain percentile           pct instead of the whole curve          Based on the analysis of the spiking experiments          discussed later it is empirically determined that  is          the optimal percentile for signal retrieval We also          tried to use the average of horizontal distances from          several           pct but without significant          improvement Therefore the expression level           E                       k             related to gene concentration for gene           k is defined as                    E                       k             max           I                      S                       k                       pct             I                      B            pct             Instead of using the standard deviation we take          confidence intervals directly from the distribution curve                    S                       k             with the background subtracted Eg           confidence intervals can be represented by a lower bound                     E                       kl             at  percentile and an upper bound            E                       ku             at  percentile of the distribution ie                    E                       kl              max            I                      S                       k                         I                      B            pct             and                    E                       ku              max            I                      S                       k                         I                      B            pct             As one might expect increment of the probe set size          helps narrowing down the confidence intervals in a manner          determined by the statistics of probe distribution          However this piece of information is unknown and we took          an           ad hoc approach by modifying the          boundaries formulae as the following                    and                                    MOID algorithm for normalization          The most common way of understanding gene functions by          expression profiling is to study the change of their          expression levels in various disease states and cellular          environments The observed expression level is a product          of complicated protocols and is subjected to various          factors from sample preparation to final image scanning          Therefore it is a common practice to normalize          expression data drawn from multiple profiles before          making any reliable interpretation          The normalization procedure in MAS aims at          normalizing the average intensities of probe sets          excluding the top and bottom  To avoid possible          signal contamination MOID takes similar approach by          normalizing the probe sets between  and  percentiles          However it is noticed that an ideal normalization factor          should be derived from only those genes that do not          change their expression levels between the two          experiments MAS software provides the possibility to use          a list of housekeeping genes for such purposes however          it certainly requires careful downstream research to          validate any such a list Some common normalization          criteria were summarized in a recent study by Zien et al              MOID uses a heuristic bootstrap method to          identify an approximate list of unchanged genes between          two data sets          Step  include all genes as the normalization gene          list          Step  sort the           E                       k            values already background subtracted for all the          genes in the list the interesting portion of expression          values between  and  in our case is retrieved and          average intensity is calculated for each experiment          respectively The initial normalization factor           nf is calculated by the ratio of          the two average intensities          Step  normalize the data sets using           nf obtained in the previous step          refine the gene list by further excluding those genes          whose intensity values changed by more than a certain          fold            f           max or             f           max  between the two data sets          Step  repeat Step  and update           nf to           nf until one of the following          conditions is met           the maximum number of iterations           Itr           max  is reached                      nfnf              max  where           max is a small predefined          threshold           size of the normalization gene list drops below a          predefined threshold           Sz           min           In practice a single iteration is usually sufficient          for most comparisons User can adjust threshold          parameters towards their preferred stringent levels In          this study we use           f           max             max             Itr           max             Sz           min                            MOID algorithm for comparison analysis          Different probes within the same probe set generally          respond very differently to mRNA sample fragments We          examined various probe properties such as melting          temperature nucleotide base composition possible          sequence motifs and potential secondary structures in          order to understand the cause of such diverse response          properties That study did not find any conclusive factor          that explains observed probe signal distribution          satisfactory Although it seems rather difficult to          precompute and predict probe responses it is possible          to derive some features afterwards for a probe based on a          significant amount of expression data where the target          gene of interest is present     Instead of using a          modeling approach to explain various signal          contributions MOID uses a new approach to avoid the          affect of diversities of probe response factors in          calculating expression fold changes          Let us assume any two probes in a probe set           k of size           n                       k            always respond to their target gene concentration          with factor           r            and           r             respectively That is if the gene          is present at concentration           c            and           c            in two hybridizations the two          probes in average give signal intensities           r                      c            and           r                      c            in the first experiment           r                      c            and           r                      c            in the second experiment As in          MAS fold change is calculated by the ratio between           r                      c                       r                      c            and           r                      c                       r                      c             where the result is essentially          dominated by the probes with the largest response          factors and the statistics of the ratio becomes          difficult to estimate However we observe that by taking          the ratio of the two signals for each probe individually          one essentially is looking at           n                       k            independent measurements of           c                       c            for that probe set This opens a          possibility for obtaining a distribution of fold change          values          If one assumes most probes have a rather stable          intrinsic response factor           r a fold change number can be          calculated from each probe           i in the set independently which          hopefully removes the affect of the unknown response          factors           r                       i             However it seems the response factor of each          probe has a nonnegligible intrinsic spread as well this          may be further complicated by alternative splicing and          tissuespecific cross hybridization issues In addition          the           n                       k            ratio numbers calculated for a probe set are not          normally distributed it is well known that even the          ratio of two normally distributed values is no longer          normally distributed The current background subtraction          algorithm may not take fully into account response          factorunrelated signals therefore could further          increase the nonnormal component To overcome this          difficulty MOID uses a percentile           pct                       f             of the integral distribution formed by the           n                       k            fold change numbers           F                       k                       f  which satisfied the boundary          conditions           F    and           F    Empirically  is used          for           pct                       f            as determined by spiking experiments discussed          later The confidence intervals are also directly taken          from relevant percentiles in the distribution          corresponding to the lower bound and upper bound          respectively The effect of the number           n                       k            is taken into account in the same heuristic manner          as we did previously for absolute analysis The final          formulae are                                    MAS Algorithm for Absolute Analysis          After a sample is hybridized to probes on a chip the          chip is scanned and fluorescent signals are collected and          stored in an Affymetrix DAT file For cell           i after filtering out boundary          pixels           N                       i            numbers of pixels are used to calculate an average          intensity value           I                       i            and standard deviation                        i             Hereafter we index a probe set by           k which contains           n                       k            probe pairs The calculated intensity values for the                    j th pair in the           k th probe set are denoted as           PM                       kj            for PM and           MM                       kj            for MM Background intensity           bg is derived from the average          intensity of the  darkest cells Noise level           Q is determined as                    where average is done over all background cells          MAS assumes that the cross hybridization component of          a match is captured by its mismatch companion therefore          the difference           PM                       k                       MM                       k             is used to derive expression levels MAS also          uses a superOlympic scoring procedure to iteratively          filter out outliers defined as those probe pairs with          difference values more than three times the standard          deviation away from the mean After filtering the          average difference value for a probe set           D                       k             is used to represent the expression level of that          particular gene          The significance of gene presence is determined by an          empirical absolute call decision matrix coupled with          proprietary MAS algorithms parts of which are described          in the Microarray Suite documentation As the result a          probe set is marked as either Present Absent or          Marginal          MAS calculates average difference by                    D                       k                        PM                       kj                       MM                       kj                                   j                      which is essentially                    D                       k                        PM                       kj                                   j                        MM                       kj                                   j                      where the average is taken over all the probe pairs          surviving the superOlympic filtering process mentioned          above Based on this observation the oneone          correspondences between           PM                       kj            and           MM                       kj             typically with an average correlation coefficient          around  are essentially lost during such averaging          Since MAS is successful in various applications despite          the fact it averages out probespecific mismatch signals          we hypothesize that contributions of the mismatch probes          are mainly probenonspecific if the pairwise          correspondence between           PM                       kj            and           MM                       kj            are not enforced This observation led to the idea          of only using match probes in the MOID algorithm          discussed above                          MAS Algorithm for Normalization          MAS introduces a normalization factor a scaling          factor in MAS serves the same purpose The goal of          normalization is to reduce false positives in the          expression fold change calculation and ensure          housekeeping genes are marked as unchanged Since it is          usually unknown           a priori what genes sustain their          expression level during the two experiments different          heuristic normalization schemes may be adopted and it is          unclear at this point which particular approach is          optimal MAS normally derives the normalization factor          by scaling average           D                       k            for all genes with expression levels within the          central  to a certain target intensity constant This          algorithm is based on the assumption that the total copy          of mRNA per cell is a conserved number among          experiments                          MAS Algorithm for Comparison Analysis          In comparison of two chips we follow Affymetrix          convention of calling the reference chip measurement as          the base            b  the other one as the          experiment            e  After the above normalization          procedure the fold change value for gene           k f                       k             is essentially calculated by dividing           D                       k                       e  with           D                       k                       b  MAS uses a filtering process          to ensure that a common subset of good probe pairs          between           b and           e are used to recalculate           D                       k             Very weak expression signals sometimes negative          are rounded to the noise level mentioned before The          final formula for           f is

described in the          Microarray Suite  documentation determine the          significance of the fold change As a result the probe          set is marked as Increase No Change Decrease          Marginally Increase or Marginally Decrease It is          obvious that the fold change number is only meaningful if          the probe set is clearly present at a level above the          noise in
