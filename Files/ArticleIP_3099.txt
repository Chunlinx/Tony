                                 Belle Lettrism            The currentshow at the Metropolitan Museums Costume Institute concentrates on th century garments bearing words letters and numbers in variousways There are a few wordbearing accessories from earlier daysgartersstockings fans and gloves most with political or erotic referencebut theclothes date mostly from the middle to the end of this century Neverthelessthe shows punning title Wordrobe appears on the wall with the displaceda in flashing red neon above the first o Right away were meant to thinkof Hester Prynnes big scarlet A imposed by the godly community which shedefiantly embellished with gold thread In so doing Hester was transgressing asecond time because in the  th century in which the novel was setand in the  th  in which it was written wearing letters fordecoration on everyday clothing was entirely unacceptable            It is still disturbingor was until very recently Why is that Words letters and numbers ongarments seem riskier than kittens clouds and flowers on garments just asthose seem less natural than stripes plaids or checks But what exactly isprofaned by putting words on clothes Is it the garment the person or thewords I believe it is the writing The written word was accumulating its ownsacred aura even before Homer and the Bible Ever since priests scholars andpoets used writing to record Scripture prayer law and history both exaltedand prosaic reverence for canonical writings has lent an august power towritten words themselves And with all the weight of such a past a certaindread can still attach to the sight of them being frivolously used            In the middle of this century turning words into fashionseemed like just such a use Some of the designs shown at the Met reflect aserious daring they are examples not just of amusing invention but also ofrulebreaking Turning the cutout letters of Emily Posts Advice toDebutantes into a debutantes dress designed by Evans and Wong  orknitting the preamble to the Constitution and the Declaration of Independenceinto a cashmere sweater designed by Joseph Golden  or even just makinga dress out of random alphabetlace French late sall these are ways offlaunting modern fashions basic iconoclasm            After the show I lookedaround the museum to see if I could find any paintings representing people withwriting on their clothes I found only Christ and the Virgin and the occasionalsaint clad in ceremonial garments edged with golden or pearlsewn words fromliturgy or Scripturebut these were worn only in heaven Earthly mortalsdidnt seem to have the privilege Words or letters or numbers on your clothesset you apart as some sort of human object sacred like St Anthony or shamefullike Hester Prynne or maybe useful like a team member            There is in fact anold football jersey in this show with a big number on it But its mainlythere as a foil to an evening dress by Geoffrey Beene  with a footballnumber in glittering beading Beene has another beautiful sleek black one witha sequined traffic sign emblazoned across the chest a big shiny yellowtriangle with yield in black capitals  Wonderful to look atwith themeaning not lost just transmuted by the sequins            More stirring is a sheer bodysuit designed by Jean PaulGaultier in  that transforms the wearer into a living banknote allgraygreen engraved swirls and crosshatching with an occasional  atsalient corners This stretches the theme a little since there are no wordsand it isnt the reproduction of a real bill But it works like so much elsein the exhibition to show how practical signs can become erotic adornments onthe human surface depending on texture and placement This skintighttransparent garment turns its pattern into a tattoo a practice alluded to byseveral other items here including some skincolored Gaultier swim trunks thatseem to cover the genitals with a tattoo saying Safe Sex Forever             Monograms have a naturalplace in the wordrobe but they were not invented for clothing The rich andthe noble used to put them on personal effects to imitate the ancient royalhabit of stamping or embroidering or incising the kings property with hispersonal cipher Artisans would discreetly stamp precious creations with theirown monograms in minidesignerlabel mode while giving elaborate prominence tothe clients There are plenty of surviving cigar cases purses boxeslockets brooches penknives and all kinds of tableware with smallmakermonograms and large ownermonograms and there are mountains of antiquehousehold linen with embroidered domestic monograms            But none of these isclothing Putting monograms on display on garments is very recent I know mymother thought monogrammed blouses and bathrobes vulgarbut not monogrammedbracelets or guest towels from which I gather that vivid personal monograms onclothes were new in the s Once everybody got used to them in the nextgeneration it was very easy to replace them with YSL and CK and the double Gsin the following one And those have acquired a lot more prestige than our ownever had            Sultan Sladin the great  th century Muslimopponent of the Crusaders had an ornate monogram that Mary McFadden borrowedto adorn a dignified  ensemble that is on view in this show Of course itcant be read by those familiar with only Greek and Roman letters nor can allthe beautiful Chinese and Japanese characters in this exhibition similarlyreduced to abstract motifs by our inability to recognize what they say Itdoes seem unfair to love them only for their looks as if we despised theirminds Unlike Judaism and Christianity Islam has used script for sumptuousdecoration of all kinds But the Islamic artists like those in China andJapan didnt forget that the immortal soul of the word is its sense nor thatclothing since prehistory has made sense without words Arabic words appearon beautiful textiles but not on those worn as clothing Similarly Japanesecalligraphy has a great artistic tradition no less great than that of Japanesewatercolor painting or Japanese costume and beautifully brushed poems mayappear next to watercolor images similar to those that often appear on clothesBut the words do not go on the garments            It has taken modern Westernfashion to make that happen Brocade or chiffon dresses covered inwhoknowswhat utterances in beautiful Chinese and Arabic script or dresseswittily made of paper printed with the New York Yellow Pages all express ajoyful relish in the decay of the written word a forthright pleasure in theway its meaning has been draining away Indeed you could view this show as acarnivalesque celebration of our growing tolerance for illiteracy            At the end of the show is acluster of popular sportswear with Tommy Hilfiger Donna Karan Nautica theGap and such names applied to it These prove that Hester Prynnes prouddisplay of her A was prophetic For with the proliferation of shifting publicsignage slogans logos and the lava flow of printout the words on yourclothes are now what certify your physical existence They put you in harmonywith the rest of the material world as well as with the electronically writtenuniverse on the Internet Words are now rarely carved in stone printed booksare quickly pulped but endless messages flicker momentarily on screens or onthis months Tshirt The exhibition tells us that as a vessel of lasting senseor sacred truth the written word may be losing ground but that as a source ofinarticulate comfort it has gained much
