                    Introduction        The Pima Indians have a very high prevalence for type         diabetes mellitus or noninsulindependent diabetes        mellitus NIDDM with evidence of strong familial        aggregation   In this population insulin resistance is        a major risk factor for the development of the disease          and maximal insulin action ie glucose disposal rate        at pharmacological insulin levels was found to be        determined by a codominantly inherited autosomal gene          Initially Bogardus and colleagues observed an        association and linkage between insulin resistance and red        cell antigens on chromosome q   After the analysis of         sibpairs using quantitative trait sibpair analysis        they observed a significant linkage between maximal insulin        action and the intestinal fatty acidbinding protein         FABP gene and the annexin V ANX gene on chromosome q                 It is well recognized that fatty acid metabolism is        linked to insulin resistance    Intestinal FABP        contains a single ligand binding site that displays a high        affinity for fatty acid   Because it is a candidate        gene at this locus a search for a mutation was initiated        and an Alanine GCT to Threonine ACT polymorphism at        codon  was identified in Pima Indians   The        associations between this polymorphism and fasting insulin        concentration fasting fat oxidation and glucose uptake        during a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp were identified        in  nondiabetic Pima Indians          Because NIDDM is a genetic disorder   and results        from an imbalance between insulin sensitivity and beta cell        function we hypothesized that the AT polymorphism of the        FABP gene plays a role in the pathogenesis of insulin        resistance which is one of the key determinants for the        development of NIDDM   Since insulin sensitivity is        affected by hypertension    and abnormal glucose        tolerance   we examined the relationship of this        polymorphism with insulin sensitivity in  healthy and        normotensive Caucasians with normal glucose tolerance                    Results        The clinical features of the studied subjects were shown        in Table  Using the PCRRFLP assay we identified  AA         AT and  TT subjects In this Caucasian population the        allele frequency was  for the A allele and  for the T        allele The distribution of genotypes was in compliance        with the HardyWeinberg equilibrium p          Since there were only  TT subjects they were pooled        with the AT subjects during the analysis There were no        differences in clinical features between the two genotypic        groups AA vs ATTT as shown in Table  Although the        ATTT subjects had a higher fasting plasma insulin        concentration than the AA subjects p   no        differences were noted in fasting plasma glucose        concentrations and postchallenged plasma glucose and        insulin concentrations We estimated insulin sensitivity        S and beta cell function B using the average of the        three fasting plasma glucose and insulin concentrations        While no difference was noted in B the ATTT subjects        were more insulin resistant a lower S than the AA        subjects p          Since a higher body mass index had been reported to be        associated with this polymorphism   we were concerned        that the observed differences could be the result of other        confounding covariates A multivariate analysis was        performed to examine the influence of this polymorphism and        other covariates Table  This polymorphism and body mass        index explained  of the variation in S and this        polymorphism was an independent determinant of S p          However this polymorphism had no impact on B        Age gender and waist hip ratio accounted for  of the        variation in B                    Discussions        In this study we found that the AT polymorphism of        the FABP was associated with insulin resistance and        accounted for  of the variation in S Multivariate        analysis confirmed that this polymorphism was an        independent risk factor for insulin resistance In        contrast this polymorphism had no impact on B Our        observations confirm that the AT polymorphism of the        FABP affects insulin sensitivity which was previously        reported in Pima Indian and Japanese populations                  The FABP locus has been studied extensively MNS red        cell antigens one of the few genetic markers available at        that time were initially found to be linked to insulin        resistance in  nondiabetic Pima Indians from  nuclear        families using a sibpair analysis and they were also        associated with insulin resistance in  nondiabetic Pima        Indians   With additional families and additional        genetic markers a significant linkage was identified        between the FABP and ANX loci on chromosome q with        insulin resistance in  nondiabetic subjects from         nuclear families   Furthermore the linkage of the        FABP locus with insulin resistance hour postchallenged        insulin concentration was also found in a MexicanAmerican        population which is genetically related to the Pima        Indians   However sibpair analysis failed to detect        any linkage of the FABP locus or the AT polymorphism        with diabetes related phenotypes in other ethnic groups           as shown in Table A Furthermore no linkage was        found between the FABP locus Table B and diabetes           lipodystrophic diabetes   or obesity   As        shown in Table C the population association studies of        the FABP locus with diabetesimpaired glucose tolerance        were negative in UK Finnish and Welsh   and Japanese        populations   Subsequently the AT polymorphism was        identified and was found to be associated with increased        fatty acid binding protein increased fat oxidation and        increased insulin resistance in the Pima Indians   The        population association studies of the AT polymorphism        with NIDDM         coronary artery disease           obesity   and hypertension   were also        essentially negative Positive associations were mostly        observed in quantitative association studies as shown in        Table D In addition to the original positive association        between the AT polymorphism and fasting plasma insulin        concentration fasting fat oxidation and glucose uptake in        nondiabetic Pima Indians   positive association was        also found with obesity    hour postchallenged        insulin concentration   and various lipid metabolism                In the present study we also        demonstrated a positive quantitative association between        this polymorphism and S However numerous negative        studies were also noted                  Clearly there is substantial controversy surrounding        this locus and the AT polymorphism in the pathogenesis of        insulin resistance and TDM as described above        Disagreement also occurred in the original Pima Indian        study Although significant linkages were identified at the        FABP locus with fasting insulin concentration p          and with glucose uptake p   in the Pima Indians          the differences regarding the AT polymorphism with        fasting insulin concentrations p   and glucose        uptake p   were only marginally significant in        the same population   The significant linkage in the        original sibpair study   could be the combined results        of a highly polymorphic marker of the FABP locus         alleles vs  alleles for the AT polymorphism and less        intrafamilial difference in insulin sensitivity as the        result of familial clustering of insulin sensitivity In        contrast the marginal difference reflected a very modest        influence on insulin sensitivity of the AT polymorphism        in the Pima Indian population which is consistent with our        observation that this polymorphism only accounted for         of the variation in S in this Caucasian population        Furthermore since  insulin resistance is neither        necessary nor sufficient for the development of TDM         this polymorphism has only a very modest influence on        insulin sensitivity and  beta cell dysfunction on which        this polymorphism has no influence in the present study        plays a key role in the development of overt diabetes          the population association studies and linkage studies are        not able to detect the interaction between this        polymorphism and the diabetes phenotype In contrast        quantitative studies of diabetesrelated phenotypes become        more rewarding in detecting a polymorphism of a very modest        effect as shown in Table D The negative quantitative        studies could be the result of other confounding factors        such as the inclusion of diabetic impaired glucose        tolerant or hypertensive subjects in the study Therefore        we only enrolled glucose tolerant and normotensive subjects        in the present study for the reasons described        previously        The most convincing evidence that supports the AT        polymorphism as a causal mutation is from a functional        study of mutated FABP   FABP plays a role in the        absorption and intracellular transportation of dietary        longchain fatty acids   Thrcontaining FABP has a        twofold greater affinity for longchain fatty acids than        the Alacontaining FABP   As predicted by the        proposed    and subsequently proven   Randles        cycle an increased concentration of fatty acid inhibits        glucose uptake in muscle and results in insulin resistance        Furthermore two interventional studies showed that this        AT polymorphism affected lipid metabolism during        interventions    as shown in Table E        In summary we examined the role of the AT        polymorphism in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in         glucose tolerant and normotensive healthy Caucasians We        found that this polymorphism had an independent but very        modest influence  on insulin sensitivity S which        was assessed by the HOMA However it had no impact on beta        cell function B To our knowledge this is the very        first report of a positive association between this        polymorphism and insulin sensitivity in a Caucasian        population                    Subjects and Methods                  Subjects          Through the advertisement in the campus newspaper of          this institution healthy subjects without a prior          history of diabetes and hypertension were invited to          participate in the study None of the participants were          receiving medical treatment on a regular basis Subjects          were instructed to fast for at least  hours before the          study visit On the morning of the visit subjects were          admitted to the General Clinical Research Center of this          institution as outpatients An indwelling angiocatheter          was inserted into an antecubital vein All subjects had          fasting blood samples drawn at   and  minutes          A blood sample for the fasting lipid profile was obtained          at  minutes Fasting plasma glucose and insulin          concentrations were calculated as the average of the          three fasting samples After an oral administration of          gm glucose postchallenged blood samples were drawn at             and  minutes for glucose and insulin          measurements A total of  Caucasian subjects were          enrolled in the study They were glucose tolerant          fasting plasma glucose   mM interval plasma          glucose   mM and hour plasma glucose            mM and normotensive systolic blood pressure            mmHg and diastolic blood pressure   mmHg Plasma          glucose and insulin concentrations were assayed as          described previously   Insulin sensitivity S and          betacell function B were estimated based on the          Homeostasis Model Assessment HOMA as described          elsewhere    They were calculated from the          average of three fasting plasma glucose and insulin          concentrations mM and mUL respectively using the          following formulae S    insulin x glucose and          B   x insulin  glucose   The study was          approved by the Institutional Review Board and written          informed consents were obtained at the entry of the study          from each participant We confirm that the study has          complied with the recommendations of the Declaration of          Helsinki                          Genotyping          Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral leukocytes          using the method described previously   A polymerase          chain reactionrestriction fragment length polymorphism          PCRRFLP assay was developed for genotyping The          genomic DNA fragment flanking the AT polymorphism was          amplified using two primers flanking exon  of the FABP          gene CTACCGAGTTTTCTTCCCACC and          AATTAAACCATCCAATGAAATAGAGC Polymerase chain reaction          PCR was carried out in an l reaction volume          containing  pM of each primer  mM dNTP  mM MgCl              glycerol  U Taq          polymerase  mM KC  mM TrisHCl pH  and  g          of genomic DNA The region of interest was amplified by          an initial denaturation at C for  minutes  cycles          of denaturation at C for  seconds annealing at C          for  seconds and extension at C for  seconds and          concluded with a final extension at C for  minutes          Then  l of the PCR product  base pairs was          digested in a l reaction volume containing  U of Hha          I New England Biolabs Inc Beverly Massachusetts USA          with the buffer supplied by the vender The digested PCR          products were resolved on  agarose gels Hha I          digested the wild type Alanine GCT which yielded two          products  and  base pairs A allele The G to A          substitution Threonine ACT destroyed the Hha I site T          allele                          Statistical analysis          Variables which failed the Normality test were          logarithmically transformed before analysis They were          age body mass index waisthip ratio plasma insulin          concentrations S and B The relationship between the          variables and parameters of interest B or S was          determined by using univariate analysis A multivariate          analysis using a stepwiseregression strategy was          employed to examine the effect of covariates on the          parameter of interest S and B The continuous          covariates were age body mass index waisthip ratio          and systolic and diastolic blood pressure The          categorical covariates were gender and the FABP          polymorphism Backward stepwise option with          alphatoenter of  and alphatoremove of  was          employed to exclude covariates that had much less or no          influence on the parameter under analysis one at a time          starting from the one had least impact which was based          on

multivariate analysis based on their p values as          indicated in each analysis A nominal P value of less          than  was considered significant SYSTAT  for          Windows from SPSS Inc
