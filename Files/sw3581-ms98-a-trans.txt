              all right   so what was the last car repair that you had done on your car   well we have two cars and on our little Honda we had to replace some CV joints and on our bigger car its a Chevrolet we had to repair   umhum   the control module   the control module a mystery box huh   uh yeah yeah yeah right so weve had just recently a couple of things the CV joints my husband just did himself and im glad he can do that because that saves us lots   yeah thats thats impressive hes able to do a job like that because that requires special tools   lots of money yes he does and hes lucky in that way too because his his dad lives real close and he has a lot of the tools   oh thats interesting   so so hes able to do quite a few things like that and saves quite a bit of money   that thats great what what kind of jobs would you folks repair refer refer to a garage   um well we had to have the the Chevrolet had to be repair done by a repair man the you know the control module and even though that that still hasnt been taken of in fact we were driving along the other night and the engine light came back on but   umhum   the man wouldnt the repair man when he fixed it said that it looks like um the computer panel or or the whatever it was needed to be replaced also and we didnt have it done at the time so it looks like well need to go back in and have that done   wow   so how about yourself   well um the last thing that i had to have done to my car uh i wound up doing myself and um that was uh tuning it up   oh   and um i had been having a a problem where i would be driving along and and i would notice this at night when id be sitting at a light i would see smoke in my uh   oh wow   my headlights and uh then later on when you know id id get out wherever i was going i would smell uh something had been burning   oh umhum oh   and i pretty much figured it was oil because id looked under the hood a couple of times and there was a a lot more oil sort of floating around than you should have on a Honda which i ironically have too   uhhuh oh huh uhhuh   youd expect the car to be really clean inside   right   and it run real well real well and so anyway i i had been thinking about it for a long time and discovered that um uh or i had decided that what had happened is theres a a a little piece of metal that sits there over the top of the valve train called the valve uh uh cover   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh i decided that there must be something wrong with the gasket or perhaps the the whole cover itself hadnt been uh tightened down well or whatever and so   oh   when i was doing this tune up i decided it was time for me to explore   uhhuh   and sure enough thats what the problem was   my word huh   and so i went out and i got a new gasket and slipped it in there   oh   and on on older cars up to i i in fact i have no idea when they started doing this but but on the older cars they used to make the gasket out of a cork like material and on this car they make it out of a rubber like material   umhum umhum oh   so uh   oh so do you enjoy doing the repairs yourself   yeah up to a certain point i used to do a lot more of it when i was younger than i do now um       and i have to admit that when the weather starts to get cold theres just no fun like a busted knuckle i just uh i just cant even tell you the joy i get from that experience and   uhhuh right right oh well thats what my husband says too he says when you have the right tools and a good place to do it in its its enjoyable and he really likes to be able to to do it but when you dont have the right tools youre out in the weather its no fun at all   sure and my finances have always been a little precarious so sometimes repairing the car is a financial necessity   umhum right right   um but its the the down side of that is that i very rarely always had the right tools and   oh   ive   because yeah you cant afford to buy them so   yeah exactly yeah yeah its a sort of a catch twenty two if youre well enough off to buy these exotic tools you need to do the work then you can generally have somebody else do it for you   umhum right uhhuh so have you found um one certain type of car needs less repair work than another   so well um   have you had that many different cars or   its funny ive ive owned a lot of different cars i started out with Volkswagons and then um uh graduated to um a Honda and had that for a long time and then graduated to a Volvo and then wound up with a Honda again   umhum hm oh   and so ive ive  had them all and and uh       uh have gotten to know the engines in each one of these uh sorts of vehicles and but uh i in the Volkswagon business i i went from you know owning a bug to owning uh one of their cars called a Rabbit   uhhuh   oh yes uhhuh   and the and there was a completely different kind of engine in the Rabbit um but i i actually rebuilt a Volkswagon bug engine at one point and uh so i learned an awful lot about cars uh that way and   oh oh boy ill say ill say well we i dont know were a little bit partial our Honda we have got a hundred and
