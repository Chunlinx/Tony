                            Gastric adenocarcinoma GC is one of the most common        malignant diseases in China Although the GC has been        declined in its mortality rate it remains the leading        cause of cancerrelated deaths in this country Parkin et        al  World Health Organization  Nomura A         Gastric carcinogenesis is considered as a multistage        progressive process The early indicator for the subject        predisposed to GC is abnormal hyperproliferation of gastric        epithelial cells such as chronic atrophic gastritis CAG        DYS and intestinal metaplasia IM which have been        considered as precancerous lesions of GC You et al         Correa P  However the information for the mechanism        of gastric carcinogenesis is very limited        The growth and metastasis of tumors depend on the        development of an adequate blood supply via angiogenesis        Recent studies indicate that the inducible nitric oxide        synthase iNOS vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF        and tumor suppressor p are fundamental playmakers of the        angiogenic process Ambs et al  Jekins et al         Forrester et al  Chiarugi et al  iNOS is one        of the isoforms of nitric oxide synthase that catalyzes the        formation of nitric oxide a regulator of vascular        permeability VEGF is a dimeric glycoprotein and has        specific mitogenic activity for endothelial cells        Overexpression of iNOS and VEGF could induce angiogenesis        in tumors P suppresses angiogenesis by downregulating        VEGF and iNOS Mutant p potentiates protein kinase C        induction of VEGF expression Zhang et al  In a        tumorigenicity model using human fibroblast cells the loss        of wildtype p and transfection of activated ras led to        increased VEGF expression Devavrata et al         Transient transfection of wildtype p and of vsrc has        been found to exert opposing effects on human VEGF gene        promoter activity in human glioblastoma and transformed        human fetal kidney cells Devavrata et al However        because wildtype p did not repress hypoxiainduced        transcription of the VEGF gene in stably transfected human        colorectal carcinoma and human hepatoblastoma cells with an        inducible pestrogenreceptor fusion protein expression        system Ambs et al  it has been proposed that there        is a need for caution in interpreting p function on the        basis of cells transiently overexpressing this protein        Nevertheless mutant p has been correlated with increased        VEGF expression in human lung cancer Ambs et al         and colorectal cancer Ambs et al by        immunohistochemical staining of surgical specimens It has        been reported that dysfunction of the pMDM pathway can        be found in more than twothirds of angiosarcomas thus        mutant p influences the development of angiosarcoma not        only by affecting growth and apoptosis control but also by        upregulating VEGF Chinrugi et al  We hypothesized        that alterations of p iNOS and VEGF expression may        contribute to gastric carcinogenesis and influence the        clinical behavior of GC via angiogenesis The correlation        of expression of p VEGF and iNOS and clinical features        in gastric carcinogenesis however has not been well        characterized        To characterize the changes of p iNOS and VEGF        expression in human gastric carcinogenesis the present        study was undertaken to determine the protein level of p        iNOS and VEGF in normal tissues and the tissues with        different severities of lesions of CSG CAG DYS IM and GC        with and without lymph node metastasis from surgically        resected

incubated overnight at  with a diluted solution of the          primary antibodies  for p  for iNOS and           for VEGF Location of the primary antibodies was          achieved by subsequent

Known immunostainingpositive slides          were used as positive controls          Specific staining for each protein was categorized as          either positive or negative based on the presence of

considered significant                            Results        Histopathologically all the  surgicallyresected        gastric specimens were confirmed as adenocarcinoma Of the         GC patients  cases occurred the invasion within        submucosa  with wholemuscle layer Of the         biopsysamples examined  were diagnosed as normal  as        CSG  as CAG  as IM with CAG and  as DYS Table                The positive immunostaining for p iNOS and VEGF was        observed in the gastric epithelial cells and cancer cells        with different rates in the lesions of CAG DYS IM and GC        But the positive immunostaining for p iNOS and VEGF was        not observed in normal gastric epithelial tissue and CSG        Figure  and shows the representative of p iNOS and        VEGF immunostaining in GC p immunoreactivity was located        in the nuclei VEGF and iNOS immunoreactivity were located        mainly in the cytoplasm and cell membrane iNOS        immunostaining was confirmed by Western Blot on part of        iNOS positive and negative slides three slides for each        and consistent results were obtained for iNOS        immunohistochemistry and Western Blot data not shown The        positive immunostaining rate for p was very low in CAG        and slightly increased in IM and DYS and significantly        increased in GC Table  Similar results were observed in        iNOS and VEGF Table  P positive immunosatining rate        in welldifferentiated GC was lower than that in        poorlydifferentiated GC p   Table  iNOS        positive staining was similar among the GC with different        degree of differentiation Although VEGF immunostaining        rate in poorlydifferentiated GC was higher than in        welldifferentiated GC the difference was not significant        Table         iNOS positive immunostaining rate in the cases with deep        invasion of GC through muscle layers was higher than in        those with superficial invasion within submucosa but        the difference was not significant Table  P and VEGF        immunostaining was similar in GC patients with superficial        and deep invasion        iNOS immunosatining rate in the cases with lymph node        metastasis was higher than that in those without lymph node        metastasis p   Table  However there was no        difference observed for p and VEGF between the cases with        and without lymph node metastasis        P immunostaining rate in the cases with TNM grade T        was lower than that in those with TNM grade T T and T        TT p   TT p   Similar results were        observed in VEGF TT and TT p   TT p          TT p   Table  However there was no        difference for iNOS immunostaining between the cases with        different TNM stages        A higher coincidental expression of p iNOS and VEGF        in GC was observed Of the  cases examined there were         cases showing positive staining both for p and iNOS          cases showing negative staining for both p and        iNOS  p   Table   cases showing positive        staining both for p and VEGF  and  cases showing        negative for both p and VEGF  p   Table         The correlations were significant                    Discussion        An interesting observation in this study was that the        immunoreactivity of p iNOS and VEGF occurred in the        early stage of gastric carcinogenesis The positive        immunostaining cells were invariably associated with cell        proliferate activity With the lesions progressed from        normal to CSG to CAG to IM to DYS and to GC the positive        immunostaining rates for p iNOS and VEGF increased        significantly the increasing tendency for p iNOS and        VEGF had a good linear correlation with lesions        progression The present results indicated that p protein        accumulation and increased expression of iNOS and VEGF may        be important molecular events involved in the early stage        of gastric carcinogenesis        Another interesting observation was that a high        coincidental positive immunostaining rates for p and iNOS         and p and VEGF  was observed Table and         This result was consistent with the findings in human lung        and colon carcinomas Ambs et al  Although p        antibody used in this study could not differentiate        wildtype p from mutant p previous studies have        indicated that p protein detected by immunohistochemistry        seems to representative most mutant p Accumulation of        p is an indicator for a loss of p tumor suppressor        function Both mutations and proteinprotein interactions        can cause a p accumulation Wang et al         Considering that p protein accumulation was correlated        with poorlydifferentiation and T T and T TNM stage of        GC we concluded that p protein accumulation in this        study may lead to the loss of cell proliferation control        and inhibition for iNOS and VEGF possibly because of p        gene mutation Thus the high coincidental expression of        iNOS and VEGF and p protein accumulation may be important        events to enhance gastric carcinogenesis and poorly        clinical features and may be useful biomarkers to assess        risk for the development of GC Recent studies on Japanese        GC patients have showed that increased expression of VEGF        and p protein accumulation are associated with        intratumoral angiogenesis Takeuchi et al  Saito        et al  and poor prognosis Skatani et al         Ikeguchi et al  Maeda et al  Rajnkova        reported that increased expression of iNOS may promote        gastric cancer progression by providing a selective growth        advantage to tumor cells with nonfunctioning p        Rajnkova et al         The third observation in this study was that increased        expression of iNOS and VEGF and p protein accumulation        occurred with a high frequency in gastric biopsy samples        with IM IM which may be defined as the replacement of        gastric mucosa by glands which have the histological        histochemical and physiological characteristics of the        small intestine has been strongly associated with stomach        cancer The present results demonstrated that IM was a        unstable stage with active molecular changes and further        analysis to compare these changes with normal small        intestine will provides more information for the        significance of IM in gastric carcinogenesis        Finally the present study demonstrated that the        positive immunostaining rates of iNOS was correlated well        with GC lymph node metastasis increased expression of VEGF        and p protein accumulation was related with TNM stages        and GC differentiation These findings indicate that p        iNOS and VEGF may be useful biomarkers for GC        aggressiveness The molecular basis for the observed        expression of iNOS and VEGF and p protein accumulation        and their roles in the progression of gastric precancerous        lesions and angeogenesis requires to be carefully        investigated in the laboratory and followup studies                    Abbreviations        The abbreviations used are CSG chronic superficial        gastritis CAG chronic atrophic gastritis DYS
