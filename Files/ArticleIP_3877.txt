press conference in TodaysPapers Imagine a NASA astronaut having the nerve to say such thingsYoull have to because its never happened even when things went as awry asthey did with the Challenger            I guess Shuger doesntrecall John Young taking NASA management to task about flawed decisionmakingafter the Challenger accident If hell refresh his memory he might recallthat Young speaking as the leader of the entire astronaut corps saidastronauts would refuse to fly until there were significant changes in thedecision tree            I guesswere so used to our freedoms here that we quickly

henotes Apples failure to build a business selling system software rather thancomplete computer systems The Microsoft business model is an attractive one inhindsight but before Microsoft every large company in the industryshistoryIBM Digital Equipment HewlettPackard etchad prospered byselling complete systems In  when the Macintosh was released Microsoftwas dwarfed by both its hardwareselling clients and the vendors of popularapplications It was Bill Gates genius to understand that his tiny companycould own the link between those two sides of the business reducing PCmanufacturers to commodity boxbuilders and forcing software developers tocompete with Microsoft applications on Microsoft turf But as successful as thesystemsoftware strategy has been for Microsoft it isnt a panacea see IBMsexperience with OS and Jobs own experience with NeXTStep forcounterexamples            It isinteresting to note what Microsoft gave up in order to pursue a softwareonlystrategy Today  years later Microsoft systems still do not approach thetight integration and polish of the original Macintosh They dont even knowwhen the user has inserted a floppy disk Jobs hubris was not that he wantedto own the personal computer business but that he wanted to sell a productthat was better than anything the industry could put together piecemeal             JimMatthews Hanover NH                           DOS andDonts                        In Steven JobsTotalitarian Vision James Surowiecki gives one of the finest examples ofMonday morning quarterbacking Ive ever seen He states Jobs wanted to makethe computers and the systems that ran them  Had Apple allowedCompaq HewlettPackard perhaps even IBM to build hardware running the Mac OSit might very well have seen its software become the industry standard            Wellyes We all know that now But in  it was taken for granted that themanufacturer of the computer also designed the operating system I didnt knowanyone with a DOS system in the early s but I knew plenty of people withCommodore s TI As Apple IIs computers by Tandy and even Timexallwith distinct and incompatible operating systems This was the state of theindustry when the Mac was born Bill Gates realized it would be more efficientif all computers regardless of manufacturer ran the same system which is whyhes the richest man in America today As obvious as this insight seems todaythough it wasnt in Steve Jobs didnt realize it my computer nerdfriends and I didnt realize it and I suspect James Surowiecki didnt realizeit either             KimScarborough

are not the contemporary equivalent of Gary Hartsvideotaped escapades on the appropriately named Monkey Business  Do youremember the grainy video of Hartstop motion circle around Hart circlearound Rice drinking funthat was broadcast for days on local and nationalnews programs Have you seen any such videos of President Clinton or RudolphGiuliani In the court of public opinion there is no parallel between video anda bare allegationsomething often forgotten by zealous reporters andcolumnists Weisbergs conclusion that Americans are apathetic about infidelitymay be true but it is totally unsupported by his argument If anything thecolumn merely supports the conclusion that the American public is more carefulthan Weisberg in branding individuals with a scarlet letter

shamelessimmorality of liberal expoliticians who have sold their services to thetobacco companies but he fails to properly identify why their actions arewrong            Defending the freedom ofpeople to make dumb decisions is not morally wrong Whether it is sky divingeating Big Macs smoking or engaging in promiscuous sex people should be freeto take risks with their own lives Advocates of the nanny state may respondthat society bears some of the costs of these behaviors but that is the faultof the health welfare and other government programs that protect people fromthe consequences of foolish behavior            No thereis nothing at all wrong with defending tobacco companies What is immoralinstead is taking lots of money to lobby for something you do not believe inThis is why Ann

losers as illustrated by a sex crime described in lurid detail On top ofthat we get huge gobs of money from Uncle Sam but are not sufficientlygrateful            We do have our share ofloners and losers but most Alaskans have families and jobs go to churchesor synagogues and are the same as the rest of America except for having todress warmer We have chosen to live in a beautiful place where some of theworlds most scenic areas have been closed to mining and oil developmentforever But thanks to advances in mining and petroleum technology other areasof the state can be safely developed leaving only a minuscule footprint onthe environment            As for federal spending inAlaska keep in mind that you will get skewed statistics on a per capita basiswhen you are dealing with a small capita The federal government is theoutright owner of most of the land in Alaska and has financial responsibilitiesthe same as any other landlord Add to that Alaskas strategic position in aworld where the threat comes increasingly from Asia and you can see that themoney spent here on the military is hardly a boondoggle dreamed up by thelocals In addition the federal government spends a large amount of money onAlaskas native peoples It would certainly save money not to deliver mail toscores of isolated native villages that can only be reached by air but thenatives hardly intend to apologize for living in their ancestralcommunities            Sensibleenvironmentalism deserves everyones support and gets it up hereEnvironmentalism as a secular religion though is another matter Alaska
