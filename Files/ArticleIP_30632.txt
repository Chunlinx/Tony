book even though they havent read it The book Dow  which will be out in early September explains the reasons for thestock markets rise between August  when the Dow Jones industrial averagestood at  and today when its over  During nearly this entireascent financial journalists academic economists and Wall Street analystshave claimed the market was heading for a fall After all just look atpricetoearnings ratios and other measurements of valuation goes theconventional wisdom Theyre too high            What my coauthorKevin Hassett a former FederalReserve economist whose work has been widely published in scholarlyjournalsand I offer in our book is a new model for pricing stocks one thatis consistent with the markets performance and with the basic principles offinance Our starting point is that the value of a stock like that of anyother asset a rental condo a bond is determined by the amount of cash itputs into your pockets over time With stocks that amount has beenskyhighand will continue to be we believe until shares are bid up byinvestors to where they should be That proper level is about  on theDow            This argument is laid out at length in an annotatedpage book which also includes extensive advice on how to implement aninvesting strategy based on the theory            In                   Slate                on June   Paul Krugmanrehashed the criticisms made in                   Slate                by and before him Ourresponse to Krugman is the same as our response to Gottlieb and Crook Youreaccusing us of making an assertion we dont make            Krugman wrote that our theory is based on a simplemisunderstanding of corporate accountingthat businesses can eat their seedcorn and plant it too What he means is that while we rely on the growth incash flowing to investors as justification for higher stock prices that cashis needed by corporations themselves In other words we doublecountby using reported corporate earnings for our calculations But we dontNowhere in the book do we claim that free cash flow is equal to earnings Infact we say that it would be an egregious error to make such a statement orto use it in calculations of stock values Instead what we have written fromour first March  piece in the Wall Street Journal to our bookandhave repeated without provoking objection at academic conferences fromPrinceton to Tokyois that the measure of cash is somewhere between the lowerbound of dividends and the upper bound of earnings In the book we discusssimple ways to determine cash flow as a percentage of earnings Hint Theanswer is far from  percent            The thrust of Krugmans piece is the irony thatstocks have kept rising just as Glassman predicted so that the guy who hadno idea what he was talking about gave what turned out to be good advice Thistwisted argumentthat we are right in practice but wrong in theoryhas becomethe last refuge of people who simply do not understand what has been happeningin the stock market over the past two decades and who cling to an old paradigmthat recent history has clearly repudiated            We have written aserious bookone that will launch a debate over discovering a new and usefulmodel for determining the true value of stocks But see for yourself Dontread premature reviews of a book that the reviewers havent read Just hang onDow  will be out in

poisoning deaths of  animals at a cost of  million intaxpayer funds in the Environmental Protection Agency and the ChemicalManufacturers Association high production volume HPV chemical testing programis about a whole lot of nothing Every national animal protectionorganization in the countryrepresenting more than  million Americans andall of which have asked Vice President Al Gore to reexamine the programwouldbeg to differ            So might the environmental consumer and publicinterest group members of the EPAs food quality advisory panel who recentlyresigned in protest stating that the agency dithered in endless fruitlessdebate rather than doing anything about toxic chemicals that have been aroundsince World War II the Washington Post  April   So might anynumber of public policy righttoknow organizations for whom the design andgoals of the HPV program are obscure  RighttoKnow News  Jan             What they would tell Noah is this The EPA has theknowledge and the ability right now to prioritize the high productionvolume chemicals and protect us from the most hazardous ones But the agencyhas launched unthinkingly into this nations most massive animal testingprogram rather than make the effort to collect the substantial amount ofexisting data on these chemicals centralize it and make it accessible            Spurred on by Goresrushed schedule for the testing program even EPA officials admit they are notable to develop a scientifically defensible testing strategy According towhistleblower calls PETA has received from EPA employees the HPV program istaking much needed resources from important effective and authorized EPAprograms In fact after all the money is spent and all the animals have beenkilled what the public the environment and the workers will be left with isa whole lot of nothing              JessicaSandler                        People for the EthicalTreatment of Animals            Norfolk Va                           Over and Under theLine in Oregon                        Almost everyone misunderstands the Oregon HealthPlan and Cyrus Sanai  is no exception            Oregon led the way with an attempt atexplicit rationingtreating only the diseases that were most likelyto benefit from treatment and increasing the coverage as money allowed Mosteveryone else in the world rations implicitly through a process knownas queuing in England by progressively increasing the length of time neededto obtain services until the least hardy either get better get discouraged ordie It is debatable which is the better procedure it is notdebatable that resources are limited that some form of rationing isinevitable and that virtually every scheme for financing medical care has runaground on the shoals of excess demand in an ocean of insufficientresources            People actually do get treatment for many of thenoncovered services in Oregon and specifically they get treated for analfissures Its just that the doctor usually doesnt get paid for treating themMany below the line procedures actually are covered on a casebycase basisbut it depends on the insurance companys policy there are many privatecompanies administering the Oregon Health Plan            To my knowledge there has been little or nomovement of the line since the scheme was first written down The federalgovernment has been very reluctant to grant the necessary waivers to allow theOregon experiment to operate that way so in reality the number of diseasescovered has not changed very much But the eligibility requirements change withchanging resource levels so that more or fewer people are covered by the plandepending on how much money is available People pretty much expect to be takencare of no matter what is wrong with them and once they get their insurancecard the hemorrhoid sufferers generally will not defer to congestive heartfailure for example so the Oregon plan has a fatal flaw the most basic flawof allhuman nature            Most people are uncomfortable with the idea of ataxsupported planned suicidebut it is among other things an unintendedconsequence of the Americans with Disabilities Act How can a publicly fundedprogram discriminate against persons with disabilities If it is legal thenthe law requires that it be funded For what it is worth there has been norush to exterminate a lot of unwanted Oregon Health Plan recipients For onething there is something called Tort Law malpractice that discourages eventhe most dyedinthewool supporters of death with dignity from actuallyprescribing any suicide cocktail             Thomas SDuncan                MD                        Astoria Ore                                             Cyrus Sanaireplies Dr Duncan is correct that the HMOs administering the OregonHealth Plan may elect to cover conditions below the funding line and no doubtmany physicians do treat such conditions at no charge or by combining treatmentwith a condition falling above the line But they dont have to provide suchtreatment under the Oregon system thats the whole point of having theprioritization list                                       Dr Duncans information on the status Medicaiddemonstration waiver is outdated the Oregon Health Plan received its Sectiona Medicaid demonstration waiver from the federal government in  afterbeing required to reorder the prioritization list                                       The Americans withDisabilities Act has a lot of strange things to answer for but publiclysupported assisted suicide is not one of them After the Death with Dignity Actsurvived a repeal attempt and court challenges the Oregon governors officeconcluded correctly I think that physicianassisted suicide was a medicalprocedure eligible for inclusion in the prioritization list However it wasthe commission that decided that the Rx of No Return merited position That there has not been a rush to fill these prescriptions let alone publicizethe availability of this option does not lessen the significance of Oregonsmove as the logical intersection of healthcare rationing and assistedsuicide                                       ChihulyHoop                        In general I agree with Eric Sciglianos LetterFrom Washington  on Dale Chihuly however I think hes being unfair in afew places            First I think he makes far too big a deal over thefact that Chihuly doesnt blow his own glass Many sculptors run workshopstudios where assistants do the actual casting and assembling of the largeworks Im not sure how many of the Burghers of Calais were actuallycast by Rodin and I dont think it particularly affects how I should regardthe statues If Scigliano thinks that Chihulys real crime is to imply that hestill blows glass then he should say so directly            Im also not sure itsfair to lay all of the Northwests sins at the feet of Microsoft Amazoncomand Starbucks While making his case that the nouveau riche are responsible forChihulymania Scigliano also cites Tacoma as groundzero for the phenomenonLast time I checked there werent too many stockoption millionaires living inTacoma             TomWilliams
