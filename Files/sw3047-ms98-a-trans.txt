          do you have children     uh yes yes i have a daughter yeah shes only about uh uh a little less than two years old   do you how old is she   uh  i guess you have not reached the stage where you need to uh promote a college or anything huh  ive got one thats seven and one thats three so we uh we started saving but thats all   no yeah   so do you is there are you planning to like encourage your children to go to a particular school   uh um  no uh um no particular school uh i think thats really       no such decision that   that you are going to let them make   that they well help them make in terms of you know what they are they are wanting to do you know that thats a big influence i think and you know what not only what you can afford but what   right uhhuh yeah yeah   whats going to be best for them in terms of what their career goals are   right uhhuh   so uh you know you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do   yeah where did you go to school   uh University of Mississippi   oh was that local or uh   uh well it was well it was in within the state   uhhuh   but it it wasnt necessarily local it was   yeah but i i mean so whats   whats the criterion for choosing to go there   yeah   uh well at the time i was uh thinking of going premed and in the state uh they had the best premed uh curriculum for the   uhhuh   uh state institutions it was choice between there and uh a private college that uh was a bit more expensive at the time we really could not afford it so   uhhuh uhhuh yeah yeah   i ended up going there although it was quite a drive away for me it uh i enjoyed it   so you did you commute everyday then or oh okay   no   no it was a six hour drive   oh okay when you said it was quite a quite a way away i did not know it that meant you had to drive like an hour or   well well i was uh it it was like another world   uhhuh   basically it was a no it was a did not get home that often you know and at that age its uh its kind of   yeah   kind of difficult sometimes too   yeah   especially if you have not been away a lot   yeah   that that extended   so did you go there like straight out of high school   yeah   uh uh see i did not get my degree until later on so i just finished mine a couple of years ago   uhhuh   and uh you know i guess you know when you have to do it that way it makes makes your choices a lot easier but   uh thats true yeah that thats like you know when i went on to get my my masters i   uhhuh   basically was you know it was where i was at the time you know i wasnt gonna   right   try to pick and go somewhere else because i was pretty much settled and i was trying to work   right right   but uh so when you are first going to school that you kind of have the luxury of being able to have some latitude in choosing the place to go   exactly yeah what which group do you work in in TI   um uh the computer science center   oh uh where is that at   uh north building   i see how long do you work for TI   uh about three years   did you work somewhere else like sounds like you got your masters before here or   uh yeah i have uh uh no actually i mean i came straight from school to here so   i see   so cause this was the first first real job after getting my degree   uhhuh after your masters or after your   after my masters my undergraduate degree was not in not in what my masters was   i see i see   so i made career change basically   uhhuh i see well lets see  i have not you know theres a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools you know just like you said uh depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford different things like that so i i have not really made up my mind you know whether to encourage them to go different places or   yeah well i mean i would like to uh you know the uh i i like the school where i went i mean and i would not       hesitate at all to uh to encourage her to go there if she wanted to or the school where i got my masters at which which was a different school and uh   right right right   i liked it almost as well uh but uh you know that im not going to hold them to that just because i went there i you know think thats If they want to thats fine but   uhhuh right yeah yeah   otherwise not although i can uh would get quite a break on on tuition  yeah because they uh allow for uh   um because you went there   uh tuition uh break for out of state students who   um   children of alumnae   i didnt know that   well certain schools do it this school does so uh its been  been interesting i i was involved in some uh   yeah uh     oh alumnae recruiting uh here in town uh recently uh well last year uh and it was kind of fun because you are trying to       to trying to get people interested in your school you know and they were this was a college night at a at a high school in Richardson and it was and there were a bunch of   uhhuh uhhuh   kids you know and a bunch of schools there were a hundred schools probably there all competing for the same kids its kind of interesting to   uhhuh uhhuh   to to talk up you know your school and i was surprised by the number of kids that came came by and had heard of you know our school and and were interested in it   yeah your old school uhhuh um   uh you know we uh you you situations like that you dont realize you know until you start thinking about it the kinds of advantages you school may have over others   uhhuh   and so i i was real real pleased with that that worked out so well   yeah so did you drum up any interest then or   i think so i dont know offhand but uh it seemed like there were quite a few   well thats good uhhuh   kids that were definitely interested in going there so there there was one mother who uh came by right even before we started who who obviously was uh very interested in getting her her daughter in or or   and that   having gotten her daughter in or something and she was wanting some more information but she was her her daughter was uh a a majorette majorette drum a majorette or something you know a baton twirler or something and she was  she was letting us know she  how how   uhhuh uhhuh   her daughter was she had cards printed up actually describing you know business cards describing her daughters uh you know she had won several different twirling awards and all this and she was     oh really uhhuh   had these business cards she was passing out and it was  quite a production  i think some parents go a little bit overboard   yeah it sounds like it well you know i think Richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely   yes
