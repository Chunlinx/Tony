                    Background        The ZAS gene family is an emerging family of important        transcriptional proteins that have been implicated in the        regulation of gene expression of the HIV long terminal        repeat     and genes encoding Acrystallin            somatostatin receptor type II     the small calcium        binding protein SAmts     and type II collagen           via specific promoter or enhancer elements Three human        genes         HIVEPMbpPRDIIBF                HIVEPMbp       and         HIVEP     and their respective        mouse counterparts          ACRYBP             MIBP     and         KRC      as well as rat         AGIEBPMIBP     have been        cloned and characterized In addition a distant relative         Schnurri          Shn  has been identified in         Drosophila       Although        little is known about the physiological functions of the        mammalian ZAS proteins Shn has been shown to be an        important transcription regulator during embryonic        development Shn modulates transcription by relieving the        repression of the nuclear protein Brinker and in        association with SMAD mediates transcription response of        the decapentaplegic pathway             Each ZAS gene encodes large sequencespecific        DNAbinding proteins with Mr  that contain two        widely separated of C          H          type zinc finger pairs Smaller        protein isoforms with a single zinc finger pair or with no        zinc finger pairs can be generated by alternative RNA        splicing      The amino acid sequence and relative        location of the two zinc finger pairs are highly conserved        among ZAS proteins from invertebrate to vertebrate        Reviewed in     Although the zinc finger is a major        structural motif involved in proteinnucleic acid        interactions and is present in the largest superfamily of        transcription factors few proteins contain separate zinc        finger pairs The ZAS proteins with two zinc finger        pairs tramtrack with one finger pair and basonuclin        with three finger pairs constitute a unique class of C          H          zinc finger transcription factors        Reviewed in     In addition each ZAS protein        contains a sequence similar to the serine stripe present in        basonuclin in which eight serines are located on one side        of a putative helix             The ZAS domain is a protein structure unique to the ZAS        protein family A ZAS domain denotes a composite protein        structure consisting of a pair of C          H                            z          inc fingers an                   a          cidic region and a                   s          erinethreoninerich sequence      Here we        name the aminoDNA binding domain ZASN and the        carboxylDNA binding domain ZASC The DNA binding        specificity of the ZASN or ZASC domains from several ZAS        members have been characterized by electrophoretic mobility        shift assays methylation interference experiments and        DNAse I footprinting experiments The cumulative data show        that individual ZAS domains bind a Blike consensus        sequence GGGN          CC     However mouse KRC        ACRYBP and mouse MIBP have also been shown to bind        distinct DNA sequences KRC binds to the signal sequences        of VDJ recombination RSS      ACRYBP binds to        a sequence in the type II collagen gene enhancer            MIBP binds to a TCrich element present in the        somatostatin type II receptor gene enhancer            This is the first study to evaluate DNA targets of both        ZAS domains from a single protein independently We used        site selection amplification binding assays to select        specific DNA targets recognized by KRC fusion proteins        containing ZASN or ZASC from an initial oligonucleotide        pool containing degenerate mers After cloning and DNA        sequencing the KRCselected sequence datasets were        analyzed by the computer program Multiple Expectation        Maximum for Motif Elicitation MEME version  to        generate sets of position specific scoring matrices PSSMs        or motifs     When the program was set to identify        wider sequences   nucleotides the PSSMs were homologous        to Sb     the B motif     and the canonical        heptamer and nonamer elements of the RSS     However        shortening the width of the motifs to  nucleotides the        target length for the C          H          zinc finger pairs of the tramtrack            the ZASN dataset yielded two motifs GGTAT and        TTCTTTGG and the ZASC dataset yielded a single        motif TGTGG Juxtaposition of the two pentamers of ZASN        forms a sequence homologous to the canonical RSS nonamer        GGTTTTTGT Similarly the ZASC pentamer together with        its complement form the canonical RSS heptamer palindrome        CACTGTG        The computer program Multiple Alignment Sequence Tool        MAST version     was used to search human and        mouse genome databases for DNA elements matching the        KRCselected PSSMs The hits included sequence matching DNA        regions located within or close to mobile genetic elements        including the diversity D gene segments of the variable        region of the immunoglobulin Ig heavy chain     and        break points of chromosomal translocation between Ig DH        and the B cell lymphoma          BCL gene     and between the         ENLMLLTLTG gene and myeloid        lymphoid leukemia         MLL gene                        Results                  Amplification of KRCs DNA targets with a site          selection amplification binding assay          In this study sequences bound by the DNA binding          domains of KRC were identified in a site selection PCR          amplification DNA binding assay KRCZASN or KRCZASC           g each Fig A were initially incubated with an          pool of Plabeled degenerate oligonucleotides and          nonspecific competitor DNA polydIdC  g          DNAprotein complexes and unbound DNA were then resolved          on a  polyacrylamide gel and the proteinbound DNA was          purified and amplified The oligonucleotides in the          degenerate pool were composed of twentyfive random          nucleotides mer in the middle flanked by a specific          sequence BSS at one end and the complementary sequence          of BSS at the other end Subsequently the primer set          BSS and BSS was used to amplify the recovered          oligonucleotides by PCR The sequence of binding          selection and amplification was repeated several times          before proteinselected oligonucleotides were cloned          sequenced and analyzed To select optimal binding          sequences the stringency of succeeding rounds of the          selection procedures was increased by using successively          less  fusion proteins and more  nonspecific          competitor DNA in each round          The formation of proteinDNA complexes was monitored          throughout the site selection experiments Fig Band          Fig Analytical EMSAs were performed under more          stringent conditions than in EMSAs used to purify          proteinbound oligonucleotides in the site selection          experiments using much less fusion protein  to           g and an excess nonspecific DNA polydIdC  g          Initially the DNAprotein complexes formed between the          degenerate oligonucleotide pool and KRCZASN or          KRCZASC were barely detectable indicating that both          fusion proteins bound DNA selectively Figs Band C          lane  In the subsequent rounds the yield of the          DNAprotein complexes increased suggesting successful          enrichment of KRC binding sites in the recovered          oligonucleotides during the selection procedures After          the fourth rounds of selection and amplification no          further increase in the amount of DNAprotein binding          complexes was observed The experiment therefore was          stopped at the fifth round for both fusion proteins          Furthermore in rounds four and five a cluster of close          migrating DNAprotein complexes were observed for          KRCZASN Fig B lanes  and  In EMSA the gel          mobility of DNAprotein complexes depends on the overall          mass of the binding proteins    and on the possible          protein induced bending angle of DNA     Since a          single fusion protein was used in each binding reaction          the slight variation in the gel mobility of the          DNAprotein complexes may reflect that KRC has more than          one target or that the targets were located at different          positions within the mer DNA Similarly two closely          migrating DNAprotein complexes were clearly seen for          KRCZASC at rounds three through five labeled C Fig          C lanes   and  In addition another complex          labeled C which was minor and had significantly slower          gel mobility was observed in round four and round five          Fig C lanes  and  Previously we showed that          KRCZASC bound DNA as dimers tetramers and multiple of          tetramers     The significant difference in the gel          mobility between complex C and complex C suggested that          they were likely composed of KRCZASC dimer and          tetramer respectively These data show that the site          selection amplification binding assays using both KRC          DNAbinding domains were efficient in selecting KRC          targets and that KRCZASC readily formed highly ordered          DNAprotein structures          DNA oligonucleotides recovered from the fifth rounds          of site selections were cloned into plasmid vectors We          obtained fiftythree KRCZASN selected sequences and          fortynine KRCZASC selected sequences The mer          sequences of individual site selected sequences from each          fusion protein are shown in the BSSN            BSS orientation Figure  These          sequences were named tentatively after ZASN or ZASC          correspondingly and a suffix a number given in the          order of plasmid DNA preparation Gaps in the numberings          represented clones with empty vectors and therefore          were excluded from Figure as they most likely resulted          from cloning artifacts Among the proteinselected          sequences  out of  ZASNsequences ZASN and          ZASN ZASN and ZASN and ZASN and          ZASN and  out of  ZASCselected sequences          ZASC and ZASC were identical The redundancy          observed during DNA amplification appeared to be minimal          and therefore the complexity of the proteinselected DNA          sequences in the datasets should be high                          Motif discovery by MEME   W            nucleotides          The fiftythree KRCZASNselected sequences ZASN          dataset and  KRCZASCselected sequences ZASC          dataset were first analyzed by the Motif Expectation          Maximum for Motif Elicitation MEME computer program          MEME analyzes input sequences for similarities and          produces a PSSM or motif for each pattern it discovers              We set the parameters of MEME as follows i zero          or one occurrences of a single motif per sequence ii          five as the maximum number of motifs to identify iii           to  nucleotides as the range of motif size and iv          both DNA strands as input          The first pass of MEME for   W   nucleotides          generated a single mer TGrich motif found in all           sequences in the ZASNdataset Fig  The log          likelihood ratio llr the logarithm of the ratio of the          probability of the occurrences of the motif given the          motif model likelihood given the motif versus their          probability given the background model likelihood given          the null model was calculated to be  The Evalue          which is an estimate of the expected number of motifs          with the given log likelihood ratio and with the same          width and number of occurrences that one would find in a          similarly sized set of random sequences was calculated          to be e  The llr and Evalue scores suggested that          the PSSMs discovered were statistically significant          Using the ZASCdataset a similar pass of MEME also          generated a TGrich motif with llr of  and an Evalue          of e Fig  A sequence comparison showed that          the ZASNPSSM was generally homologous to that of the          ZASCPSSM with  guanines at both ends and a Trich          sequence in the middle In fact when the two datasets          were combined for a pass of MEME a mer motif with llr          of  and an Evalue of e was obtained data not          shown suggesting ZASN and ZASC have similar DNA          targets Furthermore we were able to align the B motif          the Sb sequence the RSS nonamer and part of the RSS          heptamer TGTG with both PSSMs Figs and  As a          control several sets of  random mers were generated          by a random number generator G   A   T   C            and none yielded any statistically significant PSSMs          where Evalues  when analyzed by MEME under the          same settings data not shown                          Motif discovery by MEME   W            nucleotides          A motif of nucleotides was obtained in the above          MEME analysis when widths of   W   nucleotides were          set This is longer than known transcription factor          binding sites In addition the information content          measured in bits which reflects the degree of          conservation of each column or position in those PSSMs          was relatively low ranging from  to  with an          overall average  per position Figs and  To          elucidate more biologically relevant motifs with higher          information content a second pass of MEME was performed          with motif widths set to shorter lengths ranging from           to  nucleotides The PSSMs discovered for each width          all had significantly higher overall bits per position          and obtained a TGrich core sequence data not          shown          Representative results of passes of MEME with W            nucleotides are presented in Figures      In          those passes two PSSMs were discovered in the ZASN          dataset One motif with a consensus sequence          GTGTAATTTTTGTG was found in  of          the  sequences of the ZASNdataset with a llr of           and an Evalue of e  This PSSM was more conserved          than the mer PSSM described above with bits for all          positions ranging from  to  and an average          bitsposition of  Figure  We were able to align          the canonical RSS nonamer and Sb with this PSSM The          second motif GGTTGTTC was found only in two input          sequences had a llr of  and Evalue of e  and was          similar to the B motif Figure           A similar pass of MEME discovered three motifs in the          ZASC dataset The major motif had a consensus sequence          ATTTATTGTGG with a llr of  and an          Evalue of e Figure  This consensus sequence          aligns with canonical RSS nonamer Notably the terminal           nucleotides TGTGG each had an information          content of  bits and were nearly invariant in that          sequence alignment With respect to the heptamer          canonical sequence CACAGTG the CAC sequence bordering          the recombination site is the most conserved segment of          the sequence     and mutation of these nucleotides          has been found to decrease VDJ joining in transfection          assays using recombination substrates     Because          the sequence of the canonical RSS heptamer is palindrome          we speculate that the TGTG sequence may be sufficient for          KRCZASC binding A second motif also contained a TGTG          core sequence Figure  A third sequence was homologous          to the RSS nonamer B or Sb sequences Figure  In          general PSSMs generated from MEME passes looking for          shorter motifs yielded more conserved sequences                          Motif discovery by MEME W   nucleotides          KRC and tramtrack TTK share the same class of C            H            zinc finger pairs The crystal          structure of the zinc finger pairs of tramtrackDNA          duplex revealed that the two fingers together contacted           basepairs A G G A T  in the major groove of DNA          The first finger interacts with A G G while the second          finger interacts with G A T      By inference          each zinc finger pair of KRC might also bind to a          pentamer To test this hypothesis a pass of MEME was          performed with a fixed width of  nucleotides Two PSSMs          were obtained for the ZASN dataset One motif was an          invariant GGTAT Figure  and the other was          TTGTTGG Figure  Both motifs when superimposed          form a sequence that is homologous to the RSS nonamer          GGTTTTTGT It is possible that two KRC molecules may be          needed to interact with an RSS nonamer one protein whose          ZASN domains may bind to the half of an RSS nonamer          while a second proteins ZASN domain may bind to the          half of an RSS For the ZASCdataset a single motif          TGTGGT was obtained Figure  Since the RSS          heptamer is a palindrome it is possible for two KRC          molecules to bind to an RSS heptamer with one ZASC          binding to the top strand and the other ZASC binding to          the bottom strand This notion is consistent with          previous observation that two molecules of KRCZASC are          required for DNA binding     Further passes of MEME          with W   were too short to generate statistically          significant motifs data not shown These data suggest          that with respect to the RSS canonical elements          KRCZASN binds the nonamer more efficiently while          KRCZASC binds the heptamer more efficiently and that          two KRC molecules may be needed to bind a single RSS          element                          MAST analysis          The human and mouse genomes in the GenBank databases          were searched with the KRCbound sequences identified as          PSSMs by the MEME program with the Multiple Alignment          Search Tool MAST MAST is a program designed to search          biological sequence databases for sequences that contain          one or more of a group of known motifs     Of a          total of  sequences analyzed only a total of           hits were obtained  hits for KRCZASN Figure  and          hits for KRCZASC Figure  Significantly  and           of the hits derived from KRCZASN and KRCZASC          respectively came from the D gene segments of the          variable region of human or mouse Ig heavy chains For          example the KRCZASC consensus sequence ATTTTGTGG          matches completely with  nucleotides of the RSS nonamer          and  flanking nucleotides of the human IgH D D D          and D gene segments     Furthermore the MAST          search identified KRCselected motifs near two          chromosomal breakpoints between a t translocation          of the Ig DH gene segment and the           B cell lymphoma             BCL  gene in a mantle cell          lymphoma     and at a t translocation of the           myeloid lymphoid leukemia            MLL  gene and the           ENLMLLTLTG gene in a Tcell          acute lymphoblastic leukemia     The other hits were          derived from loci of cellular genes pseduogenes or DNA          fragments        The expression of those genes          has not been shown to be regulated by KRC or other family          members therefore the biological significance of those          MAST results is unknown The result of the MAST analysis          identifies probable endogenous KRC targets and suggests          that KRC might interact with genetic elements involved in          legitimate or illegitimate VDJ recombination                          KRCbound sequences match RSS elements within          endogenous antigen receptor gene segments          Although RSS are evolutionarily conserved the          sequences of individual nonamer and heptamers vary               To further determine the physiological          significance of KRCs DNA binding we compared the          datasets with known endogenous RSSs of Ig and TCR loci          The mouse TCR chain J gene segments TCRAJ and the          human Ig light chain genes IgV were analyzed taking          advantage of the fact that both loci have been sequenced          and the location and sequence of their RSSs have been          characterized      Of the  IgV gene segments          listed   have a nonamer a heptamer or both          matching a sequence within the datasets Figure           Similarly  out of   of the TCRAJ RSS elements          matched one or more sequences in the datasets Figure           As controls only    of random sequences from          several data sets matched the endogenous RSS sequences          data not shown Potentially the DNA binding domains of          KRC might interact with the range of heptamer and nonamer          sequences found in endogenous antigen receptor loci                            Discussion        KRC was independently cloned due to its ability to bind        the RSS    and the B    motifs Subsequently        sequence analysis identified KRC as a member of the ZAS        family of proteins which share the ability to bind Blike        motifs     DNA competition analysis showed that KRC        fusion proteins containing the ZASC domain bind        specifically to both the RSS and to the B motif             DNA footprinting analysis further showed that KRCZASC        binds to specific nucleotides within the B and the        heptamer of the RSS     In this study using a        PCRbased DNAbinding siteselection and amplification        procedure we demonstrated that both the Nterminal ZASN        and the Cterminal ZASC domains are able to bind GTrich        DNA sequences and confirmed that the RSS and B motifs are        the highaffinity targets of KRC        In the siteselection experiment the increasing yield        of DNAprotein complexes in successive rounds of DNA        amplification and purification suggest that KRCZASN and        KRCZASC bound DNA specifically Conceivably repetitive        binding selection and amplification should have selected        increasingly specific KRC targets as increasingly stringent        binding conditions were established As far as we know        this is the first DNA siteselection study to employ the        MEME program to identify target consensus sequence The        program has been conventionally used to identify conserved        motifs in proteins It was chosen as a DNA motif search        tool in this study due to its flexibility in recognizing        several patterns within a set of sequences It was able to        identify multiple motifs that could not be recognized by        other alignment programs such as Pileup GCG Software        Package     or Clustal W    which have been used        in other siteselection experiments to identify a single        consensus sequence The oligonucleotide pool presented in        this study was composed of a random mer flanked by        specific primers A relatively large target was used to        accommodate ligands with a range of potential sizes and        also to minimize the influence of flanking primer        sequences Inspection of the sequence alignments shows that        all of the KRCbound oligonucleotides align in the         orientation suggesting that orientation of binding may        have been influenced by the flanking sequence However the        flanking sequences were constant throughout the        oligonucleotide pool which should have controlled for        their relative contribution to consensus sequence        Using the ZASN and ZASCselected DNA sequences as        input the MEME program discovered motifs containing        sequences similar to the B or Sb transcriptional enhancer        motifs as well as the conserved heptamer or nonamer        elements of the RSS Generally the significance of the llr        and Evalues scores of a motif generated by MEME increased        with its length whereas the information content per        nucleotide position decreased Figures                  These are statistical values showing different        parameters of a motif llr and Evalues reflect the        likelihood of a motif being generated at random whereas the        information content represents the degree of conservation        In our analysis passes of MEME where the width was not set        to a fixed length but to a given range of nucleotides        always yielded the longest motif The MEME program aims at        generating motifs with the most probable occurrence and        the length of a motif may override other parameters in the        algorithm MEME is a useful tool with which to discover the        best motif among DNA sequences provided the length is        specified and determined experimentally        Given that the crystal structure of the DNAprotein        complex revealed that the C          H          zinc finger pair of TTK like the        first two zinc fingers of DNAZif binds five basepairs            we hypothesize that each zinc finger pair of KRC        may also interact with five basepairs Passes of MEME for        pentameric motifs yielded homologous TGrich sequences for        the KRCZASN and KRCZASC datasets TTGTTGG and        GGTAT for KRCZASN and TGTGGT for KRCZASC We had        previously shown by methylation interference analysis that        KRCZASC bound specifically to the sequence TGTGG within        the context of the canonical RSS heptamer plus the        immediately flanking guanine     Because the pentamer        motif for KRCZASC predicted by MEME completely matched        with the empirical results we conclude that the two        pentameric motifs discovered by MEME are likely authentic        binding sites for KRCZASN as well        The putative DNA binding sequences of the ZASN and        ZASC domains as determined by MEME width   were        homologous Specific DNA binding of separatepaired C          H          zinc fingers depends on the amino acid        sequences of the finger domains the linker sequence        between fingers and the higherordered structure of        fingers The structure of individual C          H          fingers as determined by D NMR        methods has shown that each zinc finger consists of two        Nterminal short antiparallel  sheets followed by an         helix The amino acid residues at position    and         of the  helix form base contacts with DNA Reviewed in            The amino acid sequences of the zinc finger pairs        among the ZAS proteins are highly conserved Reviewed in            The conservation of the zinc fingers from        invertebrate to vertebrate species and their common DNA        binding target sequences suggest that these proteins may        play similar physiological roles in diverse organisms        While the overall sequence identity between human and mouse        KRC is  their corresponding zinc finger pairs are        completely identical    Figure  Notably for those        critical amino acid residues within the  helical regions        of the finger described above they are identical at all        corresponding positions between the first and second zinc        fingers of the ZASN and ZASC domains except at position         of the first zinc finger Val in ZASN Met in ZASC and        at position  of the second zinc finger Ser in ZASN Gly        in ZASC Because Val and Met are both nonpolar amino        acids and Ser and Gly are both polar and uncharged amino        acids those amino acid substitutions between ZASN and        ZASC may result in minor changes in the tertiary structure        of the zinc fingers which account for the subtle        differences in the DNA binding properties of the ZASN and        ZASC domains The differences in the linker regions TGERP        for ZASN and TDVRP for ZASC which presumably interact        with the sugarphosphate backbone of DNA and the        observation that KRCZASC more readily forms        higherordered structures with DNA than KRCZASN may also        contribute to the differences in the DNA binding of ZASN        and ZASC        Based on the results here we hypothesize that each DNA        binding domain of KRC binds to pentameric TGrich        sequences Two KRC binding sites when put together can form        some longer known KRC targets For example a copy of GGTTT        and its complement can form a sequence GGN          CC fulfilling the minimal DNA        binding requirement for the ZAS proteins other than a lack        of the  guanine     Similarly the GTrich RSS        nonamer and the palindromic RSS heptamer can serve as        binding sites of KRC Furthermore our hypothesis can        explain why halfsites but not complete KRC targets were        frequently found in the proteinselected datasets Although        previous results of protein titration experiments suggested        that KRCZASC binds DNA in a cooperative manner for a        given oligonucleotide the presence of multiple binding        sites might not be favored over a single site in our site        selection assay which used a degenerate pool of        oligonucleotides and limited rounds of amplification The        data suggest that both DNA binding domains of KRC are        potentially capable of binding to either RSS heptamer or        nonamer Because the pentameric motifs derived from the        KRCZASN dataset more closely resemble the canonical RSS        nonamer and the motif derived from the KRCZASC dataset        more closely resemble the canonical RSS heptamer and a        canonical sequence was derived from the majority of        sequences we propose that the ZASN domain of KRC binds        RSS nonamers more frequently than the ZASC domain and         vice versa for the RSS heptamer         in vivo                     Conclusions        Our results suggest that KRC binds with individual        endogenous RSS elements and transcriptional enhancer        motifs As the most abundant RSSbinding species detected        in thymus     it is intriguing to propose a role for        KRC in regulation of the VDJ recombination process        Several studies have shown that the RSS themselves may act        as         cis acting elements which influence        recombination frequency                 Furthermore affinity of KRC for the RSS has been shown to        vary inversely with activation of the catalytic components        of the VDJ recombinase RAG and RAG     It is        possible that differential affinity of KRC for individual        RSS influences RSS utilization by the recombinase allowing        differential recombination of gene segments        Our finding that KRC binds to the RSS as well as the B        motif may also provide a link between transcription and        recombination in the context of the accessibility model             Enhancer or promoter elements are important for        the recombination process in cell lines and animal models            Similarly expression of transcription factors in        conjunction with the recombination activating genes has        been shown to induce VDJ recombination in nonlymphoid        tissues by rendering RSS accessible to the recombinase            The B motif first found in the Ig light chain            and later in the TCR  locus     has been shown to        promote VDJ recombination by modulating locus        accessibility     In addition to influencing        recombination by binding of RSS KRC binding of the B        motif may modulate accessibility and transcription of        target loci The ability of KRC to promote transcription of        target genes has been demonstrated for the Smts gene        by binding at the Sb enhancer motif     Similarly        binding of Blike motifs by other ZAS proteins has also        been implicated in transcriptional regulation               Considering KRCs target sequences the B motif and the        RSS the two binding domains on a single KRC protein could        theoretically bring together         cis acting DNA elements for gene        regulation VDJ recombination or both Such a molecule        could coordinate transcription of individual promoter or        enhancer elements andor could physically connect        different cellular machineries via distinct DNA elements        KRC could provide a link between the fundamental processes        of DNA transcription and VDJ recombination                    Methods
