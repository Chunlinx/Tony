                    Background        Tuberculosis is estimated to cause at least three        million deaths per year worldwide    and also accounts        for more than onequarter of all preventable adult deaths        in developing countries     Infection with the human        immunodeficiency virus HIV is thought to be the single        most important factor that has contributed to the increased        incidence of tuberculosis globally in the last decade            Tuberculosis is now the leading cause of death among        HIVinfected individuals worldwide and accounts for at        least  of deaths among HIVinfected persons in Africa            Furthermore tuberculosis kills more women than any        other infectious disease including malaria and AIDS                   Reports have suggested that responses to tuberculosis        differ between men and women and that barriers to early        detection and treatment of tuberculosis may be greater for        women than for men     A year study performed among        Ethiopian Jews who immigrated to Israel found that women        had an incidence rate of tuberculosis that was twice that        of men  versus  cases per  population per        year     In addition studies have suggested that        progression from tuberculosis infection to disease may be        faster in women of reproductive age than men of the same        age      Nonetheless there is an estimated  male        to female ratio in the number of tuberculosis cases        notified to public health authorities     indicating        that any increase in the risk of development of        tuberculosis that reproductive stress may confer upon women        is transient Despite this disparity in case notifications        mortality from tuberculosis is similar among young males        and females in Africa            The literature lacks information on the relationship        between gender tuberculosis HIVinfection and the        outcome of tuberculosis in Africa Studies that have        examined gender relationships in tuberculosis patients        found a similar proportion of HIV infection among males and        females in Tanzania     Zambia    and Kenya            Among younger age groups female tuberculosis patients        were more likely to be HIVinfected than males whereas the        opposite was found in older age groups        In  almost  million  of the  million        people in Uganda were estimated to have been infected with        HIV Of these  were estimated to have tuberculosis        coinfection     The total number of notifications of        tuberculosis cases of all forms has been steadily rising in        Uganda from  in  to  in  an increase        of over  even with an estimated case detection rate of        about             This report describes an investigation of the        relationship between gender and the baseline presentation        and oneyear outcome in a cohort of HIVinfected pulmonary        tuberculosis patients in on tuberculosis treatment in        Uganda                    Methods                  Study population          Between March  and March   to  year old          HIVinfected patients with initial episodes of sputum          acidfast bacilli AFB smearpositive cultureconfirmed          pulmonary tuberculosis were enrolled at the National

        patients gave informed consent for study          participation                          Statistical analyses          We investigated the influence of gender on the          likelihood that a study patient achieved a favorable          outcome ie alive and cured of tuberculosis or an          unfavorable outcome ie dead or not cured of          tuberculosis after oneyear from the initiation of          antituberculosis treatment Vital status was determined          through interviews of family members Study subjects who          were acidfast bacilli sputum smear and culture negative          at the oneyear followup sputum examination were          considered cured Only subjects whose status could be          assigned into either of the two outcome groups were          included in the analysis We evaluated the bivariate          relationships between gender and outcome with selected          baseline covariates and constructed a timeseries          repeated measures regression model     to describe          the influence of gender on the outcome using data at          baseline and two six nine and  months We chose the          timeseries model because it accounts for the variations          of covariates within the study patients with time A          proportionalhazards regression model was used to assess          the influence of gender on oneyear survival All          analyses were performed using the SASSTAT version           SAS Institute Cary North Carolina USA          module                            Results        Of  HIVinfected patients with pulmonary tuberculosis        who were enrolled into the cohort study   whose        outcome status was known as either favorable ie alive        and cured of tuberculosis or unfavorable ie dead or        not cured of tuberculosis after oneyear of initiation of        antituberculosis treatment formed the sample for this        analysis The majority of patients whose status could not        be determined had withdrawn from the study before        completion of treatment        Of the  patients   were male and          were female table  At baseline male patients were        significantly older and had higher body mass indices BMI        than female patients Both male and female patients had        similar educational levels and marital status There was no        statistically significant difference between males and        females in the frequency and previous duration of symptoms        of tuberculosis cough fevers hemoptysis and sweats and        other HIVinfectionassociated conditions herpes zoster        diarrhea genital ulcers and thrush and Karnofsky        performance scores at baseline However female patients        had significantly higher mean serum           microglobulin levels while male        patients had significantly higher hemoglobin levels There        was no difference in baseline CD cell counts and PPD skin        test reactivity between males and females        At oneyear from the time of initiation of        antituberculosis treatment   of the  study        patients had experienced a favorable outcome table  In        a comparison of baseline characteristics patients who        developed a favorable outcome were similar in age to those        with an unfavorable outcome but they had higher BMI and had        more years of education Both groups had similar        tuberculosis and HIVinfectionassociated symptoms though        the subjects with an unfavorable outcome were more likely        to have presented with a past history of fever diarrhea        and thrush In addition patients with a favorable outcome        had larger PPD skin test reactions higher absolute CD        cell counts lower serum           microglobulin levels and were more        likely to have fibrotic changes on their initial chest        xray than subjects with an unfavorable outcome        Furthermore patients who experienced a favorable outcome        had significantly higher baseline Karnofsky performance        status than those with an unfavorable outcome        In an unadjusted comparison between gender and outcome          of the  female patients compared to   of        the  male patients had experienced a favorable outcome        at oneyear relative risk   CI  From the        repeated measures model female subjects were more likely        to have a favorable outcome at oneyear although the effect        was not statistically significant OR   CI         after controlling for CD cell count serum           microglobulin hemoglobin BMI        symptoms and radiology table  Additionally increasing        CD cell count OR  p   increasing        hemoglobin OR  p   increasing BMI OR  p          and decreasing serum           microglobulin OR  p   were        associated with a favorable outcome        Among the  subjects with an unfavorable outcome year        after the beginning of antiTB treatment  had died Of        the  dead patients   were female and          were male The majority of the patients died with the first        two months of TB treatment and we did not conduct        autopsies additionally the majority of the patients in the        study were sputum culture negative at  months of        treatment Because of this difference we created a        proportionalhazards model to investigate the influence of        gender on survival controlling for baseline presentation        of fever diarrhea serum           microglobulin CD cell count        hemoglobin BMI cavitary disease and extent of disease on        chest xray Female patients were less likely to have died        than male patients relative hazard RH for death         CI  but this protective effect was not        statistically significant Higher baseline CD cell count        RH  CI  hemoglobin RH  CI         and lesser extent of disease on chest xray RH          CI  were each significantly associated        with better survival Baseline serum           microglobulin levels had no effect on        survival RH  CI                     Discussion        We identified differences in the presentation of        HIVassociated tuberculosis between men and women in        Uganda however there were no differences in outcomes or        survival at one year HIVinfected women with pulmonary        tuberculosis were younger had lower body mass indices and        were more anemic than men at the time of presentation This        is consistent with observations in other settings where        tuberculosis has been shown to occur more among younger        females than males and in persons of lower body mass        indices     However in our study cohort female        patients had higher serum           microglobulin levels at the time of        diagnosis with tuberculosis suggesting a possibly higher        HIV burden      than male patients despite        comparable CD lymphocyte counts In spite of their        comparative disadvantage at presentation female patients        had a similar likelihood of a favorable oneyear treatment        outcome        Studies have suggested that tuberculosis and HIV may        have a particularly severe impact on young women in a        lowincome setting     We did not find that        HIVinfected women fared any worse from tuberculosis than        men Hudelson has suggested that delays in care seeking for        tuberculosis among women may be compounded by stigma        associated with HIV infection     We found no gender        difference in the duration of symptoms of tuberculosis and        HIV prior to the diagnosis of tuberculosis in our study        cohort        Differences in compliance with antituberculous        chemotherapy have been postulated to exist between female        and male tuberculosis patients     Women have less        access to funds for transport and personal healthcare than        men do in Africa We were unable to evaluate compliance        because all patients were encouraged to come back to the        treatment center by home healthvisitors and those who        defaulted on their treatment were often brought to the        clinic        Biologically there may be differences in immune        responses to tuberculosis between males and females It has        been suggested that the immune response in tuberculosis may        be closely related to differences between females and males        in type and concentration of nonsex steroid and sex        steroid hormones secreted     the direction of this        response difference is however unclear Cell mediated        immune responses are depressed by proteincalorie        malnutrition     and this could account for        differences in the response to tuberculosis in males and        females since females had significantly lower body mass        indices However females would have experienced more        unfavorable outcomes than males which is not what we        observed        This study is subject to at least possible three        limitations first the relatively small sample size could        have contributed to our inability to detect clear gender        differences in this study To detect the observed crude        relative risk of  given the frequency of favorable        outcomes at oneyear in males of  and in females of         with  confidence and  power the study would have        needed to enroll about  males and  females        However the modest gender differences in the presentation        and the similarity in the oneyear outcome that this study        suggests could provide impetus for larger and longer        studies in this area or studies with a different design        eg casecontrol studies Using the repeated measures        model methodology     allowed us to use more data        points since each covariate was updated at the different        time points and it gave us more power and a more robust        estimation of the effect of gender on outcome than using        baseline covariates would have done The second possible        limitation could be a differential followup rate between        male and female patients leading to the apparent trend        towards better oneyear outcomes in the female patients        Nonetheless we do not believe that there was a systematic        difference in the followup rate by gender and as        indicated home health visitors followed up all patients        similarly The third potential limitation is that serum           microglobulin levels have not been        shown to be associated with survival in HIVinfected        patients on antiretroviral treatment although high levels        generally imply a higher burden of HIV infection This        restricts generalization of our results in terms of        survival                    Conclusions        We conclude that female HIVinfected tuberculosis        patients have a similar oneyear outcome to males in        Uganda even though they have lower body mass indices        lower hemoglobin levels and higher           microglobulin levels at presentation        which may indicate more advanced HIV disease than the        males Because tuberculosis is the number one infectious        disease killer of women it is imperative that public        health workers in areas of high HIV and tuberculosis        prevalence should encourage women to present for screening        as soon as they experience the first signs of        tuberculosis
