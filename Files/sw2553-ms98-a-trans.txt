                 well whats your thoughts on it   okay i i think what happened with savings and loans is uh is what everyone says is they they made a lot of uh of not well secured loans on real estate and when uh the bottom fell out of the real estate market the bottom fell out of their loans   um thats it thats thats the primary that and the loosening of the restrictions letting them ease up on their cash reserves and uh like you say all these bad real estate loans and energy loans   right yeah   um you know i i its hard to say what caused it i mean you know if if the regulations hadnt been uh hadnt been relaxed maybe it wouldnt have happened but i somehow think it still would have you go in you start making massive investments in those two areas and youre youre just playing the market you know they were just gambling with their their savers money   yeah yeah   then of course then of course there was the fraud but youre going to have that anywhere so   yeah i think right  yeah that seemed to play a pretty big role i think because i dont know i get the feeling that the regulations probably needed to be a little a little more stringent   yeah well so are they are they handling it right gee who knows   uh   i dont dont even know if they know      yeah it certainly has has uh the magnitude of the crisis it seems i dont know it it seems much greater than i would have thought it really just seems out of proportion talking theyre talking four or five hundred billion dollars   yeah yeah i that thats the part of it i couldnt understand i mean   yeah   i i wonder if theres not a little bit of overzealousness there uh you know they say well this one went under because of bad energy loans bad real estate loans and then they go around classifying everybody as bad when in fact there are some very good   yeah   loans out there i mean not all real estate loans are bad you know the greatest majority of them are people who own their homes so you know those arent exactly what youd call bad  i   right no i think that a a typically bad loan is is that the ones that just took place massively in Houston when they put up these huge office buildings and spent   uhhuh yeah that exactly   very large amounts of money and then could simply simply could not rent them out they couldnt even rent them out for expenses it was cheaper to keep them empty   yeah yeah yeah the   than to rent them at twenty percent occupancy   yeah and and thats nothing more than speculation i mean they they   yeah   yeah it it seems that there should have been something in the regulations saying they couldnt do that i know banks cant do it   uhhuh   uh back when i used to play the commodities market i i tried to go to the bank to get a loan to buy gold and silver futures and they wouldnt let me   well i mean just for me to mortgage my to to get a mortgage on my house i mean they invest investigated me personally to the point where i was insulted and i was putting forty thousand dollars down on a hundred and sixty thousand dollar house   yeah yeah   i mean i would have thought gosh were happy to do it just sign here you know but   really   i mean they had forty thousand dollars in equity and i mean they just wanted to see three years of income tax returns and all that bullshit which really sort of disturbed me   and the and and then it yeah yeah and then and then some some rich yoyo walks in there whos buddies with the bank president saying look i want to borrow   right   seven hundred thousand dollars so i can invest in this oil well they say oh sure no problem youre a good customer   yeah yeah   yeah i i uh i run i run a little business on the side out of my home and i tried to uh get set up with my bank to accept MasterCard and Visa   umhum   you would think i was asking for an appointment with the president you know and basically what it came down to is they werent going to let me have it     um   um they frown on home business they uh they they insist that you have a storefront   uh   and thats just ludicrous i mean i mean the way things are going people are more and more working out of their homes i know a lot of people who do lawyers doctors uh architects consultants   yeah uhhuh   they they work in their home theres no reason for them to have an office they they have very little customer contact and when they do they go to the customer   right right   so i mean  you know whats the story on them you know are you going to let them have it well of course theyre going to get it you know all youve got to do is have a nice big bank account balance and theyll give it to you   yeah i uh i also run a little business out of my home on the side whats the nature of yours   uh mail order primarily   uhhuh   me and my uh me and my roomie whos also my partner um well we lump everything under this business i mean we do just about everything hes into the computer end of things he does consulting and graphics design and   uhhuh   oh systems design i mean you name it he does that and then i handle the mail order and whatever else we do we do cat breeding  i mean yeah its all lumped under the business   umhum yeah cat breeding huh uh   um yeah  make a few bucks here and there on that   yeah   but um were were theres several ways of getting set up to take MasterCard and Visa uh theres several banks out there the smaller banks who are trying to break into the market and they will take the risk on a home business um   uhhuh   theres i made i made a few contacts through CompuServe um talking about you know hey were brokers for these banks you know it you dont pay us anything the bank pays us and   uhhuh   of course what youre dealing with is some somewhat higher costs like a two hundred and fifty dollar nonrefundable application fee   right uh wow   so if the bank turns you down well thats it youre out two hundred and fifty bucks   thats not too great   no i im im im leery of it i know thats the way it works um but and as long as you can meet their requirements there theres very little chance theyll turn you down and they do have some requirements like you have to be registered with the State and you have to have   yeah   a business address and you have to have a business phone line and then you have to have a separate line for their equipment that kind of stuff uh but if meet all those chances are theyll approve you so were looking at that   yeah yeah uhhuh   so were looking at that its just its just hard to give somebody two hundred and fifty bucks on a chance you know   yeah i would i would find that uh a little bit disarming   yeah what what business do you do   its a computer business   yeah yeah my uh my roomie is down in Charlotte right now hes got an internship down at IBM   uhhuh   so business has sort of come to a standstill   i see where does does he go to school here   yeah hes at uh hes at NC State   i see okay whats whats his name i might know him   uh Floro Chrisostimo   uhhuh okay i guess i dont   do you by are you by any chance out at the campus   uh no huhuh   oh okay because the last guy i talked to was out on the campus   i see ha   it was how did how did you get involved in this   um ive got a a friend whos in the business who just gave me this application   yeah he he picked this thing up from school and brought it home and i said yeah sure ill do it why not   um   and he signed up for it and then of course he moved off to Charlotte so now im stuck making his calls too      i see     gosh i dont know what i got roped into   ha so uh oh well whatever its five bucks a shot what the heck   yeah yeah what the heck im surely not going to count this as business income     yeah um really well speaking of that i think weve probably given them their moneys worth   oh yeah no doubt about it i i usually go until the the recording comes on   oh i see ive never gone that long thats   have you yeah that it itll cut you in about ten minutes   oh i see   uh they used to it used to say you have exceeded the ten minute recording limit but now they just say uh were sorry our recording capacity is limited today you know a nicer way of saying you talked too long   yeah yeah uhhuh   but anyway if you need to get going well well terminate okay well good talking to you maybe well maybe well chat again   all right byebye   all right later on man bye bye
