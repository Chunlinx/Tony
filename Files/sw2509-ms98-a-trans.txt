        what movies have uh have you seen lately   well the last movie i saw was Ghost i theres a lot out that id like to see i just dont have much opportunity i have a small child and its gets so expensive   right well thats true thats true if you have to get a babysitter and everything else yeah   but you have to either yeah so but uh what have you seen   uh  ive seen Ghost we really enjoyed that i thought that was a good movie   yeah i thought that was pretty good   i thought that was a good movie and uh about a week ago we went out and saw uh Silence of the Lambs   yeah   and i guess im just not smart enough to figure that movie out that was just uh uh        i dont know i really i didnt really enjoy it that much   i have a friend who saw that and told he me said i dont want said dont go see it it because you wont be able to sleep but i dont know from all ive read about it i i i really think id i id like to see it       i think it you know it probably was a good movie i just uh really didnt get into it that much but uh everybody ive talked to has just loved it and they want to go back and see it you know two or three times   yeah really um   but uh theres a lot of little things that go on in the movie that you have to uh really pay attention to uh to get the total gist of it   really yeah      but   well i do i enjoy going to the movies and i tell you ive try to there we have a dollar theater i dont know where do are you in Dallas or   uh yeah in Dallas   okay well i live in Carrollton   okay   and theres a new dollar theater thats real nice and so uh   huh   see i took him and a friend to to see uh Kindergarten Cop a couple of weeks ago   was that a pretty good movie   you know it it was so uninteresting that i dont even remember what it was about   oh really is that really   the the kids seemed to enjoy it and then uh lets see uh before the week before that i took them to see Look Whos Talking Too which was just awful   it was that bad huh oh was it   i mean even the dollar it wasnt even worth a dollar       uh the first one was much much better i in fact i enjoyed enjoyed the first one Look Whos Talking   oh Lord right yeah i i saw the first one and i i thought that was you know pretty humorous   but the second ones just its more it really hardly has anything to do with the kids its more about their relationship and theyre just always fighting and they break up and they you know get back typical you know   i see i see   typical plot   right huh   so but i was real disappointed in that and then Kindergarten Cop like i said i you know i just i dont even remember it  my mind must have just been somewhere else so   dont even remember it right another movie that ive seen that was pretty good was uh Sleeping with the Enemy   oh id like yeah i want to see that one too      that was a good movie that that was one movie that uh i wasnt ready for it to be over with   really   it was        pretty predictable towards the end but uh i still thought it was a good movie   yeah i definitely want to see that have you seen uh The Doors   no i havent no i havent      i havent seen that either i uh when it first came out it was like hey you know ive really got to go see this movie and now that its been out awhile its kind of like well maybe i dont really have to go see it   right right and i havent uh talked to anybody thats seen that i dont know uh what anybodys views are on   yeah dont think i i havent either and its had terrible reviews   oh really   yeah   i see have you seen the movie Flatliners its out on video now   yeah yeah i rented the video i thought that was pretty good   yeah that was uh pretty suspenseful   so my same friend that told me not to go see Silence of the Lambs also told me not to see Flatliners so i dont think i trust his judgment   oh okay so theyve got a theyve got a weak stomach then huh   i dont think i uh i think if uh i enjoyed Flatliners i rented that not to uh just about a week or so ago and i i like Julia Roberts   right right she is a a good actress did you see uh oh that movie with her and Dolly Parton and Steel Magnolias   seems like uh Steel Magnolias yeah i just watched that yesterday or Sunday i just watched that   really i enjoyed that movie i thought that was a good movie   yeah that was pretty good i heard it was a real tearjerker so i was pretty much prepared  and i knew that she i knew that she died so i was prepared for that just i still cried but i was i was prepared for it   prepared i see   oh Lord   and uh it seemed like every time i turn on the movie channel Pretty Woman is on   right   have you seen that that thats a good i think thats just a cute real cute movie   yeah that really is and i didnt think that i was going to enjoy that uh just from what people had told me about it and and i thought well its not going to be that good but i i really did enjoy that   uhhuh yeah i did too   and anymore uh my wife and i are getting bad we we wait until videos come out instead of going to the movie theater   yeah   uh for the very reason you know its just so expensive   well uh yeah with the dollar theater though i its sometimes its cheaper to pay a dollar to see it than to you know to pay it depends on where you rent your videos but   thats true thats true plus a lot of movies you need to sort of see them in a theater you know it just makes them that much better   yeah im glad that im glad that i saw Ghost before it went   right   because its out on video now but its still playing at the dollar theater im glad i got to s ee it there rather its TV just doesnt have the same impact   right right because you can always youll either get interrupted with a telephone call or want to get up and leave and that just doesnt make the movie you know you need to just sit through it and and enjoy it   yeah uh yeah for ones that you want to see again or you know ones that you really werent sure if you wanted to see or not you know   right right that you didnt want to waste the time or the the expensive movie ticket then the videos are worth it   yeah yeah   theres another one i want to see is uh uh Dances with Wolves   i havent seen that and i and i you know it of course won a lot of Academy Awards   right   but ive heard that its real its a long movie   thats what ive heard that uh   like three hours   right   and uh   but uh ive heard the scenery is real good in it yeah   really ive heard a lot of good things about it but ive also heard that it can it becomes slow   oh theres parts in it that dont move yeah   yeah so i dont know you know speaking speaking about making a three hour time commitment  i dont know   i bet thats true   thats right thats all afternoon ill tell you what but uh   so   but uh yeah there are a ton of movies out seems like a lot just uh you know the first three months of this year seemed like theres been a lot of movies come out      i thought i wanted to see the The Marrying Man with uh Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger but then we saw a uh like a preview of it and it looks pretty formula you know   yeah oh really   so oh i dont know now if i want to see it now its like now ill probably wait until its either at the dollar movie or on video   or on the video thats right but   and what else what else is out right now that i want to see   uh lets see there was another movie that i saw a preview to that i wanted to see uh something about cowboys uh uh All My Heroes Are Cowboys or   is that new   yeah its its pretty new uh im trying to think who its got in it   i guess uh uh theres a song by that name i guess but its not new   uh yeah its uh that song that Willie Nelson song is in it   yeah   um but its about this this guy thats a rodeo big rodeo guy and he comes home to his dad   oh okay yeah   and hes i dont know in a rest home or something and then they go off and do something i dont really know what all it was but uh   yeah i think ive seen you know commercials yeah   yeah yeah they sound like thatd be a pretty good Western movie but i i dont know yet uh ill just have to save my money i guess       and splurge a little bit   yeah   but well hey i appreciate the conversation   yeah it was nice talking to you you have a good day bye   okay you have a good day byebye
