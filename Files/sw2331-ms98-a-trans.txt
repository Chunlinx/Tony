                are you a player   uh i like to think i am its its been a while now   is it   yeah ive uh oh just recently i got married and we bought a house were about fifty yards from the golf course but unfortunately the house is taking up my time   um yeah   so its been uh its been almost a year i guess since ive actually uh swung a club for a purpose   yeah i havent i havent played in about two years and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here i work at TI and i played in a tournament out there and i shot a net fifty nine they were kind of little upset   yeah     but i guess i laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits   yeah yeah   i have a hard time inventing shots you know lets go around this tree and you know try a slice through a hook here and i cant do that so i i finally got out and ive been watching quite a few videos i   right right   hadnt been able to play so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while and i i hope im on the right track you know i shot a career low eighty nine so and my handicaps twenty i   yeah thats thats great yeah   i like the   no its uh i could say its been a while for me too i uh ive got my wife motivated about it um   really   and uh i think thats probably going to be one of our next investments is get her get her a set of clubs and uh well get out of the driving range and and get some interest built up and hopefully we can uh we can start in   yeah ive tried to get my wife i bought her a set of clubs four years ago she hasnt even swung them but she wants to get into it now after i came home and won the tournament the other day shes   really well great great thats good   shes ready to get off into it but you know i like i just like getting out being in the outdoors and im a hunter and a fisher anyway but you know i i you know at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf and   yeah same thing here   its not going to cost me an arm and a leg really   right right   and i you know i walk i dont ride so you know i get a little exercise there too so   umhum yeah thats ive got the same attitude i uh i tell you i i started i guess the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now when i was in college   yeah   and uh i took uh took it as a PE course and then kind of left it alone for a while and then finally got got into it when i was while i was still in school   right   since then uh weve made it um as as the friends start getting married and things like that weve made a tradition of uh having a a Thursday or well have have probably like a like a Thursday night bachelor party and a Friday golf day before the wedding   yeah   and uh so it thats back in South Dakota where i grew up and uh so that thats uh thats been my main my main involvement is it seems like i go home and play golf more than i do around here but uh   oh yeah   eventually i get people to come and visit me in Dallas and then ill show them that we can play golf in the middle of winter when we cant do it back home   yeah its pretty nice we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not they were amazed   yeah   you know here it is sixty five degrees were out playing golf and theyre freezing cold back there so   yep yep   but i uh i  i picked it up when i was in high school at on the same as a PE course and then when i got into the service i got into it   oh okay   and then when i come out here i just kind of let it go and then one of one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf i said well yeah you know ive got my clubs but i havent swung them in quite a few years   yeah   and then i got into it and then back out of it and it it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there   yeah thats right   you know i really enjoy it its really nice   oh it is its its a lot of fun especially especially if you can find somebody thats uh thats got the same level of interest that that seems to be the hardest thing well about thats thats thats true of any sport you know if you want to play tennis or   yeah yeah you dont want to go out and get beat to death but   racquetball right and and people dont want to play with somebody that theyre going to beat every time you know and and uh and   no and then you know weve got some guys here theyre you know four and five handicappers and they dont like to play with me because im too slow for them so   umhum right   you know but get somebody around your own handicap and you can just mosey on out for three or four hours and have a good time   thats right yeah   and ive you know ive never yet never yet have i walked up now ive walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with and never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that wouldnt allow me to join their twosome or threesome you know theyre always friendly sure come on out you know and they dont mind if you make a mistake they dont mind saying well you know let me teach tell you how to do that or teach you how to do that or   thats true thats true well   you know its its pretty nice and friendly out there and you cant find that in all sports   that that thats uh yeah thats absolutely right and you can gain a lot of ground doing that too if you   right   you you know you you get stuck you get in a rut if if you do play a lot but you play with the same people you you arent going to learn anything uh after after a short period once you learn everything theyve got to offer then uh   yeah yeah you need to   you know youve basically tapped your resources there   yeah   but uh id id like to uh eventually id like to work work up if if my wife does get interested and and maybe get involved in a league in a in a mixed mixed doubles league or something like that   oh yeah we  we have one down here in the summertime uh it runs from like five oclock to seven thirty or eight oclock you know because it doesnt get dark until nine thirty or ten   umhum right   and we play in the summertime out here we get a mixed league in and thats what im trying to get her ready for its going to start well when we change the time back whenever that is next month i guess   uhhuh   and itll start then and you know we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago and they were just starting to learn and you know they were shooting a hundred a hundred and twenty but they were   sure   you know now theyre down into the hundreds nineties nineties nineties so it wont take her long   right well thats good thats good that sounds like a lot of fun   you know and its something we can do together so well she doesnt do much hunting she could care less about that she does a little fishing but you know golf would give her the exercise shed be outside give her something to do that we both enjoy so   yeah yeah it it sounds like weve got real similar situations uh i i go home uh ive gone home every year now since ive moved to Dallas to to go pheasant hunting and uh   yeah umhum   um the the last time i i took my wife along and uh kind kind of the same situation she sat she sat in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff but   yeah   shell definitely uh shell make the trip for fishing if we if that comes along but uh   yeah all right   its uh thats interesting though   yeah and its you know its a game that you dont  like bowling you know you feel bad if you bowl a hundred but if you shoot a hundred in golf you know you dont have to be an expert to play any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right   umhum thats right umhum   so you know you dont have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all   thats right well yeah thats ive ive kind of formed the attitude that you know if if i could just if i could pick two or three shots out uh out of my game every time and put them together on one hole then i do pretty good and then and   yeah   i keep i keep rationalizing that well you know i i can do it i i just got to do it all at the on the same hole and and then itll get better and you just keep going and in the meantime just enjoy what youre doing and   yeah   it it it really works that way   and when you know when i first got back into it i used to get mad because i knew i could do something and i didnt get it done you know and i just well i need to slice this ball around here i naturally slice anyway   umhum   now you know the ballll go straight and i go  i never broke a club or anything but you know id get upset about it sometimes and now i guess you know being in my forties i just kind of mellowed out a little bit i dont get upset any more so   yeah yeah sure sure   and   yeah thats great   well i enjoyed talking to you   well you bet   i guess ill go back to work   okay sounds like it   all right see you later bud byebye   okay bye
