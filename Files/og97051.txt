promulgated by the Department ofHealth and Human Services Food and Drug Administration FDAentitled Substances Prohibited From Use in Animal Food or FeedAnimal Proteins Prohibited in Ruminant Feed RIN AA Wereceived the rule on June   It was published in the FederalRegister as a final rule on June    Fed Reg FDA is issuing this rule to reduce the risk of an outbreak oftransmissible spongiform encephalopathy TSE in the United StatesIn the United Kingdom one form of TSE bovine spongiformencephalopathy BSE is believed to be linked to cattle feedcontaining rendered protein byproducts from sheep and goatsinfected with scrapie a disease related to BSE FDA suggests theremay be an association between BSE and a form of human TSE known asnew variant CreutzfeldtJakob disease BSE has not been diagnosedin the United States This rule is intended to prevent theestablishment and amplification of BSE in the United States throughfeed and thereby to minimize the risk to animals and humansGAOOGCThis rule amends FDA regulations to provide that animal proteinderived from mammalian tissues for use in ruminant feed is a foodadditive subject to certain provisions in the Federal Food Drugand Cosmetic Act  USC   et seq FDA is taking thisaction because ruminants are being fed protein derived from animalsin which TSE has been found and such proteins may cause TSE inruminantsEnclosed is our assessment of FDAs compliance with theprocedural steps required by section aBi through ivof title  with respect to the rule Our review indicates that FDAcomplied with the applicable

ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED SUBSTANCES PROHIBITED FROM USE INANIMAL FOOD OR FEED ANIMAL PROTEINS PROHIBITED IN RUMINANT FEEDRIN AAi Costbenefit analysisIn the preamble to the rule FDA presents a summary of itseconomic analyses discussing the potential benefits of theproposed rule and the economic impact that could occur as a resultof its implementation Full texts of both the cost analysis and anaddendum were provided to GAO at the time the agency filed the rulewith us In accordance with Executive Order  the analysesdescribe the regulatory options available to reduce the risk of anoutbreak of BSE in the United States and the costs and benefitsassociated with each optionFDA estimates the direct compliance costs of the rule will beabout  million per year and that the initial value of theaffected meat and bone meal will be reduced by  millionannually In contrast nonruminant animal producers may gain up to million in lower feed costs FDA estimates that the aggregatednet annualized costs of the rule accounting for both losses andgains will total  millionThe primary benefit of this rule as described in the economicanalyses is the costs that would be averted by reducing the riskof BSE becoming established and proliferating in the United Statesthrough feed FDA stated that it could not quantify the costs ofall the benefits associated with this rule such as the value ofhuman lives saved or the medical costs that would be avoided bypreventing an outbreak of BSE However it did provide estimates ofsome of the costs that might be incurred if the rule were notimplemented and an outbreak of BSE were to occur in the UnitedStates FDA estimates that costs of  million would be incurredin direct livestock losses due to BSE infection that costs of billion would be incurred slaughtering atrisk cattle culled toprevent BSE spread and that costs of  million would beincurred imposing feed regulations at the time BSE wasdetectedGAOOGCii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act USC    and On January   FDA published a summary of its InitialRegulatory Impact Analysis in the preamble to the proposed rule Fed Reg  at  FDA concluded that the rule will have asignificant impact on a substantial number of small entities Thevast majority of entities involved in ruminant production and meatpreparation are considered small businesses according to sizestandards set by the Small Business Administration The analysisalso discusses the regulatory alternatives FDA considered indrafting the proposed ruleFDA published a summary of its Final Regulatory FlexibilityAnalysis in the preamble to the final rule published on June   Fed Reg  at  In that analysis FDA discussesthe need for the rule the benefits anticipated from theimplementation of the rule and a summary of the impacts of thefinal rule The preamble summarizes the issues raised by the publiccomments to the proposed rule describes the numbers of smallentities affected by the rule and describes the recordkeepingburden of the rule The preamble also describes the sevenalternatives considered by FDA in promulgating this rule and why itbelieves that the alternative selected the mammaliantoruminantprohibitionwith exceptions is the most costeffective regulatoryalternative that meets the objective of the agency FDA also pointsout that it revised the rule in several respects to decrease theburden on small entities in response to comments received fromsmall businessesiii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC  FDA determined that
