          great   um are you what what type of music do you like   uh i like uh probably  cutting edge rock would be the best way to describe it   oh well then im sure were going to have a lot in common  im just joking what exactly is cutting edge rock   good deal   cutting edge rock oh i dont know you got your top forty rock which i just cant stand top forty music the stuff youd see on MTV and VH One and what have you and then theres new music come from weve got a radio station down here that uh   oh really  umhum   started broadcasting about a year ago and theyve uh they play music that you just wouldnt hear on any other radio station more like a college its more like a college station would play   umhum umhum   which we dont have down here but uh its just music by different groups its you know things you wouldnt you wouldnt uh   i see umhum   you wouldnt would never be exposed to   is it music that um like you can understand the words to   yeah most of it   oh okay well the the thing that i hate really is music that um it just seems like instruments playing all at once to five different scores of music do you know what i mean like didnt seem like it was meant what   yeah kind of noise its noise   yeah its noise it just doesnt seem like it was supposed to be played at the same time together or that someone isnt tuned or whatever but um i have to admit i do love top forty and um although i dont watch MTV i do love that type of music but i feel like its the best music that you can sing along to and dance and   well yeah yeah   and um im an aerobics freak so i just uh i love that type of music to do aerobics to and exercise and that sort of thing do you go out to listen to music a lot   do i go out to listen to music well i go to school and work so i dont get too too many opportunities to uh go out and see a a live band although occasionally   umhum dont get much time umhum   ill go downtown they have what they call Deep Ellum down here where a lot of local bands play and ive gone down there a few times   umhum do you play any sort of instrument oh   no im musically destitute       have no talents   oh dont be silly i used to play the piano and i used to play the guitar but then when i moved out you dont get to take the piano with you and uh theres no guitar around so i decided just to turn on the radio and thatll be my musical entertainment from now on   right   but we dont get to go i love concerts if i could i would save my money and just go to concerts but obviously not only is they dont come around Rochester too often but um standing in line for hours on end doesnt really appeal to me either   yeah yeah i used to go i when i first moved to Dallas several years ago ive gone to a few concerts but it just it just gets to be more of a hassle than its worth yeah you get a lot of thirteen and fourteen year olds and its just a crowd of little kids   yeah exactly i know and then by the time you leave you end up like sitting in your car for an hour just to get out of the parking lot   yeah we usually go down and theres a tower that they have downtown you go down have a couple of drinks and wait for traffic to go away   do you have a good um stadium there or or   its its an indoor arena   oh right whats it called   Reunion   oh Reunion no thats not what im thinking of wasnt   theres one theres the Bronco Bowl thats out in Fort Worth though   i dont know what im thinking of   Arlington Stadium   oh   theres several big things down in down here most of the most of the concerts are out at uh Reunion Arena   umhum umhum   and its its okay the the acoustics could be better but like i say i havent been down there to a concert since   yeah   jeez i dont remember who i went to see last   well now you have to like the Beatles and Billy Joel you know uh   i like the Beatles some Billy Joel you know back in high school i guess i was a big Billy Joel fan but   umhum   ive been   sort of grown out of that   well you know i listen to it but i wont go buy it   umhum   ive ive like ive been exposed to so many new and different bands lately just through this new radio station that   umhum   i realize theres just a lot of a lot of things ive i never would have heard or even thought of looking at or listening to   like who are some of those bands what are they called   and oh im trying to think of a good example one that wont get me into too much trouble   who wont get you in too much trouble   um yeah be a bad example but like for example the Violent Violent Femmes theyve been around for a while and theyve just started playing some new music of theirs and it made me go out and buy some and listen to it i wont say i like the whole album really but uh   umhum umhum umhum well you know i was just reading the newspaper and um theres this big thing on Madonnas new movie Truth of Dare have you heard about that   umhum yeah i was reading an article about that yesterday   and um well i havent seen the movie but obviously it looks extremely risque and um they were just mentioning some figures that shes made like in the past year she made thirty nine million dollars and over the past couple of years its totaled almost two hundred million dollars and i mean as much as i like top forty i dont like Madonna i dont like her and i dont like her music and um i just dont like anything about her actually   the only thing i like about Madonna is i think if if i was given a ticket to see her perform i think shed be entertaining to see perform   umhum probably yeah   but i dont i dont really care for her music theres one or two songs that i like you know for a while until they overplayed them to death but uh ive never been a big Madonna fan   umhum right exactly umhum   but i do think if someone gave me a ticket itd be a really entertaining show   yeah thats true   i wouldnt go stand in line or sleep overnight at the   but i know oh God no but to think that shes able to make that much money   yeah   just think of i mean that is what our kids are growing up with right now you know that they that they were talking about how Madonna is becoming a role model for kids   thats crazy   and uh boy its really scary i dont know but i guess i i still go back to the old faithfuls like James Taylor and if i could if i had my choice to sit and listen to um oh i dont know some new group of today or just uh put on a tape of i dont know Carly Simon or whatever thats probably what i would stick to although i do have uh an unending love for fifties music which you probably detest   some no theres some my parents you know i used to listen to the stuff they listen to you know the Guess Who and what have you ive got some of that uh i dont i dont   umhum umhum   i wont say i make tapes to listen to in my car but occasionally i put on LCD and crank it up because i you know stuff i grew up with     umhum umhum yeah   listening to so   umhum   im ive got pretty broad musical tastes i dont really care for gospel and im not a big country fan but   me either   other than that ill listen to just about anything   yeah do you have uh any sort of collection are you like uh you know do you go out and buy a bunch of CDs or tapes or   yeah ive got some ive got i dont know about a hundred hundred and fifteen CDs i suppose   do you really   i just ive got a bunch of the albums but i never play them because CDs have taken over   yeah exactly they really have we were talking about um how the only way to really destroy a CD is to drill a hole through it that you can microwave them and uh i dont know do whatever really it amazes yeah amazing   yeah you can scratch them up pretty good theyll still play   but well it was nice talking to you   yes so go out and play in that sun   yeah right and ill go turn on my James Taylor tape or something  all righty take care byebye   all right   okay bye
