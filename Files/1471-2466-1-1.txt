                    Background        Since the beginning of the acquired immunodeficiency        syndrome AIDS epidemic pulmonary complications have been        major causes of morbidity and mortality in patients with        human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection     In        addition to the common pulmonary diseases affecting        immunocompetent individuals HIV seropositive patients are        prone to other infectious and noninfectious complications        The types of pulmonary complications that develop depend on        the degree of immunosuppression HIV transmission category        and geographic location Antiretroviral therapy and         Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia PCP        prophylaxis have improved the clinical course and outcome        of HIVinfected patients However pulmonary complications        including PCP have remained common            The Pulmonary Complications Intensive Care Unit        Support and Prognostic Factors of Hospitalized Patients        With HIV PIP Study is a singlecenter prospective        observational study designed to describe the types of        pulmonary complications and the role of critical care        support and to determine the prognostic factors of        hospitalized HIVinfected adults Knowledge of the types of        pulmonary complications in patients with HIV infection will        help clinicians to develop better diagnostic and        therapeutic approaches This article describes the        nonbacterial pulmonary complications that were detected at        hospital admission and during hospitalization of         patients                    Material and Methods        This prospective observational study included         consecutive hospital admissions of  adults with HIV        infection The patients were identified from the hospitals        computer system and admission logbooks and by contacting        the case manager for patients with HIV Patients  years        or older with confirmed HIV infection were included in the        study All the patients were treated at the University        Medical Center Jacksonville Florida during the  years        from April   through March   The University        Medical Center is a bed teaching innercity hospital        affiliated with the University of Florida The study was        approved by the Institutional Review Board of the hospital        which waived the need for informed consent        Data were collected on age sex race exposure category        for HIV infection CD lymphocyte count APACHE Acute        Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score        hospital stay and inhospital mortality The investigator        a pulmonologist reviewed all chest radiographs All        nonbacterial pulmonary complications that were diagnosed        during patients hospital stays were noted The        microbiologic cytologic and histologic findings of        expectorated and induced sputum and other samples obtained        by bronchoscopy mediastinoscopy and thoracotomy were        noted        Only confirmed pulmonary complications were included         P carinii  mycobacterial fungal        and viral pulmonary infections were diagnosed by        identifying the organisms in stains or cultures of sputum        bronchial washing bronchoalveolar lavage BAL and lung        tissue Multiple episodes of PCP and mycobacterial        infections were defined by identifying the same organism on        different admissions of the same patient Fungus ball was        diagnosed by the typical chest radiographic finding of a        fungus ball in a preexisting cavity Acute asthma        exacerbation acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive        pulmonary disease COPD and cardiogenic pulmonary edema        were diagnosed by physical findings in the appropriate        clinical setting Pulmonary embolism was documented by        pulmonary angiogram or spiral computed tomography of the        chest Pulmonary contusion was diagnosed by the development        of radiographic densities of the chest following chest        trauma Pulmonary sarcoidosis and malignancies were        diagnosed by bronchoscopy In patients with         Mycobacterium tuberculosis MTB        infection antibiotic susceptibility test results were        reviewed        For the purpose of this study multiple hospital        admissions of the same patient were analyzed independently        of each other StatView  computer software SAS        Institute Inc Cary NC was used for statistical        analysis All means were expressed with their standard        deviations SDs Comparisons between groups were made by        using the Student         t  MannWhitney U   and Fisher        exact tests         P values   were considered        significant Continuity correction was used to determine        the         P values of  tests The        sensitivity specificity and positive and negative        predictive values of lactate dehydrogenase LDH for the        diagnosis of PCP were calculated by using the normal high        serum LDH level for our laboratory of  unitsmL as a        cutoff point                    Results        Demographic characteristics exposure categories CD        lymphocyte count and APACHE II scores of the hospital        admissions are listed in Table  The primary reason for        hospitalization was pulmonary in  of the  hospital        admissions  The nonbacterial pulmonary complications        observed during the study are listed in Table  The median        APACHE II score of patients with PCP MTB and         M avium complex MAC were          and  respectively        PCP was diagnosed in   of the  hospital        admissions  patients Seventeen of the  admissions         during the first year of the study had PCP compared        with  of  admissions  during the second and  of         admissions  during the third period          P   Two episodes of PCP were        diagnosed in  and a single episode in  patients during        the study In the  patients who had  episodes of PCP the        time between the episodes ranged from  to  months        Induced sputum from  hospital admissions and BAL from         hospital admissions were examined for         P carinii by using monoclonal        antibodies The methods used to diagnose PCP are listed in        Table  Seventyseven of the  hospital admissions with        PCP had induced sputum examined for         P carinii   were positive        PCP was diagnosed by BAL in  hospital admissions with        negative findings from induced sputum Induced sputum was        diagnostic of PCP in  patients whose BAL results were        negative         P carinii involved a cervical lymph        node in  patient        Serum LDH was measured in  hospital admissions in        which the primary diagnosis was pneumonia  PCP and         nonPCP Among these  hospital admissions the        sensitivity specificity and negative and positive        predictive values of serum LDH in the diagnosis of PCP were           and  respectively        The initial chest radiograph obtained at hospital        admission showed no infiltrate in  focal infiltrate in         and diffuse infiltrate in  of the  hospital admissions        with PCP The differences in CD lymphocyte count        duration of hospital stay and mortality of patients with        and without PCP are listed in Table  The CD lymphocyte        count of  patients with PCP was  L Pulmonary        mycobacterial coinfection was identified in  of the         hospital admissions with PCP  Cytomegalovirus CMV        was isolated from the BAL of  hospital admissions with        PCP        Mycobacteria were isolated from the respiratory specimen        of  hospital admissions The frequency of acidfast        bacilli AFB smear in culturepositive MTB and MAC        respiratory infection is listed in Table  Multiple        episodes of pulmonary mycobacterial infections were        diagnosed in  patients during the year study         episodes of pulmonary tuberculosis in  patient and         episodes in  patients  episodes of pulmonary MAC in         patients  in  patient and  in  patients and         episodes of pulmonary         M kansasii in  patient The time        between the different episodes ranged from  weeks to         years MTB was isolated from respiratory specimens in         hospital admissions of  patients Thirteen of the         admissions  during the first year of the study had        respiratory MTB infection compared with  of         admissions  during the second and  of  admissions         during the third period          P   All the MTB isolates        were sensitive to isoniazid Rifampin resistance developed        in  patient during the second episode of MTB        infection        MAC was isolated from respiratory specimens in         hospital admissions of  patients Eighteen of the         admissions  during the first year of the study had        respiratory MAC infection compared with  of         admissions  during the second and  of  admissions         during the third period          P   Lung tissue confirming        the diagnosis was obtained in only  of the patients with        MAC         M gordonae was isolated from        respiratory specimens in  hospital admissions of         patients and         M kansasii in  hospital admissions        of  patients Nontuberculous mycobacteria were identified        in  patients        The median CD lymphocyte count in the hospital        admissions with MTB was L compared with L in those        with MAC          P   The initial chest        radiograph at hospital admission showed no infiltrate in         hospital admissions with pulmonary MTB and in  hospital        admissions with pulmonary MAC The extrapulmonary sites        from which MTB and MAC were isolated are listed in Table         The inhospital casefatality rate of hospital admissions        with pulmonary MTB was   of  compared with   of         of those with pulmonary MAC          P          Viral infections were detected in the BAL in  hospital        admissions among  different patients CMV in         respiratory syncytial virus in  herpes simplex virus in         and influenza B virus in  Of the  hospital        admissions with viral infection only  patient who had        CMV died Pulmonary involvement by         Nocardia asteroides was seen in         patients none of whom died Fungus ball was seen on the        chest radiograph of  patients  of whom died Pulmonary        histoplasmosis was diagnosed in a patient of South American        origin who died during hospitalization        Malignancies involving the lungs were detected in         hospital admissions of  different patients  bronchogenic        carcinoma  nonHodgkin lymphoma  Hodgkin lymphoma and         Kaposi sarcoma The  patients with bronchogenic        carcinoma were  and yearold AfricanAmerican men who        smoked cigarettes The risk factor for HIV transmission was        homosexuality in  patient with small cell cancer and        injection drug use in the other patient with squamous cell        cancer Of the  patients with malignancy only  who had        Hodgkin lymphoma died in the hospital All  patients with        pulmonary sarcoidosis were of AfricanAmerican origin and        survived to hospital dismissal Ten patients were        hospitalized for acute asthma attack and all survived to        hospital dismissal Of the patients admitted for        cardiogenic pulmonary edema pulmonary embolism acute        exacerbation of COPD and traumatic pulmonary contusion        only  patient who had cardiogenic pulmonary edema died        before hospital dismissal                    Discussion        This study describes the nonbacterial pulmonary        complications detected among  hospital admissions of         adult patients with HIV infection The study population        consisted predominantly of African Americans with a        significant number of heterosexual and unidentified        transmission categories The HIV transmission category        influences the types of pulmonary complications that        develop in patients with HIV Because homosexuality and        injection drug use are the major HIV transmission        categories in the United States the findings in our study        may not apply to other countries        PCP was the most common nonbacterial pulmonary        complication caused by a single organism in our study        Despite its decline as a result of widespread        antiretroviral therapy and chemoprophylaxis PCP has        remained a common complication in patients with HIV        infection      In a prospective multicenter study of        HIV seropositive patients for  of those with a CD        lymphocyte count  L receiving PCP        chemoprophylaxis the rate of first episode PCP was  per         personyears     Although actual data were not        available high rates of noncompliance with and lack of        access to antiretroviral therapy and chemoprophylaxis were        likely in our study population which included a        significant number of medically underserved patients        without perceived risk for HIV        Previous studies addressed the need for simpler tests        and strategies to identify patients with a high probability        of having PCP to initiate either empiric treatment or        aggressive investigation      These studies reported        that an increase in LDH value had variable specificity and        sensitivity for the diagnosis of PCP HIV seropositive        patients are at increased risk for PCP when their CD        lymphocyte count is  L Similar to the        multicenter study by the Pulmonary Complications of HIV        Infection Study Group      of the patients with PCP        had a CD lymphocyte count  L in the PIP study        The classic chest radiographic findings of patients with        PCP include bilateral diffuse opacities     However        some patients present with unusual chest radiographic        findings      In a multicenter study from the United        States the inhospital mortality rate of hospitalized        patients with cytologically confirmed PCP was             The PIP study showed that PCP is unusual in patients with        normal CD lymphocyte count and serum LDH concentration        can present with atypical chest radiographic findings can        be diagnosed from induced sputum in most of the cases and        is associated with  mortality        In the PIP study of predominantly AfricanAmerican        patients nearly  of the MTB isolates had a negative AFB        smear none of the isolates was isoniazid resistant and         of the admissions with MTB respiratory infection had no        infiltrate on the initial chest radiograph HIVinfected        individuals are highly susceptible to contracting        tuberculous infection and are prone to rapid evolution of        active disease     The rate of tuberculosis is high in        African Americans and in injection drug users            Although the prevalence of a positive AFB smear in patients        with pulmonary MTB is approximately the same in        HIVinfected and noninfected individuals it may decline in        advanced HIVmediated immunosuppression     A previous        study of  HIVinfected adults with pulmonary MTB showed         of them had a normal chest radiograph            The isolation of MAC in BAL or sputum does not        distinguish between disease and colonization Prospective        cohort studies have shown that in  to  of patients        with HIV infection disseminated MAC disease eventually        develops      The risk of disseminated MAC disease        depends on the severity of the immunodeficiency In the PIP        study patients with MAC respiratory isolates had a low CD        lymphocyte count and the majority of them had evidence of        disseminated disease        CMV is the most common opportunistic viral infection in        patients with HIV     Although CMV was isolated from        the BAL of  patients in the PIP study its isolation does        not distinguish between infection and colonization Fungal        infections are common in patients with HIV infection        HIVinfected individuals residing in areas endemic for         Histoplasma capsulatum are at        increased risk for         H capsulatum infection            Histoplasmosis is uncommon in individuals from areas in        which         H capsulatum is nonendemic and        usually represents reactivation     The PIP study was        performed in an area in which         H capsulatum is nonendemic and there        was only  case of pulmonary histoplasmosis in a patient        who had resided in an area endemic for         H capsulatum  Although the lungs are        the primary site of cryptococcal infection pulmonary        disease was believed to be uncommon in patients with AIDS            No pulmonary cryptococcal disease was diagnosed in        the PIP study However a recent review of  autopsies of        HIVinfected patients from the same institution showed        cryptococcal pneumonia to be as frequent as PCP                   In patients with HIV infection about  are expected        to develop a malignancy     The PIP study population        is predominantly African American Blacks with HIV        infection have a lower risk of cancer developing than        nonblacks     Kaposi sarcoma and nonHodgkin lymphoma        are the most common malignancies and they are        epidemiologically linked to HIV Kaposi sarcoma has been        reported in all HIV risk groups However it occurs        predominantly in homosexual and bisexual men     In        the PIP study homosexuality was not a predominant HIV risk        factor and pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma was diagnosed in only         patient        Conflicting evidence links lung cancer with HIV        infection At the beginning of the AIDS epidemic few cases        of bronchogenic carcinoma were reported      Using        the registry of Bellevue Hospital in New York City Chan et        al    showed no link between lung cancer and HIV        infection Another populationbased study from San        Francisco showed no excess of lung cancer among a cohort of        men with AIDS     The Italian Cooperative Study Group        described  cases of HIVassociated lung cancer   in        tobacco smokers     More recent studies have indicated        an increase in incidence of primary lung cancer in patients        with HIV infection      Although there was no case        of adenocarcinoma in the PIP study it is the predominant        cell type of bronchogenic carcinoma in patients with HIV        infection       The Pulmonary Complications of HIV        Infection Study Group has shown upper respiratory infection        and bronchitis to be common in patients with HIV infection            Because the PIP study included only hospitalized        patients minor respiratory problems were likely to have        been ignored        The PIP study has several limitations Some important        data such as smoking history and the use of        chemoprophylaxis and antiretroviral drugs were not        collected No attempt was made to identify patients with        pulmonary hypertension The diagnostic approaches varied        according to the patients primary physicians The        investigators unblinded review of chest radiographs may        have introduced biases into the study Diagnostic        fiberoptic bronchoscopy was performed in only  hospital        admissions and thoracotomy and mediastinoscopy were rarely        required This approach may have led to underdiagnosis of        some of the pulmonary complications Although MAC and CMV        were isolated from the sputum and BAL of many patients the        presence of disease could not be ascertained because        tissues were not available for examination Because the PIP        study was started before highly active antiretroviral        treatment was introduced the findings may not apply        now                    Conclusions        The PIP study describes the nonbacterial pulmonary        complications in  hospital admissions of  patients        with HIV infection The present data confirm previously        described findings addressing these complications                          With the advent of        antiretroviral therapy and chemoprophylaxis against some of        the opportunistic infections the morbidity and mortality        of patients with HIV infection have declined in the last        decade The study showed that PCP is still a frequent        complication despite the availability of chemoprophylaxis        Although pulmonary tissue involvement is not confirmed        most of the patients with MAC isolated from their sputum or        BAL have disseminated disease These findings suggest the        need for more effective preventive measures in similar        patient populations The application of highly active        antiretroviral treatment and the development of more        effective chemoprophylaxis against opportunistic infections        are likely to be associated with changes in the types and        severity of pulmonary complications that we see in these        patients The pulmonary complications are also likely to        vary according to geographic locations HIV risk factor        and severity of immunosuppression To keep up with these        changes and variations we must continue to monitor and to        describe the pulmonary complications that develop in        patients with HIV infection                    Competing interests        None declared
