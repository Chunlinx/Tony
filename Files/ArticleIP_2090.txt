                                 Trumpet Voluntary            Business as usual no longeris enough explains a pressrelease for the big Volunteer Summit officially The Presidents Summitfor Americas Future from April  to April  Of course business as usualhas never been enough and never will be The concept exists only for thepurpose of being declared insufficient            Orgies ofhighmindedness like the Volunteer Summitfour presidents Colin Powell thenetworks celebrities corporations foundations all huffing and puffing inPhiladelphiaare a cheap target for kneejerk iconoclasm In our cultureattitude is easy and sincerity is hard Newsweek s cover story is sodefensive about endorsing the summit and its goalencouraging voluntarism tohelp who else childrenthat you want to reach out pat the author and sayThere there Its OK to want to help children By contrast recyclingthe conceit of Swifts Modest Proposal to eat children would beembarrassmentfree            So let us stipulate that everyone involved in the VolunteerSummit means well President Clinton isnt triangulating Colin Powell isntrunning The expresidents arent looking for attention The corporationsarent looking for a PR fix Let us stipulate furthermore that a little bitof good can outweigh a lot of bullshit and the summit probably nets out as aGood Thing But let us also consider the summits philosophy Distilled fromall the hot air this philosophy has two components  American society shouldpressure its citizens to do more good works for children and in general Thatsocial pressure should be a cooperative project of government employers andthe media  Those good works should involve active personalparticipationnot just giving money            Why tostart is it obviously better to give your time than your money This notioncontradicts one of the basic principles of freemarket economics the divisionand specialization of labor Take an extreme example a successfulbusinesswoman earning  a year Thats about  an hour If hercompany thinks shes worth what shes being paid why should it encourage herto devote several hours a week to say working in a soup kitchen when otherswould gladlygratefullydo that work for far less Why shouldnt she work afew more hours doing what she does best and let the company turn the proceedsover to the soup kitchen Or more realistically why shouldnt she write alarge check and not feel guilty about it Would the soup kitchen really preferan hour of this womans time to  cash            Something like tutoring a highschool studentobviously requires more valuable skills than serving soup does But is itcompassion or arrogance for our executive to assume that her tutoring is worth an hour Because that is exactly what she is assuming when she gives hertime instead of writing a check True the emphasis of the moment seems to beless on specific services than on a kind of semiadoptionmentoring troubledkids acting as a role model and so onand this kind of service is hard tobuy But she has to be pretty confident in her mentoring skills to believe thattheyre worth more than what  an hour could buy for a kid not gym shoesbut professional tutoring and counseling health care etc            Ofcourse this assumes that our executive actually does write that contributioncheck and that she writes it to the soup kitchen or tutoring program and notto her alma mater for a new science lab It also ignores the potential benefitsto her of personal involvement in good works She might quite reasonablyprefer spending a few hours a week tutoring a highschool kid to spending themporing over spreadsheets in her office She might enjoy the moralfrisson  To be less unkind she might well be truly morally enriched bythe experience All of which is fine But it is not costfree If she works inthe soup kitchen rather than donating the cash value of her time this meanspeople are going hungry so that she can be morally uplifted A strange moralcalculus            Gen Powell and the Three TenorsI mean the FourPresidentsinsist that the volunteer ethic is not supposed to be a replacementfor the governments role Clinton in particular loves this sort of thing asa way of achieving a national goal without costing taxpayers any money Butlogically something either is an obligation of society or it isnt And if itis being left to voluntarism that obligation is not being fully met Thatswhy each volunteer makes a difference as we are constantly being toldPerhaps this or that function cannot or should not be provided by thegovernment But to say it is a social obligation that ought to be satisfiedthrough voluntarism is to have it both ways Society accepts theresponsibilityand takes the creditrhetorically while evading theresponsibility in practice            When societys leadingelementsgovernment business media and so onall start singing in unisonits not a pleasing noise The summit itself is an example of the summitsphilosophy about how things ought to work identical and mutually reinforcingmessages from your senator your employer your TV anchorman your ministeryour cereal box your FedEx delivery man  all urging you to sign up and savethe country Basically this is the propaganda machinery of war being revved upin peacetime which is one reason the rhetoric is so overheated and so full ofmartial metaphors Festivities like the Volunteer Summit address a nationalpsychological needfor the rhetoric and rallyinground of wartimeas much asthey do the practical problem that is their alleged subject And the premisethat you must give of your body not just of your money makes voluntarism anideal theme for such an exercise            Its both comic and eerie tosee how easily the free press of a free country can be coopted into thesepseudowars For another recent example see Jacob Weisbergs recent columnabout ABC and the war on drugs Offer them an interview with ColinPowell and they lose all critical perspective In fact a fullpage newspaperad detailing NBCs abject surrender to the hijacking of all its news showstouts two different interviews with the former general One of them isbreathlessly but illogically labeled an exclusive
