                                 The Great Kibbitzer            WINDHAM NEW HAMPSHIREBill Bradley likes to say that his campaign rejectspolitics as usual But out here on the campaign trail its John McCain whois the true radical A day with McCain in New Hampshire is a marathon of candorwithout precedent in modern presidential politics            McCain started the day with a town meeting at a high school in Raymond his  th such event in New Hampshire After speaking he fieldedevery question and comment the audience could muster After that he held apress conference in the snow outside After the press conference he got on hisbus and took more questions from reporters  until the next town meetingwhere he began the cycle all over again McCain talks until your notebook isfull your tape player is out of batteries and your pen is out of ink After acouple of hours every journalist in his entourage has the same enviableproblem too much good material             McCains bull sessions on the Straight Talk Express have become thehottest ticket on the campaign trail this year Today there were dozens morereporters who wanted to kibbitz than there were seats on the bus But otherthan the need to take turns sitting next to him McCainsrelationship with the press remains remarkably similar to the one I wroteabout during his announcement tour last fall Surprisingly the increasedscrutiny and intensity of a closely fought race havent changed the tone orstyle of his campaign It remains lowkey free form and fun as hell            After finishing a town meeting McCain embarks washes his hands withgermkiller and assumes his swivel throne in the front section Reporterscluster around attaching microphones to his lapels and sticking taperecorders and cameras in his face In a flash McCain is off wisecrackingtalking seriously about his campaign and his life engaging in badinage withaides and teasing his goodnatured spouse who sits a couple of seats awaytrying to talk to their daughter back home in Arizona about her lacrosse gameon a cell phone It all feels like a collegiate road trip with running jokescuisine by Dunkin Donuts and the odd unscheduled stop to shop for localhandicrafts Heres a sample of the dialogue             Asked aboutthe recent spate of Bush endorsements including Orrin Hatch McCain says Iwant to say right now Orrin Hatch is off my short list for postmastergeneral              Defendinghis liberalsounding concern about income inequality We know in the innercities and on the Indian Reservations and other places they do not have theopportunity to receive the kind of education and training necessary to givethem the ability to take advantage of this prosperity It seems to me that allof us as Americans whether Republican or Democrat or libertarian or vegetarianshould be interested in addressing that situation             On how muchcoffee he drinks Seven to eight cups a day But sometimes only threefour             In responseto a question about whether his politics have evolved All of us should changeand evolve over time In  I voted against the Martin Luther KingHoliday I ended up being one of those in  who fought hard for recognitionI dont claim not to have evolved as a politician and in my philosophy and myviews I think it would be an incredible waste of time if I hadnt grown andmatured in some of those areas               Jokingabout his marriage Cindy and I are getting divorced The grounds are I foundout she doesnt love me as much as I do            Inevitablyreporters run out real questions and start asking McCain why he likes talkingto them so much Its fun Its intellectually stimulating  he says Someof the last of the Trotskyites have been on this bus Its hard to find themthese days             After thefirst town meetings in Raymond the bus pulls off the road at a shop called theVillage Quilter The McCains go in to chat up the employees and buy ablueandwhite patchwork quilt Back on the bus Cindy McCain passes the quiltaround for reporters to autograph with a magic marker highschool yearbookstyle The McCains plan to have it framed as a souvenir after the campaignHere is what some prominent national reporters wrote on it              Senator You Cindy  Are the greatest  I had the time of my life            Thanks for theStraight Talk            Its been funhanging out with you on your one last mission            From DunkinDonuts to gummy bears its been a memorable journey            Senator yougave new meaning to the term road trip Hope it ends at PennsylvaniaAvenue            Ill never eatanother pinkfrosted donut as long as I live Best of luck            Best of luck no matter what happens its been great            I love theshades Keep talking straight All the best            You sure showyour Trotskyist pals a good time            The lastcomment Ill admit was mine McCains relentless openness certainlyencourages favorable press attention as well as increasing the risk ofgaffes But I dont think that the wish to curry favor explains why McCain haschosen to run his presidential campaign as what one reporter on the busdescribed as a traveling Truman Show I think McCain simply had to find a wayof running for president that he found pleasurable And for whatever reason hefinds nonstop public interaction both stimulating and therapeutic Where theendless schmooze would exhaust another candidate it seems to renew McCainsenergy and keep him sane            In factMcCain doesnt treat reporters so specially His table talk on the bus is notvery much different from the way he conducts his town meetings McCain startsthese events with a comic monologue ramps up to a serious pitch aboutrepudiating the power of the special interests and motivating young people andthen takes questions the floor From time to time he fertilizes the crowd DonRicklesstyle abusing one questioner as ugly and mocking another for hisexpensive sweater sure enough the guy asks him about cutting the capitalgains rate By the time he winds down the civilians are as glutted withaccess as his traveling pressEven the hecklers get their due At an event in high school cafeteria inWindham McCain spots the global warming activists who have been stalking allthe candidates with posters that ask WHATS YOUR PLAN Today some of themare dressed in elaborate costumes that include giant smokestack hats withribbons of flame and smoke spilling out McCain doesnt wait for them tointerrupt him If youre committed enough to wear a funny hat Im committedenough to listen to you he says We had a guy in a shark suit last night
