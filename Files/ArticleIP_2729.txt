                                 Marriage Death and Leo            President Clinton disappearsfrom the tabloids this month as they return to their classic themes lousymarriages loss licentiousness and Leo            TheGlobe  the Star  and the National Enquirer all agree themonth marriage of Titanic director James Cameron andTerminator actress Linda Hamiltonhis fourthis over There appear tobe two reasons  his continuing affair with Titanic actress Suzy Amisand  according to the Globe  Hamiltons realizationalong with thebillion people who watched the Academy Awardsthat hes a jerk Cameron andHamilton were an excouple they have a yearold daughter when they suddenlymarried last year Its usually a bad sign when as the Star reportsyour friends are more surprised by your wedding than by your separation Themarriage permanently unraveled says the Globe  when the director movedout of his marital home a day after he was spotted making out with Amis in hisHumvee Ah romance Most shocking of all is the Enquirer s assertionthat Hamilton did not sign a prenuptial agreement According to theStar  the actress wants half of the directors Titanic earningswhich could be  million            Enough money for a B bomber is also at stake in themarital woes of Home Improvement star Tim Allen Last week the tabs werereporting that if the sitcom star did not go into rehab his wife of  yearsLaura was going to leave him This week he is in rehab and says theStar  his wife wants out anyway For Allens part according to theEnquirer  his stay at Promises rehab center in Malibu where ChristianSlater is another guest has made him realize he wants out If one of them getstheir wish it could make a big dent in what the Star estimates is a million fortune The tabs leave the impression that the Promises counselingsessions are patched directly into their newsrooms According to theEnquirer Allen said part of the reason he is having so many problemsright now is that he is unhappily married The publication says hes asked hiswife not to come for the Saturday family picnic But he has had one specialvisitor says the Star  his lawyer            There aremixed signals about the state of the marriage of newlyweds actress Sharon Stoneand San Francisco Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein According tothe Star  when theyre together in their LA home they make loveincessantly From the kitchen to the garage theyve christened practicallyevery room Maybe a session in the broom closet killed their passion becauseaccording to the Enquirer  the honeymoon is over Stone wants herhusband to give up his job and work in Hollywood but he hates the Hollywoodscene reports the publication He has also fumed to friends Theres no wayI am going to give up my life and become a Hollywood trophy husband  Thishas left some friends with no option but to start taking bets on how long themarriage lasts            The deaths of Linda McCartney and Tammy Wynettewere widely covered by the rest of the press but one of the tabloids specialmissions is to give you celebrities final words and farewells The tabs werecertainly taken in by Paul McCartneys subterfuge about where his wife spenther last days To protect the familys privacy a spokesman told the pressshed died in Santa Barbara Calif when she actually died at a ranch thefamily owns in Arizona So it seems unlikely that at the end of her life shesaid as the Enquirer reports I want to smell the Pacific or that aninsider saw her there            McCartney issued a statementsaying he held his wife in her final moments and told her they were ridinghorses together on a fine spring day Linda closed her eyes and gently slippedaway The Enquirer preferred that her life end this way Lindawhispered to Paul I love you I want you to be brave Well meet again tocontinue our love affair            The Star had its ownversion of her parting words  Give me one last kiss Linda weakly beggedPaul minutes before she closed her eyes for the last time I wont leave youhe whispered Ill always love you  The Star  too had her dying inSanta Barbara although its own reporting turned up a neighbor in Arizona whosaid the family was on its ranch shortly before her death            TheGlobe also fell for the Santa Barbara story and it has the most floriddeathbed scene  There is no woman on earth who can take your place sourcessay a heartbroken Paul McCartney sobbed to his dying wife Linda as he tenderlyclutched her hand I will never marry again  It seems unlikely Linda wouldhave wanted or Paul have made such a promise It is a vow Thomas Jeffersondid make to his dying wife Keeping it may have led to the situation with thatwoman Miss Hemmings            Matrimony was also very much a part of the tabs coverageof the death of country singer Wynette Although she was only  when she diedshe managed to cram in five marriages Her first was to one Euple Byrd whoreports the Star  when she drove off to Nashville to become a singershouted after her Dream on Dream on Years later when Wynette was signingautographs after one of her concerts there was Byrd standing in line Sheturned his picture of her over and signed on the back Dream on Dream onLove Tammy            Thereprobably arent many fifth marriages that last  years but Wynettes did Herlast husband and manager George Richey was more than overcome by her deathAt the funeral home the night after she died reports the Star  He ranup to the casket and tried to lift Tammy right out of it saying Come onhoney Im taking you home  During her funeral the Star says helunged from his front pewand tearfully wrapped his arms around theflowerstrewn casket of his wife All this led a friend to conclude reportsthe Globe  He wont be long behind his beloved Tammy            On the sex front nonpresidential illicitencounters are all the tabs can muster this month The Globe has aninterview with the yearold boy who at age  became the lover of the mostreviled teacher in America Mary Kay LeTourneau LeTourneau  is back injail pregnant a second time by the teenagertheir daughter is now a yearold LeTourneau was the boys teacher in both second and sixth grades and hedescribes their relationship thus When I was six or seven she encouraged mein my drawing  We were friends But my feelings toward Mary became moreromantic when I reached the  th grade Yessiree It seems theteacher could have taught Stone and Bronstein a thing or two The boy describeshow they made love in nearly every room of her home while her husband Stevewas away At night we sometimes had sex outside on the deckand even in aswing hanging from a tree in her front yard            Just whenyou start thinking private school vouchers would curb such situations theGlobe throws you a curve The tabloid interviews yearold actor KirkDouglas who reveals that his English teacher seduced him when he was  MrsLivingston changed my life he says She introduced Douglas not only to sexbut also to poetry He says she gave him the confidence to be an actor and heended up helping to support her at the end of her life            The Star covers George Michaels arrest for exposinghimself in a mens room at Los Angeles Will Rogers Memorial Park as if itswriting a review A close friend of the singer says Hes a performerthrough and through But he needs help The arrestand Michaels subsequentacknowledgment of his homosexualitydid give the Globe the opportunityto print pictures it had from last year of Michael cruising the same park Andboth the Globe and the Enquirer note Rogers most famousquotation I never met a man I didnt like The Enquirer alsohelpfully contacted Earl Goss the father of Michaels current livein loverKenny Goss The heartfelt but likely ineffective reaction from Goss Sr wholives in Coleman Texas was Ive got to talk to Kenny and sort this outKenny needs to come back home to Texas            Finally the tabs deliver ontheir implicit promise to reveal every stray fact about Leonardo DiCaprioSince the actor is only  this means scouring a rather meager past So welearn from the Globe that as a yearold he took classmate CeciliaGarcia out on a date She recalls He looked in my eyes put his arm around meand kissed me on the lips It was a dry short peck and it felt weird PerhapsLeo later had a helpful English teacher According to the account in theStar of more a recent former girlfriend swimsuit model Kristen Zanghes a terrific kisser on top of everything else But what hes not theGlobe documents is a terrific spaghetti eater A series of photos shotthrough a restaurant window shows the Titanic star slurping up hispasta He obviously needs the carbohydrates According to the Star  Leowas romancing model Kate Moss but she dumped him when she learned he hadcheated on her with another model But the Enquirer reported Leo hasturned his interest from model Naomi Campbell to Cuban model Carla Paneka Itsprobably lucky that according to the Enquirer  Leo was rebuffed byBaby Spice Emma Bunton while he was in London All this has led to Leo nowfinding his life a living hell the Enquirer says So he is taking thenext step every young star must take That is talking about going to India towork with Mother Teresas Missionaries of Charity Says Mother Teresassuccessor Sister Nirmala to the Enquirer  Of course we would welcomeLeonardo The door is always open
