Vehicle Engines Air Pollution Control VoluntaryStandards for LightDuty Vehicles Final RulePursuant to section aA of title  United States Codethis is our report on a major rule promulgated by the EnvironmentalProtection Agency EPA entitled New Motor Vehicles and New MotorVehicle Engines Air Pollution Control Voluntary Standards forLightDuty Vehicles Final Rule RIN AF We received therule on May   It was published in the Federal Register as afinal rule on June    Fed Reg The rule provides the main regulatory framework for the NationalLow Emission Vehicle program and creates the means wherebyautomobile and lightduty truck manufacturers can volunteer tocomply with tailpipe standards that are more strict than EPA canmandate at this time The rule is the result of the Ozone TransportCommission OTC recommendation that EPA mandate a low emissionvehicle program based on the California program The OTC consistsof the Governor orGAOOGCdesignee of each state in the Ozone Transport Region OTRthe EPA Administrator or designee the Regional EPA Administratoror designee and an air pollution control official representingeach state Without a national program each of the OTC stateswould adopt a statebystate program mostly based on theCalifornia program unless a state could show it could meet theClean Air Act requirements by some other means The remaining states would be subject to the requirements of the current CleanAir Act standards at least until model year According to EPA these regulations and other actions taken byEPA substantially harmonize federal and California motor vehiclestandards and once a manufacturer opts into the programenforcement would be the same as any other federal motor vehiclepollution control program The quid pro quo for manufacturersopting into the program and subjecting themselves to the mandatesof the regulation is regulatory stability and the need to meet onlyone set of nationwide standards to which vehicles can be designedmanufactured and tested Although the rule is made effective onAugust   because it is voluntary it cannot be implementeduntil the OTC and the manufacturers reach final agreement oncertain remaining issuesEnclosed is our assessment of the EPAs compliance with theprocedural steps required by section aBi through ivof title  with respect to the rule Our review indicates that theEPA complied with the applicable requirementsIf you have any questions about this report please contact AlanZuckerman Assistant General Counsel at   Theofficial responsible for GAO evaluation work

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ENTITLED NEW MOTORVEHICLES AND NEW MOTOR VEHICLE ENGINES AIR POLLUTION CONTROLVOLUNTARY STANDARDS FOR LIGHTDUTY VEHICLES FINAL RULE RINAFiCostbenefit analysisThe EPA included an analysis of the costs and benefits of anational low emission vehicle program with its submission to thisOffice That analysis shows an annual estimated cost vehicle priceincreases of the national program for states other than Californiaof  million as opposed to the  million annual cost for theOTC program alone Although the national program and the OTCprogram would appear to achieve the same pollution reduction in theOTR it would do so at a lower per vehicle cost  per vehiclebased on national sales volumes as opposed to the  per vehiclecost for the sales volumes in the OTR Because the EPA has noauthority to change the current Clean Air Act standards beforemodel year  implementation of the voluntary program willresult in substantially reduced exhaust pollutants nationwideearlier than could otherwise be achieved because of the morestringent standards of this rule The benefits of these reductionsdo not appear to have been monetized in the analysisiiAgency actions relevant to the Regulatory FlexibilityAct  USC    and EPA has concluded that it was not necessary to prepare aregulatory flexibility analysis because the rule only affects motorvehicle manufacturers a group that is not comprised of asubstantial number of small businessesiii Agency actions relevant to sections  of theUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of   USC  Although the rule qualifies as a covered rule within the meaningof the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act Act it appears not toqualify as either a federal intergovernmental mandate or a federalprivate sector mandate because it results in a duty arising fromparticipation in a voluntary Federal program SectionaiII and Aii of the Congressional Budget andImpoundment Control Act of  as added by Pub L  a GAOOGCAs a consequence EPA did not prepare the statements required bythe Act EPA did however prepare a regulatory impact analysiswhich it furnished to this Officeiv Other relevant information or requirements under acts andexecutive
