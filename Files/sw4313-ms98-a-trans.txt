        well i guess uh        start off by saying that i am very much in favor of space travel but i think were going about it all wrong   okay with that   what are your thoughts     uh id like you to expound on that a little bit but uh i am very much in favor of it too and i think that we need to take the approach that so much technology is advanced out of the uh space program that its amazing to me that we dont put more money into it   um       yeah well i am uh kind of disappointed by the way things have been going uh basically weve been out this at this for what about thirty five years   uh well yeah well it depends on what youre saying yeah that i guess   from the first experimental well first experimental vanguard type stuff uh i think that was called the first uh the modified B twos and things like that   umhum okay   that was late fifties i believe so   yeah   and um if you look at the progress that was made at the turn of the century in aviation in a period of thirty five years   umhum   in my assessment it was spectacularly better   well theres no doubt about that   and um i dont think thats because the complexity of the task i think thats because its being handled by bureaucracy now   well you so youre saying you thought uh that well that that implies to me that you would you shouldve felt like it shouldve been uh turned over to a commercial market   well im excited about these fellows who are experimenting commercially im excited about uh the commercial end of satellite operations um there seems to be some spectacular progress happening there and uh   well i think that uh satellites now that is a that is a market where theres a a valid reason for commercial uh when it comes to research im not sure i agree with that   well what would be what would be the reasons for prohibiting commercial research   oh no reasons i just dont think that uh a commercial organization could successfully uh uh make it profitable for them uh i mean  and besides the fact it it also would be extremely limiting as to which research itd be be whichever one happened to bring in the dollar   well they have some organizations out there with some fairly deep pockets and uh i think that   but US is notorious for not spending any money on research uh our commercial market uh our commercial percentages are much lower than uh most most of the other major countries as compared to Japan compared to Germany compared to uh most of the Scandinavian countries   yeah well maybe   the amount of money uh put towards research is is minuscule and had minuscule and has been decreasing over the last few years that so im not so sure that that would be   well you go ahead   i i i agree that the bureaucracy in most cases is something which it should be avoided and we have we have entirely too much government and bureaucracy and it and it seeps over in a lot of different ways   um   now uh in space i dont think you could do it any other way uh well id say fact my opinion is what we ought to do is we ought to get all these all the countries involved in these things and in fact   um go ahead   oh well because i mean we have um resources across the world i mean i i were coming out to a global global economy anyways   umhum   so why arent we using the Japanese technology why arent we using the European technology why arent see   well   see space travel is a world issue its not a US issue and and our our our kind of elitism attitude we had in the sixties about US uh love it or leave it  and you know actually we still have it but that whole     its not as effective now as it was then   right um that the the the concept of beating the other uh countries i think is somewhat     it may be obsolete   yeah its somewhat obsolete  and i think   yeah yeah you know i uh what do you call it um i think its important that it happened i think that ultimately it will happen um i think that the way things are going on now may be an impediment and that by that i mean you know i dont know about im not going to speculate about research across the board but lets suppose um you were the executive of a company that could possibly have benefit from some space research   right   and youre three or four competitors and youre debating whether to um throw a couple of billion dollars into it over the next twenty years   umhum   but its going to be a real long term uh play or whether youre just going to sit back and watch television and um when you look when you see that your primary competitor is um a government with very deep pockets thats going to give the fruits to your competitors the obvious correct decision is to sit back and wait for them to give it to everybody rather than doing it yourself so i think the government getting involved in that tends to reduce the amount of uh private uh effort put into it uh with regard to myself personally i think that if ever if i ever in my lifetime do stand on the surface of the moon its going to be uh on a ship with a Japanese flag   i would say that i have absolutely no
