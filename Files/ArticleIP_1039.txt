                                 Welfare as We Know It            All leading Americanpoliticians including President Clinton and Bob Dole say they want to endsomething called welfare as we know it What is welfare as we know it                           Aidto Families with Dependent Children is the safety net for the poorestAmerican families with children In  AFDC provided cash assistance toabout  million single mothers and their children and about twoparent families through the AFDCUnemployed Parent program AFDC costs thefederal government about  billion a year and states another  billion Addother federal expenditure for AFDC familiesfood stamps  billionMedicaid  billion with another  billion in state spending andhardertocalculate expenditure for housing child care social services andso forthand total federal expenditure for AFDC families exceeds  billion ayear or roughly  percent of federal outlays            A bout one in seven American children is now on AFDCOf the  million children on AFDC in  about  percent wereAfricanAmerican  percent Hispanic and  percent nonHispanic white Thismeans that about four of every  black children were on AFDC as were aboutthree out of  Hispanic children and about  percent of white children                           Nevermarried mothers now head more than half of all AFDC householdsWhen AFDC started in the s twothirds of children on welfare were therebecause of the death or incapacitation of a parent By  children ofdivorced or separated parents accounted for the majority of cases about percent while the children of nevermarried mothers made up another third By children of nevermarried mothers accounted for almost twothirds of thecaseload compared with only  percent for children of divorced or separatedparents and  percent for the children of widows            L ongterm welfare dependency is a serious problemAccording to estimates by the Urban Institutes Ladonna Pavetti  percent ofrecipients at any given time are in the midst of welfare spells that eventuallywill last nine or more years Many mothers mainly divorced ones spend arelatively short period of time on welfareleaving as soon as they can get ajob But many others especially unwed mothers who had their first baby asteens and either dropped out of high school or have little work experiencefind it much more difficult to work their way off welfare Thus the increasingpercentage of nevermarried mothers on welfare probably has increased thelength of time the average welfare mother stays on the rolls See chart            Moreimmigrants are receiving welfare benefits Illegal immigrants are noteligible for AFDC although their USborn children are Legal immigrants areeligible but during their first three years in the country they are presumedto receive some assistance from their sponsor if they have one Immigration hasnot had a big effect on the AFDC caseloads of most communities although it hasa substantial impact in places like California where noncitizens account forabout  percent of all persons on the program Immigration also has increasedfederal spending for the indigent elderly and disabled under the SupplementalSecurity Income Program Between  and  the number of aliens gettingSSI benefits jumped from   percent of recipients to  percent of recipients at a cost of more than  billion a year Eightyfivepercent of these noncitizen recipients come from three areasLatin America percent Asia  percent and the former Soviet Republics percent            Over the last three years  states have begunreforming their welfare programs using waivers from the Clintonadministration The most common provisions allow recipients who go to work orget married to keep more of their earnings or stay on Medicaid longer Othercommon reforms reduce benefits if welfare mothers dont send their children toschool dont keep their childrens immunizations uptodate and so forth Inrecent months however  states have received waivers that go to the veryheart of the program  They end the absolute and unconditionalentitlement to longterm benefits Five more states have similar waiverspending About half completely terminate cash benefits and about half trigger awork requirement after a specific period on the rolls usually  months or months Three others terminate benefits after a period of mandatory workStates making these fundamental changes include some with the largest welfarecaseloads in the countryCalifornia Illinois Ohio and Texas New York willprobably join the list soon In fact time limits already cover over  percentof the nations welfare caseload            Many waiver requestssubmitted by states initially proposed an absolute termination ofbenefits after the time limit So far however the Clinton administrationhas insisted that there be some sort of protection for longterm recipientsThe most common safetynet provisions exempt families from the time limit forpersonal hardship  states inability to find a job  states thecaretakers age  states and the childs age  states            After rising  percentunder George Bush from  to  AFDC caseloads are now decliningBetween January  and February  the number of families on welfarenationwide fell by  percent President Clinton already is claiming creditfor this decline He may be right but the bite of these new rules will not befelt for many years Have recipients really changed their behavior inanticipation of future penalties Another explanation is the stronger labormarket for lowskilled workers The decline in AFDC rolls started in when for example the poverty rate among AfricanAmericans declined from percent to  percent
