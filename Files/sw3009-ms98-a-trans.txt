                okay   well i take it since you selected this topic that you have children   no i dont but i have nine younger brothers and sisters   you dont my goodness       so well i have two daughters and um theyre past this theyve been latchkey children for a while and theyre almost where i can start saying theyre you know young adults so i dont have to worry about child care too much anymore   umhum   um were supposed to discuss what criteria we would ask or expect   uhhuh i would assume its you know if you were looking for a day care center or something like that   well if i were looking   or probably even babysitters would be the same thing   exactly exactly um i think my my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children   yes i would think someone older and i would want to know if theyve had any past experience with children   umhum   umhum   and i think that varies i think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child   yes thats true also   um you know its its its once they get to a certain age its almost more important that its someone that can entertain your child as opposed to someone whos you know really really qualified per se   uhhuh   um but with a with a baby definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency   umhum   so   well um i did a lot of babysitting when i was younger im twenty two now and i did most of my babysitting when i was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen but um the only thing people ever asked me well of course they knew i came from a family with younger kids but they really didnt ask me if i was used to children or not the only other thing they asked me is what i would expect in pay   oh uhhuh uhhuh   you know and um i was pretty surprised because if i had a child and someone would you know i would want to know i personally would ask for people that that person has babysit for before   well i my experience i babysit a lot also at when i grew up and um coming from you know that background and the background as a parent now i think the reason that people dont ask a whole lot of questions is a a lot of times babysitters i know i did this with my children its you get somebody where you kind of know the family already   umhum   and that gives you so much basic knowledge that you dont ask a whole lot of questions   umhum   because because i had three younger brothers and sisters myself so they they thought okay she knows how to how to treat children   yes well see when um i first got my babysitting my first babysitting job was pretty strange um this lady saw us at church and she was a you you know she was a younger lady she didnt really know my mom she knew my mom by name and that was it and um she knew that i was one of the oldest girls in my family so she just asked my mom if i could babysit   uhhuh uhhuh   you know she really didnt know my name or anything you know and i thought that was pretty strange you know and she had two children one was still in diapers when i started babysitting   wow   so um she pretty much you know just assumed that i would know you know how to handle them so i want you know i enjoy kids and i get along with them very well so theres no problem but uh with todays world and the kids today uh theres no way i cant say that i would just ask someone you know that i didnt know like that to babysit   oh i agree with you but there again she she you know she knew knew of your family and she and she met in a safe setting such as church   umhum thats true umhum   so she was going on those two instincts just the same i know myself i never and i was very very protective on who babysit my children   oh i would be too   and and in it it really shocked me because just about six months ago someone came to my front door rang the doorbell she had just moved in the neighborhood she had her daughter with her and the daughter was oh about a second grader and she was actively looking for people who would babysit her child   oh my   and i thought well she doesnt know me or my children from anything and   huhuh   it was i was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go babysit for her because i didnt know her  then she was reluctant of letting strangers into her house   umhum yes uhhuh   so i mean people are so different   oh i know um well i really i obviously youve never had to look for a day care or anything   well i did i did have um my my child uh in a day care for just a short time and when my oldest was about two and a half and i worked just a parttime job and   uhhuh   uh in in those situations um what i did is id i went in and you know i made a few phone calls i went in and visited i asked questions such as how they would discipline a child um that was a concern with me um you know   uhhuh   you you learn a lot by going in there and they explain they explain to you you know what their day consists of and what their general rules are and um thats you know thats as much as i know you probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers   umhum   you know that have done this over and over again but i   well   go ahead   how did you stumble upon the day care center did you just look it up in a phone book or what was it   um i think lots of people lot i think i went by location for one thing i think most people do that i think you start out with the criteria of   umhum   you know do i know of anything or do i know anyone who has their child in a day care and   yeah most i would say most people would probably go by word of mouth   right right and then you know i mean even at that you have to consider the logistics of it you know i mean youre not going to take your child south of town if you work north   uhhuh yes exactly   you even if thats the best one in the whole wide world   umhum   so there there are just so many considerations   umhum then again did um money come into play with it at all   oh money is always a factor in my life definitely  ive never you know ive never had the luxury of not having that be a factor um         even in something as important as day care i know if i didnt have that stipulation i would have done things differently   uhhuh   you know um Montessori school would be something that i would have pursued but thats always a little bit more expensive than what i could look at   uhhuh   um and i was very very fortunate in that i didnt have to do that on a fulltime basis   yes   so and and then when you get you know when you get into the fulltime basis day care
