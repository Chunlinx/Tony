          well hi Bob   hi   hi um my lawn and garden well that thats quite a topic because uh basically my husband takes care of it   um   um but what hes done is hes done a raised garden in the back yard because that we dont have dirt around here you understand that the its its sludge its its mud its cruddy   yeah right right yeah thats the   so you know instead of uh trying to break every rototiller that we ever rented um weve just decided to do the raised garden and it works out great he just built like a twelve by eight box   yeah   out of um lumber thats you know the Wolmanized lumber and its i guess its maybe oh say eighteen inches wide so it makes a really nice box set that on top of the dirt   umhum   and then worked and worked and worked with the soil i mean bag after bag from Wolfe Nursery to uh fill it up   right   but over the years it has produced some of the best vegetables and garden um you know type things that   umhum   boy its been really great and right now we have tomatoes out there and weve got you know have eggplant were growing corn corn grows great here so um we really enjoy that a lot   yeah oh thats good uh yeah well its uh so far as vegetable gardening is concerned it has been uh many years since ive tried any of that uh i we did have uh weve been in our house uh where were located now for about fifteen years   oh   and about uh eight nine about nine years ago i guess we put a swimming pool in our backyard which means we dont have a backyard anymore       uh so our our gardening is pretty much uh limited to plants uh you know shrubs and and trees that that kind of gardening   right   uh i in the years that i did have vegetable gardens there were you know there were times when i had really good gardens and there were times when they just they werent very good at all and i guess uh the soil and the and the bugs together   its  its amazing they come up well someone told me they they come in the in the uh packs you know the seed packages thats where the bugs come from     sort of umhum yeah i wouldnt doubt that uh i always like to try to grow squash and uh the squash bugs would would just go crazy     yeah oh those oh yeah weve given up on those ourselves   and uh and in in my experience with tomatoes was that if i got tomatoes at all they usually got uh sun blisters you know or or it would rain on them and they would bust open you know when the heat hit them   yeah i guess weve got an early early grow variety or something like that and theyre just now you know starting to turn red so before hopefully before all this heat hits   but uh yeah but uh but there were you know there were years uh we i grew uh the little plum salad type tomatoes uh quite a bit and had real good luck with those   well have some tomatoes uhhuh   uh one year at at a the house we lived in before which was also here in Richardson uh we grew okra and i i picked okra up until almost Christmas   i know what you mean green peppers grow like crazy too around here   yeah and uh and i still i still occasionally will grow uh jalapeno peppers uh we we like jalapenos and they they grow real well too now you can just stick one of those anywhere   right yeah definitely right  right   uh one of the things that were doing talking about uh about lawns and shrubs uh we have a live oak tree in our front yard   umhum   and we just have more trouble getting grass to grow underneath that   yeah   and were in the process or at least in the planning stage of of putting in a bed around that oak tree   i think thatd be really pretty really nice   uh right yeah were going to just have a ground you know put ground cover and and maybe you know maybe a few low plants under there   i think i think that Asian jasmine just is so aggressive itll take no time at all to surround that tree and probably your house and your back yard and your pool  the way it goes   right    and uh right   right we uh uh uh we uh brought some plants out were from both from East Texas and we brought some plants in from there and uh one one of the things that we brought uh unintentionally was uh violets   oh oh   which is like almost like a ground cover and they really spread they really spread out and grow uh pretty rapidly when they you know when theyre growing well   oh oh that would be a good idea   but uh but they uh they are i guess uh not an annual but a they they volunteer to come back every year but they do die off during the winter ive forgotten what the term is for that   yeah   but uh but they do die back during the winter so that you know they are not really very satisfactory for a you know for a full ground cover because of that   yeah well that you know one project were looking at is were building a deck out back and we want to put a tree in and weve been looking around and maybe you could you know suggest something but   but uh   um the tree that weve sort of you know come upon is a Bradford pear and we wanted it for shade and we wanted it for you know for the leaf and um thats   umhum    yeah um i i dont im not familiar with that pear tree uh but its a non bearing pear is that right yeah   you know right it does its yeah its ornamental   uh and then the uh of course the leaves drop off during the winter right so   right thats true   yeah we have uh weve had real good luck with uh and again these are like volunteer trees that we transplanted from east Texas but weve got a couple uh well we did buy one though we have a couple of red bud trees   oh red bud   and uh weve got one of those on our patio uh weve got a lot of rock and and around in our one area of our patio and we brought a a red bud tree in and it has done very well it has a a a little larger leaf than uh maybe even than a pear tree i know its got larger leaves than a plum tree has   umhum   the uh the leaves are probably uh oh four inches or so in diameter and uh you know makes a pretty good uh tree it   that would be a great shade tree then   it it has uh of course during the early spring it has the red you know the red flowers that are really pretty   umhum   uh the only problem wit h it is it does have a seed pod uh you know a little its a little flat bean type seed pod that uh will drop off you know uh when uh when they start drying out so theres a little bit of clean up work for that   um but as long as you mow the grass around well you said it was around rocks but   yeah yeah always its uh with with our in our case uh its fairly close to our swimming pool   oh   and so the uh the flowers uh uh blow in there they dont drop in but they blow into the swimming pool so theres a good a good bit of cleanup you know in the swimming pool from that but its you know its not too bad even at that so   well thats just in the springtime too isnt it   right and uh but uh y eah we weve really enjoyed that uh the live oak tree that we have uh is in the front and of course the live oak is uh its susceptible to bending by the wind it it it leans away from the predominant wind direction   oh   and i think i think youll find that uh we also have an apple tree uh in our side yard and it does the same thing the the southwesternly winds southwesternly winds which are predominant you know during the growing season make both of those trees lean       toward the northeast   yeah   and uh so its but thats uh the live oak tree thats youll find that uh pretty much anywhere that there are if theres a grove of live oaks growing theyre going to be leaning away from the you know the direction of the wind   oh thats interesting get to know all these things   uh if you if you go down along the uh Texas coast there a lot of them grow you know down there and youll see them and therell just be like twenty five or thirty of them growing real close together and theyll all every one of them be leaning away from water away from the from the water mostly   leaning away from well thats interesting yeah i know that um weve done some other things with the grass and trying to   yeah     you know get the right combination of grass here   right the uh   because its   what kind of grasses are you growing   well we see  ours was a model house so when they set it up they had like these cement walkways across the front yard   umhum yeah   and they had planted bermuda and then when they took the cement walkways out they stuck in um what what is that Saint Augustine stuff   Saint Augustine right   and i am a transplant here from the north myself and so when i saw that Saint Augustine i said oh weeds and i spent i mean weeks just pulling it up bag by bag   hm   until i went to the nursery one day and found out they were selling it by plugs you know and i could have made some money on all those big huge black bags of stuff id thrown out so were trying to um   right yeah   after after this winter we had a lot of winter kill and hopefully you know some of the Bermuda will take over and because i really like that grass   right yeah what you what you will find uh with the Saint Augustine grass is its very susceptible to both diseases and to grub worms   yeah that yeah the grubs   you know uh the the grub worm is the larva of the uh June beetle   umhum   the June bug beetle and uh the grub worms uh in the late spring uh the the beetles come in and and they lay their eggs in the grass and then the grub worms come out in the larva stage and they eat the grass off at the roots they eat the roots of the grass off   right   and uh we we had Saint Augustine uh in uh our yard before i mean before we the house we were in before and one year all of the Saint Augustine in our backyard died
