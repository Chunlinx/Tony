        lets see i know       i can guess i know what the rules are in Washington DC   no handguns are permitted in DC at all   but on the other hand in in uh Virginia its supposed to be close to wide open right   umhum uh sort of yeah i live in Virginia i dont i work in DC   so im uh and im well ill give you a clue ive if if guns caused crime there would be a lot of crime in Virginia and not much in DC       but uh   so how does that rate you in the uh the scale that theyve given us   on a scale i guess im about a nine and a half so ive lets see so ten means what ten means no controls and one means uh     one means total restriction   one means total restrictions i guess im im about uh yeah ive im between nine and a half and ten im im not saying no control but uh   nine and a half   but uh   are you an NRA member   yes i have been since uh       you know its its one of those things where they say uh that youre biased youre uh youre youre uh   right this is a rather a interesting   youre a member and so then the question comes up uh well if you really believed in it why wouldnt you be a member   right   but anyway i uh   hm   lets see okay now so you tell me where you are in the scale then   i fall i fall i fall smack dab in the middle yeah um   youre about a five you think sometimes its right and sometimes its wrong huh   exactly i mean im originally from New York   it   so   well its i know it can be uh it can be kind of scary the idea of just everybody wandering around with uh uh you know absolute no limits or anything like that on the other hand the truth is that all the bad guys let me put this way all the guys that im scared of already have it   right already have them or can get them if they want them   and uh and uh uh when John Lennon got uh nailed   right   shot  i should say       uh one of the some some of my friends were saying you know thats another argument for gun control i said oh yeah he should have lived in in uh he should of have lived in in uh Ireland where they have a total ban you know in northern Ireland yeah that   well i mean the same thing went everyone everyone uses England as an example saying oh well you know there theres no one has guns in England and look at the crime rate there its so much lower   but   but   the reason when i say i was really talking about northern Ireland you know because in northern Ireland there is a lot of crime and its totally banned   right right   and uh the uh the uh how do i say this the uh the thing that i have noticed with uh this topic is that that i know some very intelligent people and i i say well heres a little brochure why dont you read this and see what it says i dont want to read that okay and uh   umhum   where as im the other way ill read i can read about when i say im the other way thats not to say im open minded uh as much as i think i am       but ill read anything   and uh try and and pick it apart so uh lets see what was the other thing i was going to say uh now my earlier statement about if if they caused crime then Virginia should have a lot of them should have a lot of crime uh i dont know that that kind of reflects my my feeling about it because you notice the states where they claim all of these things are coming from they dont have a very high crime rate   right well i mean look at DC i mean youre talking youre talking about a district where handguns are illegal to be have to have at all and its also the murder capital of the country   and yeah yeah well the the the thing that i see is its not the availability because availability is you know cocaine is is is outlawed too but   right exactly   but but its the uh its the nature and and my feeling if you go back to England uh England is one of those places where they have relatively low rates but also the rates of other crimes are lower   right   and the other thing that happens is they also have the ability to stop you and say uh mister you look like a pickpocket would you please empty your pockets   crime umhum   and if you try that here in the States i mean you could unload four four pounds of dynamite and uh youd walk because they theyre not allowed to ask you   theyre not allowed to do that right   so its its kind of like uh dandelions i dont know if you have any if do you own a house   uh no   well anyway if you had a lawn   what okay   uh uh if you if youve ever had a lawn   i get the point yes ive had a lawn before   if youve ever had a lawn uh and somebody says uh wait till the place is full of dandelions and then go try and and pull the heads off as fast as you can youd be pulling heads off all day you know of of dandelions   right   and whereas in England where they come up they come up to a kid and they say uh you look like youve got a problem and he says i dont no i dont and then they say well uh lets go they can even go to your apartment and uh force you to open your apartment and anything they find in there is used as evidence so the result is that uh   right
