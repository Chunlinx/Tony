DearPrudence                                                      My significant otheris driving me berserk He changes religious beliefs like some people changeclothes This might be only peculiar and therefore tolerable but he expectsme to accompany him as well as get into the philosophy of the moment I reallydo not have time for this and to be truthful do not share his passion forreligious theory I gave it a try but can no longer play along How would yourecommend I deal with this And him                                       Pulling My Hair Out in Chicago                        Dear Pull            Your trendy friend sounds like a handful If youare interested in maintaining the relationship you need to spell out thatlovers need not share every interest and that his searching for new beliefsystems is particularly tiring for you            It would be helpful ifyou had a religion that you started with and said you wished to retain butfailing that tell the theologian that you are making a new beginning that hehas your blessings pardon the expression to pursue the religion of his choice alone If he throws it up to you that you used to go to all the variousservices with him tell him that was Zen this is now            Prudie individually                                             DearPrudie                                                      My wife of eightyears is starting to make me wonder if she is mature enough to even be marriedShe spends more time with her girlfriends most of whom are from high schoolthan she does with me We have no children I wind up doing many things aloneon weekends and in the evenings because she always has plans with the girlsMy wish is to make this marriage work because I love my wife but I am feelinglike second fiddle to a gang of girls Any ideas                                       Stumped                        Dear Stump            Do you know the saying Were all grownups hereWell that seems not to be the case in your life Your wife sounds immature tothe max Prudie is at a disadvantage however not knowing the details and thedynamics of your marriage            Just regarding thecomplaint about reliance on girlfriends though Prudie suggests you have aloooong and serious hearttoheart with your wife outlining your disturbancewith her choices Ask if she wishes to be married Ask if she has complaintsabout you  If she is willing a couples therapist might be helpful Oneway or the other you have to resolve the situation            Prudie amicably                                             DearPrudence                                                      My father was married once before my mother andhas three children from his earlier marriage I am  and my stepbrothers arein their late s All three are intelligent two are lawyers one has an MBAbut have never found themselves in stable situations All three have beenbankrupt at one point during the past three years All three apportion a greatdeal of guilt to my father who did not win custody of them when they wereyounger Their mother was not a good one and I recognize that they haveemotional scars However my father never fails to bail them out of a financialcrisis While my father has done well he is by no means wealthy I know he hasdipped into his retirement fund several times to help my siblings out                                       What bothers me isthat while my childhood was far more normal I demonstrate moreresponsibility in my financial obligations school loans etc than my eldersiblings and frankly would be embarrassed to ask my father for money becauseI couldnt get a handle on life My father came from a poor family and I wouldlike him to enjoy his retirement Is it appropriate for me to say anything tohim regarding this matter I do love my elder sibs but feel they are exploitingmy father with guilt                                       Concerned in DC                        Dear Con            It sounds as though you have your fatherswellbeing at heart so you might gently engage him in a conversation aboutyour concerns Do articulate that you do not feel competitive with yourhalfbrothers and try to bring up the question of making reparations out ofguilt Also mention that bailing out these boys may not be in their bestinterests He cannot help but be touched if you tell him of your concerns forhis comfortable retirement He may be amenable to what you have to sayor hemay not Once youve brought the subject up however know that you can take itno further In the end it is his money  and his guilt            It is admirable that youregard responsibility in a different way than the three boys you write aboutIt is interesting too that the two lawyers and the MBA display financialincompetence Prudie recommends by the way that you not bring up this subjectwith your brothers That way lies fireworks            Prudie gingerly                                             DearPrudie                                                      This is going back abit but I was struck by the letter from  As a psychology professor aprevious psych major and an avocational singer I agree with your advice toGo for it but think theres yet another option that Carpe should considerbefore running away from home or from college Since Carpe is already enrolledin college why not take a minor in music or even double major in psychologyand music Surely Mom and Dad cant object to that but more important Carpehas this wonderful opportunity to increase her musical skills develop hertalent and make important connections that could lead to jobs Why not takethe four years to do all that and then run away to pursue her dreams fullyprepared                                       Sincerely                                       One Who Has Her Singing Dream and Her Psychology Job                        Dear One            Why not indeed Whatyou suggest is very sound advice and Prudie thanks you for being a Prudie            Prudie rationally
