        all right i guess this is a great time to talk about fitness with everybody and their New Years resolutions and going out and getting their recor regular exercise program um do you recor exercise regularly     yeah uh uh yes i do uh   and tell me about that if you would   well unfortunately i have a cholesterol problem and uh i for a long time i did aerobics   uhhuh yes   but a couple of years ago my uh doctor says no dont do aerobics any more ride the stationary bicycle so that thats what i do for thirty minutes a day i average six days a week     wow well thats great thats fantastic do you have that set up where you can uh listen to some music or read a book or you just uh go   yeah oh definitely oh definitely uh its its boring   well good  so youre good youre using it yes  because you dont see a whole lot on a stationary bike   no no uh and i i also belong to uh the Texas Club and uh so some days i uh i go over there and i work out with the the Nautilus weights   yeah oh okay umhum   well uh my goal is uh three days a week but usually it boils down to about one day a week   yes yes   uh do you have a regular regimen   well youve got me at a disadvantage i do not have a regular regiment i do exercise periodically but its whenever i have the time i uh i have a problem in that i dont make the time and i i understand the importance of it and in fact when i was in high school and college i was   umhum umhum   on all sorts of athletic teams and and regular programs but since ive gotten into a new job and into my uh career   umhum   and into a young family time seems to escape me right now but uh one thing that i really enjoy   um   yeah   is that uh i have bicycles and i have two older boys that they like to ride bicycles with me and we ride as a family   umhum umhum umhum umhum yeah oh thats wonderful   and you know uh i actually live in Plano but im working here in Dallas and they have some excellent bike paths   um   where you can go and ride for miles and miles and days and days and not see the same scenery twice which is really fun   um umhum oh yeah   and uh one thing that ive been doing also is that mind you its not regularly but uh i like to go out and go jogging and i do that and the boys get on their bikes and uh we we   umhum umhum   they ride along and i jog along and its a nice time to spend some some time with the boys too so im trying to coordinate   umhum   you know my family time in conjunction with my exercise time exercise program and uh we really seem to enjoy that   oh yeah thats extremely important   and uh there theres a couple of reasons for that is my boys are very sports minded even at their young age and uh one of them s in soccer and the other one just loves to do it   umhum umhum umhum   and so we get out and and do this and it i found out that its very helpful to them also in my oldest boys soccer league that uh he doesnt seem to run out of breath as much as the other boys do and   umhum   he can stay in longer   oh yeah   and uh and uh so i i dont have a a regular one but i i really would like to set my priorities straight i guess and and set aside time to do that   umhum   i thought of different things i thought about going at the same time every day in the morning if i am generally uh getting up and heading off to work around six or six thirty   umhum   which means id have to get up way early in the morning in the wee hours of the morning to do that and uh ive also tried to set aside time in the afternoon or evening   yeah   but uh things generally pop up that precru preclude me from from doing that so i just need to get into a habit   umhum yeah theres a a program on in the afternoons on channel two at four oclock do you have a VCR   umhum uh yes i do   uh you might record it and play it later now its just uh oh stretch and tone its not aerobics   umhum oh okay   uh but its called body electric and its a a lady broadcasting from Florida and uh its for thirty minutes it comes on uh   umhum   five days a week and uh it it its a really good supplement to your bike riding   well great umhum   uh it helps with flexibility and uh for uh for some of the exercises she uses three pound weights   oh okay   but uh shes not a a a great weight person but uh sometimes for the uh upper arms and deltoids and   well   uh back muscles she uses these three pound weights   umhum umhum   so     well thats thats good thats one thing that id and the weights id kind of like to get away from because in high school and college i lifted an awful lot of weights and that immediately   uhhuh
