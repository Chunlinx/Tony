              there you go   umhum   well well Jean the subject is uh jury trials and should the jury recommend uh sentencing   uhhuh   uh now my personal opinion uh i dont know uh uh here lately it seems well up until a few years ago i guess there there was uh there just too many liberals about and permitting too many oh they just broaden the the human rights in to to cover just about everybody everybody and i dont think uh   umhum   those guilty of committing capital crimes should be uh permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned loose on parole its just not right   umhum i think i agree with that very much i do you   and therefore i think juries should be able to recommend sentencing   i do you think a lot of people when they are listening to a trial put themselves in a position like that and say i would never do something like that and its hard for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done   uh yes very possibly so many of us have led led sheltered lives that uh when we go into a sit in on a a a jury ive never done it myself   umhum umhum i never have either   unfortunately i wish i could have   uhhuh uh is there a reason why you have never   ive just never been called up   uhhuh my husband works as a policeman so i always assumed that that was why i was never called uhhuh   well now thats possible but uh i was called up as an an alternate once but i never made it to the jury   uhhuh uhhuh uh do they have such a thing now as a six man jury   not that i know of   somebody told me the other day that there is what what they call a six man jury and i had never heard of such thing and i wondered if it was true   uhhuh uh ive never heard of it   i never had either but i just wondered uh another question was uh should a criminal case uh should the jury be unanimous on their decision and that i wasnt sure on either whether it should be unanimous or not   uh well there again uh i suppose it should be   that would mean they all would have to decide   exactly exactly   one way or the other   is it guilt or innocence but then again so many times uh you get one or two holdouts and and it permits the criminals to get a retrial   uhhuh umhum yeah yeah   and now that thats not too bad in this sense because you might get someone in their thats a victim of circumstances i mean thats happened   umhum umhum umhum   and uh giving them another another another trial might give them additional time to uh prove their innocence   bring some of these things out umhum   yes uh we cant overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials   uh apparently there are i i i since my husband worked as a policeman i cant believe there are very many people that come to trial that have are not guilty of something some part of whatever theyre accused of i have i still have a little bit of a problem with that   hum umhum   uh but i would suppose there are circumstances youre in the wrong place at the right time or know the person wrong person at the right time   oh thats it and you just might resemble somebody   umhum   uh out here in Texas we had a a a a great miscarriage of justice here it was finally after nine years it was finally uh uh uh taken care of we had a a a black man was accused simply because he resembled uh someone who stuck who who held up a uh a a Eleven i think it was   umhum ah umhum umhum umhum   and even though he had witnesses that said that uh he was at work and he had all sorts of of a uh character witnesses and whatnot   they still found him guilty   they they found him guilty   when people said he was at work   well they said it was that this happened during lunch time and he could have disappeared uh gotten away at lunch time and uh committed the robbery   uhhuh well uhhuh yeah   but after nine years well as a matter of fact they made a TV show about it after nine years they finally uh came up with evidence and proved to prove that he was innocent   uhhuh oh for heavens sake so theres nine years of that mans life gone umhum   exactly now that just was not fair   no huhuh yeah i guess thats where a lot of the problem lies were we try bend over backwards protecting the guilty people the ones that are on trial   so yes unfortunately thats what happens   and yeah and we often forget about the one that the injustice has been done to because i bet they still say our system is the best in the world   well its not the uh uh its its its not the best system but its the best one in the world   yeah its the best one that exists i guess so   uhhuh and unfortunately we just have to put up with a lot of things and they they trying to solve them and everything and but uh oh i dont know i think the Supreme Court   umhum   well im im im still rankled about their decision to permit burning of the flag   oh i think a lot of people are i think theyve lost sight of some things that are very important to our country   well it the the uh the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech not freedom of action   umhum yeah yeah   and uh uh oh that just rankles me no i swear if i ever saw somebody that   umhum   uh burning burning a flag id id try to kill them i would   that bad huh  i wouldnt like it but i dont know if id go that far   well i happen to be a flag freak i served i was in the service i was in Korea   uhhuh uhhuh   and uh well i saw what the red in the flag represents   yeah well i think pride in our country and our flag is is so important its important in so many facets of our life   umhum   and uh i i i feel like if they dont people dont like what our flag stands for theyre welcome to go some place else exactly   yeah see what they   theres nobody holding them here   see what how they like it under another flag   right theyd soon be back im sure   umhum   yeah   well Jean we seem to be of of uh uh the same uh uh opinions here i hope they get something out of this   umhum yeah i dont know about the judge making the decision if thats do you think thats good you know like if a jury   oh passing sentence well uh uh yes   uhhuh   yes but i i think the jury should be able to recommend   make a recommendation do they sometimes make a recommendation thats what i was thinking they they sometimes do   yes oh yes yes uh i dont know if thats a regular procedure or what   um umhum   but uh i know im always hearing that uh well the jury came in with a guilty guilty verdict and they recommended uh twenty years or something   and they recommend some yeah and then the judge has the final decision on what does really happen   yes   yeah   of course uh now the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence uh they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five   umhum well i think thats where a lot of people think boy theyre getting put away for a long time but actually their chance course when a lot of times when they come up for a parole theyre denied it depends on you know what theyre what theyd been guilty of and   umhum   and a lot of different things i guess   yeah but too many times they they are permitted permitted to go out on parole and   umhum a lot slip through the the protective whatever they have to do and and there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again   yes they just go out and repeat their crimes   umhum umhum   well there well they say after after three offenses why its automatically life in prison but i think they ought to make it two offenses   umhum umhum i always thought there was there was wrong it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody it seemed like there sometimes theres not a good the balance isnt right it doesnt make sense   umhum uh yeah very true well here again now there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so so frequently   umhum umhum   uh race or nationality even   umhum yeah so   but uh like you said its uh its its its not the best system but its the best one weve got   yeah right so lets put up with it i guess improve it if we can if we ever get a chance so   umhum sure enough   so   Jean its been awful nice talking to you   well its been nice talking to you Jack and uh i hope you have a real good day and week   well lets hope neither one of us ever have to run into this this uh with subject weve been discussing take care now bye   i hope not  you too byebye
