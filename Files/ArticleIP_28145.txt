                                  Was Bob a God            Americansat least those who own stockhave notonly endorsed the infallibility of the markets they have also endorsed theinfallibility of the people who watch over those markets Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan was long ago elevated to divinity And TreasurySecretary Robert Rubin who announced his resignation today has joinedGreenspan in the pantheon of Money Gods There are no atheists in bullmarkets            For the past few years but especially since rumorsof his departure began circulating this spring Rubin has been bathing in mediaslobber He has been credited with eliminating the deficit captaining the USeconomy through seven fat years vanquishing the Asian financial crisistransmuting base metals into gold and generally doing eight impossible thingsbefore breakfast            Does Rubin deserve this sanctification Is therein fact anything wrong with Bob            As with GreenspanRubins godliness rests on a foundation of genuine accomplishment In Rubin was one of several Clinton advisers who urged deficit reduction ratherthan economic stimulus This tightfistedness set the table for the currentboom leading to low interest rates job growth the Wall Street explosionetc Since then Rubins cautious advice has helped ensure that theadministration did nothing to screw up the prosperity Rubin lobbied for NAFTAand GATT His friendly relations with Greenspana dramatic contrast to theBush administrations squabbling with the Fedhas soothed bankers andinvestors His deft manipulation of the debt ceiling during the government shutdown prevented a US default and guaranteed that the politicalwar between the president and the Republican Congress would not derail thethriving economy            And as a conservative Wall Street veteran in a White Houseof Democratic political operatives Rubin brought market credibility to theClinton administration reassuring the New York money folks that Washingtonwould not go loopy on them Perhaps the most compelling evidence of Rubinsaccomplishment may be perversely Wall Streets yawn at his resignation TheDow dropped more than  points on the news then gained most of it backwithin the hour This is testament to Wall Streets faith that Rubin has beenso successful that the White House wont dare change his promarketpolicies            But Rubins deificationis not simply the result of having done a good job Who hasnt done agood job during the past few years His reputation depends on style as much assubstance In a Republican administration Rubin would be another gray suitanother dull rich guy moonlighting as a politician But Rubin has been blessedwith a boss and colleagues who make him look good by comparison Clinton isemotional loud chaotic horny and enveloped by Monica sleaze Rubin isascetic controlled rational quiet and untouched by any of the zillionClinton scandals During Flytrap and since Rubins chilliness has been awelcome adult relief from the childish president            In a more democratic Democratic administration Rubinswealthestimated at  million or morewould have made him suspect Butamong the Clintonians it has burnished him He seems the Cincinnatus ofWashington Unlike the political types around him he has proved himself inanother arena He doesnt need the power and prestige of Washington and feelsno compulsion to claw his way up This is rare among DC pols Having beenassigned the role of the Amateur Politician Rubin seems pure next to thesleazy pros He is not of course an amateur Click for an example            Rubin has another rarequality He does not seek press coverage and when he is covered he speakswith blandness in order not to make news This silence impresses thosewho cover him Compare the medias worshipful treatment of Rubin with its scornof publicityseekers such as Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo or TreasurySecretarydesignate Larry Summers Rubins longtime deputy Rubins reticenceas well as his praise of underlings and colleagues has earned him an enormousthough not fully deserved reputation for humility This humility stuff isnonsense says a former White House colleague of Rubins He does not need toelbow others out of the way and brag but its not because hes humble Itsbecause he is totally confident            Rubin subtly enhances his own reputation for perfection bytalking frequently about his imperfections In interviews he repeatedlyemphasizes the uncertainty of his job He describes to reporters how he focuseson weighing and reweighing percentages until he makes the best possibledecision in ambiguous circumstances This is a fine way to make decisions asRubin has proved but it is an equally good way to protect your image If adecision turns out well its because you calculated it would If it turns outbadly its not your fault You made the most rational choice you could            Rubin agnostics will beglad to learn that there are two weak spots in his record He arrived inWashington as a supposed champion of the poor He was expected to use hisposition as head of the National Economic Council and later as treasurysecretary to redirect federal resources toward inner cities and the underclassBut Rubins cautiousness has got the better of him Although he stronglydisagreed with the welfare reform bill he didnt battle hard to preventClinton from signing it And instead of lobbying for largescale antipovertyor urban revival programs Rubin settled for minigovernment small efforts toprod banks to extend credit in troubled neighborhoods microloan programs toencourage entrepreneurship among the poor In Rubins defense his stewardshipof the economy has done more to help the poor than any federal grant programcould have            The secretary has also been excessively obeisant to WallStreet Though Rubin has bucked Wall Street by opposing a capitalgains taxcut he comes from Wall Street and most of his closest friends and advisersare Wall Streeters and he generally heeds the street During the globalfinancial crisis Rubin has halfheartedly warned Americans not to investcavalierly in weak foreign economies but anytime foolhardy American investorshave been threatened Rubin has rushed to save them During the Asia Russiaand Brazil crises Rubin constructed bailout deals that benefited outsidecreditors above all He insists he was not trying to help Wall StreetAccording to Rubins logic safeguarding investors in these troubled economiesprevents contagion from spreading If American investors thought they weregoing to lose the billions they had unwisely put in Korea they might pull outof Latin America Eastern Europe or the rest of Asia            But many economists especially nonAmericanscomplain that Rubin has been far too obliging toward his old colleagues andindifferent to the poor Russians and bankrupted Koreans damaged by hisdecisions After all when Wall Streeters say today that the Asia crisis isover what they mean is that American exposure is over The economies of Asiaare still a mess Rubins relief for Americans has encouraged a moralhazardan inducement for people to speculate excessively because they knowthe United States will rescue them            The regulatory capture of Rubin by Wall Street hasnot only benefited Wall Street it has also polished Rubins reputation WhenRubin makes decisions that aid Wall Street analysts and traders reciprocate inthe financial media telling CNBC the Wall Street Journal Bloomberget al just how wise the good secretary is Rubin himself probably does notcare about such back scratching but it is a lesson that heirapparent Summersan eager press hound has surely absorbed Be nice to Wall Street and perhapsyou can be a money god too
