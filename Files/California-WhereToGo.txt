Where to GoMany Californians would like to divide their state into two new states Northern and Southern Californiacorresponding to what they believe to be two distinct frames of mind as represented by San Francisco and Los Angeles In fact you will find a little bit of bothSan Franciscos sophistication and Los Angeles sunny crazinessall over the placeOur journey begins with San Francisco and its nearby attractions and works its way down the coast to Los Angeles and San Diego before heading inland to the mountains and deserts of the Sierra Nevada and Death Valley You can turn this itinerary upside down if you prefer but either way you should also consider making an excursion to Las Vegas Californias favorite outofstate playgroundYou can get to almost all these places by train or bus and air travel is quite cheap However the car is king and its difficult to enjoy the full scope of this vast and varied landscape without driving San Francisco is unusual for California in that it is a walkers town with buses and cable cars to help you up and down the hills Los Angeles is undeniably car country though it is trying to alleviate its congestion and pollution by building a lightrail network Outoftown attractions such as the national parks and especially Death Valley are most easily reached by car although once there its more rewarding to leave your vehicle behind and explore on footSan FranciscoSan Franciscans are quite unashamedly in love with their town Its natural setting nestled in the hills around the bay makes the city uncommonly cozy the zip in the air is invigorating and even the fog that rolls in off the ocean seems more romantic than chilling If you have a car one way to begin your visit is to travel along Mile Drive which provides a comprehensive tour of the main sights Youll need to use a good map as the blue signposts with a white seagull in the center can be difficult to locate Stop off at Twin Peaks the road to get there starts near the southern end of Market Street for an excellent panoramic view of the city and the bay then park the car put on a pair of comfortable walking shoes and take to the citys firstclass public transport system see page  Start at the bridge The city has more than one but the one is of course the Golden Gate Bridge The name Golden Gate was given to the citys harbor entrance in  by Captain John Frmont but the milewide channel lay unspanned until the bridge a masterpiece of engineering by Joseph Strauss was completed in  At  ft  m it was the worlds longest single span until New Yorks Verrazano Narrows Bridge surpassed it in  but few would deny that it remains the most beautiful suspension bridge in the world It took four years and  million to build more than  million vehicles now cross over the span every year You can take a bus to the bridge entrance and then walk acrossits just as exciting an urban adventure as climbing up the Eiffel Tower or the Empire State Building The bridge trembles underneath your feet and the lampposts rattle as the wind whistles through swooping cables But dont worrythe ft m high towers are well embedded in earthquakeproof foundationsVisible in the distance is the San FranciscoOakland Bay Bridge known locally as just the Bay Bridge This silvergray structure swings across to Oakland via two suspension spans a cantilever span and a tunnel through Treasure Island Its the bridge youll take to go to Berkeley see page  and is one of the routes to the wine country of Napa and Sonoma see page Beneath the south end of the Golden Gate is Fort Point National Historic Site the site of the brick fort built in  to protect the entrance to the harbor You can now watch surfers brave the waves here The fort lies within the grounds of the acre hectare Presidio a former army

the many other exhibits of the National Maritime Museum The museum can be reached from downtown by way of the PowellHyde cable car lineThe other main cable car route the PowellMason line terminates at one of San Franciscosand Californiasmost popular sights Fishermans Wharf Geared more today toward tourists than fishing the area offers a dozen or more seafood restaurants as well as garish knickknack shops and sweatshirt emporiums Seafood stands line the wharfsidethough the fish is very likely to be importedand there are two shopping centers Ghirardelli Square a converted redbrick former chocolate factory there are good free concerts summer weekends and The Cannery once a fruitprocessing plant The ferry to Alcatraz leaves from Pier  at the east end of the wharf Pier  consists of two levels of openair shopping and snacking an arcade and of course the famous sea lions who lounge and argue on platforms all day long to the delight of the crowds Just follow the barking noisesAlcatrazOf the many cruises you can take on San Francisco Bay the most entertaining is a trip to the abandoned prison island of Alcatraz The name is a distortion of the Spanish Isla de Alcatraces Pelican Island National Park Rangers offer informative and witty selfguided audio tours around the former home of Al Capone as well as other convicts such as Robert Stroud the famous Birdman of AlcatrazA acre hectare rock with no cultivable soil all the earth and water for the shrubs and trees here had to be shipped in by the US Army for whom it had been a disciplinary barracks until  Separated from mainland San Francisco by  miles  km of treacherous icecold water haunted by sharks and dangerous currents it was the ideal location for Americas most notorious federal penitentiary However it proved enormously expensive to run and was closed down in You will see what maximum security minimum privilege meant for Alcatrazs  inmates each one alone in a tiny cell with three minute recreation periods each day There were luxurieshot showers so that inmates would be unable to acclimatize themselves to cold water and survive the chilly waters of San Francisco Bay as well as remarkably good food One inmate returning for the guided toursurprisingly some do out of nostalgiasaid the food was better than he had eaten in many San Francisco hotels The prisoners named the cell rows after elegant streets of America such as New Yorks Park Avenue LAs Sunset Boulevard and Michigan Avenue in Chicago The gangster Al Capones cell was on B Block nd tier number The HillsThere are around  of them and theyre steepits been said that if you get tired walking around San Francisco you can just lean against itbut you dont have to tackle them all on foot A tour of Nob Hill from California Street or by PowellHyde cable car Telegraph Hill bus and Russian Hill PowellHyde cable car will give you a good sense of the past and present splendors of San Franciscos more wealthy residentsThe cable cars were

can loiter with appropriate decorum in the areas two landmark hotels the Fairmont and the Mark Hopkins both at the top of California Street The panoramic view from the bars in the Crown Room or the Top of the Mark is well worth the stiff price of a drinkGrace Cathedral at the corner of California and Jones is not an especially happy neoGothic effort but it is worth a look in passing for its Ghiberti doorsbronze reproductions of the Baptistery East Doors in Florencea remarkable example of San Franciscos continuing romance with Europe You may also be impressed by the  stainedglass windows dedicated to Human Endeavor depicting among others Albert Einstein Frank Lloyd Wright Franklin D Roosevelt and Henry FordRussian Hill is less opulent than Nob Hill but the gardens and immaculate little cottages of this fashionable residential area make it far more appealing The rollercoaster dips and crests of the citys hills breaking up the monotony of the standard grid system of streets reach a crazy climax on Lombard Street between Hyde and Leavenworth After youve negotiated all eight hairpin bends lined with gardens of hydrangeas youre not going to quibble about the claim that its the crookedest street in the world Two blocks south is Filbert Street boasting the steepest slopea stomachchurning  percent gradient with no bendsIt is worth climbing to the top of Telegraph Hill for

corner of Montgomery and Washington Its one of those buildings that purists start off hating because it clashes with the spirit of San Francisco and then defend in the next generation as the very epitome of its age If its time for lunch or dinner head to Belden Alley between Bush Pine Kearny and Montgomery streets where youll find an entire block of excellent restaurants all with outdoor seatingWalk the few blocks uphill to Grant Street and suddenly youre in Chinatown This compact district has evolved from a ghetto imposed on the Chinese in the th century by the citys founders into a
