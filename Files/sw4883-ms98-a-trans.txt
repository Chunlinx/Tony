        i know uh product quality first of all i have had to return products uh generally those products that i bought mail order recently     umhum   well i think that you know brand name products that weve become familiar with have in most cases you know gotten better i think that we have a problem in this country with consumer protection laws and the lack thereof   yeah i agree with you yeah   for for a lot of things theres some real junky mail order places out there um that weve ordered from in the past and ended up with not what we expected and having an absolute nightmare especially in dealing with a mail order in trying to return a product and get satisfaction i it it seems like every time i turn around i have to write one of my world famous complaint letters to try and resolve these situations with these kinds of mail order places   yeah   uh but you know generally speaking i think products in most cases have gotten better than they were in the in the past   yeah yeah i agree with you there yeah um usually i think its its not even the manufacturer so much as its where you yes well like like where with you buy your stuff i guess a lot of your stuff mail order but if you buy it like if you go to like a uh a retail place like i dont know uh uh uh Silo or one of these  you know theyre usually the ones that are giving you the you know they give you a hard time   yeah oh yeah im not happy at all with Silo i  we have every time you look around and there theres a price thats better somewhere else i theres a lot of ripoffs out there uh even in  parts of the retail uh community as far as uh you know they there seems to be this real lack of ability in dealing well with customer service   right   with and product support for a lot of these products i remembered when i you know certain product names where youd get the product and immediately theres a problem with it and it needs to be upgraded and suddenly its your responsibility to pay all of this money to have it done when it was their fault to begin with   right yeah yeah   that that really irks me and i you know im not use to that and with technology you know ive had some answering machines here die very quickly yet other brand names you know Panasonic and that that little that i can drop on the floor and they still work   yeah   it you you really these days because we dont everythings been deregulated we dont seem to care as much about consumer protection if you arent ultrawise uh in shopping and looking for products youre in real trouble   uh yeah i agree with you   i mean you have to have your consumer reports you got to have um you know David Horowitz and and all these things its just to buy something i mean the the amount of money you have to spend on some of this high technology   yeah     today and then you have these brand names that attempt to mimic the the these brand names that we know   right   and then youre youre if youre not informed as a consumer you end up with absolute junk   yeah its its true thats happened to me im i mean ive gone uh when when Walkmans first came out uh i i think i had i bought two when they first came out i just a radio one and then i had a radio and a cassette one and or just the cassette one     umhum   and uh the one was Panasonic and the other one was like not even a brand name but those both lasted me for like three years and then i mean then within the past year and a half two years ive probably gone through about six of them     yeah   you know and and i really dont think im abusive or any  im not you know   well yeah they do they wear out i weve just had an RCA television that we bought two years ago go up and just decide  im not working anymore and you know before you buy TV its like ten fifteen years   theyre just uhhuh   yeah yeah   but now i mean two years were having trouble excuse me     yeah yeah i mean thats really um       its its  its even with cars now too i mean it it in every area in every any kind of product     oh yeah i mean we have a Buick uh eighty five Park Avenue that you know once you past the three year point everything just started falling apart   yeah   and and by the time were done i mean we couldve bought a whole new car  for the amount of money   yeah its yeah its true sad but its yeah you know and uh how about these places where you go like out in Silo i think its Silo no uh there is a store uh The Appliance Store i dont i dont think i think their local is just uh western Pennsylvania but uh whenever you go there they try to sell you the insurance you know   oh yes   you know where you want to extend your warranty of course im i know other places do this too you know     oh yeah the the worst value is because if something goes wrong its generally in the first thirty or sixty days that you own it   right   oh they do that on VCR and its high pressure i mean its like well you know you must be stupid if youre not going to buy this  why   right yeah yeah they really try to you know tack on another fifty sixty dollars   we have
