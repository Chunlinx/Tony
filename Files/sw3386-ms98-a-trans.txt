            well Sid have you established what kind of requirements youre looking for for your next vehicle   well i dont know if i really have  a a lot of uh requirements uh i guess i look at uh getting the best deal uh       as as my main objectives normally whoever is willing to deal and and give me a good price   okay well i i tend to be more methodical i guess uh i determine first of all what im gonna use the vehicle for whether its going to be primarily as a family mover or as a a personal mover uh where its gonna be driven you know what types of uh driving im going to be doing on it primarily highway or or local mileage more often and uh hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that i tend to drive cars for about ten years at a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles   umhum   so im im real picky if if if youre gonna keep something that long  you know you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that youre youre gonna like for a long time   yeah i dont know ive had pretty good luck you know even if if you take any car and and you care for it well enough uh youre gonna get some good life out of it uh i my Oldsmobile right now that i have uh is getting near eighty thousand and still in pretty good shape uh there was a flaw in there where a where a head gasket bolt broke and it cost me some bucks to to fix that but that was you know something that was unforeseen but i still think i can im gonna get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it   sure well it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways a also then   well i i drive like the song says the little old lady but uh but not from Pasadena       but uh yeah i i baby them ah as much as i possibly can its a pretty big expense nowadays uh and i guess i like to take care of it uh so i dont have to buy one too often   thats true uh do you have more than one one than one vehicle in your fleet uh do you have a family fleet or   yeah i i i got an old uh seventy six uh Grand Fury that uh doesnt wanna die on me so i i just keep running the thing dont wanna sell it or get rid of it until it it quits but it just doesnt seem to want to ill probably have uh three four hundred thousand before it wants to die   well that may be they Chrysler made some really good old engines back then like the the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine   its got the big three sixty in there gas guzzler but it runs good   yeah at the moment ive got a Cadillac Cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a uh reasonably new Plymouth Voyager its only a a couple of years old but thats the second one of of those that weve had thats the the family travel vehicle you know not only does it do all the the uh carpooling around during the week but its also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in i think that what im getting ready to get next is probably a Suburban unless they drastically change the the vehicle a lot uh im just getting tired of when i do get hung up in traffic not being able to determine what the problem is and and come to some resolution of whether its better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit that kind of stuff just because i cant see   yeah   yeah im too my Cimarron is just so small and so low to the ground that i cant see past any vehicle thats in front of me   yeah yeah well i im considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle uh i just have so many hauling projects a lot of times and uh uh id like to just start doing some uh uh carpentry uh type work around and i just feel that
