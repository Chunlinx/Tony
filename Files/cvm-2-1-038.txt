                    Full text        The disappointingly slow progress in developing        effective therapies for ischemic stroke has led to a        reevaluation of the strategies for stroke drug development        and the methods used in clinical trials Magnetic resonance        imaging MRI techniques have been proposed and have begun        to be used in stroke trials as a means of optimizing        patient selection and as a direct measure of the effect of        treatments on the brain        One objective in all clinical trials is the selection of        a sample that is sufficiently homogeneous to reduce the        statistical variance of the data and thereby optimize the        sensitivity of the design to detecting a therapeutic        response while remaining representative of the population        of interest Ischemic stroke trials have traditionally        sought to limit the range of disease studied according to        one or more of several dimensions such as clinical        severity at the time of enrollment exclusion of        nonischemic causes for the clinical syndrome lesion        location and vascular territory stroke mechanism and        comorbidities These dimensions have been assessed in the        modern era of stroke clinical trials by clinical criteria        at the bedside usually aided by the exclusion of cerebral        hemorrhage or other nonischemic pathology by noncontrast        computed tomography CT scan as the only imaging tool        required Except for the trials of intravenous recombinant        tissueplasminogen activator rtPA in the treatment of        ischemic stroke within the first  h   this traditional        approach has lead to no approved therapies for stroke and        has lead to a great degree of pessimism with regard to        thrombolysis beyond  h and with regard to the concept of        neuroprotection in stroke        Because several imaging modalities may provide more        accurate and specific information than a clinical        assessment and a normal CT scan it has been proposed that        positive imaging diagnoses would improve patient selection        toward the goal of a more optimal target sample for stroke        clinical trials a sample selected based on an imaging        diagnosis of a pathology that the drug is hypothesized to        treat for example an arterial occlusion or perfusion        defect for thrombolytic drugs This principle has been        supported by the results of the intraarterial        prourokinase stroke study PROACT II   Prior attempts        to prove the efficacy of thrombolysis initiated between         and  h from onset without a positive diagnosis of arterial        occlusion or perfusion defect have not been successful            Patients in PROACT II   however were selected        based on evidence of arterial occlusions at the M or M        levels of the middle cerebral artery by conventional        arteriography and a significant clinical benefit was        observed when thrombolysis was initiated up to  h from        symptom onset median time to treat  h Whereas trials        of intravenous IV thrombolysis between  and  h in a        general sample of ischemic stroke patients were not        positive selection of the optimal subgroup by imaging        diagnosis of the appropriate arterial lesion was an        effective strategy in this time period for PROACT II This        study contradicted the increasingly promoted hypothesis        that treatment of stroke by thrombolysis or any therapy        beyond  h would not be successful Selection of the        optimal target population by angiography led to slower        recruitment and a more expensive trial but to a successful        result The results of that trial suggested that a more        prolonged study duration increased expense and potential        delay in treatment to complete a screening test may be        justified by the greater chance of demonstrating        therapeutic success using a more homogeneous and rational        selection of patients        The appeal of MRI methods is that whereas the standard        CT examination of acute ischemic stroke will typically        appear normal in the first hours after stroke onset the        methods of magnetic resonance angiography perfusion        weighted imaging PWI and diffusion weighted imaging        DWI provide information on arterial patency tissue blood        flow and parenchymal injury from the earliest times after        onset of ischemic symptoms in a brief noninvasive        examination DWI Fig  detects tissue injury within        minutes of ischemia has high sensitivity and specificity        for the diagnosis of ischemic stroke and permits        measurement of lesion volumes that correlate with clinical        severity and prognosis         If        untreated the lesion seen with DWI typically enlarges over        hours to days and will progress to infarction PWI depicts        focal cerebral ischemia The volume of ischemic tissue seen        with PWI in the majority of cases is greater than the        region of parenchymal injury evident on DWI and this        diffusionperfusion mismatch is considered to be a marker        of the ischemic penumbra Fig  the tissue at greatest        risk for infarct progression                  Furthermore increasing theoretical experimental        and clinical evidence suggests that MRI using magnetic        susceptibility weighted pulse sequences may be sensitive to        the early detection of hemorrhage     Although        prospective comparisons of MRI and CT for sensitivity to        hemorrhage detection have yet to be reported the proper        acquisition and interpretation of MRI can eliminate the        need for a screening CT scan and regain some of the time        spent on adding a MRI examination to a screening        evaluation The target pathology revealed by MRI also        represents the biological marker of the disease that can        serve as a surrogate measure for assessing the effects of a        therapy        Three potential uses of MRI in clinical trials have been        proposed patient selection proof of pharmacologic        principle and as an outcome measure        In using MRI as a selection criterion in patient        selection Table  the goal would be a sample based on a        positive imaging diagnosis of a pathology rationally linked        to the drugs mechanisms of action Requiring a positive        diagnosis of acute ischemic injury by DWI would ideally        assure that no patients with diagnoses mimicking stroke are        included in the sample a desirable objective unachievable        in trials using bedside impression and normal CT as the        basis of inclusion The goal of imagebased patient        selection is to narrow the range of patient        characteristics leading to a more homogeneous sample        reducing withingroup variance and increasing the        statistical power of the experimental design to demonstrate        efficacy Optimal patient selection would be based on        positive imaging evidence of the ischemic pathology that        the therapy has been developed to treat The simplest use        as an inclusion criterion would include the presence of a        lesion on DWI to increase the diagnostic certainty of        ischemic stroke The optimal target of therapy for        reperfusion therapies would be patients with evidence of an        arterial occlusion or hypoperfusion Fig            Optimal selection of patients for neuroprotective drugs        would be acute lesions involving the cerebral cortex and        with a larger region of hypoperfusion  the        diffusionperfusion mismatch indicative of tissue at risk        for infarction Fig and Table  Patients might also be        excluded from the trial at screening if subacute or chronic        lesions are found that may confound measurements of lesion        volumes or clinical severity as outcome variables Because        of a relatively large error of measurement associated with        small lesions   lesions larger than a minimum volume        eg  cm  may be desirable Furthermore an upper limit        of lesion volume at enrollment would permit an opportunity        for lesion growth and may better differentiate the effect        on lesion size of an effective treatment from placebo        Selection of patients by DWI is also optimally suited for        using the lesion volume change as a direct measure of the        neuroprotective effect of the drug        The proof of pharmacological principle uses MRI as a        marker of response to therapy replicating the preclinical        experiment in patients Before an experimental stroke        therapy is brought from the laboratory to clinical trial        it is necessary to demonstrate that the treatment causes        reduction in lesion volume in experimental models The        fundamental premise of drug discovery and development in        acute stroke is that treatments that reduce lesion size are        those most likely to lead to clinical benefit In clinical        trial programs that depend solely on clinical endpoints as        indices of benefit drugs may be brought to phase III        testing  costing several years and tens of millions of        dollars  without the slightest evidence that the drug will        have the therapeutic effect observed in the experimental        model Only a safe and acceptable dose must be demonstrated        by the end of phase II The question of whether the        treatment causes reduction of lesion volume however may        be answerable in the study of  patients in phase II        whereas  times as many patients are typically tested in        phase III studies to evaluate the treatment with clinical        endpoints A phase II MRI endpoint trial to replicate the        preclinical experiment in a patient population may thus be        a rational and costeffective basis of deciding whether to        proceed with phase III testing A positive lesion outcome        study in late phase II would be supportive of the decision        to proceed with phase III trials        MRI measurements have proven to be a marker of clinical        severity measured by stroke scales      and        changes in lesion volume over time are associated with        change in clinical severity Table    The exact        sample size that is required for detecting the effect of        lesion volume change with MRI will depend on many factors        in the design of a trial The citicoline MRI trial          with approximately  evaluable patients per group        approached but did not reach significance Estimates based        on that study indicate that  patients per treatment arm        would have been sufficient to demonstrate a neuroprotective        effect in patients a sample size compatible with typical        phase II sample sizes That study and natural history        samples suggest that a sample size of  should be        sufficient to demonstrate a neuroprotective effect on        lesion volume in patients        It is proposed that a treatment emergent advantage on a        measure of lesion volume is a surrogate of clinical benefit        for stroke trials Table  The rationale for the use of        lesion volume as a surrogate measure in stroke trials may        be summarized as follows Lesion volume reduction in animal        models is both necessary and sufficient evidence of        neuroprotection The clinical benefit for neuroprotective        drugs is mediated through a reduction in cell death and        brain tissue loss Drugs that reduce infarct volume are        those most likely to cause clinical benefit        The factors required for validation of MRI as a        surrogate marker are summarized in Table  The first four        of these requirements have been met see earlier discussion        and cited references Confirmation of the validity of many        of these features of DWI and PWI in acute stroke has        recently come from the first prospective multicenter stroke        trial using MRI as an inclusion and primary outcome        measure the citicoline MRI stroke trial   In that        study identical MRI hardware and software were used in         centers across the United States to study  patients with        ischemic stroke within  h of onset Patients were        randomly assigned to  mgday citicoline or placebo        Diffusion and perfusion MRI were obtained before treatment        and  and  weeks after treatment Image data processing        and volumetric analysis were performed at a single central        laboratory using a single expert reader blinded to patient        clinical severity and treatment assignment The primary MRI        inclusion criterion was a lesion of volume  cm in        middle cerebral artery territory gray matter The primary        efficacy endpoint was a change in lesion volume from        pretreatment to week  Although the primary efficacy        endpoint of an effect of citicoline on lesion growth was        numerically different  increase in lesion volume in        placebo patients versus  increase for citicoline treated        patients it was not statistically significant However        the study replicated the findings of other investigations        regarding the relationship of MRIderived lesion volumes to        patients clinical status Acute lesion volumes by DWI in         patients correlated significantly with acute clinical        severity on NIH stroke scale scores          r   and with chronic lesion        volume          r   the chronic lesion volume        by Tweighted MRI significantly correlated with chronic        NIH stroke scale score          r   The strongest predictor of        change in lesion size from baseline in the  patients who        completed their week  assessment was the size of the        perfusion abnormality          P   by covariance        analysis The volume change over the  weeks of        observation was significantly related to the patients        clinical improvement Patients meeting the protocol        specified criterion of clinical improvement improvement on        the NIH stroke scale of seven points or more had a        significantly more favorable response on the lesion volume        change outcome variable than those who did not improve The        differentiation of improved from not improved was present        whether the lesion volume change was assessed as an        absolute decrease  versus  median change  cm        versus  cm  or mean SE change   cm        versus   cm  Table  This prospective        multicenter centrally analyzed trial confirmed the value        of MRI as a marker of disease severity and progression in        stroke trials and indicated that the change in MRI lesion        size is likely to predict clinical improvement in clinical        trials        The fifth criterion of validation the concordance of        effects on clinical outcomes and surrogate outcomes        remains to be demonstrated Effective drugs will show        benefit on both clinical and imaging outcome measures The        citicoline trials provide support for this wherein trends        on both clinical and imaging outcomes measures have been        observed      Ineffective drugs will show        benefit on neither clinical nor imaging outcome measures        The latter has been found for the Glycine Antagonist in        Neuroprotection GAIN trials which showed no effect on        clinical or MRI surrogate outcomes    This        comparison is only meaningful if studies are optimally        designed and equally powered to show effect on their        respective outcome measures that is the optimal sample        size for imaging studies may be too small to show clinical        effects Possible explanations for discordant clinical        versus surrogate marker results are presented in Table                The concept that improvement as a measure of brain        lesion volume is a proper surrogate outcome for destructive        central nervous system diseases has been already accepted        by academic and regulatory communities alike Approval of        betainterferon for the treatment of multiple sclerosis was        based in part on lesion volume as a surrogate marker of        disease activity even though the surrogate was not        considered fully validated A surrogate outcome measure in        clinical trials does not need to be fully validated as a        condition of drug approval Recent changes to the Federal        Food Drug and Cosmetic Act which regulates the Food and        Drug Administration approval process have specified a        fasttrack drug designation to expedite review for drugs        that have the potential to address unmet medical needs for        serious and lifethreatening conditions   Drugs for        treatment of stroke have fallen under this designation A        drug must ordinarily have a beneficial effect on a clinical        endpoint or on a validated surrogate endpoint to        demonstrate effectiveness The new regulations state that a        drug may be approved if it has an effect on a surrogate        endpoint that is         reasonably likely to predict clinical        benefit Such surrogate endpoints are considered         not to be validated because while        suggestive of clinical benefit their relationship to        clinical outcomes such as morbidity and mortality is not        proven   emphasis added The issue with regard to        MRI as a surrogate in stroke trials is whether it is        reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit The        hypothesis that neuroprotection the restriction of infarct        volume is reasonably likely to be clinically beneficial to        patients is the premise of virtually all acute stroke drugs        being developed The clinical data already discussed        supports the value of measuring infarct value as a        surrogate        Strict validation must eventually be proven but as we        see from Food and Drug Administration regulations it is no        longer required to use lesion volume by MRI as a surrogate        outcome in stroke trials A benefit on the surrogate may be        acceptable as an independent source of confirmatory data in        support of a clinical benefit seen in a single trial The        question therefore is no longer whether MRI surrogates        should be used in trials but how they should be used        The pharmaceutical industry has taken the initiative in        investigating this final step in validation The results of        several industrysponsored drug trials using MRI as a        surrogate will be known over the next several years and        those studies should provide the most decisive information        regarding the utility of MRI as a surrogate outcome measure        in stroke trials Three multicenter randomized clinical        trials using MRI as a key selection and outcome variable        have been completed and reported Several other trials are        in progress or being planned        In conclusion there have been concerns raised in the        past that the use of MRI in stroke clinical trails is        impractical for technical and logistical reasons eg scan        duration and availability The practical limitations have        disappeared with the widespread availability of ultrafast        echoplanar imaging with diffusion and perfusion capability        on commercial MRI scanners A highly motivated        wellcoordinated center can perform emergency diffusion and        perfusion MRI with a latency to scan and scanning session        duration comparable with that of emergency head CT There        are now over  centers worldwide capable of and        experienced in performing these types of acute MRI        examinations Key design issues with regard to the use of        diffusion and perfusion MRI in stroke trials are proposed        in Table  MRIbased recruitment into trials with a time        window of  h has proven feasible as has specific        selection based on lesion size location and the        diffusionperfusion mismatch As the field of stroke        clinical trials examines opportunities for improving trial        design positive imaging diagnoses in patient selection and        use of imaging as treatment assessments is likely to assume        an increasingly useful role Patient selection and outcomes        based exclusively on clinical assessment and        nonhemorrhagic CT scans may no longer be appropriate for        all trials
