                                 Last Gasp of the Intelligentsia                        Lots of people are complaining that Edmund Morris is a biographer who likesto make things up In his new biography of Reagan Morris has invented not justone but several characters who interact with Reagan at various stages in hislife Isnt this ironic Reagan himself was accused throughout his career offailing to distinguish between fact and fiction Yet I think Morris techniquecan be defended if it helps us understand Reagan better Unfortunately it doesnot            As a Reagan biographer myself I can testify that Morris is right Reaganwas a complex mysterious man Many Americans who saw him on television everyday thought they understood him but they kept forgetting that he was an actorA Cstudent who graduated from Eureka College Reagan was in many respects anordinary man Yet extraordinary things happened in the s the taming ofinflation the revival of economic growth the technological revolution thebeginning of the end of the Cold War            So did Reagan do these things And if he did how did such an ordinaryfellow perform such extraordinary feats Morris biography contributes littleto our understanding of this large issue He gives Reagan credit for his forceof will but he does not credit Reagans force of intellect Reflecting theprejudices of the intelligentsia Morris in his book and in interviews hasdescribed Reagan as ignorant an airhead and a yahoo            Yet it was this very yahoo who in the early s repeatedly predicted thefall of communism He did this at a time when there was complete agreementamong the sophisticated classRepublican and Democrat hawk and doveconservative and liberalthat the Soviet empire was permanent So how didReagan know something about the vulnerability of Soviet communism that all thelearned pundits including the entire Soviet Studies community did not knowMorris  pages brings you no closer to understanding why on this immenselyimportant question the wise men proved to be wrong and the dummy proved to beright            Heres another question Why did the computer revolution occur in the sWhy didnt it happen in the s Reagan is no more responsible for inventingthe Internet than Al Gore But is it possible that Reagans policies such asthe tax cuts deregulation privatization of government assets and thecelebration of the entrepreneur as the true American hero created thenecessary political and social framework for the silicon revolution ManySilicon Valley entrepreneurs Ive spoken to say that without Reagan thecomputer revolution may have happened but it wouldnt have happened as fast asit did So what does Morris think about this Nothing Its not that he adoptsa position I disagree with He seems unaware that this is an important subjectof debate In the sphere of politics it is Morris not Reagan who comesacross looking like an ignoramus            Unable to fathom Reagans public accomplishments Morris focuses on hispersonal life Even here there are no big revelations Morris speculates thatReagan married his first wife Jane Wyman because she threatened to commitsuicide if he didnt But the source for this turns out to be Reagans secondwife Nancy Reagan All we can learn from this episode is that second wivesdont like to think that their husbands wanted to marry their first wivesMorris also makes much of the fact that Reagan in the mids consideredjoining the Communist Party but was turned down because they regarded him as aflake Does this prove that Reagan was a lightweight On the contrary itreveals that the Commies were even more inept than previously thought Reaganwould have been an unbelievably good catch and if he had stayed with thissorry lot he would have been their best chance to win mainstreamacceptability            Morris failure is symptomatic of the failure of the intelligentsia in thiscountry to comprehend Reagan Perhaps it also reflects an attempt to avengeReagans rout of the intellectual class We are now living in the world thatReagan made a world in which entrepreneurs and not intellectuals are directingthe nations future So will Morris have the last word on Reagans legacy Inthe words of one of Tom Wolfes characters fuhgetaboutit  Historywill remember Reagan as one of the two great presidents of the  thcentury The other was FDR He will be cherished as the man who won the ColdWar and revived the American economy and the American spirit Morris book willbe a footnote
