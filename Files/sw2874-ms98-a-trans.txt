        so you like to fish huh   yeah i like to um i dont have a boat but i like to fish and theres a lot of lakes around here um are there many lakes up there   yeah actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me we actually uh we have the those little the the the Great Lakes you know Great uh Lake Ontario is right near here   uhhuh   plus were in whats called the Finger Lake Region of New York where therere lots of small lakes everywhere and these are uh real good um for like you know bass fishing and so forth   they have mostly small mouth in them or   no we have a quite actually quite a lot of variety heres uh theres we have large mouth small mouth um sort of musky pike stuff like that   umhum   you know all sorts of fun stuff like that um we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on Lake Ontario every year   oh yeah thats right uhhuh   so its its thats a lot of fun   umhum   how about you do you like what what do you like to go for   oh its its uh i fish for bass but i hardly ever catch one but um um they have a tail race over in Lake Lavon and uh you know they wash when they open up the dam and let out water they wash down the fish and uh you catch that white bass and crappie out of there   yeah um   every once in a while therell be striped bass   we have uh some friends who live on a lake and it the lake it just seems is is completely filled with bass to the point where you know normally you go you you go fishing for bass you get a lot of sunfish or   umhum   or cat or whatever and some other strange stuff but in this particular lake we went out with some friends once and we just every time you tossed the line in you pull up a five six seven inch minimum bass and usually you pull up you know thirteen to fourteen inch bass   wow   yeah its a real its a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just we pull up you know bass after bass and   umhum   during perch season as well you pull up a lot of uh probably during during perch season the perch will run in very large schools so what theyll do is just youll youll be sort of boating around these people own a little row boat and theyll be boating around and theyll hit a theyll hit a school of perches in the middle   umhum   and when they do you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at they they just drop it in they they cant pull it in fast enough     what do you what do you catch perch on   um i they actually they according to them you can catch when the perch are running you can catch them on just about anything   huh   they tend to use i guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes but you know ive she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything you know   umhum   theyll corn or salami or bread or anything theyll theyll theyll hit because theyre just sort of surrounded these large schools   yeah its sometimes i use corn but uh uh some fish steal it off the hook sometimes   yeah its a big problem   yeah um the other day i was fishing with bread uh theres a college across the street and they its its full of carp   yeah   and uh i caught a carp on a about what size is that uh i think it was a number two treble hook and its huge its its mouth was just full of hooks   um wow   so he was in a bad way but uh its he was fast   a big one   hes uh yeah well its uh it was sixteen inches long   wow thats thats thats a nice size carp   yeah i think it was about a pound and a half you know but all theyre good for is the fight boy they dont they really dont want to come out of the water they they zip through the water you know youre how your line goes you know     uhhuh   and i thought you know that uh i wasnt going to be able to get it in because uh the one i hooked just about ten minutes before when when i tried to raise it out of the water it fell off so it wasnt hooked very well but you know i got it that far i figured that uh   that that that counts   yeah thats what i said thats what i told the guy the guy was standing there and he laughed when it fell off  and i said thats a quick release right there     do you do you do you actually like the taste of fish do you like eat the fish that you catch or are you more of a sport fisherman   um catfish yeah but uh i havent eaten anything else you know   um   um theres some uh my dad has a farm and theres he has two ponds up there and my uncle has a a pond upstream and theres a lot of crappie in there now but uh i think hes the only one thats thats caught enough crappie or a big enough crappie to eat but the catfish theres you know theres hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and   right so you can just   yeah yeah   oh because i dont actually like fish its sort of so when i fish its more for sport than anything else   yeah and if you know when you when you have to look in their eyes and you know hit them in the head or whatever thats what you do with a catfish you know because you have to sever their spinal cord     right and and and and and be careful you dont get stung   yeah yeah   yeah i know it have you ever tried uh deep sea fishing   uh not yet my brother went off the coast of Maine uh when the i dont know what they Mackerel that school out there its he he said that it was just like that  they were throwing like uh uh hell benders or uh   yeah   uh some other kind of treble hook lure and and uh each time they bring them in theyd have at least one sometimes theyve had two on you know one on every hook   yeah we i was out in  Florida with a friend a while ago and we would go and just uh drop two you know a a two or three rig two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat we just dropped it down there and the captain had you know some kind of sonar in the boat so hed maneuver us in into a school of fish and you just drop it in and   umhum   and it just you you get one or two at a shot you know and   yeah   its a good deal too it was it was a like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat   wow   you know and and and theyll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want   yeah down here its like two hundred dollars a day   well this is yeah this this this was for a you know large there were   a group party   maybe thirty of us on the boat we we werent all related just you know thirty people off the shop in the boat there if you want to go on a boat alone its like two hundred dollars a day   yeah yeah   but this is great because it was i think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something   umhum   you know so youd get to go out there for five for for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and and fish all day its really nice its real enjoyable   yeah well i i dont know if its been five minutes yet or not   i think were probably close though   yeah its nice talking to you   nice talking to you too good luck with fishing this season   good luck byebye   byebye
