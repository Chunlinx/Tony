        okay did       um all i the scale is from one to ten i think one being um no or im sorry is all total control   uhhuh   and then ten as being no control is that what it was   oh where would i be i would be somewhere around hm seven or eighth i think for control   okay so that would be like less control   oh no um   i im confused but i dont really think it matters but okay more control  okay and why is that   more on the uh higher end yeah oh well for one i think criminals um   umhum   they uh i mean im all for people you know hunting and doing their thing although i dont hunt personally   umhum umhum i dont either   i dont uh i dont own any guns but um you know i mean ive ive shot gun plenty of guns uh target practice   umhum huh   and um well i mean ive kind of gone out hunting a little bit you know with boyfriends but uh   umhum gosh ive never done that   its its fun but you really have to have respect for the weapon   uhhuh   and uh but the thing im concerned about is you know those people you know like a seven day delay is not gonna hurt those people its no big thing um you know because its its   uhhuh umhum   you know recreation whereas the people who are going out to um you know  for crime   umhum umhum   you know to rob somebody now i think thats good that they have enough time to check their record you know and it   umhum where its a like cool down if theyre just like in the bad uhhuh i agree um thats why im i guess im like five   oh yeah its for everybodys safety uhhuh yeah i mean i could be five too   in the middle because because like if i like i say if someone tried to break into my house today i would wanna get a gun that day   oh well i didnt think about that   you know for to help be protected tomorrow or whatever that night   yeah   but i wouldnt want some crazy nut that you know gets mad at somebody else and says im gonna kill them to be able to get a gun that fast so its like a doubleedged sword i guess   umhum yeah yeah it definitely is i didnt think about the other side huh   so hm hm but ive never i dont know if ive ever shot a gun i dont   hm well i served in the service so you have to   oh you have to  thats neat   you have to uh shoot a weapon and qualify otherwise you dont pass   umhum huh   so to speak and uh so we had to zero it you know to your own eye each gun you have to kind of zero to your own eye and how you look at the sights   umhum umhum   and um   who but you wanted like slightly more rules like um like youre towards the conservative end   oh well im kind of fifty fifty you know if you know hearing your argument it got im just right smack in the middle   umhum umhum i was just wondering because like since ive never shot one maybe its different if youve actually shot one or like you said hunted or you know maybe if i you know had ever shot one   oh well you   well you definitely need to you know have the uh respect for it and you cant just pick up a gun and expect to hit something you know you may be within lets say a foot foot range   uhhuh uhhuh umhum   i mean uh  i dont know half a foot to a foot off   huh   um just because of your sights and how you look through a sight  as compared to somebody else   umhum hm what kind of hunting have you done   oh uh that was uh i i think we just for small but it was quail i think   hm   i mean yeah that was just nothing not not anything like deer or rabbits or squirrels   hm umhum   but uh   hm because like i have friends that hunt  and um but theyre like real careful they kill the animal with like one shot so they dont have like a injured animal running around and umhum   umhum oh well here uh actually about thirty minutes away there was a guy that fired and the bullet actually went through the deer and then hit somebody and killed them   hm oh my God   so it hit two different targets um and   does that have to be like some heavy duty bullet to be able to do that or some real super gun or   i dont know its im surprised because usually when a bullet hits something it um it it compresses you know it loses its shape   hm umhum   but uh evidently they had bone fragments of both so um yeah it killed and and theyve had several instance right here in Raleigh and it was national news   oh my gosh hm   and it was a real big thing but uh had several uh one woman was out in her backyard and she had a white glove on she was taking her laundry down and the guy thought it was the tail of the uh deer   umhum umhum umhum oh my God   and shot her   did she die or   uh i think so yeah there was two or three killings like right one was a school teacher and of course all the school kids uh were upset about it and it made the news so uh   hm umhum umhum umhum hm   you know its it hit pretty close to home i guess   gosh id uh wouldnt wanna live near a forest   i know i wouldnt even wanna go hiking you know with people out there hunting   uhhuh really  are you still in the service or   no and
