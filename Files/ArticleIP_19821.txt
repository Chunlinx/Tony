                                 Saint Monica            The majority of newspapersaround the world disapproved of the impeachment trial of President Clinton andhoped for his acquittal The exception was the British press which dividedalong predictably partisan lines Following the Senate votes the conservativeDailyTelegraph said a decent man would have resigned when his public lyinghad been revealed whereas Mr Clinton hung on correctly calculating that amixture of brazenness legal equivocation and personal charm would see himthrough But the paper pronounced him the lamest of ducks which it saidis a loss not only to the Americans but also to their friends around theworld            The Times of London anotherantiClinton paper splashed the headline Clinton The Great Escape acrossits front page and said in an editorial Suspended Sentence that a revivalin Mr Clintons standing can only be achieved through foreign policy whichwill require a huge investment of his time for uncertain returns Someforeign policy initiatives would invite internal opposition and risk damaginghis precious poll numbers the Times said That should not be anexcuse for inaction Alan Greenspans financial decisions have been the makingof the Clinton presidency It is time that the Chief Executive made rather moreof his presidency himself            In an editorial it called The end of the Zipper theliberal Guardian said one of the losers in the scandal was theAmerican media which constantly predicted a national mood swing against thepresident when none was there They also compromised some of their own mostcherished ethical standards a mistake they may live to regret the editorialsaid It acknowledged however that three stars of the affair had emergedwith credit Monica Lewinsky who showed some class in her testimony  andwho refused to surrender to the bullying of Mr Starrs witchfindergeneralthe US Constitution which showed it is robust enough to survive even themadness of s puritanism and the American people who held their nervethroughout and were able to distinguish between the President and the manaccepting one even as they acknowledged the flaws in the other            The liberal Independent onSunday  in an editorial headlined The stained presidency said that toanyone sane it was always obvious that impeachment was a hideouslyinappropriate and disproportionate punishment for President Clintons lowcrimes and misdemeanours  but that didnt absolve the man Clintonsbehavior has been contemptible throughout from his initial offences to hislegalistic evasions to his unbearably mawkish and snivelling apologies thepaper said Although Clinton has shown again an astonishing talent forsurvival it cannot be pleasant for him to contemplate how his presidency willbe remembered by posterity            In Rome La Repubblica focused on Clintons loneliness as he prepared to repayagainst Republican opposition those who had stood by him for  monthstheblack lobby the womens organizations the leftwing Democrats and his wifeHillarywho would now be presenting their bills The paper said Saturday thatClintons task in his remaining  months in office is to show that he hasbecome a man His first stephis apology to the American people in the RoseGarden on Fridaywas a step in that direction La Repubblica said Itconcluded Perhaps even Monica watching him from afar felt a last shudder oftenderness and regret for her exlover so important and so alone            In its editorial Sundayheadlined The rout of the Starr judges Le Monde of Paris called Clintons victory in theSenate impeachment trial the first serious setback for the crusade led by theneoconservatives since the beginning of the s to dictate the morality andsexuality of Americans It said A certain America has triumphed over theother that of humanist good sense has beaten that of the fundamentalistpreachers that which wants to preserve certain achievements of the s hasbeaten that which wants to abolish them  The country has recognized itselfmore in Bill Clinton than in Kenneth Starr and so much the better            Canadas most influential newspaper the TorontoGlobe andMail  said Monday in an editorial that the reason Americans hadforgiven Clinton his lies and misdemeanors was that he was a victim ofentrapmentby a politically motivated independent prosecutor  usinginformation that invaded his privacy and subjected him and his family toworldwide humiliation The paper added If Mr Clinton survives as somethingof a victim through all this Monica Lewinsky survives as something of aheroine Of all the people involved she is the one who apparently never liedor knowingly broke a confidence She never sought publicity about her affairwith the President and so far has done nothing to exploit it  Ms Lewinskyhas behaved with admirable restraint and dignity throughout the piece the onlyplayer to come out entirely clean            In Egypt thesemiofficial press was determined not to write off Clinton as a lame duck Itis difficult to concede to the argument that despite his acquittal USPresident Bill Clinton is likely to be paralyzed through his remaining periodin office AlAhram said in an editorial Monday But it pointed out that some ofClintons major achievements such as the peace deal in Ireland the strategicpartnership with China and the Wye Plantation Memorandum between thePalestinians and the Israelis have been attained at the peak of his crisis It does not stand to reason then that the man who so succeeds whilepreoccupied with a moral scandal that could have cost him his seat at the OvalOffice would be paralyzed and disabled once the episode is over            Following Madeleine Albrights visit to RambouilletFrance Sunday to inject some momentum into the
