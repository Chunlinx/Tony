                                 Brills Follies                        Evan            Between the toilet and the bowl Im shifting in my seat just thinking aboutit Im also thinking of about a dozen crude and ugly things to say inresponse but since this is the Breakfast Table and not the Bar Stool I wontshare them            But speaking of dicks Im glad you brought up Steve Brill The saddestthing about Brill is that hes a genuinely smart guy who has destroyed hisreputation become a joke among his peers and wasted a ton of cash all forthe sake of  what That silly magazine The chance to make morally superiornoises on cable once in a while I dont understand it            A few years ago I went out to lunch with Brill and came away impressed Hespent the entire meal explaining why we ought to put television cameras inevery courtroom in America The OJ spectacle was in full bloom at the timeand I remember thinking that it took pretty hefty stones to contend that anyoneapart from say those with a financial stake in Court TV could benefit froma televised trial But Brill did Ludicrous I said He came back at me withsuch force and with what seemed like such a tight argument that by the end Iwas almost ready to agree that what the Supreme Court really needs is moreTelePrompTers maybe a lavaliere mike or two Thatd make the legal system moreefficient and just            Im happy to say I recovered my senses shortly after leaving the restaurantBut my impression of Brill as a vigorous capable guy remained Until he puthis own name in the title of his magazine and in a thousand other ways made anass of himself What a waste It still depresses me to see him ontelevision            Just as it depresses me to see a magazine I work for flayed in the Mondaybusiness section of the New York Times  I hope you wont think less ofme for taking a huge cringing pass on that story Media conglomerates and theuse of actors to sell magazines are two topics that make me prettyuncomfortable though I know so little about Hollywood that most of the time Ihave no idea whos being synergized and whos not so yesterdays Timespiece was particularly hard for me to get through            It did leave me wondering and not for the first time who these people arewho buy magazines based on the celebrity cover photo Heres my thinking on thesubject Magazine buyers are people whove chosen reading over watchingtelevision or going to the mall or playing video games as a form ofentertainment This is a relatively small group of people presumably moreliterateor at least interested in becoming more literatethan the averageperson Yet these are also people who will buy a magazine simply because it hasa photograph Ricky Martin on the cover though not necessarily a real storyabout him inside Can this be true Help me here Im getting depressedagain            BestTucker
