                all right i i think our experience of camping is i i am the the passive member i get things ready and then i enjoy   uhhuh   uh because my my husband is a good camper and so they he manages the troops and they do the work and i have fun   uhhuh well uh uh your you said your family was grown uh all grown up now how about when they were younger did you go camping take them camping   thats when we camped the most when i thinks its a marvelous activity for younger families   uhhuh   because uh i it seems like i would go through a period of time where i just uh was really overworked you know and and getting out into nature and relaxing     uhhuh   and having the family do a good share of the work you know and the part that i did was more fun than uh than labor because they did the the running and toting chores and i just helped cook and kind of organize you know   yeah but even even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun isnt it   it is isnt it it isnt have what kinds of things have you tried have you done uh uh uh the big pot cooking   oh oh uh well it was really my ex who did the the uh uh the cooking back when we first started   uhhuh   and we found that the you know what was one one great handy things was this uh uh uh hamburger helper   oh yeah   because all you needed was a big frying pan you dumped everything in together   big frying pan   and it was enough for all five of us six of us   oh thats interesting you know interesting enough uh the food part was kind of uh important thing in our camping uh when my oldest son   six of us   uh always at the beginning i did all the shopping and everything but the the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son Mark took his uh uh cooking merit badge in and and Mark was the kind of camper who ate beef Stroganoff and uh   oh   i mean you know he did it up really good  and so uh after he took that merit badge he did all the shopping and preparing getting ready for it   well thats great   it was it was a marvelous experience because after that then all i had to do was uh follow the instructions you know and do and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things like i would take corn bread and uh cook a pan inside of a pan over a over a camp uh stove and it works real good its like an oven   uhhuh well   just put uh put a thing on it   cooking was our secondary interest i mean   what did you like to do most   well really just commune with nature   thats neat isnt it   we started out uh well we were living in Florida at the time and we early in life we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very very expensive   right i agree   so my ex decided were going to try camping and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent       and thats how we got started we did it for years and years uh   huh well now in Florida is there is there times are there times of the year when its very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot   well yes uh yes and no i mean um yes in the winter time yes its it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly but uh theres really no time of the year that you cant go   uhhuh oh is that true now now were were in Texas now and youre in Texas right   uh because yes im in Dallas   okay uh we have not camped a great deal here because uh a good share of the time in the Summer time its too hot really to be very comfortable camping   well it just depends on where you go for instance if you went down to the sea shore it would be wonderful a nice breeze blowing in from the water   i guess yeah yeah we have done that but but we camped mostly when the kids were little we were in we were in New Jersey   oh where abouts   and we uh in uh Allendale and uh and uh Waldwick its just about twelve miles south of the New York border   uhhuh   and wed go up to the Adirondacks and camp and it was so you know pick your own uh blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast  uh also go ahead   oh yes yes yes i come i come from up in that area im a New Yorker myself   oh are you where did you live   a little town called Tuckaho over by White Plains   oh oh yeah i know that i had a cousin who lived in White Plains thats a thats a neat area but its a that is a particularly neat area for camping   well that i wouldnt know i left there when i was quite young   because yeah it is neat though because there are lots of lakes fairly near by you dont have to go very far   uhhuh   and uh and theres uh a lot of trees lot of mountains and lot of uh hiking sort of things and and we had uh collapsible boat which we uh clipper little clipper sail boat   uhhuh   and so we would sail and and uh did a lot of camping that way   well uh me i outgrew uh sleeping bags and uh tents       and i now have a motor home   oh do you weve gotten out a time or two on a rented basis and its fun too i think   well i live in mine yes   do you thats neat so you kind of uh uh an everyday camper   uh well yes i consider myself what they call a fulltimer     a full time camper well now are you living alone now or   yeah the yes well just me and my dog   you and your dog huh  hey that sounds great well we dont we dont camp quite as much as we used to but uh i still think its a great way to spend a time with your family and   yeah oh yes definitely   and enjoy nature and uh kind of wipe out the stress of everyday life id always   nothing like the fresh outdoors   right id always come home just relaxed and uh comfortable and ready to go at it again so it was a neat activity good to talk to you tell me your name
