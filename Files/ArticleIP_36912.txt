                                 Clintons Nuclear Alarm            Lastweek  Republican senators voted not to ratify the nuclear Comprehensive TestBan Treaty The direct result of this vote was virtually nothing No missileswere launched No bombs were detonated No agreements were voided The treatyitself remained open to ratification Instead analysts agreed that the importof the vote lay in the signal it sent to foreign governments At his newsconference the next day President Clinton had an opportunity to define thatsignal for good or ill He chose both While assuring other nations that thevote signified no change in Americas commitment to nonproliferation he toldAmericans that arms control had suffered a disastrous setback and that theUnited States was withdrawing from the world            Clintons equivocation on the test ban vote is the latest chapter in thestruggle between his two personalities Policy Bill and Political Bill PolicyBill strives for solutions and looks for deals Political Bill strives foradvantage and looks for fights Policy Bill treats elections as a means topassing legislation Political Bill treats legislation as a means to winningelections Policy Bill wants arms control as an accomplishment Political Billwants it as a festering issue Policy Bill wants to frame the treaty vote in away that will calm the world by minimizing the perceived damage to armscontrol Political Bill wants to frame it in a way that will alarm Americanvoters by maximizing that perceived damage            Republicans said they voted against the treaty because it lacked adequatemonitoring and enforcement mechanisms wouldnt affect rogue states andimposed too permanent a commitment on the United States to refrain fromtesting Several indicated that they would have supported it if Clinton hadworked with them to amend it By voting against it were Republicans givingforeign regimes a green light to test nuclear weapons No they replied Theyargued that the best safeguard against proliferation was the previouslyratified Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and that Clinton was sending a greenlight by failing to enforce that pact Was the GOP turning away from theworld No said Sen Mitch McConnell RKy The Republicans are notisolationists Were the party of GATT NAFTA and the WTO Were theyrejecting arms control No said the Republicans They observed that pragmatichawks such as Sen Dick Lugar RInd who had supported previous arms controlpacts deemed this one unwise The leader of the nonproliferation effort overthe last  years the United States of America is not abandoning itsleadership said Sen Chuck Hagel RNeb I dont believe thats what thatvote was about            Clinton could have used his news conference to affirm this soothing message asSen Joe Lieberman DConn did in a joint appearance with Hagel We havecome together today to say to anyone who will listen to the American peopleand hopefully to people around the world that although there are not nowsufficient votes in the Senate to ratify this test ban treaty that does notmean that the cause of nuclear nonproliferation died on the Senate flooryesterday said Lieberman That cause  is embraced by a great majority inCongress he went on We do want to signal to nations around the world in theaftermath of yesterdays vote that neither the American people nor the UnitedStates Senate are walking away from our responsibility to lead the effortagainst proliferation            AtClintons news conference his two personalities wrestled over how to spin thevote Policy Bill played it down We will not abandon the commitments inherentin the treaty and resume testing ourselves he told the world I call onRussia China Britain France and all other countries to continue to refrainfrom testing I call on nations that have not done so to sign and ratify theComprehensive Test Ban Treaty And I will continue to do all I can to make thatcase to the Senate When all is said and done I have no doubt that the UnitedStates will ratify this treaty  We are not going to reverse  years ofcommitment on nonproliferation He concluded So I urge other nations notto overreact to make clear their opposition to what the Senate did but tostay with us and believe in the United States because the American people wantus to lead toward nonproliferation            ButPolitical Bill was determined to punish Republicans at the polls by depictingtheir vote as a repudiation of arms control They had betrayed the vision ofPresidents Eisenhower and Kennedy and embraced a new isolationism hecharged The Senate majority has turned its back on  years of Americanleadership against the spread of weapons of mass destruction They are sayingAmerica does not need to lead either by effort or by example They are sayingwe dont need our friends or allies  We say to them our allies Go takea hike  Were not cooperating with them anymore As far as wereconcerned  anything you want to do with your money is fine with us becausewe have more money than you do so whatever you do well do more             Political Bills scare tactics destroyed Policy Bills reassurances TheChinese should have every assurance that at least as long as thisadministration is here we support the moratorium on nuclear testing saidPolicy Bill Abruptly Political Bill interjected Now if we ever get apresident thats against the test ban treaty which we may getI mean thereare plenty of people out there who say theyre against itthen I think youmight as well get ready for it Youll have Russia testing youll have Chinatesting youll have India testing youll have Pakistan testing Youll havecountries abandoning the Nonproliferation Treaty Political Bill didnt carehow these words affected world leaders To him the test ban treaty was justanother wedge issue Thats why he opened his news conference not bydistinguishing arms control as a transcendent responsibility but by lumping ittogether with budget politics In recent days members of the congressionalmajority have displayed a reckless partisanship It threatens Americaseconomic wellbeing and now our national security            Clintons partisan teammates repeated his alarmist spin This vote sent adangerous message to people around the world said Hillary Clinton In acampaign ad endorsed by Senate Democrats and the White House Vice President AlGore warned This vote goes against the tide of history The Senate haddecided to roll back  years of progress on real efforts to stem the nuclearproliferation lamented Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakotacalling it a definitive vote that said Around the world we relegateleadership on nuclear proliferation to somebody else  The Democratscampaign chief Sen Bob Torricelli DNJ charged Republican senators havebought responsibility for the North Koreans and the Iranians and the Iraqis inthe next decade who almost assuredly will continue now with nuclearprograms  Other nations are going to interpret this vote by the Senate asan opportunity to break out of arms controls            Foreign governments and the media were already inclined to interpret the voteas a renunciation of arms control and global engagement Clinton onlyencouraged that interpretation The vote halted the momentum toward nucleararms control and further weakened the already shaky standing of the UnitedStates as a global moral leader the New York Times concluded in afrontpage analysis the day after Clintons news conference AnotherTimes story added that fears have been heightened by what looks like anAmerican renunciation of any controls over its huge nuclear arsenal and theappearance that Americans are moving away from international agreements andresponsibilities can also be alarming A Los Angeles Times analysissaid the Senate was signaling an ominous retreat from the world            The perverse irony of thenuclear age is that the survival of humankind has rested as much oninternational perception as on reality Thirty years ago it rested on theperception that we were willing to build bombs and deploy them Today it restsincreasingly on the perception that were willing to stop Clinton has theability to sustain that perception despite the test bans defeat If only hehad the will
