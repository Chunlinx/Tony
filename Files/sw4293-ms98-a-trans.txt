              yes uh i think a lot of the problems whether they be in school or in home in discipline has a part is rooted in the amount of time parents spend with their kids   yeah i i dont think parents spend enough time with their kids these days i remember my parents used to help me with my homework and stuff like that you know make sure that i had that i understood what i was trying to study and everything like that   now my parents were the same way uh they they took uh interests in everything that i did not just the things that interested them or when they felt like uh i wanted to spend time which was uh uh when they wanted me get out get me out of the door to school in the morning   right  well we used to take family vacations which i always used to love wed travel by car to all these different states and       uh see these you know really nice things and they were not the typical things like Florida or Disneyland or whatever   umhum   was more like Colorado for the mountains or something like that   yeah thats essentially what we did uh i look i came from the midwest and we went to the neighboring states to uh little known places that i have yet to find anyone else thats ever been to these places   yeah exactly i im from the midwest myself from Michigan and wed wed go as far as like oh oh places like Colorado we went to Arkansas very frequently and  the the biggest thing was that the family did things together you know we didnt just like separate and go our separate ways when we got there   umhum   wed always go out and do things and spend time with each other   yeah so i i used to babysit uh the neighbors kids when i was a lot younger and um it was essentially theyd theyd get home from work the parents would they stick the kids in front of the TV set until it was time to go to bed and never did anything as a family together   yeah yep and the kids ended up the losers i think   yeah they they became uh brats and juvenile delinquents   umhum   the parents just didnt want to really put the time and effort into uh uh   its   making them making a family unit it was like they were single but theyre they were still a a a single people but uh they had kids   right   the kids were just a nuisance   they they got in the way they cost money and they get theyre thats the attitude that a lot of people have these days and its one of the reasons why the kids dont do well in school and dont are carrying guns to school and stuff like that because they dont feel like anybody cares   yeah   and uh   and in some in a lot of cases uh very few or the only the uh only the wrong people care the the people who should care dont   umhum right thats correct       um have have you uh have you uh worked around kids quite a bit   people at work         uh     not directly huh   no no not not in recent years     yeah i havent worked i havent worked around kids too much either i used to live in a building that had a day care down in the basement   umhum   and id go down there and play with some of the kids at times and it was really kind of enjoyable to just they you know they were younger like two and a half to five   yeah   and um it was enjoyable because they would they liked just liked being with people i mean it really didnt matter what you did with them as long as you did something with them   umhum exactly   oh you know lets play with the kitchen or or lets lets play with you know read me a book or you know do something   the only problem i had with that and i had i talked to another person who had the same thing when you start actually playing with them you take on the same uh uh sometimes you take on the same mentality of like its mine       and i said wait a minute wait a minute i im im beyond this and im acting just like they are   you you speak in simple sentences huh   yeah all the words have one syllable   do you have a boo boo that doesnt go across very well when youre uh talking to your coworkers   right     do i have a what   you know a boo boo an owie   i think im going to go to the potty now   excuse me       oh yeah   but uh oh well it sounds like you and i have uh similar opinions on this topic   yeah its its its just uh parents today are its they want everything if if it cant be done in five minutes dont bother me with it   yeah yep no attention no attention span   umhum   and then especially if it cant be solved in a half hour with ads in between you know   right its the its the television mentality all problems are created and solved in a half hour   yep and uh then you go on to the next set of problems and solve them in a half hour too   yep well things just and therefore you have children that um
