                    Background        The fibromyalgia syndrome FMS is characterized by wide        spread pain in the body associated with particular tender        points      It is often accompanied by unrestorative        sleep patterns fatigue headaches irritable bowel and        bladder syndrome morning stiffness paresthesias anxiety        and depression      The prevalence rate is about  in        the general population  of women ages  and         of women ages      and as high as  in women ages             FMS is more prevalent in women than men in        about a  ratio     People who suffer from FMS have a        disability index comparable to that of patients with        rheumatoid arthritis    while disease severity was worse        than Sjogrens syndrome     The natural course of FMS        may include some symptomatic relief     but many        symptoms remain essentially unchanged after  years of        follow up            Treatments for FMS include medications amitriptyline        and fluoxetine most common nutritional supplements malic        acid sadenosyl methionine hydroxytryptophan and        physical therapies cardiovascular training stretching        electroacupuncture and cognitivebehavior therapy        reviewed in       FMS patients frequently use        alternative therapies indicating dissatisfaction or        ineffectiveness of traditional medical therapy            FMS engulfs patients in a downward spiral of        unrestorative sleep chronic pain fatigue inactivity and        depression Each symptom reinforces the others making it        difficult to break out of the cycle A week vegetarian        diet improved subjective well being in FMS patients along        with significant reductions in serum peroxides plasma        fibrinogen apolipoproteins A and B and serum total        cholesterol     A livingfoods vegan diet was used        in a month nonrandomized controlled study of FMS        subjects     In the intervention group there were        significant improvements in pain scores quality of sleep        morning stiffness health assessment questionnaire scores        and general health questionnaire These studies along with        anecdotal evidence that we have gathered indicate that a        mostly raw food vegetarian diet is helpful in breaking the        cycle of suffering of FMS patients        In this study we utilized a pure vegetarian diet        composed mostly of common fruits vegetables nuts tubers        carrot juice and dehydrated barley grass juice while        tracking participants FMS status during a month period        of time                    Methods                  Subjects          Subjects were recruited from a local fibromyalgia          support group by notice of the study in a biyearly          newsletter and by word of mouth An informed consent          document explaining the study and the risks and benefits          of participation was given to each potential subject          Written consent was obtained from subjects before          participation The study was conducted in accord with the          ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration of  as          revised in           Subjects were required to have a previous diagnosis of          FMS by a rheumatologist using the American College of          Rheumatology criteria of at least  of  tender points          being painful upon palpation Subjects underwent a          physical examination upon entering the study including          the tender point survey          Subjects were encouraged to continue with any          medication for sleep or pain It was believed that this          would allow the best comparison between initial and final          conditions with as few variables changing as possible          Subjects and their prescribing physicians made all          medication decisions The investigators in this study had          no control of medication usage                          Diet implementation          Subjects were supplied with books published by          Hallelujah Acres Inc            Gods Way to Ultimate Health Recipes          for Lifefrom Gods Garden  Days to health the          Hallelujah diet way  and informational pamphlets          Instructions were given on what foods to eat fresh          fruits salads raw vegetables carrot juice nuts          seeds whole grain products tubers flax seed oil extra          virgin olive oil what foods to avoid alcohol caffeine          foods containing refined sugar corn syrup refined          andor hydrogenated oil refined flour dairy eggs and          all meat and how to prepare freshly extracted carrot          juice with the supplied Champion juicer Plastaket Mfg          Co Inc Lodi CA Subjects were given a month supply          of dehydrated barley grass juice powder Barleygreen and          a blend of laxative herbs and psyllium seed Herbal          Fiberblend AIM International Nampa ID with          instruction to ask for more when this supply was          finished Subjects were encouraged to attend a live          motivational presentation of the basis of the Hallelujah          Diet to reorient their thinking about food and health A          video was available for those subjects that did not          attend the presentation No regular support meetings were          scheduled for motivational encouragement after this          initial presentation as this might make the results less          applicable to the general population                          Main outcome measures          Physical performance measures as detailed by          Mannerkorpi et al     were collected at the          beginning and end of the study  measures were used          These were shoulder pain at rest range of active motion          abduction and flexion shoulder pain on motion hand to          neck hand to scapula isometric shoulder endurance neck          rotation hand grip strength flexibility of the low back          and hamstrings using the sitandreach method chair test          number of times a subject could stand up in a minute          and a sixminute walk All of these measures were taken          by the same physical therapist SL Along with these          objective tests subjects were asked to report their          health status using the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire              the SF short form health survey     and          a Quality of Life Survey     The SF has been          widely used to record how a person perceives his or her          own health status The quality of life survey queries the          subject about  different aspects of life with a scale          from  to  for each question These questionnaires were          selfadministered at    and  months          A food frequency questionnaire FFQ designed to          include commonly eaten foods while following the          Hallelujah Diet was also selfadministered at   and           months The FFQ administered at  months was analyzed          using The Food Processor version  ESHA Research          Eugene OR                          Statistics          The FIQ QOL and SF surveys were analyzed by          repeated measures analysis of variance Differences          between time points were calculated using the Bonferroni          comparison A subgroup of  of the participants was used          that reported in the beginning end and either  or           months into the trial The physical performance measures          were analyzed by the students paired ttest  subjects          gave initial and final physical performance measures A          significance level less than  was considered          statistically significant          Responders and nonresponders were initially          distinguished using the FIQ score If a subject reported          at least a point improvement in their initial and          final FIQ score then that subject was classified as a          responder A point improvement in the FIQ correlated          with statistically significant improvements in measures          of physical performance QOLS scores and SF          scores                            Results                  Subjects           subjects participated in this study  female           male All subjects had been previously diagnosed with          fibromyalgia by a rheumatologist but not all subjects          currently had  or more positive tender points All          subjects had symptoms which they attributed to FMS          Compliance of subjects was monitored by selfreported          food intakes on a food frequency questionnaire and by          requests for more dehydrated barley grass juice          Approximately a twomonth supply was initially given to          each subject with instructions to call and ask for more          when their supply ran out           subjects  of whom are classified as responders          returned surveys at the beginning end and either  or           months Detailed results for the selfreported          questionnaires FIQ SF QOLS here are reported for          this subgroup Response responder or nonresponder to          the dietary intervention is reported based on all           subjects according to the intention to treat principle          Analysis shows there were no significant differences in          gathered data between the whole group and this          subgroup                          Dietary intake          Food frequency questionnaires were collected from           participants Nutrient intakes based on the FFQ          administered at  months are reported in Table  Diet          percentages on an energy basis were  percent fat           percent carbohydrate and  percent protein          Participants reported drinking   ml servings of          carrot juice daily so that the mean intake of          betacarotene was  mgday Several participants          reported less consumption of carrot juice at  months          than at  months The dehydrated barley grass juice was          consumed by all but  subjects who reported immediate          nausea upon consumption of the powder Flax seed oil was          consumed by  of  participants so that the mean intake          of n fatty acids was about  gday Fresh fruit and          salads based mostly on leaf lettuce and dark leafy          greens rather than head lettuce were consumed daily The          high intakes of fruits and vegetables resulted in high          intakes of fiber vitamin C folate potassium and          magnesium Animal product consumption was very low          especially intakes of meat poultry and fish Intakes          were mainly from once weekly to none resulting in low          intakes of fat cholesterol vitamins B and D and          zinc Soft drink intake was reported in  subjects          demonstrating willingness to report truthfully Only           subjects reported consuming more than a  ml serving          per week                          Physical performance          Eighteen subjects were followed up after completion of          the study see Table  Results are only reported for          these  subjects  of whom were classified as          responders Initial values were very similar to values          reported by Mannerkorpi et al     Significant          improvements P   paired ttest in these           subjects were seen in shoulder pain at rest and after          motion abduct range of motion of shoulder flexibility          sit and reach chair test and minute walk Neck          rotation left only was also significantly improved          Hand grip strength decreased significantly in right hand          and decreased to a lesser extent in the left hand          Isometric shoulder endurance showed no change                          FIQ          The FIQ is a survey designed specifically to measure          the impact of fibromyalgia on a persons life After two          months the mean FIQ score had fallen from  points to           points and decreased further to  points at seven          months n   at each time point This is a           improvement after  months and a  improvement after           months The histogram in Figure of the FIQ score shows a          decrease in the scores as the trial progressed          There was a significant trend all P   for          improvement in all scales see Table  There were          significant improvements P   with Bonferroni          correction in all of the FIQ subscales from  months          and almost all of the subscales from  months work          missed and days feeling good being the exceptions          see Table                           QOL          Quality of life improved during this month trial          with the composite score rising from an initial  to           at  months and  at  months n   each time          point P for trend  E on a scale of  to  with           being a delighted quality of life There were          significant differences between initial and  month          scores and initial and  month scores but not between           and  month scores P   with Bonferroni          correction The biggest impact was seen in active          recreation health socializing and participation in          organizations                          SF          The SF health survey breaks down health into           subheadings These areas are physical functioning role          physical bodily pain general health vitality social          functioning role emotional and mental health see Table            of these  areas bodily pain being the exception          showed significant improvement n   each time point          all P for trend   There were significant          differences for these  headings between initial and           month scores except for general health and also between          initial and  month scores but not between  and  month          scores P   with Bonferroni correction          Norms for the general populations responses to the          SF questionnaire have been published              Initially the mean score for all of the SF scales          were significantly lower than the norms for women ages           After  months of dietary intervention  scales          were no longer significantly different from the norms          showing marked improvement general health vitality          role emotional mental health see Table                           Responders versus nonresponders          A point improvement in the FIQ score was used to          distinguish responders from nonresponders  subjects          were classified as responders  as nonresponders and           individuals did not follow through on initial          evaluations Mean FIQ score improvement for responders          was  points with a range from  to  points Mean          FIQ score decreased by  points for nonresponders          with a range from  to  points The responders          SF scores at  months for all scales except bodily          pain were no longer statistically different from norms          for women ages  Responders to the dietary          intervention also had significant improvements in          physical performance and QOL scores data not shown          while nonresponders had no significant change in their          fibromyalgia status                            Discussion        The connection between dietary and lifestyle habits with        chronic diseases has become increasingly strong in the past        several years Most of the research has been towards the        prevention of chronic disease rather than toward its        treatment        The natural course of fibromyalgia shows that symptoms        are generally the same over at least  years     A        stable sharp reduction in symptoms in seven months as we        have reported here is a definite alteration of the natural        history of fibromyalgia        Group treatment of fibromyalgia patients using a        multifaceted approach resulted in a  improvement in        overall FIQ score and a  cm increase in sit and reach        flexibility     This study resulted in even greater        improvements with a  improvement in overall FIQ score        and a  cm increase in sitandreach flexibility A        sixweek exercise and education program produced a total        drop in  FIQ subscales of  points     these same        subscales in this study decreased by  points after the        dietary intervention reported here This comparison shows        that education and exercise are not as an effective        intervention as this dietary intervention        As mentioned vegetarian dietary intervention of        fibromyalgia has been tested by two investigators In a        small study of  patients Hostmark et al    found a        week vegetarian diet produced an improvement in        subjective wellbeing Increase in wellbeing as seen in        the improvement in quality of life FIQ and SF scores        was also seen in our study In a recent study Kaartinen et        al    used a strict livingfoods pure vegetarian diet        in month nonrandomized controlled study of FMS        Investigators saw significant improvements in pain scores        and significantly less morning stiffness similar to our        results Apparently the diet was difficult to implement and        no subjects continued with the livingfoods diet        Symptoms returned upon reverting back to a more standard        diet showing even more clearly the association of diet and        FMS Maintenance of diets requiring more food preparation        time and uncommon foods is difficult Since the diet used        here is mainly based on common foods the longterm        adherence to the program is likely to be higher Subjects        learned which foods caused them the most symptoms so that        they avoided these foods on a longterm basis        Initial scores using the SF health survey compared        to population norms were very similar to those reported        elsewhere     This indicates that our fibromyalgia        subjects were very similar to other surveyed groups in        terms of their health status Initial FIQ scores are also        in line with other studies     After  months the         subjects that responded to the diet were no longer        statistically different from the general population of        women aged  except for bodily pain This indicates a        remarkable recovery of function in a short period of        time        Selfreported pain was significantly reduced as measured        by the FIQ and by the physical performance measurements        but not as measured by the SF questionnaire Both the        FIQ and physical performance measure used a visual analog        scale from  to measure pain whereas the SF only        used  questions with a total range of  points to measure        bodily pain This may have made the SF a less sensitive        measure of bodily pain than the other two measures        It was unclear whether or not closer adherence to the        diet by the nonresponders would have resulted in better        success Without rapid improvements a few subjects lost        motivation and adhered less to the diet while others saw        positive results within a couple of weeks thus encouraging        them to continue faithfully The basis for not responding        to the diet may have been physiological rather than        motivational Further research will help answer this        question        What caused the significant improvements seen in this        intervention study There is likely a synergy of both        physiological and psychological factors The change in diet        gave the subjects motivation to take control of their        symptoms to overcome their disabilities and inactivity        People that believed that a change in their diet would        improve their symptoms were attracted to this study The        effect of expecting a positive result was not measured but        it certainly was beneficial to the subjects        Some aspects of the new diet also improve fatigue and        sleep patterns so that overwhelming fatigue did not        squelch subjects newfound motivation Subjects could begin        an upward cycle out of their FMS symptoms rather        continuing the downward trend toward further disability        chronic pain and depression        Intakes of fats protein fiber several vitamins        including the antioxidants vitamin C vitamin E and        betacarotene and minerals especially magnesium        potassium and zinc are significantly different from the        general populations dietary intake see Table  so it is        difficult to single out which factors were most important        in producing the dramatic improvements seen in this study        The improvement is likely the synergistic result of several        factors It is unlikely that a single factor or a dietary        supplement will be able to reproduce the results generated        by an overall dietary change        Though the FFQ used in this study has not been validated        rigorously a comparison to day semiquantitative dietary        intake of people following the same Hallelujah Diet        unpublished data showed that on an energy basis the        only significant differences between nutrient intakes        reported here and in that survey were for fiber and vitamin        A So it appears that the FFQ captured nutrient intakes        satisfactorily        Our study had several limitations First because all of        the subjects did not currently meet the diagnosis criteria        of FMS the results cannot be compared directly with other        studies Its possible but cannot be proven here that        greater improvement would have been seen with people who        were experiencing more pain Its also possible that        subjects with less severe pain were able to improve        quicker Equal percentages of subjects with more than         painful tender points were found among responders and        nonresponders        Second as an unblinded observational study there was no        direct comparison with a control group Many historical        controls were available and the natural chronic course of        FMS is well described However the results would certainly        be stronger if an active control group was included        Another limitation was the size of the treatment group        Though the subjects here seemed to be representative of        people with FMS it is not certain that the same results        would be seen in a large study These results should be        reproduced and extended in a larger controlled trial                    Conclusions        In summary a diet intervention using a mostly raw pure        vegetarian diet produced dramatic improvements in FMS        symptoms  of  participants responded very favorably to        the intervention seeing marked improvement in all FMS        symptoms This dietary intervention shows that many        fibromyalgia subjects can be helped even without        understanding the full cause of their symptoms Further        controlled studies are needed to reproduce and extend the        results obtained here to see if this dietary intervention        is a viable adjunctive therapy for managing fibromyalgia in        a clinical setting
