  okay uh in my community they are doing a lot as as as far as recycling goes uh Wacos a pretty small city and so a lot of the city people       i guess they want they take they take care of the community more than i would think that a big city does or they can because theyre smaller and so theyre doing all kinds of recycling projects and the school kids are doing all kinds of things and im a im a news reporter and so i   yeah yeah   report on a lot of the recycling things that they do and just last week they opened up a new recycling center uh so now they have two uh in an adjoining community uh Hewett   uhhuh   they are doing uh curbside recycling which is something a lot of cities are starting to look into but for some cities its very expensive   oh yeah yeah Plano just uh just started a program where they uh they gave everybody these big plastic garbage cans   so uhhuh   and uh what theyre doing is on Thursday they pick up the regular garbage and these plastic garbage cans but on Mondays uh if you leave they have these special huge paper bags   right umhum right   and if you put your clippings in that theyll pick that up on Mondays and   umhum yeah thats a form of the curbside yeah   yeah right and then as i understand it theyre uh theyre planning to um start giving everybody containers to put aluminum and glass in to to recycle that as well so   um umhum i know even uh WalMart Department Store i dont if they do it there they have the recycling bin right outside the store   right oh wow   and its got glass aluminum plastic and   yeah i know all the the grocery stores here have a a bins when you walk in if you want to recycle your paper bags or plastic bags   uhhuh right the plastic bags   so uh i think its great uh um i know the kids uh at school are being indoctrinated into the whole idea i know my daughter came home the other night   umhum uhhuh yeah   and um she was all excited because they gave her an eight hundred number to call to find out where your local recycling center was       and she called it and turns out the the nearest ones in Garland which is about i dont know forty five minutes to an hour from here but   wow do you recycle yourself at home do you   yeah we um in fact ive got a car full of newspapers that were trying to   umhum uhhuh   the uh heres a sort of i guess a a setback uh there were a couple of places that used to collect newspapers just around here and we went to all of them yesterday and none of them had bins for for the papers so   umhum hm   i dont know if they just discontinued it or   its kind of rough doing the newspaper i understand because the they cant recycle the uh i guess its the sale papers that have the color on them   oh yeah   and so its kind of hard for them to i guess uh separate all that   yeah i know we dont sort that out um   umhum yeah i dont think anybody would you know i dont think they can put the colored paper on there or something so that should be pretty difficult   yeah and oh yeah   i dont recycle myself i live im single and so  i guess if i had a family id probably be more aware than now that i am single but uh   yeah right right i i you probably uh eat uh fast food type stuff and uh on the go   yeah yeah especially on my job im hardly ever home so you know my   yeah well when i was single i was a reporter too i so i uh i can identify with you um  uh i know that a lot of times that youre working double shifts and odd hours and   uhhuh yeah yeah umhum yeah   you just eat when you have something to eat   you just go in and you dont know when youre coming out   right   so but uh lets see what else are they doing   so   uh jeez im all out of recycling   i know uh the Boy Scouts collect newspapers here and uh and uh in in fact the theres a the kids at the end of the block come by every once in a while when they want extra money   umhum uhhuh   they they come by uh collecting aluminum cans because we have places that you can go where you can the city the city has places where you can just dump the aluminum cans but uh   hm right my mother before all this recycling stuff started i guess well not before it all started but she would collect the cans and you go like in front of the supermarkets or whatever and you put the cans in this bin thing and it spits out money yeah thats   yeah yeah yeah well thats where thats where these kids take their aluminum cans   yeah yeah that that freaked me out when we first did that i thought okay     yeah you you dont get rich on those right right huh   we got like eight cents or something  yeah exactly uh so at work we do recycle we have a little recycling bin for our cans and bottles and uh those go out   yeah the where where i work they just started a paper drive and in fact everybody has two trash cans   uhhuh hm   uh one is for your normal crap trash and one is just for paper and they uh they had a big campaign for it and theres a list of things that youre allowed to put in the paper bin   uhhuh umhum   and uh you know and but they theyre pretty good about it it doesnt you know you can have the staples in them and the paper clips on them and the plastic windows   wow   they take care of all of that but they dont want certain types of paper uh they dont want anything you know they dont want you know like transparencies overheads you know they dont want any of that in there   wow right uhhuh just regular paper and   right they dont want the garbage from your from your lunch in there um and uh and theres uh even little um uh this uh board   hm right umhum   outside the cafeteria that that shows uh has a its a picture of a tree with a with a squirrel going up and its like a a a gauge and the higher the squirrel goes up the more trees youve saved   umhum oh   and it shows you how many thousands of trees uh have been saved because of the recycling program at work   so like so that gives you kind of an incentive   right right   well thats great if you know that like a lot of things you pick up today almost everything says recyclable or this is made from recyclables or something its its amazing it really is its amazing to me how fast i im sure recyclings been going on forever and its just   right right right yeah yeah   i guess everyone is picking it up now you know but its just amazing to me how much its come in the last year since last Earth Day you know everythings i mean recycle recycle everywhere you go   right oh yeah right well i know when i was a kid uh which was quite a while ago um we used to collect newspapers and take them to the there was a uh i dont know what it was a plant that it was a paper plant i guess it was that was fairly close to where i lived in Richmond Virginia and um   umhum umhum umhum   you could you bring your papers in to sell them there i remember doing that when i was a kid and uh   hm i remember my mother used to take the Coke bottles in and you get like ten ten cents or something like that   oh yeah sure yeah right thats right   yeah i guess that was a form of but now its just like perpetrated into the crowd into the you know society its like if you dont recycle you feel you feel almost uh   right   i dont know like youre doing something wrong or you feel guilty almost so hm   thats right yeah well thats good i mean were such a were such a um throwaway society   yeah wasteful umhum umhum   its uh its nice because you know uh if you talk to people who grew up during the depression   uhhuh   nothing was wasted i mean everything and nowadays its like you know nobody darns their socks i mean if you see a hole in it you throw it away by a new pair of socks you know kind of thing and uh i   yeah yeah throw it away thats it yeah were spoiled very spoiled   yeah i you know i guess i believe the propaganda if you want to call it that that uh um you know were uh were we we have limited resources and uh we really should think about uh conserving them instead of wasting them   right i know im doing the story big story im covering now is of about our landfill here   uhhuh   and uh what was it i think twenty four million tons of garbage that we throw away   wow   everywhere everywhere America could be recycled   yeah wow   like twenty four million to and i think that accounts for uh i think one quarter or half of the landfill space     wow   so i mean i just learn all these little   yeah   uh propaganda things   you cant always i mean itd be nice if you could if the landfill space was reusable but it isnt it all it it isnt always i know sometimes it is   oh yeah yeah not at all   i know theres place called Mount Trashmore Trashmore which is a a park that they built on top of a landfill   hm umhum hm   and i cant remember where it is i think its in Washington DC or thereabouts   Mount Trashmore i havent heard of that one   yeah but uh   yeah thats like the big stink around here this landfill thing theyre wanting to expand it and a lot of the community the people that live around the area dont want it expanded because you know they say itll uh   yeah   uh poison their water and you know poison the air and theres an elementary school right across the street and all kinds of stuff so its a pretty pretty big issue   yeah well yeah i i guess uh you know the scary the the scary part is that you dont know what the effects are you know fifty years from now   umhum exactly   you know its easy to say well well build a concrete hole and and nothingll happen and then theyll say well the only way to test that is over a long period of time so   umhum umhum right right thats what a lot of people are saying that it may not hurt now but theyre looking in the long run you know and theyre saying well forty years from now well   right right and theres and theres no way to measure that i mean you you know you the only way is to take the chance and see what happens forty years from now and who knows what kind of havoc youve created   yeah umhum hm yeah people dont want to wait   uh by the no nope
