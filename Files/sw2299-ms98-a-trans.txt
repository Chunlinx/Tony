                so what do you think about it how are we doing in recycling are we   well i think we need to do more i i mean i know i need to do more they have programs around where you can reach they uh they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up   umhum   but i have a hard time of being able of separating you know having a place separating my trash and get all the cans from the paper and you know i just havent gotten that dedicated yet so   yeah yeah and see i do a lot of work with the boy scouts and we try to do a lot   uhhuh   but theres still a lot more we can do you know i dont recycle my newspapers myself but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a   yeah   like a a clothes hamper kind of thing that you know you lay your string in then you put your papers in there and tie them all up and bundle them up so i figured i might get me one of those   uhhuh uhhuh   because we dont always read the newspaper sometimes it just sits around for a while and then we just chuck it   yeah well i dont i dont get the paper every day but i you know i get it on i try to buy you know the early edition for the coupons you know the Sunday edition so     yeah   but then i just you know bundle it up and put it on the front you know the front walk every you know every Monday or every other Monday and   yeah   have them pick that up but thats the extent of what ive done id like to be able to do more the problem is with a lot of it is you have to go you know it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it you know its not always convenient to do it   yeah see and yeah see and here in Lubbock everythings so close i can imagine what its like up there   yeah im not exactly sure where the you know the can thing is but you know sometimes its just so seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them   yeah yeah see i went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall   uhhuh   and then i put me a little five gallon bucket and its just outside the garage door so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket   uhhuh do those can crushers work good   yeah i got one from Payless Cashways and its actually metal   uhhuh   its not plastic i didnt want to buy a plastic one   yeah because those things i think would just snap you know   yeah but Payless Cashways has them and theyre metal and i dont know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there but it was only like seven dollars not too bad   oh   so   id have to check into something like that because i mean we dont drink a whole lot of soda around here you know but um   yeah   you know occasionally we have some around but you know for other kind of cans just to itd probably only take aluminum cans like that dont they   yeah i dont yeah i dont think it would crush steel cans its pretty tough   yeah so i dont know i dont think you have to to crush the other ones for them to get to take that but   no you could probably just you know   i need to look into it more you know its you know it sometimes even with the newspaper they say theyll only take certain types of paper you know they wont take paper thats shiny   yeah they wont yeah they wont take any lint free paper or see i work at TI   yeah so does my husband yeah   and we do a lot of recycling out there now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard but thats just now come on board   uhhuh uhhuh   you know weve been throwing paper out there away for years and were just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out you know   uhhuh yeah i dont know what you know i havent im sure theyre probably doing that here some   yeah im sure they are TI is doing it pretty well nationwide im sure   uhhuh i think its necessary i i like it you know it makes i think its good that you see these you know like boxes cereal theyre now starting to make them you know the packages out of recycled paper and   oh yeah   and ive bought you know ive bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper and i think theyre just fine   yeah yeah i bought a i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work its his birthday were pretty good friends and what it is is a recycled paper bag   uhhuh   and its just got Happy Birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside and its just a paper bag   uhhuh   you know and its really cute   yeah   but i think were doing better and better all the time i still dont   yeah i think were getting becoming more conscious because we just cant stick everything in landfills any more so   no theres not going to be any room shortly   no no   you know i dont know what New York does about theirs i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere   yeah its probably sitting out on the barge somewhere   yeah so but i think were getting better at it i think theres quite a bit more we could do   yeah yeah  girls put that away now   but youre right sometimes it does seem like its more trouble than what it would be worth but   yeah i just wish it was a little more convenient convenient to do you know   yeah   seems like youre so busy anyway and then thats just one more thing to have to worry about so   yeah it sure is   i think if you know the cities locally you know theyd get more programs going so that you could do that itd make it a lot easier so   yeah yeah well theyll get at it sooner i guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later they   yeah yeah get the kids interested in it too so   you know they have we tried to have a aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that i have and we just dont have any place to store those kind of cans   yeah   you know if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure theyll save them for us theres no problem there but what do you do with them in the meantime now i dont want a can a garage full of cans   uhhuh thats right thats right who does that you know people dont have room for that kind of stuff     you know no theyre just not theyre not prepared for it   no and in Texas theyre just get things like that they just get bugs in them so   yeah yeah they do and you know the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get thats for sure   so you dont thats right so   so   im pretty lazy about it right now everything goes into one thing and goes out to the  you know pick it up so   yeah yeah myself about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans   uhhuh   s o   yeah well i need to get better get better at it so   well if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way you know   yeah thats right thats right   if everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then   thats true   well get there   thats right   well thank you for talking to me   yeah well thank you for calling i   sure no problem   okay take care   all righty byebye   byebye
