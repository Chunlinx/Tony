                                 Not Gotcha            My                   Slate                colleague Jacob Weisbergargues that the  lets call it the unfolding of Vice PresidentGores position on the great JointChiefs Gay Litmus Test issue was not sufficiently flipfloppy toconstitute a reversal Many commentators in                   Slate               s Frayecho this view dismissing the whole controversy as a phony media game ofgotcha I respectfully disagree            First of course it was a reversal Initially Gore said he wouldrequire that any Chiefs nominee be in agreement with his gay policy Then hecame back and denied there should ever be any kind of inquiry into thepersonal political opinion of officers in the US military The only litmustest explained his adviser Robert Shrum was the banal constitutional onecivilian control of the military Under Gores Position No  Colin Powelland Norman Schwarzkopf get bounced Under Position No  it would seem theydont since they presumably agree with the principle of civilian control            Weisberg says no there is little functional difference between demandingagreement and Gores second position demanding constitutionallyrequiredsupport since Gore knows that those who disagree are likely to sabotage hispolicy The only difference Weisberg says is that demanding support leaves open the theoretical possibility of appointing a military officer sohonorable that he will work assiduously to implement a policy he personallydisagrees with But under Gores second position Gore wont know whopersonally agrees or disagrees with his policy since he says he wont inquireinto the actual views of Chiefs candidates Dont Ask DontTell            More important Weisberg assumes that Gore would never appoint somebody whodisagrees and might therefore sabotage the policy among disagreers only thetheoretical perfectly honorable officer would pass muster But its exactlythat assumption that bothers those who worry about a litmus testthe ideaGore would give a privileged position to the gay issue ruling out a candidatewho was otherwise a military genius and inspirational leader solely because hehad in Gores mind retrograde views on gays            That implication in Gores answer No  is what made it genuinelytroubling a legitimate gaffe It suggested the vice president was so keen onhis gay policy that he would give it higher priority than other militaryissues such as how to win wars or counter the Chinese and Russian threatsActually given the crippling effect of the gay controversy on the first sixmonths of Clintons presidency it implied Gore was willing to give the gayissue priority over nonmilitary issues as well Not that again you couldalmost hear voters saying There are other more important concerns for apresident than integrating gays into the armed forces Its time for somesensible gay leader to point this out Andrew Sullivan are you still readingthis            At best Gores gaffe revealed a candidate so eager to pander to aDemocratic constituency that he lost his bearings and overstepped the bounds ofgood political judgment Thats certainly forgivablebut wasnt Gores uniqueselling proposition supposed to be his dullbutsound reliability You meanhes boring and a bit of a hothead too            PS Weisbergs right to ridicule Gores Position No why shouldnt apresident inquire into the personal views of a Joint Chiefs candidate and tryto appoint someone who agrees with him A general who disagrees with a policyis indeed likely to implement it unenthusiastically Gore could have saidYes Ill consider a candidates viewsId be naive not tobut Ill look atthe whole man and the whole range of military issues not just this oneissue In somersaulting from personalviewsarealitmustest to Ill neverconsider personal views Gore leapt completely over this sensible obviousanswer But that doesnt make his performance any less of a reversal or anymore reassuring
