good laboratorypractices and laboratory evaluation related to toxicity testingsee FDA  USEPA d USEPA b USEPA c USEPAc DeWoskin  and Taylor Guidelines for the evaluation of laboratory performingtoxicity tests and laboratory evaluation criteria are found inUSEPA cFACILITIES EQUIPMENT AND TEST CHAMBERSSeparate test organism culturing and toxicity testingareas should be provided to avoid possible loss of cultures due tocrosscontamination Ventilation systems should be designed andoperated to prevent recirculation or leakage of air from chemicalanalysis laboratories or sample storage and preparation areas intoorganism culturing or testing areas and from testing and samplepreparation areas into culture roomsLaboratory and toxicity test temperature controlequipment must be adequate to maintain recommended test watertemperatures Recommended materials must be used in the fabricationof the test equipment which comes in contact with the effluent seeSection  Facilities Equipment and Supplies and specifictoxicity test methodTEST ORGANISMSThe test organisms used in the procedures described inthis manual are the sheepshead minnow Cyprinodon variegatus theinland silverside Menidia beryllina the mysid Mysidopsis bahiathe sea urchin Arbacia punctulata and the red macroalga Champiaparvula The organisms used should be diseasefree and appearhealthy behave normally feed well and have low mortality incultures during holding and in test control Test organismsshould be positively identified to species see Section  TestOrganismsLABORATORY WATER USED FOR CULTURING AND TEST DILUTIONWATER The quality of water used for test organism culturing andfor dilution water used in toxicity tests is extremely importantWater for these two uses should come from the same source Thedilution water used in effluent toxicity tests will depend on theobjectives of the study and logistical constraints as discussed inSection  Dilution Water The dilution water used in the toxicitytests may be natural seawater hypersaline brine  preparedfrom natural seawater or artificial seawater prepared fromcommercial sea salts such as FORTY FATHOMS or HW MARINEMIX ifrecommended in the method GP synthetic seawater made fromreagent grade chemical salts  in conjunction with naturalseawater may also be used if recommended Hypersaline brine andartificial seawater can be used with Champia parvula only if theyare accompanied by at least  natural seawater Types of waterare discussed in Section  Facilities Equipment and SuppliesWater used for culturing and test dilution water should be analyzedfor toxic metals and organics at least annually or wheneverdifficulty is encountered in meeting minimum acceptability criteriafor control survival and reproduction or growth The concentrationof the metals Al As Cr Co Cu Fe Pb Ni Zn expressed astotal metal should not exceed  gL each and Cd Hg and Agexpressed as total metal should not exceed  ngL each Totalorganochlorine pesticides plus PCBs should be less than  ngLAPHA  Pesticide concentrations should not exceed USEPAsNational Ambient Water Quality chronic criteria values whereavailable EFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER SAMPLING AND HANDLINGSample holding times and temperatures of effluent samplescollected for onsite and offsite testing must conform toconditions described in Section  Effluent and Receiving WaterSampling Sample Handling and Sample Preparation for ToxicityTestsTEST CONDITIONSWater temperature and salinity should be maintainedwithin the limits specified for each test The temperature of testsolutions must be measured by placing the thermometer or probedirectly into the test solutions or by placing the thermometer inequivalent volumes of water in surrogate vessels positioned atappropriate locations among the test vessels Temperature should berecorded continuously in at least one vessel during the duration ofeach test Test solution temperatures should be maintained withinthe limits specified for each test DO concentrations and pH shouldbe checked at the beginning of the test and daily throughout thetest periodQUALITY OF TEST ORGANISMSThe health of test organisms is primarily assessed by theperformance survival growth andor reproduction of organisms incontrol treatments of individual tests The health and sensitivityof test organisms is also assessed by reference toxicant testingIn addition to documenting the sensitivity and health of testorganisms reference toxicant testing is used to initiallydemonstrate acceptable laboratory performance Subsection  andto document ongoing laboratory performance SubsectionRegardless of the source of test organisms inhousecultures or purchased from external suppliers the testinglaboratory must perform at least one acceptable reference toxicanttest per month for each toxicity test method conducted in thatmonth Subsection  If a test method is conducted onlymonthly or less frequently a reference toxicant test must beperformed concurrently with each effluent toxicity testWhen acute or shortterm chronic toxicity tests areperformed with effluents or receiving waters using test organismsobtained from outside the test laboratory concurrent toxicitytests of the same type must be performed with a reference toxicantunless the test organism supplier provides control chart data fromat least the last five monthly shortterm chronic toxicity testsusing the same reference toxicant and test conditions see Section Test OrganismsThe supplier should certify the species identification ofthe test organisms and provide the taxonomic reference citationand page or names of the taxonomic expertsconsultedIf a routine reference toxicant test fails to meet testacceptability criteria then the reference toxicant test must beimmediately repeatedFOOD QUALITYThe nutritional quality of the food used in culturing andtesting fish and invertebrates is an important factor in thequality of the toxicity test data This is especially true for theunsaturated fatty acid content of brine shrimp nauplii ArtemiaProblems with the nutritional suitability of the food will bereflected in the survival growth and reproduction of the testorganisms in cultures and toxicity tests Artemia cysts and otherfoods must be obtained as described in Section  FacilitiesEquipment and SuppliesProblems with the nutritional suitability of food will bereflected in the survival growth and reproduction of the testorganisms in cultures and toxicity tests If a batch of food issuspected to be defective the performance of organisms fed withthe new food can be compared with the performance of organisms fedwith a food of known quality in sidebyside tests If the food isused for culturing its suitability should be determined using ashortterm chronic test which will determine the affect of foodquality on growth or reproduction of each of the relevant testspecies in culture using four replicates with each food sourceWhere applicable foods used only in chronic toxicity tests can becompared with a food of known quality in sidebysidemulticoncentration chronic tests using the reference toxicantregularly employed in the laboratory QA programNew batches of food used in culturing and testing shouldbe analyzed for toxic organics and metals or whenever difficulty isencountered in meeting minimum acceptability criteria for controlsurvival and reproduction or growth If the concentration of totalorganochlorine pesticides exceeds  gg wet weight or theconcentration of total organochlorine pesticides plus PCBs exceeds gg wet weight or toxic metals Al As Cr Cd Cu Pb NiZn expressed as total metal exceed  gg wet weight the foodshould not be used for analytical methods see AOAC  andUSDA For foods eg YCT which are used to culture and testorganisms the quality of the food should meet the requirements forthe laboratory water used for culturing and test dilution water asdescribed in Section  aboveACCEPTABILITY OF CHRONIC TOXICITY TESTS The results of the sheepshead minnow Cyprinodonvariegatus inland silverside Menidia beryllina or mysidMysidopsis bahia tests are acceptable if survival in the controlsis  or greater The sea urchin Arbacia punctulata testrequires control egg fertilization equal to or exceeding However greater than  fertilization may result in masking toxicresponses The red macroalga Champia parvula test is acceptableif survival is  and the mean number of cystocarps per plantshould equal or exceed  If the sheepshead minnow Cyprindonvariegatus larval survival and growth test is begun withlessthanh old larvae the mean dry weight of the survivinglarvae in the control chambers at the end of the test must equal orexceed  mg if the weights are determined immediately ormg if the larvae are preserved in a  formalin or ethanol solution If the inland silverside Menidia beryllinalarval survival and growth test is begun with larvae seven daysold the mean dry weight of the surviving larvae in the controlchambers at the end of the test must equal or exceed  mg ifthe weights are determined immediately or  mg if the larvaeare preserved in a  formalin or  ethanol solution The meanmysid dry weight of survivors must be at least  mg Automaticor hourly feeding will generally provide control mysids with a dryweight of  mg At least  of the females should bear eggs atthe end of the test but mysid fecundity is not a factor in testacceptability However fecundity must equal or exceed  to beused as an endpoint in the test If these criteria are not met thetest must be repeatedAn individual test may be conditionally acceptable iftemperature DO and other specified conditions fall outsidespecifications depending on the degree of the departure and theobjectives of the tests see test conditions and test acceptabilitycriteria summaries The acceptability of the test will depend onthe experience and professional judgment of the laboratoryinvestigator and the reviewing staff of the regulatory authorityAny deviation from test specifications must be noted when reportingdata from a test ANALYTICAL METHODSRoutine chemical and physical analyses for culture anddilution water food and test solutions must include establishedquality assurance practices outlined in USEPA methods manualsUSEPA a and USEPA bReagent containers should be dated and catalogued whenreceived from the supplier and the shelf life should not beexceeded Also working solutions should be dated when preparedand the recommended shelf life should be observedCALIBRATION AND STANDARDIZATIONInstruments used for routine measurements of chemical andphysical parameters such as pH DO temperature conductivity andsalinity must be calibrated and standardized according toinstrument manufacturers procedures as indicated in the generalsection on quality assurance see USEPA Methods   and  in USEPA b Calibration data are recorded ina permanent log bookWet chemical methods used to measure hardnessalkalinity and total residual chlorine must be standardized priorto use each day according to the procedures for those specificUSEPA methods see USEPA Methods  and  in USEPAbREPLICATION AND TEST SENSITIVITYThe sensitivity of the tests will depend in part on thenumber of replicates per concentration the significance levelselected and the type of statistical analysis If the variabilityremains constant the sensitivity of the test will increase as thenumber of replicates is increased The minimum recommended numberof replicates varies with the objectives of the test and thestatistical method used for analysis of the dataVARIABILITY IN TOXICITY TEST RESULTSFactors which can affect test success and precisioninclude  the experience and skill of the laboratory analyst test organism age condition and sensitivity  dilutionwater quality  temperature control  and the quality andquantity of food provided The results will depend upon the speciesused and the strain or source of the test organisms and testconditions such as temperature DO food and water quality Therepeatability or precision of toxicity tests is also a function ofthe number of test organisms used at each toxicant concentrationJensen  discussed the relationship between sample sizenumber of fish and the standard error of the test and considered fish per concentration as optimum for ProbitAnalysisTEST PRECISIONThe ability of the laboratory personnel to obtainconsistent precise results must be demonstrated with referencetoxicants before they attempt to measure effluent toxicity Thesinglelaboratory precision of each type of test to be used in alaboratory should be determined by performing at least five or moretests with a reference toxicantTest precision can be estimated by using the same strainof organisms under the same test conditions and employing a knowntoxicant such as a reference toxicantInterlaboratory precision data from a  study ofchronic toxicity tests using two reference toxicants with themysid Mysidopsis bahia and the inland silverside Menidiaberyllina is listed in Table  Table  shows interlaboratoryprecision data from a study of three chronic toxicity test methodsusing effluent receiving water and reference toxicant sampletypes USEPA a USEPA b For the Mysidopsis bahia andthe Cyprinodon variegatus test methods the effluent sample was amunicipal wastewater spiked with KCl the receiving water samplewas a river water spiked with KCl and the reference toxicantsample was bioassaygrade FORTY FATHOMSsynthetic seawater spiked with KCl For the Menidia beryllinatest method the effluent sample was an industrial wastewaterspiked with CuSO the receiving water sample was a naturalseawater spiked with CuSO and the reference toxicant sample wasbioassaygrade FORTY FATHOMS synthetic seawater spiked with CuSOAdditional precision data for each of the tests described in thismanual are presented in the sections describing the individual testmethodsAdditional information on toxicity test precision isprovided in the Technical Support Document for Water QualitybasedToxic Control see pp  and  in USEPA aIn cases where the test data are used in Probit Analysisor other point estimation techniques see Section  ChronicToxicity Test Endpoints and Data Analysis precision can bedescribed by the mean standard deviation and relative standarddeviation percent coefficient of variation or CV of thecalculated endpoints from the replicated tests In cases where thetest data are used in the Linear Interpolation Method precisioncan be estimated by empirical confidence intervals derived by usingthe ICPIN Method see Section  Chronic Toxicity Test Endpointsand Data Analysis However in cases where the results arereported in terms of the NoObservedEffectConcentration NOECand LowestObservedEffectConcentration LOEC see Section Chronic Toxicity Test Endpoints and Data Analysis precision canonly be described by listing the NOECLOEC interval for each testIt is not possible to express precision in terms of a commonly usedstatistic However when all tests of the same toxicant yield thesame NOECLOEC interval maximum precision has been attained Thetrue no effect concentration could fall anywhere within theinterval NOEC  LOEC minus NOECIt should be noted here that the dilution factor selectedfor a test determines the width of the NOECLOEC interval and theinherent maximum precision of the test As the absolute value ofthe dilution factor decreases the width of the NOECLOEC intervalincreases and the inherent maximum precision of the testdecreases When a dilution factor of  is used the NOEC could beconsidered to have a relative uncertainty as high as   With adilution factor of  the NOEC could be considered to have arelative variability of   As a result of the variability ofdifferent dilution factors USEPA recommends the use of a  dilution factor Other factors which can affect test precisioninclude test organism age condition and sensitivity

types ICs or ICs were pooled forall laboratories to calculate the CV for each sample type Theresulting CVs were then averaged across sample types DEMONSTRATING ACCEPTABLE LABORATORYPERFORMANCEIt is a laboratorys responsibilityto demonstrate its ability to obtain consistent precise resultswith reference toxicants before it performs toxicity tests witheffluents for permit compliance purposes To meet this requirementthe intralaboratory precision expressed as percent coefficient ofvariation CV of each type of test to be used in a laboratoryshould be determined by performing five or more tests withdifferent batches of test organisms using the same referencetoxicant at the same concentrations with the same test conditionsie the same test duration type of dilution water age of testorganisms

concentrationsDOCUMENTING ONGOING LABORATORY PERFORMANCESatisfactory laboratory performance is demonstrated byperforming at least one acceptable test per month with a referencetoxicant for each toxicity test method conducted in the laboratoryduring that month For a given test method successive tests mustbe performed with the same reference toxicant at the sameconcentrations in the same dilution water using the same dataanalysis methods Precision may vary with the test speciesreference toxicant and type of test Each laboratorys referencetoxicity data will reflect conditions unique to that facilityincluding dilution water culturing and other variables howevereach laboratorys reference toxicity results should reflect goodrepeatabilityA control chart should be prepared for each combinationof reference toxicant test species test conditions andendpoints Toxicity endpoints from five or six tests are adequatefor establishing the control charts Successive toxicity endpointsNOECs ICs LCs etc should be plotted and examined todetermine if the results X are within prescribed limits Figure The chart should plot logarithm of concentration on thevertical axis against the date of the test or test number on thehorizontal axis The types of control charts illustrated seeUSEPA a are used to evaluate the cumulative trend of resultsfrom a series of samples thus reference toxicant test resultsshould not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection ofindividual effluent or receiving water tests For endpoints thatare point estimates LCs and ICs the cumulative mean X andupper and lower control limits  S are recalculated with eachsuccessive test result Endpoints from hypothesis tests NOECNOAEC from each test are plotted directly on the control chartThe control limits would consist of one concentration intervalabove and below the concentration representing the centraltendency After two years of data collection or a minimum of data points the control chart should be maintained using only the most recent data pointsLaboratories should compare the calculated CV iestandard deviation  mean of the IC for the  most recent datapoints to the distribution of laboratory CVs reported nationallyfor reference toxicant testing Table  in USEPA b If thecalculated CV exceeds the th percentile of CVs reportednationally the laboratory should use the th and th percentilesto calculate warning and control limits respectively and thelaboratory should investigate options for reducing variabilityNote Because NOECs can only be a fixed number of discrete valuesthe mean standard deviation and CV cannot be interpreted andapplied in the same way that these descriptive statistics areinterpreted and applied for continuous variables such as the ICor LCThe outliers which are values falling outside the upperand lower control limits and trends of increasing or decreasingsensitivity are readily identified In the case of endpoints thatare point estimates LCs and ICs at the  probabilitylevel one in  tests would be expected to fall outside of thecontrol limits by chance alone If more than one out of reference toxicant tests fall outside the control limits thelaboratory should investigate sources of variability takecorrective actions to reduce identified sources of variability andperform an additional reference toxicant test during the samemonth Control limits for the NOECs will also be exceededoccasionally regardless of how well a laboratory performs Inthose instances when the laboratory can document the cause for theoutlier eg operator error culture health or test systemfailure the outlier should be excluded from the futurecalculations of thecontrol limits If two or more consecutive tests do not fallwithin the control limits the results must be explained and thereference toxicant test must be immediately repeated Actions takento correct the problem must be reportedIf the toxicity value from a given test with a referencetoxicant fall well outside the expected range for the testorganisms when using the standard dilution water and other testconditions the laboratory should investigate sources ofvariability take corrective actions to reduce identified sourcesof variability and perform an additional reference toxicant testduring the same month Performance should improve with experienceand the control limits for endpoints that are point estimatesshould gradually narrow However control limits of  S will beexceeded  of the time by chance alone regardless of how well alaboratory performs Highly proficient laboratories which developvery narrow control limits may be unfairly penalized if a testresult which falls just outside the control limits is rejected defacto For this reason the width of the control limits should beconsidered in determining whether or not a reference toxicant testresult falls well outside the expected range The width of thecontrol limits may be evaluated by comparing the calculated CVie standard deviation  mean of the IC for the  mostrecent data points to the distribution of laboratory CVs reportednationally for reference toxicant testing Table  in USEPAb In determining whether or not a reference toxicant testresult falls well outside the expected range the result also maybe compared with upper and lower bounds for  S as any resultoutside these control limits would be expected to occur by chanceonly  out of  tests Environment Canada  When a resultfrom a reference toxicant test is outside the  confidenceintervals the laboratory must conduct an immediate investigationto assess the possible causes for the outlierReference toxicant test resultsshould not be used as a de facto criterion for rejection ofindividual effluent or receiving water tests Reference toxicanttesting is used for evaluating the health and sensitivity oforganisms over time and for documenting initial and ongoinglaboratory performance While reference toxicant test resultsshould not be used as a de facto criterion for test rejectioneffluent and receiving water test results should be reviewed andinterpreted in the light of reference toxicant test results Thereviewer should consider the degree to which

species used in characterizing the chronic toxicityof effluents andor receiving waters will depend on therequirements of the regulatory authority and the objectives of thetest It is essential that good quality test organisms be readilyavailable throughout the year from inhouse or commercial sources tomeet NPDES monitoring requirements The organisms used in toxicitytests must be identified to species If there is any doubt as tothe identity of the test organisms representative specimens shouldbe sent to a taxonomic expert to confirm theidentificationToxicity test conditions and culture methods for thespecies listed in Subsection  are provided in this manualalso see USEPA aThe organisms used in the shortterm tests described inthis manual are the sheepshead minnow Cyprinodon variegatus theinland silverside Menidia beryllina the mysid Mysidopsis bahiathe sea urchin Arbacia punctulata and the red macroalga ChampiaparvulaSome states have developed culturing and testing methodsfor indigenous species that may be as sensitive or more sensitivethan the species recommended in Subsection  However USEPAallows the use of indigenous species only where state regulationsrequire their use or prohibit importation of the species inSubsection  Where state regulations prohibit importation ofnonnative fishes or use of the recommended test speciespermission must be requested from the appropriate state agencyprior to their useWhere states have developed culturing and testing methodsfor indigenous species other than those recommended in this manualdata comparing the sensitivity of the substitute species and one ormore of the recommended species must be obtained in sidebysidetoxicity tests with reference toxicants andor effluents to ensurethat the species selected are at least as sensitive as therecommended species These data must be submitted to the permittingauthority State or Region if required USEPA acknowledges thatreference toxicants prepared from pure chemicals may not always berepresentative of effluents However because of the observedandor potential variability in the quality and toxicity ofeffluents it is not possible to specify a representativeeffluentGuidance for the selection of testorganisms where the salinity of the effluent andor receiving waterrequires special consideration is provided in the Technical SupportDocument for Water Qualitybased Toxics Control USEPAaWhere the salinity of the receiving water is  freshwater organisms are used regardless of the salinity of theeffluentWhere the salinity of the receiving water is  thechoice of organisms depends on state water quality standards andorpermit requirementsSOURCES OF TEST ORGANISMSThe test organisms recommended in this manual can becultured in the laboratory using culturing and handling methods foreach organism described in the respective test method sectionsAlso see USEPA aInhouse cultures should be established wherever it iscost effective If inhouse cultures cannot be maintained or it isnot cost effective test organisms should be purchased fromexperienced commercial suppliers see USEPA bSheepshead minnows inland silversides mysids and seaurchins may be purchased from commercial suppliers However someof these organisms eg adult sheepshead minnows or adult inlandsilversides may not always be available from commercial suppliersand may have to be collected in the field and brought back to thelaboratory for spawning to obtain eggs and larvaeIf because of their source there is any uncertaintyconcerning the identity of the organisms it is advisable to havethem examined by a taxonomic specialist to confirm theiridentification For detailed guidance on identification see theindividual toxicity test methodsFERAL NATURAL OCCURRING WILD CAUGHTORGANISMS The use of test organisms taken from the receiving waterhas strong appeal and would seem to be the logical approachHowever it is generally impractical and not recommended for thefollowing reasonsSensitive organisms may not be present in the receivingwater because of previous exposure to the effluent or otherpollutantsIt is often difficult to collect organisms of therequired age and quality from the receiving waterMost states require collection permits which may bedifficult to obtain Therefore it is usually more cost effectiveto culture the organisms in the laboratory or obtain them fromprivate state or Federal sources Fish such as sheepshead minnowsand silversides and invertebrates such as mysids are easilyreared in the laboratory or purchasedThe required QAQC records such as the singlelaboratoryprecision data would not be availableSince it is mandatory that the identity of test organismsis known to the species level it would be necessary to examineeach organism caught in the wild to confirm its identity whichwould usually be impractical or at the least very stressful tothe organismsTest organisms obtained from the wild must be observed inthe laboratory for a minimum of one week prior to use to ensurethat they are free of signs of parasitic or bacterial infectionsand other adverse effects Fish captured by electroshocking mustnot be used in toxicity testingGuidelines for collection of natural occurring organismsare provided in USEPA  USEPA a and USEPAbRegardless of their source test organisms should becarefully observed to ensure that they are free of signs of stressand disease and in good physical condition Some species of testorganisms such as trout can be obtained from stocks certified asdiseasefreeLIFE STAGEYoung organisms are often more sensitive to toxicantsthan are adults For this reason the use of early life stagessuch as juvenile mysids and larval fish is required for all testsIn a given test all organisms should be approximately the same ageand should be taken from the same source Since age may affect theresults of the tests it would enhance the value and comparabilityof the data if the same species in the same life stages were usedthroughout a monitoring program at a given facilityLABORATORY CULTURINGInstructions for culturing andor holding the recommendedtest organisms are included in specified test methods also seeUSEPA aHOLDING AND HANDLING TEST ORGANISMSTest organisms should not be subjected to changes of morethan C in water temperature or  in salinity in any  hperiodOrganisms should be handled as little as possible Whenhandling is necessary it should be done as gently carefully andquickly as possible to minimize stress Organisms that are droppedor touch dry surfaces or are injured during handling must bediscarded Dipnets are best for handling larger organisms Thesenets are commercially available or can be made from smallmeshnylon netting silk bolting cloth plankton netting or similarmaterial Widebore smooth glass tubes  to  mm ID with rubberbulbs or pipettors such as a PROPIPETTE or other pipettor shouldbe used for transferring smaller organisms such as mysids andlarval fishHolding tanks for fish are supplied with a good qualitywater see Section  Facilities Equipment and Supplies with aflowthrough rate of at least two tankvolumes per day Otherwiseuse a recirculation system where the water flows through anactivated carbon or undergravel filter to remove dissolvedmetabolites Culture water can also be piped through high intensityultraviolet light sources for disinfection and to photodegradedissolved organicsCrowding should be avoided because it will stress theorganisms and lower the DO concentrations to unacceptable levelsThe DO must be maintained at a minimum of  mgL The solubilityof oxygen depends on temperature salinity and altitude Aerategently if necessaryThe organisms should be observed carefully each day forsigns of disease stress physical damage or mortality Dead andabnormal organisms should be removed as soon as observed It is notuncommon for some fish mortality  to occur during the first h in a holding tank because of individuals that refuse to feedon artificial food and die of starvation Organisms in the holdingtanks should generally be fed as in the cultures see culturingmethods in the respective methodsFish should be fed as

supplemented withcommercially prepared food such as TETRAMIN or BIORIL flake foodor equivalent Excess food and fecal material should be removedfrom the bottom of the tanks at least twice a week bysiphoningA daily record of feeding behavioral observations andmortality should be maintainedTRANSPORTATION TO THE TEST SITEOrganisms are transported from the base or supplylaboratory to a remote test site in culture water or standarddilution water in plastic bags or largemouth screwcap  mLplastic bottles in styrofoam coolers Adequate DO is maintained byreplacing the air above the water in the bags with oxygen from acompressed gas cylinder and sealing the bags Another methodcommonly used to maintain sufficient DO during shipment is toaerate with an airstone which is supplied from a portable pump TheDO concentration must not fall below  mgLUpon arrival at the test site organisms are transferredto receiving water if receiving water is to be used as the testdilution water All but a small volume of the holding waterapproximately  is removed by siphoning and replaced slowlyover a  to  minute period with dilution water If receivingwater is used as dilution water caution must be exercised inexposing the test organisms to it because of the possibility thatit might be toxic For this reason it is recommended that onlyapproximately  of the test organisms be exposed initially to thedilution water If this group does not show excessive mortality orobvious signs of stress in a few hours the remainder of the testorganisms are transferred to the dilution waterA group of organisms must not be used for a test if theyappear to be unhealthy discolored or otherwise stressed or ifmortality appears to exceed  preceding the test If theorganisms fail to meet these criteria the entire group must bediscarded and a new group obtained The mortality may be due to thepresence of toxicity if receivingwater is used as dilution water rather than a diseasedcondition of the test organisms If the acclimation process isrepeated with a new group of test organisms and excessive mortalityoccurs it is recommended that an alternative source of dilutionwater be usedThe marine organisms can be used at all concentrations ofeffluent by adjusting the salinity of the effluent to salinitiesspecified for the appropriate species test condition or to thesalinity approximating that of the receiving water by addingsufficient dry ocean salts such as FORTY FATHOMS or equivalentGP or hypersaline brineSaline dilution water can be prepared with deionizedwater or a freshwater such as well water or a suitable surfacewater If dry ocean salts are used care must be taken to ensurethat the added salts are completely dissolved and the solution isaerated  h before the test organisms are placed in the solutionsThe test organisms should be acclimated in synthetic saline waterprepared with the dry salts Caution addition of dry ocean saltsto dilution water may result in an increase in pH The pH ofestuarine and coastal saline waters is normallyAll effluent concentrations and thecontrols used in a test should have the same salinity The changein salinity upon acclimation at the desired test

is concluded all test organismsincluding controls should be humanely destroyed and disposed ofin an appropriate mannerSECTION DILUTION WATER TYPES OF DILUTION WATER The type of dilution water used in effluent toxicity testswill depend largely on the objectives of the studyIf the objective of the test is to estimate the absolutechronic toxicity of the effluent a synthetic standard dilutionwater is used If the test organisms have been cultured in waterwhich is different from the test dilution water a second set ofcontrols using culture water should be included in thetestIf the objective of the test is to estimate the chronictoxicity of the effluent in uncontaminated receiving water thetest may be conducted using dilution water consisting of a singlegrab sample of receiving water if nontoxic collected outsidethe influence of the outfall or with other uncontaminated naturalwater surface water or standard dilution water havingapproximately the same salinity as the receiving water Seasonalvariations in the quality of receiving waters may affect effluenttoxicity Therefore the salinity of saline receiving water samplesshould be determined before each use If the test organisms havebeen cultured in water which is different from the test dilutionwater a second set of controls using culture water should beincluded in the testIf the objective of the test is to determine the additiveor mitigating effects of the discharge on already contaminatedreceiving water the test is performed using dilution waterconsisting of receiving water collected outside the influence ofthe

objectives of the test require the use ofuncontaminated receiving water as dilution water and the receivingwater is uncontaminated it may be possible to collect a sample ofthe receiving water close to the outfall but should be away fromor beyond the influence of the effluent However if the receivingwater is contaminated it may be necessary to collect the sample inan area remote from the discharge site matching as closely aspossible the physical and chemical characteristics of the receivingwater near the outfallThe sample should be collected immediately prior to thetest but never more than  h before the test begins Except whereit is used within  h or in the case where large volumes arerequired for flow through tests the sample should be chilled toC during or immediately following collection and maintained atthat temperature prior to use in the testThe investigator should collect uncontaminated waterhaving a salinity as near as possible to the salinity of thereceiving water at the discharge site Water should be collected atslack high tide or within one hour after high tide If there isreason to suspect contamination of the water in the estuary it isadvisable to collect uncontaminated water from an adjacent estuaryAt times it may be necessary to collect water at a location closerto the open sea where the salinity is relatively high In suchcases deionized water or uncontaminated freshwater is added to thesaline water to dilute it to the required test salinity Wherenecessary the salinity of a surface water can be increased by theaddition of artificial sea salts such as FORTY FATHOMS HWMARINEMIX or equivalent GP anatural seawater of higher salinity or hypersaline brineInstructions for the preparation of hypersaline brine byconcentrating natural seawater are provided belowReceiving water containing debris or indigenousorganisms that may be confused with or attack the test organismsshould be filtered through a sieve having  m mesh openings priorto useHYPERSALINE BRINEHypersaline brine HSB has several advantages that makeit desirable for use in toxicity testing It can be made from anyhigh quality filtered seawater by evaporation and can be added todeionized water to prepare dilution water or to effluents orsurface waters to increase their salinityThe ideal container for making HSB from natural seawateris one that l has a high surface to volume ratio is made of a noncorrosive material and  is easilycleaned fiberglass containers are ideal Special care should beused to prevent any toxic materials from coming in contact with theseawater being used to generate the brine If a heater is immerseddirectly into the seawater ensure that the heater materials do notcorrode or leach any substances that would contaminate the brineOne successful method used is a thermostatically controlled heatexchanger made from fiberglass If aeration is used use onlyoilfree air compressors to prevent contaminationBefore adding seawater to the brine generator thoroughlyclean the generator aeration supply tube heater and any othermaterials that will be in direct contact with the brine A goodquality biodegradable detergent should be used followed by severalthorough deionized water rinses High quality and preferably highsalinity seawater should be filtered to at least  mm beforeplacing into the brine generator Water should be collected on anincoming tide to minimize the possibility ofcontaminationThe temperature of the seawater is increased slowly toC The water should be aerated to prevent temperaturestratification and to increase water evaporation The brine shouldbe checked daily depending on the volume being generated toensure that the salinity does not exceed  and that thetemperature does not exceed C Additional seawater may be addedto the brine to obtain the volume of brine requiredAfter the required salinity is attained the HSB shouldbe filtered a second time through a lm filter and poured directlyinto portable containers L CUBITAINERS or polycarbonate watercooler jugs are suitable The containers should be capped andlabelled with the date the brine was generated and its salinityContainers of HSB should be stored in the dark and maintained underroom temperature until usedIf a source of HSB is available test solutions can bemade by following the directions below Thoroughly mix together thedeionized water and brine before mixing in the effluentDivide the salinity of the HSB by the expected testsalinity to determine the proportion of deionized water to brineFor example if the salinity of the brine is  and the test isto be conducted at   divided by    The proportionof brine is  part in  one part brine to three parts deionizedwaterTo make  L of seawater at  salinity from ahypersaline brine of   mL of brine and  mL of deionizedwater are requiredUSE OF TAP WATER AS DILUTION WATER The use of tap water in the reconstituting of syntheticartificial seawater as dilution water is discouraged unless it isdechlorinated and fully treated Tap water can be dechlorinated bydeionization carbon filtration or the use of sodium thiosulfateUse of  mgL anhydrous sodium thiosulfate will reduce  mgchlorineL APHA  Following dechlorination total residualchlorine should not exceed  mgL Because of the possibletoxicity of thiosulfate to test organisms a control lackingthiosulfate should be included in toxicity tests utilizingthiosulfatedechlorinated waterTo be adequate for general laboratory use followingdechlorination the tap water is passed through a deionizer andcarbon filter to remove toxic metals and organics and to controlhardness and alkalinityDILUTION WATER HOLDING A given batch of dilution water should not be used formore than  days following preparation because of the possiblebuild up of bacterial fungal or algal slime growth and theproblems associated with it The container should be kept coveredand the contents should be protected from lightSECTION EFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER SAMPLING SAMPLE HANDLING ANDSAMPLE PREPARATION FOR TOXICITY TESTS EFFLUENT SAMPLINGThe effluent sampling point should be the same as thatspecified in the NPDES discharge permit USEPA lb Conditionsfor exception would be l better access to a sampling pointbetween the final treatment and the discharge outfall  if theprocessed waste is chlorinated prior to discharge it may also bedesirable to take samples prior to contact with the chlorine todetermine toxicity of the unchlorinated effluent or  in theevent there is a desire to evaluate the toxicity of the influent tomunicipal waste treatment plants or separate wastewater streams inindustrial facilities prior to their being combined with otherwastewater streams or noncontact cooling water additionalsampling points may be chosenThe decision on whether to collect grab or compositesamples is based on the objectives of the test and an understandingof the short and longterm operations and schedules of thedischarger If the effluent quality varies considerably with timewhich can occur where holding times are short grab samples mayseem preferable because of the ease of collection and the potentialof observing peaks spikes in toxicity However the samplingduration of a grab sample is so short that full characterization ofan effluent over a h period would require a prohibitively largenumber of separate samples and tests Collection of a hcomposite sample however may dilute toxicity spikes and averagethe quality of the effluent over the sampling period Samplingrecommendations are provided below also see USEPAaAeration during

equipment andonsite timeProvide a measure of instantaneous toxicity Toxicityspikes are not masked by dilution Disadvantages Samples are collected over a very short period of time and ona relatively infrequent basis The chances of detecting a spike intoxicity would depend on the frequency of sampling and theprobability of missing spikes is high COMPOSITE SAMPLES AdvantagesA single effluent sample is collected over a hperiodThe sample is collected over a much longer period of timethan grab samples and contains all toxicity spikesDisadvantagesSampling equipment is more sophisticated and expensiveand must be placed onsite for at least  hToxicity spikes may not be detected because they aremasked by dilution with less toxic wastes EFFLUENT SAMPLING RECOMMENDATIONSWhen tests are conducted onsite test solutions can berenewed daily with freshly collected samplesWhen tests are conducted offsite a minimum of threesamples are collected If these samples are collected on Test Days  and  the first sample would be used for test initiationand for test solution renewal on Day  The second sample would beused for test solution renewal on Days  and  The third samplewould be used for test solution renewal on Days   andSufficient sample must be collected to perform therequired toxicity and chemical tests A L gal CUBITAINERwill provide sufficient sample volume for most testsTHE FOLLOWING EFFLUENT SAMPLING METHODS ARERECOMMENDED Continuous DischargesIf the facility discharge is continuous a single hcomposite sample is to be takenIntermittent DischargesIf the facility discharge is intermittent a compositesample is to be collected for the duration of the discharge but notmore than  hoursRECEIVING WATER SAMPLINGLogistical problems and difficulty in securing samplingequipment generally preclude the collection of composite receivingwater samples for toxicity tests Therefore based on therequirements of the test a single grab sample or daily grabsamples of receiving water is collected for use in thetestThe sampling point is determined by the objectives of thetest At estuarine and marine sites samples should be collected atmiddepthTo determine the extent of the zone of toxicity in thereceiving water at estuarine and marine effluent sites receivingwater samples are collected at several distances away from thedischarge The time required for the effluentreceivingwatermixture to travel to sampling points away from the effluent andthe rate and degree of mixing may be difficult to ascertainTherefore it may not be possible to correlate receiving watertoxicity with effluent toxicity at the discharge point unless a dyestudy is performed The toxicity of receiving water samples fromfive stations in the discharge plume can be evaluated using thesame number of test vessels and test organisms as used in oneeffluent toxicity test with five effluent dilutionsEFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER SAMPLE HANDLINGPRESERVATION AND SHIPPINGUnless the

lapsed time holding time fromsample collection to first use of each grab or composite samplemust not exceed  h EPA believes that  h is adequate time todeliver the sample to the laboratories performing the test in mostcases In the isolated cases where the permittee can document thatthis delivery time cannot be met the permitting authority canallow an option for onsite testing or a variance for an extensionof shipped sample holding time The request for a variance insample holding time directed to the USEPA Regional Administratorunder  CFR e should include supportive data which showthat the toxicity of the effluent sample is not reduced egbecause of volatilization andor sorption of toxics on the samplecontainer surfaces by extending the holding time beyond more than h However in no case

laboratory and thesample holding time should not exceed  h unless a variance hasbeen granted by the NPDES permitting authorityPERSISTENCE OF EFFLUENT TOXICITY DURING SAMPLE SHIPMENTAND HOLDINGThe persistence of the toxicity ofan effluent prior to its use in a toxicity test is of interest inassessing the validity of toxicity test data and in determiningthe possible effects of allowing an extension of the holding timeWhere a variance in holding time   h but   h isrequested by a permittee See Subsection  information on theeffects of the extension in holding time on the toxicity of thesamples must be obtained by comparing the results ofmulticoncentration chronic toxicity tests performed on effluentsamples held  h with toxicity test results using the same samplesafter they were held for the requested longer period The portionof the sample set aside for the second test must be held under thesame conditions as during shipment and holdingPREPARATION OF EFFLUENT AND RECEIVING WATER SAMPLES FORTOXICITY TESTSAdjust the sample salinity to the level appropriate forobjectives of the study using hypersaline brine or artificial seasaltsWhen aliquots are removed from the sample container thehead space above the remaining sample should be held to a minimumAir which enters a container upon removal of sample should beexpelled by compressing the container before reclosing if possibleie where a CUBITAINER used or by using an appropriatedischarge valve spigotIt may be necessary to first coarsefilter samplesthrough a NYLON sieve having  to  mm mesh openings to removedebris andor break up large floating or suspended solids Ifsamples contain indigenous organisms that may attack or be confusedwith the test organisms the samples should be filtered through asieve with m mesh openings Since filtering may increase thedissolved oxygen DO in an effluent the DO should be checked bothbefore and after filtering Low dissolved oxygen concentrationswill indicate a potential problem in performing the test Cautionfiltration may remove some toxicityIf the samples must be warmed to bring them to theprescribed test temperature supersaturation of the dissolvedoxygen and nitrogen may become a problem To avoid this problemsamples may be warmed slowly in open test containers If DO isstill above  saturation based on temperature and salinityTable  after warming to test temperature samples should beaerated moderately approximately  mLmin for a few minutesusing an airstone If DO is below  mgL the solutions must beaerated moderately approximately  mLmin for a few minutesusing an airstone until the DO is within the prescribed range  mgL Caution avoid excessive aerationAeration during the test may alter the results and shouldbe used only as a last resort to maintain the required DO Aerationcan reduce the apparent toxicity of the test solutions by strippingthem of highly volatile toxic substances or increase theirtoxicity by altering the pH However the DO in the test solutionshould not be permitted to fall below  mgLIn static tests nonrenewal or renewal low DOs maycommonly occur in the higher concentrations of wastewater Aerationis accomplished by bubbling air through a pipet at the rate of bubblesmin If aeration is necessary all test solutions must beaerated It is advisable to monitor the DO closely during the firstfew hours of the test Samples with a potential DO problemgenerally show a downward trend in DO within  to  h after thetestis started Unless aeration is initiated during the first  h ofthe test the DO may be exhausted during an unattended periodthereby invalidating the test At a minimum pH conductivity or salinity and totalresidual chlorine are measured in the undiluted effluent orreceiving water and pH and conductivity are measured in thedilution waterIt is recommended that total alkalinity and totalhardness also be measured in the undiluted effluent test water andthe dilution waterTotal ammonia is measured in effluent and receiving watersamples where toxicity may be contributed by unionized ammoniaie where total ammonia   mgL The concentration mgL ofunionized free ammonia in a sample is a function of temperatureand pH and is calculated using the percentage value obtained fromTable  under the appropriate pH and temperature and multiplyingit by the concentration mgL of total ammonia in thesampleEffluents and receiving waters can be dechlorinated using mgL anhydrous sodium thiosulfate to reduce  mgL chlorineAPHA  Note that the amount of thiosulfate required todechlorinate effluents is greater than the amount needed todechlorinate tap water see Section  Dilution Water Sincethiosulfate may contribute to sample toxicity a thiosulfatecontrol should be used in the test in addition to the normaldilution water controlThe DO concentration in the samples should be nearsaturation prior to use Aeration will bring the DO and other gasesinto equilibrium with air minimize oxygen demand and stabilizethe pH However aeration during collection transfer andpreparation of samples should be minimized to reduce the loss ofvolatile chemicalsMortality or impairment of growth or reproduction due topH alone may occur if the pH of the sample falls outside the rangeof    Thus the presence of other forms of toxicity metalsand organics in the sample may be masked by the toxic effects oflow or high pH The question about the presence of other toxicantscan be answered only by performing two parallel tests one with anadjusted pH and one without an adjusted pH Freshwater samples areadjusted to pH  and marine samples are adjusted to pH  byadding N NaOH or N HCl dropwise as required being careful toavoid overadjustmentTable provided by Teresa NorbergKing Duluth Minnesota Alsosee Emerson et al  Thurston et al  and USEPAa PRELIMINARY TOXICITY RANGEFINDINGTESTSUSEPA Regional and State personnel generally haveobserved that it is not necessary to conduct a toxicityrangefinding test prior to initiating a static chronicdefinitive toxicity test However when preparing to perform astatic test with a sample of completely unknown quality or beforeinitiating a flowthrough test it is advisable to conduct apreliminary toxicity rangefinding testA toxicity rangefinding test ordinarily consists of adownscaled abbreviated static acute test in which groups of fiveorganisms are exposed to several widelyspaced sample dilutions ina logarithmic series such as    and  and acontrol for  h Caution if the sample must also be used forthe fullscale definitive test the h limit on holding time seeSubsection  must not be exceeded before the definitive testis initiatedIt should be noted that the toxicity LC of a sampleobserved in a rangefinding test may be significantly differentfrom the toxicity observed in the followup chronic definitivetest because  the definitive test is longer and  the testmay be performed with a sample collected at a different time andpossibly differing significantly in the level oftoxicity MULTICONCENTRATION DEFINITIVEEFFLUENT TOXICITY TESTSThe tests recommended for use in determining dischargepermit compliance in the NPDES program are multiconcentration ordefinitive tests which provide  a point estimate of effluenttoxicity in terms of an IC IC or LC or  anoobservedeffectconcentration NOEC defined in terms ofmortality growth reproduction andor teratogenicity and obtainedby hypothesis testing The tests may be static renewal or staticnonrenewalThe tests consist of a control and a minimum of fiveeffluent concentrations USEPA recommends the use of a dilution factor for selecting effluent test concentrationsEffluent test concentrations of     and are commonly used however test concentrations should be selectedindependently for each test based on the objective of the studythe expected range of toxicity the receiving water concentrationand any available historical testing information on the effluentUSEPA a provides additional guidance on choosing appropriatetest concentrationsWhen these tests are used indetermining compliance with permit limits effluent testconcentrations should be selected to bracket the receiving waterconcentration This may be achieved by selecting effluent testconcentrations in the following manner   effluent  RWC   RWC  RWC and  RWC For example where theRWC   appropriate effluent concentrations may be    and If acutechronic ratios are to be determined bysimultaneous acute and shortterm chronic tests with a singlespecies using the same sample both types of tests must use thesame test conditions ie pH temperature water hardnesssalinity etcRECEIVING WATER TESTSReceiving water toxicity tests generally consist of receiving water and a control The total salinity of the controlshould be comparable to the receiving waterThe data from the two treatments are analyzed byhypothesis testing to determine if test organism survival in thereceiving water differs significantly from the control Fourreplicates and  organisms per replicate are required for eachtreatment see Summary of Test Conditions and Test AcceptabilityCriteria in the specific test methodIn cases where the objective of the test is to estimatethe degree of toxicity of the receiving water a definitivemulticoncentration test is performed by preparing dilutions of thereceiving water using a  dilution series with a suitablecontrol waterSECTION CHRONIC TOXICITY TEST ENDPOINTS AND DATAANALYSIS ENDPOINTS The objective of chronic aquatic toxicity tests witheffluents and pure compounds is to estimate the highest safe ornoeffect concentration of these substances For practicalreasons the responses observed in these tests are usually limitedto hatchability gross morphological abnormalities survivalgrowth and reproduction and the results of the tests are usuallyexpressed in terms of the highest toxicant concentration that hasno statistically significant observed effect on these responseswhen compared to the controls The terms currently used to definethe endpoints employed in the rapid chronic and subchronictoxicity tests have been derived from the terms previously used forfull lifecycle tests As shorter chronic tests were developed itbecame common practice to apply the same terminology to theendpoints The terms used in this manual are as followsSafe Concentration  The highest concentration oftoxicant that will permit normal propagation of fish and otheraquatic life in receiving waters The concept of a safeconcentration is a biological concept whereas thenoobservedeffect concentration below is a statisticallydefined concentrationNoObservedEffectConcentration NOEC  The highestconcentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in a fulllifecycle or partial lifecycle shortterm test that causes noobservable adverse effects on the test organisms ie the highestconcentration of toxicant in which the values for the observedresponses are not statistically significantly different from thecontrols This value is used along with other factors todetermine toxicity limits in permitsLowestObservedEffectConcentration LOEC  The lowestconcentration of toxicant to which organisms are exposed in alifecycle or partial lifecycle shortterm test which causesadverse effects on the test organisms ie where the values forthe observed responses are statistically significantly differentfrom the controlsEffective Concentration EC  A point estimate of thetoxicant concentration that would cause an observable adverseaffect on a quantal all or nothing response such as deathimmobilization or serious incapacitation in a given percent ofthe test organisms calculated by point estimation techniques Ifthe observable effect is death or immobility the term LethalConcentration LC should be used see Subsection  Acertain EC or LC value might be judged from a biological standpointto represent a threshold concentration or lowest concentrationthat would cause an adverse effect on the observedresponseLethal Concentration LC  Thetoxicant concentration that would cause death in a given percent ofthe test population Identical to EC when the observable adverseeffect is death For example the LC is the concentration oftoxicant that would cause death in  of the testpopulationInhibition Concentration IC  The toxicantconcentration that would cause a given percent reduction in anonquantal biological measurement for the test population Forexample the IC is the concentration of toxicant that would causea  reduction in mean young per female or in growth for the testpopulation and the IC is the concentration of toxicant thatwould cause a  reduction in the mean populationresponsesRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ENDPOINTS DETERMINED BY HYPOTHESISTESTING AND POINT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES If the objective of chronic aquatic toxicity tests witheffluents and pure compounds is to estimate the highest safe ornoeffect concentration of these substances it is imperative tounderstand how the statistical endpoints of these tests are relatedto the safe or noeffect concentration NOECs and LOECs aredetermined by hypothesis testing Dunnetts Test a t test with theBonferroni adjustment Steels ManyOne Rank Test or the WilcoxonRank Sum Test with Bonferroni adjustment whereas LCs ICs andECs are determined by point estimation techniques Probit Analysisthe SpearmanKarber Method the Trimmed SpearmanKarber Method theGraphical Method or Linear Interpolation Method There areinherent differences between the use of a NOEC or LOEC derived fromhypothesis testing to estimate a safe concentration and the useof a LC IC EC or other point estimates derived from curvefitting interpolation etcMost point estimates such as the LC IC or EC arederived from a mathematical model that assumes a continuousdoseresponse relationship By definition any LC IC or EC valueis an estimate of some amount of adverse effect Thus theassessment of a safe concentration must be made from a biologicalstandpoint rather than with a statistical test In this instancethe biologist must determine some amount of adverse effect that isdeemed to be safe in the sense that from a practical biologicalviewpoint it will not affect the normal propagation of fish andother aquatic life in receiving watersThe use of NOECs and LOECs on the other hand assumeseither  a continuous doseresponse relationship or  anoncontinuous threshold model of the doseresponserelationshipIn the case of a continuous doseresponse relationshipit is also assumed that adverse effects that are not statisticallyobservable are also not important from a biological standpointsince they are not pronounced enough to test as statisticallysignificant against some measure of the natural variability of theresponsesIn the case of noncontinuous doseresponserelationships it is assumed that there exists a true threshold orconcentration below which there is no adverse effect on aquaticlife and above which there is an adverse effect The purpose ofthe statistical analysis in this case is to estimate as closely aspossible where that threshold liesIn either case it is important to realize that theamount of adverse effect that is statistically observable LOEC ornot observable NOEC is highly dependent on all aspects of theexperimental design such as the number of concentrations oftoxicant number of replicates per concentration number oforganisms per replicate and use of randomization Other factorsthat affect the sensitivity of the test include the choice ofstatistical analysis the choice of an alpha level and the amountof variability between responses at a givenconcentrationWhere the assumption of a continuous doseresponserelationship is made by definition some amount of adverse effectmight be present at the NOEC but is not great enough to bedetected by hypothesis testingWhere the assumption of a noncontinuous doseresponserelationship is made the NOEC would indeed be an estimate of asafe or noeffect concentration if the amount of adverse effectthat appears at the threshold is great enough to test asstatistically significantly different from the controls in the faceof all aspects of the experimental design mentioned above Ifhowever the amount of adverse effect at the threshold were notgreat enough to test as statistically different some amount ofadverse effect might be present at the NOEC In any case theestimate of the NOEC with hypothesis testing is always dependent onthe aspects of the experimental design mentioned above For thisreason the reporting and examination of some measure of thesensitivity of the test either the minimum significant differenceor the percent change from the control that this minimum differencerepresents is extremely importantIn summary the assessment of a safe or noeffectconcentration cannot be made from the results of statisticalanalysis alone unless  the assumptions of a strict thresholdmodel are accepted and  it is assumed that the amount ofadverse effect present at the threshold is statistically detectableby hypothesis testing In this case estimates obtained from astatistical analysis are indeed estimates of a noeffectconcentration If the assumptions are not deemed tenable thenestimates from a statistical analysis can only be used inconjunction with an assessment from a biological standpoint of whatmagnitude of adverse effect constitutes a safe concentration Inthis instance a safe concentration is not necessarily a trulynoeffect concentration but rather a concentration at which theeffects are judged to be of no biological significanceA better understanding of the relationship betweenendpoints derived by hypothesis testing NOECs and pointestimation techniques LCs ICs and ECs would be very helpful inchoosing methods of data analysis NorbergKing  reportedthat the ICs were comparable to the NOECs for  effluent andreference toxicant data sets analyzed The data sets includedshortterm chronic toxicity tests for the sea urchin Arbaciapunctulata the sheepshead minnow Cyprinodon variegatus and thered macroalga Champia parvula Birge et al  reported thatLCs derived from Probit Analyses of data from shorttermembryolarval tests with reference toxicants were comparable toNOECs for several organisms Similarly USEPA d reported thatthe ICs were comparable to the NOECs for a set of daphniaCeriodaphnia dubia chronic tests with a single reference toxicantHowever the scope of these comparisons was very limited andsufficient information is not yet available to establish an overallrelationship between these two types of endpoints especially whenderived from effluent toxicity test dataPRECISION HYPOTHESIS TESTS When hypothesis tests are used to analyze toxicity testdata it is not possible to express precision in terms of acommonly used statistic The results of the test are given in termsof two endpoints the NoObservedEffect Concentration NOEC andthe LowestObservedEffect Concentration LOEC The NOEC and LOECare limited to the concentrations selected for the test The widthof the NOECLOEC interval is a function of the dilution series anddiffers greatly depending on whether a dilution factor of  or is used in the test design Therefore USEPA recommends the useof the   dilution factor see Section  Quality Assurance Itis not possible to place confidence limits on the NOEC and LOECderived from a given test and it is difficult to quantify theprecision of the NOECLOEC endpoints between tests If the datafrom a series of tests performed with the same toxicant toxicantconcentrations and test species were analyzed with hypothesistests precision could only be assessed by a qualitative comparisonof the NOECLOEC intervals with the understanding that maximumprecision would be attained if all tests yielded the same NOECLOECinterval In practice the precision of results of repetitivechronic tests is considered acceptable if the NOECs vary by no morethan one concentration interval above or below a central tendencyUsing these guidelines the normal range of NOECs from toxicitytests using a dilution factor twofold difference between adjacentconcentrations would be fourfold POINT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUESPoint estimation techniques have the advantage ofproviding a point estimate of the toxicant concentration causing agiven amount of adverse inhibiting effect the precision of whichcan be quantitatively assessed  within tests by calculation of confidence limits and  across tests by calculating astandard deviation and coefficient of variationIt should be noted that softwareused to calculate point estimates occasionally may not provideassociated  confidence intervals This situation may arise whentest data do not meet specific assumptions required by thestatistical methods when point estimates are outside of the testconcentration range and when specific limitations imposed by thesoftware are encountered USEPA a provides guidance onconfidence intervals under these circumstancesDATA ANALYSIS ROLE OF THE STATISTICIAN The use of the statistical methods described in thismanual for routine data analysis does not require the assistance ofa statistician However the interpretation of the results of theanalysis of the data from any of the toxicity tests described inthis manual can become problematic because of the inherentvariability and sometimes unavoidable anomalies in biological dataIf the data appear unusual in any way or fail to meet thenecessary assumptions a statistician should be consulted Analystswho are not proficient in statistics are strongly advised to seekthe assistance of a statistician before selecting the method ofanalysis and using any of the resultsThe statistical methods recommended in this manual arenot the only possible methods of statistical analysis Many othermethods have been proposed and considered Certainly there areother reasonable and defensible methods of statistical analysis forthis kind of toxicity data Among alternative hypothesis testssome like Williams Test require additional assumptions whileothers like the bootstrap methods require computerintensivecomputations Alternative point estimations approaches mostprobably would require the services of a statistician to determinethe appropriateness of the model goodness of fit higher orderlinear or nonlinear models confidence intervals for estimatesgenerated by inverse regression etc In addition point estimationor regression approaches would require the specification bybiologists or toxicologists of some low level of adverse effectthat would be deemed acceptable or safe The statistical methodscontained in this manual have been chosen because they are applicable to most of the different toxicity test data sets forwhich they are recommended  powerful statistical tests hopefully easily understood by nonstatisticians and  amenableto use without a computer if necessaryPLOTTING THE DATAThe data should be plotted both as a preliminary step tohelp detect problems and unsuspected trends or patterns in theresponses and as an aid in interpretation of the results Furtherdiscussion and plotted sets of data are included in the methods andthe AppendicesDATA TRANSFORMATIONSTransformations of the data eg arc sine square rootand logs are used where necessary to meet assumptions of theproposed analyses such as the requirement for normally distributeddataINDEPENDENCE RANDOMIZATION AND OUTLIERSStatistical independence among observations is a criticalassumption in all statistical analysis of toxicity data One of thebest ways to ensure independence is to properly follow rigorousrandomization procedures Randomization techniques should beemployed at the start of the test including the randomization ofthe placement of test organisms in the test chambers andrandomization of the test chamber location within the array ofchambers Discussions of statistical independence outliers andrandomization and a sample randomization scheme are included inAppendix AREPLICATION AND SENSITIVITYThe number of replicates employed for each toxicantconcentration is an important factor in determining the sensitivityof chronic toxicity tests Test sensitivity generally increases asthe number of replicates is increased but the point of diminishingreturns in sensitivity may be reached rather quickly The level ofsensitivity required by a hypothesis test or the confidenceinterval for a point estimate will determine the number ofreplicates and should be based on the objectives for obtaining thetoxicity dataIn a statistical analysis of toxicity data the choice ofa particular analysis and the ability to detect departures from theassumptions of the analysis such as the normal distribution of thedata and homogeneity of variance is also dependent on the numberof replicates More than the minimum number of replicates may berequired in situations where it is imperative to obtain optimalstatistical results such as with tests used in enforcement casesor when it is not possible to repeat the tests For example whenthe data are analyzed by hypothesis testing the nonparametricalternatives cannot be used unless there are at least fourreplicates at each toxicant concentrationRECOMMENDED ALPHA LEVELSThe data analysis examples included in the manual specifyan alpha level of  for testing the assumptions of hypothesistests and an alpha level of  for the hypothesis teststhemselves These levels are common and well accepted levels forthis type of analysis and are presented as a recommended minimumsignificance level for toxicity data analysisCHOICE OF ANALYSISThe recommended statistical analysis of most data fromchronic toxicity tests with aquatic organisms follows a decisionprocess illustrated in the flowchart in Figure  An initialdecision is made to use point estimation techniques the ProbitAnalysis the SpearmanKarber Method the Trimmed SpearmanKarberMethod the Graphical Method or Linear Interpolation Methodandor to use hypothesis testing Dunnetts Test the t test withthe Bonferroni adjustment Steels Manyone Rank Test or WilcoxonRank Sum Test with the Bonferroni adjustment NOTE For the NPDESPermit Program the point estimation techniques are the preferredstatistical methods in calculating end points for effluent toxicitytests If hypothesis testing is chosen subsequent decisions aremade on the appropriate procedure for a given set of datadepending on the results of tests of assumptions as illustrated inthe flowchart A specific flow chart is included in the analysissection for each testSince a single chronic toxicity test might yieldinformation on more than one parameter such as survival growthand reproduction the lowest estimate of a noobservedeffectconcentration for any of the responses would be used as the noobserved effect concentration for each test It follows logicallythat in the statistical analysis of the data concentrations thathad a significant toxic effect on one of the observed responseswould not be subsequently tested for an effect on some otherresponse This is one reason for excluding concentrations that haveshown a statistically significant reduction in survival from asubsequent hypothesis test for effects on another parameter such asreproduction A second reason is that the exclusion of suchconcentrations usually results in a more powerful and appropriatestatistical analysis In performing the point estimation techniquesrecommended in this manual an alldata approach is used Forexample data from concentrations above the NOEC for survival areincluded in determining ICp estimates using the LinearInterpolation MethodANALYSIS OF GROWTH AND REPRODUCTION DATAGrowth data from the sheepshead minnow Cyprinodonvariegatus and inland silverside Menidia beryllina larvalsurvival and growth tests and the mysid Mysidopsis bahiasurvival growth and fecundity test are analyzed using hypothesistesting according to the flowchart in Figure  The above mentionedgrowth data may also be analyzed by generating a point estimatewith the Linear Interpolation Method Data from effluentconcentrations that have tested significantly different from thecontrol for survival are excluded from further hypothesis testsconcerning growth effects Growth is defined as the change in dryweight of the orginal number of test organisms when group weightsare obtained When analyzing the data using point estimatingtechniques data from all concentrations are included in theanalysisFecundity data from the mysid Mysidopsis bahia test maybe analyzed using hypothesis testing after an arc sinetransformation according to the flowchart in Figure  Thefecundity data from the mysid test may also be analyzed bygenerating a point estimate with the Linear InterpolationMethodReproduction data from the red macroalga Champiaparvula test are analyzed using hypothesis testing as illustratedin Figure  The reproduction data from the red macroalga test mayalso be analyzed by generating a point estimate with the LinearInterpolation MethodANALYSIS OF THE SEA URCHIN ARBACIA PUNCTULATAFERTILIZATION DATAData from the sea urchin Arbacia punctulatafertilization test may be analyzed by hypothesis testing after anarc sine transformation according to the flowchart in Figure  Thefertilization data from the sea urchin test may also be analyzed bygenerating a point estimate with the Linear InterpolationMethodANALYSIS OF MORTALITY DATAMortality data are analyzed by Probit Analysis ifappropriate or other point estimation techniques ie theSpearmanKarber Method the Trimmed SpearmanKarber Method or theGraphical Method see Appendices HK see discussion below Themortality data can also be analyzed by hypothesis testing after anarc sine square root transformation see Appendices BF accordingto the flowchart in Figure HYPOTHESIS TESTS DUNNETTS PROCEDUREDunnetts Procedure is used to determine the NOEC Theprocedure consists of an analysis of variance ANOVA to determinethe error term which is then used in a multiple comparisonprocedure for comparing each of the treatment means with thecontrol mean in a series of paired tests see Appendix C Use ofDunnetts Procedure requires at least three replicates pertreatment to check the assumptions of the test In cases where thenumbers of data points replicates for each concentration are notequal a t test may be performed with Bonferronis adjustment formultiple comparisons see Appendix D instead of using DunnettsProcedureThe assumptions upon which the use of Dunnetts Procedureis contingent are that the observations within treatments arenormally distributed with homogeneity of variance Beforeanalyzing the data these assumptions must be tested using theprocedures provided in Appendix BIf after suitable transformations have been carried outthe normality assumptions have not been met Steels Manyone RankTest should be used if there are four or more data pointsreplicates per toxicant concentration If the numbers of datapoints for each toxicant concentration are not equal the WilcoxonRank Sum Test with Bonferronis adjustment should be used seeAppendix FSome indication of the sensitivity of the analysis shouldbe provided by calculating  the minimum difference between meansthat can be detected as statistically significant and  thepercent change from the control mean that this minimum differencerepresents for a given testA stepbystep example of the use of Dunnetts Procedureis provided in Appendix CT TEST WITH THE BONFERRONI ADJUSTMENTThe t test with the Bonferroni adjustment is used as analternative to Dunnetts Procedure when the number of replicates isnot the same for all concentrations This test sets an upper boundof alpha on the overall error rate in contrast to DunnettsProcedure for which the overall error rate is fixed at alphaThus Dunnetts Procedure is a more powerful testThe assumptions upon which the use of the t test with theBonferroni adjustment is contingent are that the observationswithin treatments are normally distributed with homogeneity ofvariance These assumptions must be tested using the proceduresprovided in Appendix BThe estimate of the safe concentration derived from thistest is reported in terms of the NOEC A stepbystep example ofthe use of a ttest with the Bonferroni adjustment is provided inAppendix DSTEELS MANYONE RANK TESTSteels Manyone Rank Test is a multiple comparisonprocedure for comparing several treatments with a control Thismethod is similar to Dunnetts procedure except that it is notnecessary to meet the assumption of normality The data are rankedand the analysis is performed on the ranks rather than on the datathemselves If the data are normally or nearly normallydistributed Dunnetts Procedure would be more sensitive woulddetect smaller differences between the treatments and control Fordata that are not normally distributed Steels Manyone Rank Testcan be much more efficient Hodges and Lehmann It is necessary to have at least four replicates pertoxicant concentration to use Steels test Unlike Dunnettsprocedure the sensitivity of this test cannot be stated in termsof the minimum difference between treatment means and the controlmean that can be detected as statistically significantThe estimate of the safe concentration is reported as theNOEC A stepbystep example of the use of Steels ManyOne RankTest is provided in Appendix EWILCOXON RANK SUM TEST WITH THE BONFERRONIADJUSTMENTThe Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test is a nonparametric test forcomparing a treatment with a control The data are ranked and theanalysis proceeds exactly as in Steels Test except thatBonferronis adjustment for multiple comparisons is used instead ofSteels tables When Steels test can be used ie when there areequal numbers of data points per toxicant concentration it willbe more powerful able to detect smaller differences asstatistically significant than the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test withBonferronis adjustmentThe estimate of the safe concentration is reported as theNOEC A stepbystep example of the use of the Wilcoxon Rank SumTest with Bonferroni adjustment is provided in AppendixFA CAUTION IN THE USE OF HYPOTHESIS TESTINGIf in the calculation of an NOEC by hypothesis testingtwo tested concentrations cause statistically significant adverseeffects but an intermediate concentration did not causestatistically significant effects the results should be used withextreme cautionPOINT ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES PROBIT ANALYSISProbit Analysis is used to estimate an LC LC EC orEC and the associated  confidence interval The analysisconsists of adjusting the data for mortality in the control andthen using a maximum likelihood technique to estimate theparameters of the underlying log tolerance distribution which isassumed to have a particular shapeThe assumption upon which the use of Probit Analysis iscontingent is a normal distribution of log tolerances If thenormality assumption is not met and at least two partialmortalities are not obtained Probit Analysis should not be usedIt is important to check the results of Probit Analysis todetermine if use of the analysis is appropriate The chisquaretest for heterogeneity provides a good test of appropriateness ofthe analysis The computer program see discussion Appendix Hchecks the chisquare statistic calculated for the data set againstthe tabular value and provides an error message if the calculatedvalue exceeds the tabular valueA discussion of Probit Analysis and examples of computerprogram input and output are found in Appendix HIn cases where Probit Analysis is not appropriate theLC and confidence interval may be estimated by theSpearmanKarber Method Appendix I or the Trimmed SpearmanKarberMethod Appendix J If a test results in  survival and mortality in adjacent treatments all or nothing effect the LCmay be estimated using the Graphical Method AppendixKLINEAR INTERPOLATION METHODThe Linear Interpolation Method see Appendix L is aprocedure to calculate a point estimate of the effluent or othertoxicant concentration Inhibition Concentration IC that causesa given percent reduction eg   etc in thereproduction growth fertilization or fecundity of the testorganisms The procedure was designed for general applicability inthe analysis of data from shortterm chronic toxicitytestsUse of the Linear Interpolation Method is based on theassumptions that the responses  are monotonically nonincreasingthe mean response for each higher concentration is less than orequal to the mean response for the previous concentration follow a piecewise linear response function and  are from arandom independent and representative sample of test data Theassumption for piecewise linear response cannot be testedstatistically and no defined statistical procedure is provided totest the assumption for monotonicity Where the observed means arenot strictly monotonic by examination they are adjusted bysmoothing In cases where the responses at the low toxicantconcentrations are much higher than in the controls the smoothingprocess may result in a large upward adjustment in the controlmeanThe inability to test the monotonicity and piece wiselinear response assumptions for this method makes it difficult toassess when the method is or is not producing reliable resultsTherefore the method should be used with caution when the resultsof a toxicity test approach an all or nothing response from oneconcentration to the next in the concentration series and when itappears that there is a large deviation from monotonicity SeeAppendix L for a more detailed discussion of the use of this methodand a computer program

accurately Test review should beconducted on each test by both the testing laboratory and theregulatory authoritySAMPLING AND HANDLINGThe collection and handling of samples are reviewed toverify that the sampling and handling procedures given in Section were followed Chainofcustody forms are reviewed to verify thatsamples were tested within allowable sample holding timesSubsection  Any deviations from the procedures given inSection  should be documented and described in the data reportSubsection TEST ACCEPTABILITY CRITERIATest data are reviewed to verify that test acceptabilitycriteria TAC requirements for a valid test have been met Anytest not meeting the minimum test acceptability criteria isconsidered invalid All invalid tests must be repeated with a newlycollected sampleTEST CONDITIONSTest conditions are reviewed and compared to thespecifications listed in the summary of test condition tablesprovided for each method Physical and chemical measurements takenduring the test eg temperature pH and DO also are reviewedand compared to specified ranges Any deviations fromspecifications should be documented and described in the datareport Subsection The summary of test condition tables presented for eachmethod identify test conditions as required or recommended For WETtest data submitted under NPDES permits all required testconditions must be met or the test is considered invalid and mustbe repeated with a newly collected sample Deviations fromrecommended test conditions must be evaluated on a casebycasebasis to determine the validity of test results Deviations fromrecommended test conditions may or may not invalidate a test resultdepending on the degree of the departure and the objective of thetest The reviewer should consider the degree of the deviation andthe potential or observed impact of the deviation on the testresult before rejecting or accepting a test result as valid Forexample if dissolved oxygen is measured below  mgL in one testchamber the reviewer should consider whether any observedmortality in that test chamber corresponded with the drop indissolved oxygenWhereas slight deviations in test conditions may notinvalidate an individual test result test condition deviationsthat continue to occur frequently in a given laboratory mayindicate the need for improved quality control in thatlaboratorySTATISTICAL METHODS The statistical methods used for analyzing test dataare reviewed to verify that the recommended flowcharts forstatistical analysis were followed Any deviation from therecommended flowcharts for selection of statistical methods shouldbe noted in the data report Statistical methods other than thoserecommended in the statistical flowcharts may be appropriate seeSubsection  however the laboratory must document the useof and provide the rationale for the use of any alternatestatistical method In all cases flowchart recommended methods oralternate methods reviewers should verify that the necessaryassumptions are met for the statistical method used CONCENTRATIONRESPONSE RELATIONSHIPSThe concept of a concentrationresponse or moreclassically a doseresponse relationship is the most fundamentaland pervasive one in toxicology Casarett and Doull  Thisconcept assumes that there is a causal relationship between thedose of a toxicant or concentration for toxicants in solution anda measured response A response may be any measurable biochemicalor biological parameter that is correlated with exposure to thetoxicant The classical concentrationresponse relationship isdepicted as a sigmoidal shaped curve however the particular shapeof the concentrationresponse curve may differ for each coupledtoxicant and response pair In general more severe responses suchas acute effects occur at higher concentrations of the toxicantand less severe responses such as chronic effects occur at lowerconcentrations A single toxicant also may produce multipleresponses each characterized by a concentrationresponserelationship A corollary of the concentrationresponse concept isthat every toxicant should exhibit a concentrationresponserelationship given that the appropriate response is measured andgiven that the concentration range evaluated is appropriate Use ofthis concept can be helpful in determining whether an effluentpossesses toxicity and in identifying anomalous testresultsThe concentrationresponse relationship generated foreach multiconcentration test must be reviewed to ensure thatcalculated test results are interpreted appropriately USEPAa provides guidance on evaluating concentrationresponserelationships to assist in determining the validity of WET testresults All WET test results from multiconcentration testsreported under the NPDES program should be reviewed and reportedaccording to USEPA guidance on the evaluation ofconcentrationresponse relationships USEPA a This guidanceprovides review steps for  different concentrationresponsepatterns that may be encountered in WET test data Based on thereview the guidance provides one of three determinations thatcalculated effect concentrations are reliable and should bereported that calculated effect concentrations are anomalous andshould be explained or that the test was inconclusive and the testshould be repeated with a newly collected sample It should benoted that the determination of a valid concentrationresponserelationship is not always clear cut Data from some tests maysuggest consultation with professional toxicologists andorregulatory officials Tests that exhibit unexpectedconcentrationresponse relationships also may indicate a need forfurther investigation and possible retestingREFERENCE TOXICANT TESTINGTest review of a given effluent or receiving water testshould include review of the associated reference toxicant test andcurrent control chart Reference toxicant testing and controlcharting is required for documenting the quality of

 and compared to the current control chart limits  standard deviationsReference toxicant tests that fall outside of recommendedcontrol chart limits are evaluated to determine the validity ofassociated effluent and receiving water tests see Subsection An out of control reference toxicant test result does notnecessarily invalidate associated test results The reviewer shouldconsider the degree to

evaluating withintestvariability reviewers should consult EPA guidance on upper andlower percent minimum significant difference PMSD bounds USEPAbWhen NPDES permits require sublethal hypothesis testingendpoints from Methods  or  eg growth NOECs andLOECs withintest variability must be reviewed and variabilitycriteria must be applied as described in this section When the methods are used for nonregulatory purposes thevariability criteria herein are recommended but are not requiredand their use or the use of alternative variability criteria maydepend upon the intended uses of the test results and therequirements of any applicable data quality objectives and qualityassurance planTo measure test variability calculate the percentminimum significant difference PMSD achieved in the test ThePMSD is the smallest percentage decrease in growth or reproductionfrom the control that could be determined as statisticallysignificant in the test The PMSD is calculated as  times theminimum significant difference MSD divided by the control meanThe equation and examples of MSD calculations are shown in AppendixC PMSD may be calculated legitimately as a descriptive statisticfor withintest variability even when the hypothesis test isconducted using a nonparametric method The PMSD bounds were basedon a representative set of tests including tests for which anonparametric method was required for determining the NOEC orLOEC The conduct of hypothesis testing to determine test resultsshould follow the statistical flow charts provided for each methodThat is when test data fail to meet assumptions of normality orheterogeneity of variance a nonparametric method determinedfollowing the statistical flowchart for the method should be usedto calculate test results but the PMSD may be calculated asdescribed above using parametric methods to provide a measure oftest variabilityCompare the PMSD measured in the test with the upper PMSDbound variability criterion listed in Table  When the test PMSDexceeds the upper bound the variability among replicates isunusually large for the test method Such a test should beconsidered insufficiently sensitive to detect toxic effects ongrowth or reproduction of substantial magnitude A finding oftoxicity at a particular concentration may be regarded astrustworthy but a finding of no toxicity or no statisticallysignificant toxicity at a particular concentration should not beregarded as a reliable indication that there is no substantialtoxic effect on growth or reproduction at thatconcentrationIf the PMSD measured for the test is less than or equalto the upper PMSD bound variability criterion in Table  then thetests variability measure lies within normal bounds and the effectconcentration estimate eg NOEC or LOEC would normally beaccepted unless other test review steps raise serious doubts aboutits validityIf the PMSD measured for the test exceeds the upper PMSDbound variability criterion in Table  then one of the followingtwo cases applies  If toxicity is found at the permitted receiving waterconcentration RWC based upon the value of the effectconcentration estimate NOEC or LOEC then the test shall beaccepted and the effect concentration estimate may be reportedunless other test review steps raise serious doubts about itsvalidityIf toxicity is not found at the permitted RWC based uponthe value of the effect concentration estimate NOEC or LOEC andthe PMSD measured for the test exceeds the upper PMSD bound thenthe test shall not be accepted and a new test must be conductedpromptly on a newly collected sampleTo avoid penalizing laboratories that achieve unusuallyhigh precision lower PMSD bounds shall also be applied when ahypothesis test result eg NOEC or LOEC is reported Lower PMSDbounds which are based on the th percentiles of national PMSDdata are presented in Table  The th percentile PMSD representsa practical limit to the sensitivity of the test method because fewlaboratories are able to achieve such precision on aregular basis and most do not achieve it even occasionally Indetermining hypothesis test results eg NOEC or LOEC a testconcentration shall not be considered toxic ie significantlydifferent from the control if the relative difference from thecontrol is less than the lower PMSD bounds in Table  See USEPAb for specific examples of implementing lower PMSD bounds To assist in reviewing withintest variability EPArecommends maintaining control charts of PMSDs calculated forsuccessive effluent tests USEPA b A control chart of PMSDvalues characterizes the range of variability observed within agiven laboratory and allows comparison of individual test PMSDswith the laboratorys typical range of variability Control chartsof other variability and test performance measures such as theMSD standard deviation or CV of control responses or averagecontrol response also may be useful for reviewing tests andminimizing variability The log of PMSD will provide
