                                 Marcus Welby Wasnt So Great            Not long ago I waslistening to an NPR talk show on which the moderator and his guest bemoaned thepassing of the wellbeloved family doctor whose kindly manner and personalizedattention once graced the healing arts The guest George Anders author of anew book Health Against Wealth  described the ways in whichhealthmaintenance organizations and other forms of pennypinching managed careare causing the breakdown of medical trust            Anders offered upsettingdetails A childs mysterious lifethreatening disease misdiagnosed terminalcancer patients denied lastditch bonemarrow transplants doctors who watchbottom lines instead of blood pressures nurses who scan spreadsheets insteadof bedsheets             When suddenly there leaptto mind the memory of a holiday party a generation ago in a fashionableneighborhood of the nations capital            A kindlywhitehaired gentleman sidles up to an ample hostess Come on Kitty he saysin his soft Southern drawl A little toddys not going to hurt you            The woman in question was my motherinlaw whosealcoholism was then in remission The prescribing gentleman was her doctor apractitioner much in vogue in oldtime Washington society            Anatypical example of the sage practitioners of yore you say And indeed myhusband and I spurned the courtly generalist for an uptodate internisthighly recommended by a more senior associate at the top Washington law firm myhusband had joined And our switch came not a moment too soon My thyroid thedoctor advised was dangerously low Medication and frequent checkups coveredby our insurance as routine physicals were not were advised            This struck me as slightly odd I didnt fitthe sluggish overweight profile of the lowthyroid sufferer But I paid thevisits and took the pills and ignored the occasional heart palpitations thattroubled my sleep My doctor was most attentivehe even visited me at homewhen I came down with chicken poxthough more out of curiosity thansolicitude he admitted adult chicken pox being so rare            As timewent on I met more and more fellow patients of my internist A strikingnumber usually women turned out to share my low thyroid For men the favoreddiagnosis seemed to be gout Gout In a ish man who never frequented a clubin Pall Mall drank no brandy squired no acres rode to no hounds Well whowere we to judge            Of course we with our fine educations and scholarlyhonors were a lot better equipped to judge than the average American consumerAnd I will warrant that our doctorkeenly attuned to the incomeenhancingpotential of wellinsured diagnoses as he waswas probably far better trainedthan the average practitioner in his cohort He probably did us no lastingharm When I finally fled to the excellent still younger internist who remainsmy doctor he took me off the thyroid pills immediately and the palpitationsvanished            Whichbrings me to the to be sure paragraph as they call it in our trade Mostindividual practitioners wereand still areimpeccably honest devoted totheir patients and incredibly hardworking And many of them my doctorincluded are chafing under the bookkeeping requirements and restrictions ontheir professional discretion that are prominent features of the new medicalregime Adjustments in managed care need to be madeand under pressure fromconsumers and their representatives in Congress they are already beingmade            Neverthelessthe nevertheless paragraphineluctably follows the to be sure oneit would be a mistake to try to turnback the clock Remember that only one generation before my remembered holidayparty most people didnt have health insurance at all If they got sick theyscrounged up the few dollars the doctor requested and received care that whilesympathetically tendered probably wasnt worth much more than they paid forit If granny needed an operation there went the tuition for juniors collegeThen employerprovided health insurance proliferated and the government wadedin with generous coverage for the elderly through Medicare andfirsttolastdollar coverage for the poor through Medicaid More and morepeople demanded more and more care and thanks to science and technology thatcare was far more likely to be efficacious            Congresshaving failed to include conforming amendments in the MedicareMedicaidlegislation to repeal the laws of supply and demand medical prices soaredNobody minded much as long as somebody else was paying the bill true theeconomists warned in their dreary way that costly benefits get shifted back toworkers in the form of lower wages but who listens to them As companiesfound themselves increasingly squeezed between the demands of workers andstockholders however they started pressuring their insurers who passed thatpressure on to hospitals doctors and other providers            Only a few years agothree to be exactmanaged care wasthe prescription of liberal reformers for an overstressed health caresystem By standardizing practice the reformers argued wasteful care would becurtailed without sacrificingperhaps even while improvingquality Indeedmanaged care was the primary engine relied upon by the Clintons healthreformplan to generate the savings that would finance universal coverage at no netcost Now as the movement toward managed care has accelerated to a fullgallopand healthcare costs once thought unreinable have slowed to awalkmanaged care has become the bugbear of liberal critics Dont let thephilosophy of Gingrich  push your parents into the gas ovens of managedhealth care warned one especially overwrought Democratic challenger in thefall elections            How direis the threat A  review of various evaluations of managed care in itsseveral variants found no large differences in the average quality of suchcare as compared with that provided to patients in typical feeforserviceindemnity plans Patients in HMOs for example tended to get somewhat betterpreventative care including early cancer detection and somewhat lesssatisfactory care for complicated illnesses where methods of treatment are notwell defined HMO clients were especially satisfied with the lower premiumsthey typically paid            No doubt an energetic investigator can dig uphorrible cases though most of Anders dont pass the outrage threshold sincein the end the patients got the care they sought But what about all thehorrible cases that flourished under the old system Anders devotes a wholechapter to examples of shoddy care in states primarily Tennessee that havesteered their Medicaid clients into HMOs But if Anders had wanted to find acarload of cases that move well beyond the shoddy into the truly horrific heneed only have consulted the regular Medicaid Fraud Reports put out by theNational Association of Attorneys General These I have perused with sickfascination for more than a decade The mildest of the reported casesmost ofthem the products of our traditional system of loving careinvolve the simpletheft by doctors dentists nursing homes chiropractors and the like ofthousands often millions of dollars or sometimes drugs from federal andstate governments The more colorful cases involve the infliction of tormentson helpless patients that would excite the envy of Pol Pot            Back in the s whenMedicaid passed into law with scant attention a few brave analysts dared tosuggest that the poor might be better served at far lower cost if the moneywere spent on developing wellstaffed multidisciplinary health clinics inchronically underserved inner cities and rural areassort of like well HMOsGood heavens snorted the conventional wisdom That would be to create twoclasses of care in this country one for the welloff and one for the poor Andso we consigned many of the needy to care that would be flattered to be calledsecondclass to the Medicaid Mills or to poorly trained solo practitionersor to wait in long lines at hospital emergency rooms till the harried staff canfind time to treat their kids runny noses            Nor toreturn to the start of our story is it only the poor who were often illservedby the kindly and notsokindly vagaries of our oldtime health system So asthe chorus of complaints about managed care swells to cathedralfillingvolume its worth remembering
