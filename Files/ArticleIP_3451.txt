                                 Reality vs ILarry FlyntI                           NOTE Life andArt a new department will compare movies books etc with the facts onwhich they ostensibly are based                        What makes this movie soeffective is that it doesnt sentimentalize or airbrush Larry Flynt wroteFrank Rich about The People vs Larry Flynt in the New YorkTimes  What is the point of making a film about the founder ofHustler that airbrushes both him and his magazine wondered KathaPollitt in The                Nation             Whos right Rich orPollitt How sharply does the film diverge from real life            Like most biopics ThePeople fudges lots of little details For example in the filmHustler s staff remains more or less constantwhereas in reality themasthead was constantly changing But composite characters are a cinematicdevice commonly used to reduce audience confusion and maintain narrativemomentum Its pretty harmless when actor Edward Nortons character AlanIsaacman stands in for the numerous lawyers Flynt hired through his ongoingcourt battles which numbered more than the four the film describes Howeverserving as the allpurpose lawyer required Isaacman to take a bullet that neveractually hit him In real life it was Gene Reeves Jr who was shot along withFlynt during the publishers  obscenity trial            Of moresignificance is the accusation that Milos Formans film turns the whollyunappetizing Larry Flynt into an awshucks lovably pigheaded guy There thecritics are on firmer ground Although Woody Harrelson playing Flynt in themovie cheerfully describes himself as a scum bag the movie clearly wants tohave it both ways on this and sanitizes Flynts life in order to do so            Flynt in the movie is an innocent who wakes upone day and discovers he is a rich publisher But the story behind the realFlynts fortune may not be so storybook The Cleveland Press reported in that Flynt had launched his publishing empire with the financial help ofvendingmachine companies that allegedly were linked to organized crimeShortly after Hustler made Flynt a millionaire he decided to distributethe publication himself In  Flynt began to distribute a few titles notowned by his company He sold his distribution company last July for a reported million The Washington Post reported back in  that thefraternity of wholesalers and national distributors viewed Flynt and hisalleged strongarm tactics his brother supposedly beat up a wholesaler whocouldnt pay as an unwelcome addition to the scene But that fraternitymight have included some rough players itself A book by former PenthouseForum editor John Heidenry titled What Wild EcstasyThe Rise and Fallof the Sexual Revolution to be published in April by Simon Schuster claims that Flynts move angered the Mafia which controlled thedistribution of many mens magazines Heidenry also reports that Flynt was indebt to mob moneylenders            The filmleaves puzzlingly open the question of who might have shot Flynt in paralyzing him and why At the end of the film onscreen typescript announcesthat his assailant was never brought to justice Yet Flynts case wasinvestigated and most press accounts consider it closed Joseph Paul Franklina white supremacist currently serving six life sentences for murder and theman to whom the rightwing paranoid cult classic The Turner Diaries  isdedicated made a jailhouse confession in Flynts shooting A grand juryindicted Franklin in  but he was never tried He was considered an escaperisk at trial according to law officials and he was in prison indefinitelyanyway Franklin does have a history of confessing to crimes all over thecountry He has also confessed to shooting Vernon E Jordan then president ofthe National Urban League in  a crime for which he was acquitted in Nevertheless Flynt at least believes that Franklin shot him            After the assassination attempt the moviesFlynt holes up in his Bel Air mansion with his wife Althea and they bothstart taking morphine and pills So far so good But the movies Flynt stopshis drug use cold turkey after a  operation to cauterize his nervessuggesting he had shot up only to alleviate his physical pain Flynt himselfsays in his recent autobiography An Unseemly Man  that he continuedselfmedicating even after his wife overdosedindeed until after his mostrecent nervecauterizing operation which was in March  He also says hewas taking amphetamines as early as well before he was paralyzedandspent much of my life hypedup dopedup or drunk            Flyntsmarriage to Althea was his fourth of five although from the movie youd thinkit was his only one The films portrayal of Flynt as a quasifeministenlightened male depends in large part on its portrait of Althea played byCourtney Love In the New York Review of Books  Louis Menand suggeststhe filmmakers went out of their way to remake Althea Flynt as a way to awardHustler a place it doesnt deserve in the sexual revolution The filmpositions Althea and Larry as intellectual and emotional equals He retains theright to sleep with other women so does she At the magazine she hasextensive editorial input which is true Even after he is paralyzed and theirsex life comes to an end their love endures            Their actual relationship was more complicatedIn the movie Larry hits Althea once she tells him never to do it again andhe doesnt But Heidenry writes that Larry beat Althea more than once and shetold Hustler that she didnt see anything wrong with a man striking awoman In the films account of Altheas  bathtub death Larry propels hiswheelchair into the bathroom and tries to save her His memoir says he asked anurse to check on her The nurse told People in  that she went intothe bathroom and then ran to Larry who was asleep            Andchildren The film gives the impression that Flynt has none although he hasfiveto the best of his knowledge One of them Tonya FlyntVega has accusedhim of sexually molesting her and in an interview in the current issue ofPenthouse  Flynts former brotherinlaw accuses him of molesting asecond daughter            The main point of critics such as GloriaSteinem who wrote an oped piece in the New York Times  is that thefilm sanitizes Hustler s unsavory sexuality Even the most cursory lookat back issues of Hustler confirms that the filmmakers seriouslymisrepresent its content The images we see or hear described in the movie arevaguely countercultural a Santawithanerection cartoon not sick Hustler s reallife jokes about Betty Fords mastectomy they aresoftcore centerfoldstyle nudes not hardcore the pictorial of a womangagged and bound on the top of a car The magazines humor often depended onracist and sexist stereotypes such as widegrinned watermeloneating blacksFlynt says he was parodying these stereotypes but the film carefully avoidsraising the issue            The film also exaggeratesFlynts martyrdom for the cause of free speech One instance At his trial Flynt was sentenced to seven to  years for obscenity and for engagingin organized crime The film portrays the sentencing and then a prison visitwhere Althea weeps Our bed is so empty In fact Flynt spent six days injail            As for Flynts climacticSupreme Court victory against evangelist Jerry Falwell who sued him foremotional distress the film sticks fairly closely to the facts Indeed thescreenwriters borrowed lines from the court transcript At an earlier SupremeCourt appearance though Flynt shouted Fuck this court and called thejustices eight assholes and one token cunt That transcript didnt make themovie
