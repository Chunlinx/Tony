                 i would say Arlington Texas now because i talked to one night to somebody in Arlington Virginia   oh my yeah and well uh Plano Texas rather than Plano Illinois   oh do they have one   yes they do   oh i didnt know that well i learned something already   yeah well lets see the three questions are what um   how much time do you spend with your children   very little because theyre grown theyre grown and gone   oh what oh yeah well mines are down at UT Austin in college and the other ones in high school so you do spend less time then because     yeah because they dont want to know they almost dont want to know us   they wanna be with their friends well how old are your kids are they married or what   yeah uh yes i have uh two married two almost and then two almost married and the other two oh im not sure well two single two two  uh uh for sure single     oh  boy you have a lot of kids you   yeah we have between the spouse and myself we have six   oh thats kind of nice though you   because i came with a split family and she had one   you shouldnt be lonesome on a holiday huh   well no theres so much of them are gone and theyre doing their own things and   well thats true   and a lot of times they theyve got you know  uh       on the holidays a lot   they have to see their other parent i guess too   yeah and sometimes they want to do their own thing so sometimes its just spouse and me and and you know what   i know right   sometimes thats okay   i know thats what my mother said one time   because you know right because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time   right   for the holidays   no thats true and if they force them to you know thats not good either   yeah that becomes a drudgery and when you   well do they all live in the area   well lets see ive got of the six weve got four around here   umhum oh wow   uh you know well were talking like North Texas and then one is in Vermont uh Montpelier Montpelier Monteplier Montpelier Vermont and the other ones in Everett Washington   umhum golly howd they end up so far away   well that is  thats the the the my little pair   uhhuh   and my second marriage um and uh   those are the youngest ones     yeah yeah well the second the the the the fourth and fifth child of the the  of the uh six are the two that are scattered like that   umhum boy that those are a long way howd   and well they wanted to go uh JR my my my least son or my middle son excuse me fell in love with Washington state and the the the third daughter fell in love with uh   umhum umhum   uh Vermont so yeah thats where theyve gone to make their homes   Vermont so they wanted to make their homes there huh my goodness are they are those two married   no   are they uh just working up there or going to school or what   well uh lets see yeah i guess youd say JR is  working and going to school trying to go to school   umhum   i wish to God he would go back   oh they do eventually if they have if theyre meant to i think   yeah well i certainly hope so   i mean ive got a daughter thats a sophomore at UT and im im going to UTA right now myself so its never too late   uhhuh well its oh i agree its never too late   right especially in some of these schools around here i think they have about twenty percent older students   and yeah and when youre saying older were talking fifty up   oh yeah ive seen some people that are really really quite up there  you know they look like in their very late sixties and i say thats great why not you know   uhhuh oh my uhhuh yes why not because thats a a lot of times well its i i believe that uh we in that category and im not in that category quite yet   but no   but we are seasoned minds   oh yeah youre really ready to learn finally finally i mean i dont know why i even went to college when i was seventeen it was a complete waste of money   yes uhhuh yeah it was yeah settle down we know what were wanting to to uh study and uh   right right now were   we know our limitations   right and uh   and we dont try to burn the candle at both ends and then the middle altogether   no we dont go out drinking beer till three and then you try to go to class in the morning were past yeah were past that age   at seven yeah yes were were smarter than that   we know what we can do  oh   yack right um so lets see so mine and i dont spend a whole lot of time because theyre not here   umhum   and so the second question  i forgot what the second question   what was it what uh how what do the trends in families and do we approve of what other families do   well uh the trends in the families were to spread apart do your own thing but i have seen lately yes i am seeing   thats right a change i was gonna say the same thing   im seeing a change that whoops government cant do it schools are not able to and between a persons religion   umhum umhum   uh their their faith in their maker whether whether you know uh whether youre Christian or Jewish or whatever  uh and the family   right right   those are the two that can that that have the wherewithal and of course   or gonna have sauce on the bone huh   JudeoChristianity uh and the the Jewish folks too believe that the family unit is the one that was given the uh um mission by the Lord to do this very thing so when another group of of uh people step in try to do it theyre theyre tromping on our territory so to speak so i firmly believe that uh   umhum oh
