                well the health care several of the candidates i think in particular i think it was Senator Carey wanted to do national health care were were in  were in a disaster we need we need some sort of health care thats available to everybody and the prices just seem to be really escalating the price of medication is is so exuberant       that uh a lot of people just cant afford it and insurance is is so expensive   well uh even even for older residents senior citizens the Medicare and Medicaid does not cover enough of what they need   uhhuh   and social security as far as helping them in their retirement is not going to be adequate by the time were ready for it   uhhuh   and and doctor doctor visits medicine hospitalization if they increase at the rate they are now   umhum   theres not going to be anybody that can afford it   umhum well you know i just i dont have im an older student but im going i went back to school and like im just finishing up but so my finances are kind of shaky at times and i cant afford dental insurance and i had to have to have a tooth extracted and i had to pay cash for it and i asked the dentist how come you know the price is so high i said i said i i thought because you know the prices of medication you know like it costs them ten cents to to make a pill and they charge you two dollars and he said one of the reasons is the litigation for um claims against the doctors so they lawyers have got their their fingers fingers in the pie too       and thats its sort of like trickling down for the overall cost and the the doctors have um   might say a production line and just like i i said well how much is it going to cost he goes well itll cost you um seventy dollars he no he says itll cost you seventy dollars and then i require an xray okay and so itll cost you a hundred and two dollars well i knew which tooth it was and he knew it was too and all i needed was extract it but he wanted he wanted to make the money so theyre theyre theyre taught that people should have certain services whether regardless of whether they need them or not   exactly and theyre making it almost impossible for people to go and get well routine care shall we say insurance now wont cover uh wellness visits   uhhuh uhhuh   or uh children baby visits your insurance wont cover that anymore   but   uhhuh umhum   and i thought well does it pay for you to be a fit well individual when your insurance doesnt even cover things like that   umhum   and the thing is just like dental hospitalization and dental its unbelievable     i havent   you can go to the hospital and youll pay four dollars for a aspirin   i havent been in the the job market for oh three or four years i mean i ive worked and things but i havent really had you might say a fulltime job health coverage and things like that but ive uh done you know ive done readings and and things and in fact i was watching on the TV       is that if you work for a small company just say maybe thirty to forty employees and you have theyre insured and your employees are sure are insured under whats called the group plan   uhhuh   well if one or two of the people in that group happened to have a chronic illness where it it you need they need care all the time like say they had a child that that needed uh a lung machine and a respirator and a nurse to come in and things like this well what they would do is they would just cancel everybodys insurance and say were not going to cover you and then the employees are out uh health insurance   exactly our our group medical plan has increased every year in the past three years uh i work for Edward D Jones stockbrokerage   where do you work uhhuh uhhuh   and its just every year   uhhuh   every year is just a little bit more of course our you our cost um arent hardly anything compared to people that have to go out and get their own because of the group plan but   umhum um   it is the costs have increased every year   then plus the coverages they they decrease so you they dont want you to see the the the deductibles increase too   umhum exactly we did start a plan this year theres an insurance company through Metropolitan Life that has started a flexible plan   umhum   and with that they will take out pre tax dollars and build it up and it will cover things that your regular insurance wont eyeglasses uh dentist visits   um umhum   uh wellness care prescriptions that are not covered through your insurance and thats the first time i have seen any   umhum umhum     effort effort at all     umhum   to make a change in the
