        okay um       im very unhandy in these things and uh i dont like to do anything myself   yeah   i like to have a service station i can feel confident about   yeah i uh   which is problematical   ive been working on my car since or actually on on cars since i was probably about fourteen   umhum   uh ive ive got a sixty six Mustang out in the back that ive been trying to get running here lately thats given me a lot of problems and the the clutch and stuff isnt working out right and every time i try to put the battery in it doesnt have enough charge on it so i have to take it over to a friends house and get it charged up again try try it again it rained here all last week so i didnt get a chance to do it   oh is it is the problem that its hard to get the appropriate battery and other types of things for a a sixty six car   uh no its not  i dont know exactly what it is with the battery i think its just that  every time i charge it up it it has to sit i i i went and got a new battery and brought it home and then it sat there for two weeks so i went over to a friends house and charged it up and then it started raining so i havent been able to do it for another week so ill have to take it over there and get it charged again and maybe ill be able to see if that wont get it going tomorrow but uh but my main problems been my clutch i   is do you rely on this car for for primary transportation or just excuse me   im supposed to   im sorry   i said i said im supposed to it uh its been down for quite some time now and i been having a lot of trouble with it   so  are you struggling to get around as a result   yeah i have to rely on friends and parents and stuff like that so you you dont do any kind of car work or   i try not to um   try not to anyway yeah i can understand that   i suppose i ought to learn to change the oil and things i can save a lot of money doing that   yeah i think i can understand that i its not the most fun in the world but it it like you said it is it is cheaper on yourself to to go ahead and do it yourself than go spend fifty sixty dollars to have somebody else you know just change your oil or something like that   i mean it must be great to to to really understand whats whats going on and you can both do things yourself and  talk confidently with people when you have to take it somewhere to get parts or whatever   yeah yeah thats that i think thats what my next option is if the if the clutch doesnt work right to take it to somebody and see if they cant decipher what the problem is i i have a feeling maybe its just that ive ive put too strong of a clutch in it because ive got its a its a straight six two hundred with a three speed transmission in it and ive tried to put a racing clutch in it which i think is gonna you know i think that may be what my problem is its its too much clutch for the amount of engine ive got but uh well see   was it easy to get a more appropriate clutch   pardon yeah its it i just go to my neighborhood parts store and get another one its that when i when i had to rebuilt engine engine rebuilt i decided to try a um a better clutch so that id quit changing them out every six months i i have a slight lead foot   you have a slight   a slight lead foot yes it means it means ive always got my foot in the gas and and and the other one in the in the clutch so i i burn up the clutch a lot   oh   its not good for it but uh   um   any any questions you have about uh anything anything easy to to work on or whatever or are you trying to get yourself into working on cars or what   well the car i drove is an eighty four and its reached the point   yeah   where various things are are going wrong with it and its had to be in recently   yeah   it needed a new battery it wouldnt start um   yeah   my wife and i did manage to to uh recharge the battery from the other car um and the exhaust system has needed work and um   yeah   uh so  the latest work done it just yesterday was to have the front wheels aligned   yeah   uh so weve been spending   dont dont dont tell me let me guess your warranty just ran out and now everything goes wrong right   yes in fact   in fact on the battery uh uh its the old one it had a four year warranty and the day it gave up was four years and six days   typical  i i dont i dont know what it is somehow another car manufacturers and the manufacturers of new parts for them   uh   they put their warranties on there and they know exactly when theyre gonna run out when the when the part is gonna is gonna break down
