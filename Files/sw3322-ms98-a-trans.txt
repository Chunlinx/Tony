        ah i take a lot of magazines that i dont have time to read right away how about you      well i normally buy them at the grocery store i get like McCalls and Womans Day and and Ladies Home Journal     oh oh that way you can get them as you as you wanna read them   yeah if i have time to read them   you know well mine i subscribe and then ill let them stack up and then and then ill drop my subscription for a year and catch up   i understand that  actually for a while we were taking like Family Handyman and Thousand and One Home Ideas   uh you you think you can make yeah uhhuh   because our house is like forty five years well fifty years old now  and we were trying to do see what we could do for renovations so   oh my oh well thats good do you find the magazines help you on that   they really uh theyve got a lot of good ideas     umhum well we   and it its nice to get i mean at least on those you could get a lot of tips from it which you may not want to do the project exactly like they show you how to do it but at least theyll give you ideas that you can use parts and bits and pieces of it   umhum yeah   i have a friend who does that with her magazines and she keeps a file and cuts them out then she has them when she needs them   uhhuh thats ive started doing that because i had so many magazines pile up on my desk at work and and around the house is  cutting out recipes and putting them in like a photo album   umhum umhum oh yeah thats a good idea   and as long as theyre only on one side of the page but that way you know you can do that with recipes out of anything and then little organizing tips and and handy hints around the house and that kind of stuff   umhum umhum umhum umhum   but i like i like those kind of the womens magazine i guess theyre called   oh yes oh yes oh yes i think that my husband gets as much out of that recipes as i do on those he likes to read those   uhhuh  uhhuh well theyve got some some good ideas on things that i probably wouldnt try otherwise  you know     thats true and then you read halfway through the recipe and its stuff you dont buy otherwise   exactly  yeah we do that too   yeah we also take uh A Progressive Farmer and we uh get a lot of hints we uh we have a a weekend farm and we get a lot of hints on gardening from that   oh oh   and then the gardening magazines  and uh i found out that we could plant uh fall potatoes and im gonna wait and hope that they grow so uh i guess     ooh ooh my motherinlaw does a lot of gardening and i know she takes a couple of gardening magazines too as well as as well as seed catalogs   a lot of those are in umhum oh yeah the seed catalogs are fun to look through even if you dont buy them   uhhuh uhhuh i like to look through just when we go down there thats interesting because they have a little a little place outside of Waxahachie so thats nice to go down there   umhum ooh well thats they used to oh and right where the rain is tonight oh ooh my are they all right   yes yes exactly um as far as we know actually i think theyre out of town this or they are either on their way back or just got back from Georgia so  hopefully they missed most of the rain   well good yeah well on the magazines again it sounds like you and i like about the same things i like to look at the pretty pictures   uhhuh i do too and i like to look at some of the fashion things going id never buy that for that price i can get it at Target or  somewhere else and i can make do with something a lot closer   umhum umhum uhhuh if its gonna cost that much ill do with what i already have right or some of the styles are kind of weird too so   uh yeah thats a they really are i noticed one today as i was looking through a magazine up again cleaning out my desk and looking for one specific thing and i found an article on   umhum   you take this red wool dress knit wool dress and you can accessorize it with beads or with with uh   umhum umhum   you can put a sweater over it or you can just wear it with leggings or you could wear it with all different jewelry and its like okay   um and bells yeah give you some good ideas   that would be cute it would be cute but i couldnt see myself doing any of that  im only thirty but i just still cant see myself doing that   no oh well oh well theres some of us that are uh dont do things  i i see people come in with the leggings up to whatever and the real short things and i dont know how they but i guess if they feel comfortable in them   yeah oh   well yeah thats i can i like what they call harem pants the baggy slacks but i cant see wearing just the leggings and a a a sweater something like that is like nope sorry not my style not quite   oh yeah umhum umhum yeah i was looking at a magazine today at the hairstyles and it was showing what it assumed was i think twelve different styles and they were all cut alike   uhhuh huh   but they did something a little different with them   uhhuh but that that i would be interested in that would be good   if i could actually get my hair to do that   yeah thats yeah that helps and i course and yeah and course the proverbial diets and uh all that but every book seems to have that diet in it   and Mary Ellens helpful helpful hints and all those now see i like those i think those are fun   oh yeah i lost twenty five pounds yeah i lost twenty five pounds now you can do the same oh yeah   thats right thats right sure just eating right seven days a week and umhum   uhhuh and exercise and do all this fancy stuff at morning noon and night   uhhuh when we have two kids and and have to work full time right right   well right and you do this in your spare time while youre talking on the telephone right   thats right thats right youre supposed to
