                    Introduction        Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic debilitating        autoimmune disease of unknown etiology Although the        disease is characterized by synovitis of the joints tendon        sheaths and bursae manifestations that do not involve the        synovium are not infrequent   These articular and        systemic manifestations appear to be mediated by        immunologic processes   The hallmarks of the synovial        abnormalities in rheumatoid arthritis are synovial lining        cell proliferation neoangiogenesis and inflammatory cell        infiltration involving the myeloid macrophage and        lymphoid lineages    There has been considerable        controversy regarding the relative importance of the types        of cells and their products involved in the inflammatory        processes of rheumatoid arthritis   Nevertheless it        seems likely that all of these cell types participate to        some degree in disease pathogenesis        Evidence in support of Tcell involvement in rheumatoid        arthritis involves the description of restricted subsets of        T cells in the blood and synovial tissue that either        express or lack certain surface membrane proteins or that        express a limited set of antigen receptors For example        clonal amplifications of CD CD T cells are frequently        found in the Tcell repertoire of rheumatoid arthritis        patients   Furthermore expanded clones of CD CD T        cells exist in the blood and synovial compartments of such        patients   and these T cells appear to be autoreactive          Finally the Tcell receptors for antigen expressed by        these and other Tcell subsets frequently display a bias in        favor of receptors utilizing certain V genes                       In contrast to the extensive studies of the clonal        distribution of T cells in rheumatoid arthritis much less        is known about the level of Bcell diversity in this        disease Previous studies however are consistent with the        interpretation that the Bcell repertoire is also        restricted For example flow cytometric analyses of        circulating B cells   suggested that oligoclonality        exists and cell culture experiments             demonstrated that synovial tissue explants spontaneously        secrete immunoglobulins of restricted heterogeneity as        defined by immunoglobulin IgG subclass isoelectric        focusing and idiotype expression More recent molecular        analyses of the immunoglobulin genes expressed by B cells        in the synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients        support these notions              These findings are important because they suggest that        at the B and Tcell levels an ongoing immune reaction is        occurring that is directed at restricted sets of        autoantigens The present study was designed to analyze        further the level of clonal diversity in rheumatoid        arthritis B cells by using the length of the third        complementarity determining region CDR of the rearranged        heavy H chain variable region V gene as a marker        herein referred to as HCDR A modification of the        immunoglobulin V         H gene fingerprinting method   that        has been used to analyze the diversity of B cells and T        cells in several clinical settings      was        used to address this issue The present data suggest that        Bcell clonal expansion is a common and characteristic        feature of rheumatoid arthritis that it involves both        resting and activated cells and that it can persist over        extended periods of time These findings support the idea        that a chronic autoimmune reaction is operative in        rheumatoid arthritis                    Materials and methods                  Patients and patient samples          Heparinized venous blood

expansions using a          modified immunoglobulin V Hgene fingerprinting          assay          During normal B cell development the processes of          gene segment recombination and coding end processing          yield nucleotide HCDR lengths that are characteristic          and virtually invariant for an individual Bcell clone          Therefore these lengths can be used as signatures to          identify members of a B cell clone The immunoglobulin V           H gene fingerprinting approach            takes advantage of the wide range of HCDR lengths that          can occur in human B cells approximately  amino          acids to provide an estimate of clonal diversity in          polyclonal populations When polyclonal B lymphocytes          from adults are analyzed using this assay they display a          Gaussian HCDR length distribution around a mean of          approximately  amino acids The presence of an          individual dominant length that differs from this          Gaussian distribution can be used as an indication of a          specific Bcell clonal expansion          Figure illustrates schematically the twostage          immunoglobulin V           H gene fingerprinting approach that we          utilized Note that when cDNA prepared from normal          peripheral blood B cells is used as a template for these          V           H familyspecific and C           H specific assays ladders of HCDR          lengths that differ by three nucleotides are identified          These individual HCDR lengths are signatures of the          various individual Bcell clones contained within the          polyclonal population The intensities of the bands in          virtually all of the ladders illustrated in Figure are          relatively uniformly distributed around the mean This          indicates that there are no dominant HCDR lengths that          skew the Gaussian distribution and therefore that there          are no significant clonal expansions among the B cells          that express most of these V           H C           H combinations Similar results are          obtained using the genomic DNAbased assay although          these results cannot be interpreted in a C           H specific manner data not          shown          In the V           H IgG combination Fig  however          a nonGaussian distribution is noted even in this normal          individual This could be a reflection of the numbers of          V           H genes present in the V           H family being analyzed it is more          likely to see a nonGaussian distribution in families          with small numbers of individual genes or of the state          of activation of a specific clone because activated B          cells contain much higher levels of V gene messenger RNA          than resting B cells We believe that in the instance          illustrated in Figure the latter possibility is more          likely because the small V           H  and V           H  families only two gene members          per family do not exhibit the same degree of          oligoclonality as that observed with the only somewhat          smaller V           H  family one gene member                          Distinction between clonal expansion and clonal          activation using the modified immunoglobulin V Hgene          fingerprinting assay          Because Bcell activation and differentiation result          in dramatic increases in immunoglobulin V gene messenger          RNA these fingerprinting assays cannot readily          distinguish between clonal expansion and activation when          cDNA is used as a starting template Because DNA levels          are not appreciably altered by cellular activation          however the use of genomic DNA as well as cDNA from the          same sample of B cells helps to distinguish these two          processes          Thus in the setting of specific Bcell clonal          expansion without concomitant cellular activation the          DNAbased fingerprinting assay will indicate a dominant          HCDR length whereas the cDNAbased assay may not data          not shown Conversely in the setting of specific Bcell          clonal activation without concomitant clonal expansion          the cDNAbased assay will indicate a dominant HCDR          length whereas the DNAbased assay may not Finally in          the setting of specific Bcell clonal activation with          concomitant clonal expansion both the cDNA and the          DNAbased assays will indicate a dominant HCDR          length          These distinctions were very reproducible in the          following studies There were no situations in which          evidence for cellular activation either selective or          accompanied by clonal expansion was present in one set          of analyses and not in a subsequent set using the same          starting materials                          B cells in the blood synovial fluid and synovial          tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients exhibit clonal          expansions of activated and resting B cells          We analyzed the peripheral blood synovial fluid and          synovial tissue B cells of rheumatoid arthritis patients                     n    and  respectively          using the genomic DNA and cDNAbased fingerprinting          assays to develop an understanding of the diversity of          the B cells in these compartments Figures and are          illustrations of representative patients for whom          concomitant blood and synovial fluid or blood and          synovial tissue samples were available In order to          simplify the Figures only the results for two large V           H families V           H  and V           H  and two small V           H families V           H  and V           H  are provided although assays for          each V           H family and each major CH family           and  were performed and revealed similar          findings          The genomic DNAbased assays in both patients          indicated that clonal expansions are common in the blood          of rheumatoid arthritis patients This type of result was          obtained with all individuals tested It was most          convincingly demonstrated by the results in Figure          obtained from B cells expressing genes of the V           H  and V           H  families Because these V           H families contain the largest numbers          of V           H genes they would be more likely to          display a polyclonal pattern          An even more striking level of Bcell clonal dominance          and expansion was seen when the genomic DNAbased assay          was used to analyze B cells from the synovial fluid or          synovial tissue Figs and  In these analyses          virtually all V           H families demonstrated extensive          Bcell oligoclonality It should be pointed out that when          an individual HCDR length comprises more than  of the          radioactive counts of a V           H C           H ladder clonality based on DNA          sequencing is very likely when an individual length          comprises more than  of the radioactivity clonality          is virtually assured data not shown          Collectively these data indicate that the Bcell          repertoire of rheumatoid arthritis patients is skewed          away from the typical apparently random representation          of normal individuals The reason for this discrepancy is          not clear although one possibility is that restricted          antigenic exposure alters the composition of the          repertoire in favor of B cells reactive with the putative          antigens If this is so the progressive narrowing of          the repertoire from the blood to the synovial tissue is          consistent with the ideas that the antigenic exposures          are originating at these sites and that the synovial          compartment is supporting clonal amplification Because          these are true clonal expansions ie increased numbers of          B cells per specific clone it is likely that the          antigenic exposures are chronic and therefore are          increasing the numbers of memory B cells reactive with          these determinants          In order to confirm that these clonally expanded B          cells were receiving ongoing antigenic stimulation and          not limited solely to the memory compartment we employed          the cDNAbased assay to distinguish clonal expansions of          activated B cells from resting memory cells As          illustrated in Figure  activated Bcell clones          identified by the letter A in Fig  expressing each          of the immunoglobulin heavychain isotypes were easily          identified in all the V           H families studied In some instances          these activated clones were also expanded numerically as          defined by the genomic DNAbased assays and identified          by the letter E in Fig  In other cases these          activated clones did not appear to be numerically          expanded Similar examples can be found in Figures and           but they are not identified by letters in order to          simplify the Figures          Thus it appears that many discrete Bcell clones          exist in the synovial compartment of rheumatoid arthritis          patients and that these are increased in number          consistent with a response to a restricted antigenic          challenges Furthermore these Bcell clones appear to          be of both the resting memory and the activated types          suggesting that these antigenic challenges are chronic          and ongoing Thus these data support and extend previous          findings       by indicating that          specific Bcell clonal amplifications can occur both in          previously stimulated B cells and in currently activated          B cells The presence of activated B cells that are not          increased in number is consistent either with recent           in situ synoviumspecific          stimulation of these Bcell clones or with the influx of          activated B cells that were stimulated by antigens          outside of and not necessarily relevant to the synovial          compartment                          Bcell clonal expansions in the blood and synovial          compartments can be restricted to one or another          compartment or be common to the two          Because the preceding data indicated that the Bcell          repertoire of rheumatoid arthritis patients contains          expanded clones of B cells that can be resting or          activated we investigated whether the same clones could          be identified in both the blood and synovial          compartments Figures and illustrate data that suggest          that there are expanded clones that are blood restricted          joint restricted or are common to both compartments          Examples of bloodrestricted clones are highlighted on          Figures and with the  symbol those that are          jointrestricted with the  symbol and those that are          common to the two compartments with the  symbol These          findings suggest that there may be a degree of cellular          trafficking between the blood and the synovial          tissues          In order to address this issue we studied the B cells          of the blood and two synovial sites right and left hip          that were obtained from the same patient within  h of          each other Fig  In this patient the DNAbased assay          provided examples of clonal expansions that were present          in only one joint eg the V           H J           H and V           H J           H combinations in Figure  and the          companion cDNAbased assays indicated that in some          instances these expansions were either activated or          resting In only rare instances however did the data          suggest that a similar clone was present in two different          synovial tissues DNA sequence analyses confirmed the          rarity of this event data not shown Thus it appears          that in most instances the clonal amplifications occur           in situ and are not the result of          trafficking from one anatomic site to another If so          this would suggest that the antigenic challenges driving          these clonal expansions may not be common to all synovial          tissues but may be generated independently at each site          possibly by ongoing tissue breakdown                          Clonal persistence in the synovial fluid          compartment          If the clonal expansions identified in the joints of          rheumatoid arthritis patients are due to an ongoing          response to antigen then one would predict that at least          some of the clones would persist over time To test this          we studied the synovial fluid B cells from the same          joints of three patients on two occasions spanning          several months Most of the clonal expansions detected on          the initial samples were not present in the subsequent          samples In a few instances however Bcell clonal          persistence was found          Figure illustrates the best example of this          phenomenon in a patient who was studied over a month          interval The DNAbased assay using V           H  familyspecific primers indicated          the presence of two similar clones on days  and           whereas the other V           H expressing clones detected at the          first analysis were no longer present at the time of the          second analysis DNA sequence analyses of one of these          two clones confirmed their identity because each          displayed the same rearranged V           H DJ           H gene with identical V           H mutations and identical HCDR          sequences data not shown Therefore certain clones can          persist locally over time suggesting that a common and          persistent antigenic stimulation was operable in the          joint of this rheumatoid arthritis patient          The lack of persistence of the other Bcell clones          suggests two possibilities First the initial set of          Bcell clones might have been replaced by others that          recognized and responded to different antigenic epitopes          on the same original immunogenic protein This type of          clonal evolution to the recognition of different epitopes          on the same immunogenic moiety is common in experimental          situations in which repetitive immunizations with a          defined antigen are delivered     The other          possibility is that the B cells that disappeared over          time were not reactive with tissue antigens These could          have been stimulated by irrelevant antigens in the          periphery and therefore after entering the synovial          compartment could not be restimulated and hence could          not enter the memory pool and take up residence in the          synovial tissue                            Conclusion        The present data indicate that clonal expansion is a        common occurrence in the Bcell repertoire of rheumatoid        arthritis patients These expansions involve both resting        memory B cells and activated B cells some of which are        derived from the memory Bcell compartment Because the        extent of these clonal expansions increases from the blood        to the synovial compartment this progressive narrowing in        diversity implies that antigens located in the synovia are        responsible for these antigenreceptor biases In support        of this hypothesis are the observations that some of these        clonal expansions are joint specific Because identical        clones are rarely found in two different joints however        these immune reactions are probably unique to each        individual joint Furthermore because it is unlikely that        each joint would harbor a different foreign antigen these        B cells are most likely reacting with autoantigens        generated locally possibly by local tissue breakdown        Recent studies    have demonstrated that the        synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients can        develop lymphoid aggregates that have the cellular        components of an ectopic germinal center and that can        sustain Bcell clonal expansion and diversification It is        likely that the B cells that mature in these        pseudogerminal centers and those that we have identified        in the present studies are responding to specific        autoantigens Therefore the identification of the        antigenic reactivities of these B cells and in particular        those B cells within the memory compartment that have        presumably traversed the pseudogerminal centers and        undergone autoantigen and T cell selection and rescue        may provide important clues to the role of B lymphocytes        and their immunoglobulin molecules in the        immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis
