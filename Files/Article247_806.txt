laserguided bombs at the battery destroying itThe Iraqis claim that four Iraqis were killed and that one US plane wasalmost certainly shot down The US doesnt dispute the death toll butdismisses the shootdown claim as groundless Everybody quotes PresidentClintons defense of the US pilots response and his support for continuingto control much of Iraqs airspace The LAT and NYT explain thatthe nofly
