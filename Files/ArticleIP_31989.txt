                                 Students vs Ayatollahs            Thecrisis in Iran was the top story across most of Europe and the Middle EastWednesday though in Britain and Ireland it was overshadowed by those twocountries frantic efforts to save the Northern Ireland peace settlement andin Israel by Prime Minister Ehud Baraks imminent visit to Washington In theFar East the big issue is the tension between China and Taiwan over thelatters abandonment of the one China principle            Thestudent riots in Tehran were taken most seriously by the Italian newspaperssome of which led their front pages with dramatic headlinesA Day of CivilWar  La Stampaof Turin The Fist of the Ayatollahs  La Repubblica of Romeand devoted several pages totheir coverage of the unrest La Repubblica ran an interview with RezaCiro Pahlavi the yearold son of the last shah of Iran who expressedeagerness to return to his country as a constitutional monarch He criticizedhis father for understanding too late the Iranian peoples yearning fordemocracy saying that this was the cause of his overthrow  years ago and nowof the student revolt against the ayatollahs He called on the West to supportthe prodemocracy movement and said that what matters most for Iran now isfaith in secularism the separation of religion and the state He hopes thatIran will become the first Islamic country to embark on the road ofdemocratization            Historical comparisons proliferated in the comments on Iran Pahlavi comparedthe reformist President Mohammed Khatami to Mikhail Gorbachev saying he wasattempting an Iranian perestroika Corriere dellaSera likened the situation in Tehran to that of Prague in  SeveralArab commentators referred to the repression of the student protests as IransTiananmen Square and the PanArab daily alQuds alArabi said Mondayin an editorial that the uprising was reminiscent of the student revolt inIndonesia that led to the overthrow of the Suharto regime            In aneditorial Tuesday Saudi Arabias leading daily Asharq alAwsat  urgedKhatami to slow the pace of his political reform program rather than play intothe hands of the hardliners The latest developments vindicate earlierwarnings that Khatamis opponents might resort to provoking acts of violencefollowed by a harsh crackdown on free debate and freedom of expression thepaper said Irans only chance of finding a way out of its current crisis liesthrough institutional politics not the politics of the street It would bebetter for President Khatami to play a longterm game and not let his opponentsdictate the pace at which he should implement his reform program            But inBahrains Akhbar alKhaleej  commentator Assayed Zahra wrote thatreform openness and liberty are now inevitable in Iran The only waywidespread civil strife can be avoided is by the conservative forces realizingthat time is not on their side andshould they decide to continue the strugglethrough to its bitter endthey would be leading Iran to catastrophe TheLebanese commentator Joseph Samaha wrote in the PanArab alHayat thatthe events in Tehran show how much further Iran has gone down the road towarddemocracy than the Arab world has because in Iran the movement for politicalreform apparently enjoys mass popular support            InIsrael Haaretz reported Wednesday that in the view of the Israelidefense establishment the Iranian theocracy is still not in serious danger ofbeing toppled but that if it were overthrown it would have enormousimplications for the entire Middle East One

Tuesday the daily Yediot Aharanot quoted Barak sayingin a private meeting that the events in Iran could change the face of theMiddle East in a revolutionary manner and might already have an impact on hisgovernments peace negotiations with Syria Barak believes that while therewill be no revolution in Iran in the short term changes will take placefaster than expected the paper said            BothHaaretz and the Jerusalem Post led their front pages Wednesday with headlinessaying there are high hopes in Israel for Baraks visit to the United StatesHaaretz said Barak wants to connect with Clinton in a way that willallow him to extract a promise that the US will not intervene inIsraeliPalestinian permanent status negotiations nor make policy statementswithout first coordinating positions with Israel The Jerusalem Postsaid hehopes to find a common language with US President Bill Clinton a sympatheticear at the State Department and a sense that the days of tense IsraelUSrelations are over The paper quoted a Barak spokesman as saying he wasseeking only an exchange of ideas and positions with Clinton and was notintending to commit himself to any timetables on the Middle East peace processbut it added The sense that there is no rush is something of a facade Infact time is of the essence The coming year is crucial for both Barak andClinton            InChina Wednesday Peoples Daily  the official government newspaper saidthat Taiwanese President Lee Tenghui was overrating his strength like an anttrying to topple a tree As Beijing continued to threaten force to haltTaiwans pretensions to independent statehood the South China MorningPost of Hong Kong accused Lee of pursuing a dangerous course Saying itwas unclear what he hoped to accomplish by ending his one China policy thepaper commented in an editorial that what he had done was weaken theconstructive ambiguity which has marked relations across the Taiwan Strait fortwo decades or more and which has kept them essentially peaceful It said ithoped that the two countries or bits of the same country may yet find waysof maintaining the useful imprecision of recent years            TheMoscow Times said Tuesday that Republican frontrunner George W Bush ismissing an excellent opportunity to attack his leading Democratic opponent AlGore for the administrations policies toward Russia Washington underPresident Bill Clinton began by embracing Boris Yeltsin gushing about thebooming Russian stock market and bragging about the millions of propertyowners created by the dream team of Anatoly Chubais and his privatizers thepaper said in an editorial Now just a few short years later the Clintonteam is defensively and guiltily struggling to ignore the worlds largestcountry and top US officials disingenuously profess not to be worried by thesight of Russian blackjack bombers flying over Norway in a nosethumbinggesture at the West But Bush so far does not seem to have the stomach forwhat is really required on Russia an American apology of the sort Clinton soloves to hand out for the longdead practice of American slavery for genocidein Rwanda and for other US moral lapses and a rebuilding from the ground upof this key strategic relationship
