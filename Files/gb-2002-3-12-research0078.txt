                    Background        The discovery of genes underlying multigenic diseases        and traits is one of the most important challenges        currently facing genetic researchers This effort has been        aided by quantitative trait locus QTL mapping methods        which have now been applied to numerous complex phenotypes        in a range of species including many behavioral phenotypes        of high interest A QTL is a chromosomal region that        contains a gene or genes that influence a quantitative        trait The power of this approach was first demonstrated in        plants   and later in yeast   flies   livestock           rodents      and humans                   Historically a typical approach to going from QTL to        gene has been to select one or a few of the best biological        candidate genes from within the QTL interval and search for        sequence differences that predict differential expression        andor structure of the gene product An alternative        strategy is to carry out comparative sequencing of large        numbers of potential candidate genes located within the QTL        interval which is feasible given the automated sequencing        methods now available   However these approaches are        limited because the gene underlying a QTL may not be        recognized as a good candidate gene if little is known        about the genes function andor if a QTL region is large        in which case sequencing every gene within the QTL requires        considerable time cost and labor to complete        The recent development of murine wholegenome draft        sequences   should speed the process of identifying        disease genes underlying QTLs because several of the        strains used for genome sequencing are the same as those        that have been used to develop the majority of mouse QTLs        so far identified The public mouse genome sequencing        effort used CBLJ B mice while the private effort by        Celera has sequenced the mouse genome in four strains        DBAJ D AJ XSvJ and SSvImJ Combinations        of these strains for example BxD and BxAJ have been        used for the identification of over  murine QTLs        Because of these resources we reasoned that sequence        variations in QTL genes might now be identified simply by        direct         in silico alignment of the sequences        obtained directly from the databases of the two relevant        strains obviating much of the need for         de novo sequencing We show that        once several factors were addressed such as sequencing        error detection and discrimination between closely related        genes a highthroughput pipeline could be developed that        allows large numbers of genecoding regions from QTL        intervals to be rapidly compared         in silico and interstrain allelic        sequence differences quickly identified and targeted for        further hypothesisdriven analyses We also believe that        this strategy has considerable general utility and should        be applicable to any QTL as long as the strains used are        those for which relatively complete genome sequences are        available        While our work was in progress Celera incorporated the        public B sequence into its mouse genome assembly and        developed a searchable database of mouse single nucleotide        polymorphisms SNPs   Comparison of the gene variants        identified by our approach to the SNPs identified by a        search of Celeras SNP database indicates that the latter        significantly underestimates the number of SNPs present and        that the method described here provides the most complete        and accurate compilation of QTL gene variants        We tested this approach on two QTLs involved in physical        dependence on ethanol these are located on murine        chromosomes  and  and were identified using two mapping        populations derived from the B and D progenitor strains        The well documented difference in susceptibility to        withdrawal after chronic ethanol exposure between the B        and D inbred mouse strains provided an excellent starting        point for dissecting genetic influences involved in        physical dependence on ethanol and to study how common        allele variants influence genetic predisposition to        physical dependence on ethanol Genomewide evaluations of        chronic ethanol withdrawal convulsions identified QTLs on        murine chromosomes    and    The QTLs on        chromosome  and chromosome  a sexlimited QTL were        detected in two mapping populations that is the BXD        recombinant inbred strains and a BD F intercross                              Results        A flow chart showing the steps involved in the         in silico comparison of the coding        region of genes within the two alcohol withdrawal QTLs is        shown in Figure  The National Center for Biotechnology        Information NCBIMouse Genome Database MGD humanmouse        homology map and the Celera mouse genome assembly were        searched to obtain a list of genes and predicted genes        within each QTL The selected genes included plausible        candidate genes that have been implicated in functions        relevant to alcohol action as well as genes whose        functions are not well understood or were not previously        suspected to be related to alcohol action For the QTL on        chromosome  a list of  genes was selected most of        which are within  million bases Mb upstream or  Mb        downstream of the peak log of odds LOD score        approximately  centimorgans cM from the        centromere For chromosome  a list of  genes was        selected most of which are within  Mb upstream or  Mb        downstream of the peak LOD score approximately  cM from        the centromere The complete coding region of each gene        as available was retrieved either from Celera or NCBI to        be used as the query for subsequent strainspecific BLAST        searches   B sequences were retrieved from the        mmtrace database at NCBI using a MegaBLAST search and D        sequences were retrieved from Celera by BLAST search of the        All Mouse Fragments masked database All data were        retrieved from Celera and NCBI between August  and        April  Two inhouse programs were used to parse the        BLAST results and remove any hits with low        nucleotidesimilarity scores or an insignificant evalue        The filtered BLAST results from the B and D strains were        then aligned using AutoAssembler and allelic sequence        variations were detected        On proximal chromosome   genes covering         basepairs bp were selected and the sequences aligned        and for chromosome   genes covering  bp were        selected and aligned Altogether the alignment encompassed         genes spanning  bp Because of some gaps that        remain in the available genome sequences for the B and D        strains complete coding regions were sometimes not        available and in such cases the coverage was therefore        incomplete Our calculations indicate that the         in silico coverage of the coding        region of the  genes for the B and D strains was         and  respectively The lower percent coverage of the D        genome is likely to be due to the fact that it is only one        out of four mouse strains used to generate Celeras x        coverage of the mouse genome When the B and D data are        combined  of the length of the coding regions was        covered by both genome sequences Table         Previous efforts to identify human SNPs by database        mining found it important to filter results in order to        eliminate the false detection of SNPs   With this in        mind we took the following steps to ensure the quality of        SNPs detected in our data First to avoid the inclusion of        sequences from additional closely related paralogous genes        we used a BLAST hit cutoff of  so that only reads at        least  similar to the query sequence were selected        Furthermore reads that potentially affected amino acid        sequence were used for a BLAST search against the mouse        genome and removed from the BD alignment if the best        BLAST hit was on a sequence scaffold located in another        part of the genome Second to avoid the inclusion of        changes due to poorquality sequence Phred   scores of        individual B reads were checked at changed nucleotide        positions and poorquality changes Phred score          eliminated This step was not done with D sequences        because individual sequence traces and Phred scores were        not available from Celera Third by inhouse sequencing of         gene coding variations found in the         in silico alignments of three genes        from B D AJ XSvJ and SSvImJ DNA we        verified that Celera had not mislabeled the strain from        which sequence reads were derived and showed that no mixup        or crosscontamination of samples had occurred Even after        the above steps were taken there were still instances        where some reads had one sequence and other reads had a        slightly different sequence for the same strain Inhouse        sequencing of B and D DNA for a subset of interstrain        frame shifts  of the total showed that all the        apparent differences were false Inhouse sequencing for a        subset of intrastrain single basepair substitutions         of the total was also carried out This analysis showed        that when two different intrastrain sequences for example        in the D strain were detected the correct sequence was        always identical to the other strain for example B so        that no interstrain variant appeared at that position On        the basis of this inhouse sequence analysis we chose to        operationally classify all frameshifts as false and        interstrain substitutions present in  or fewer than         of the reads for one strain as false        The number of nonsynonymous changes was totaled from all         genes within the chronic alcohol withdrawal QTLs on        proximal chromosome  and midchromosome  for which        allelic sequences were aligned together covering  cM and         Mb of the mouse genome and representing  bp of        coding region In total  of the  genes surveyed from        the chromosome  and  QTL regions showed nonsynonymous        changes in their coding regions between B and D animals        Table  A search of Celeras SNP database found        approximately half of the nonsynonymous BD sequence        changes which we identified by multiple alignment of BLAST        hits Of the nonsynonymous changes that we identified by        multiple alignment of BLAST hits and verified by inhouse        sequencing fewer than half are listed in the SNP        database        On chromosome  where  genes were compared eight        aminoacid changes were identified in six genes Table         Of these two are known genes and four are based only on        computational predictions by Celera One of the two known        genes for which allelic variation was identified within its        coding region sequence was         Slca  This encodes a highaffinity        choline transporter expressed in the brain and spinal cord        and may be considered a plausible candidate gene for        underlying the QTL see Discussion        On chromosome  when looking only at changes that have        multiple read coverage or were verified by inhouse        sequencing  aminoacid changes were detected within         genes Table  Nine additional changes in four other        genes within the chromosome  QTL were also identified        but these were all of limited reliability in that only a        single sequence read was available for either the B or D        allele Of the         in silico predicted changes based on        singleread coverage that were sequenced in house        approximately half were proven false The proteins showing        allelic differences with multiple read coverage span a        range of functional classes and include a zinc        metalloprotease S ribosomal protein hyaluronic acid        binding protein gene         Habp  developmental related        protein gene         Ptch  transport system kinase and        several genes for which no functional assignments have yet        been made As discussed below three genes for which        allelic variations were detected         Srda Nrif  and         Hsdb are thought to be        particularly promising biological candidates to underlie        the chromosome  QTL                    Discussion        While other studies have mined EST databases to detect        SNPs   the work presented here is the first        demonstration of the use of strainspecific genome sequence        databases to discover genecoding variants for murine QTLs        Whereas previous studies have focused on detection of SNPs        in expressed sequence tags ESTs that map to locations        throughout the genome for use as genetic markers the        present work searched strainspecific genomic sequence        databases for codingregion SNPs underlying diseaserelated        QTLs In this first application of the strategy we        surveyed  QTLlocalized genes covering approximately         cM and  Mb of the mouse genome and identified  genes        that had altered coding regions between the B and D        progenitor strains        At least one of the allelically variant genes          Slca  detected within the proximal        chromosome  QTL interval  is a promising biological        candidate gene         Slca encodes a highaffinity        choline transporter expressed in cholinergic neurons in the        brain and spinal cord Prolonged ethanol exposure decreases        highaffinity choline uptake in rat cerebral cortex          and acute ethanol exposure decreases choline transport in        erythrocytes   There was a single aminoacid change of        arginine B to histidine D at position  which is        located in the first cytoplasmic loop of the transporter        with the arginine also being conserved in rat and human        However while synteny data between human and mouse suggest        that the gene is within the QTL data from Celera        apparently places it on another chromosome Therefore the        question of whether         Slca remains a good candidate for        the proximal  QTL must await resolution of this issue        Three genes for which allelic variations were detected                 Srda Nrif and         Hsdb  appear to be particularly        promising biological candidates to underlie the chromosome         QTL The most compelling of these is         Srda  which encodes a steroid        reductase  and is expressed in brain and is        consequently termed a neurosteroid reduced metabolites        of the neurosteroids are thought to be involved in        myelination   and one of the key features of        alcoholism is the loss of cerebral white matter          Steroid reductase is also required for the reduction of        progesterone to dihydroprogesterone which is further        metabolized to progesterone allopregnanolone which        has neuroactivity at GABA         A receptors   Some symptoms of        ethanol withdrawal appear to be produced through        neuroadaptive changes in GABAmediated neurotransmission          It is known that many neuroactive steroids have        anticonvulsant activity   and during ethanol        withdrawal the B and D mice have differential sensitivity        to the anticonvulsant effects of allopregnanolone   We        identified three amino acid changes within this gene        between the B and D strains one of which occurs at        position  with arginine B being replaced by cysteine        D Unlike arginine cysteine can participate in        disulfide bridge formation and thus has the potential to        produce a marked difference in the functional activity of        reductase  in B compared to D animals        Another candidate gene is         Nrif  a Krppeltype zinc finger        protein thought to function as a transcriptional repressor          One of the identified aminoacid changes replaces        the arginine at position  in the D strain with a        glutamine residue in B mice and this occurs within a        known binding site for the intracellular domain of the        neurotrophin receptor PNTR   The         Nrif gene is expressed in brain and        several other tissues but expression is highest in testis        Interestingly the chromosome  QTL is sexlimited and        affects severity of physical dependence on alcohol only in        males   In males the D allele was associated with        more severe withdrawal responses than the B allele        whereas the opposite direction of effect was found in        female mice Because the behavioral trait is sexlimited        this suggests that the actions of the underlying gene are        sexlimited Such a phenotype might be expected if the        causal variant gene was expressed andor active in gonadal        tissue as is the case with         Nrif         A third altered candidate gene within the chromosome         QTL is         Hsdb  This gene encodes a        hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase expressed primarily in        testis but also in several other tissues including brain                  Hsdb catalyzes the interconversion        of androstenedione and testosterone favoring the reduction        reaction   Ethanol exposure has been shown to inhibit        the reduction of androstenedione to testosterone in rat        Leydig cells         in vitro   The amino acid change        within this gene replaces a cysteine B at residue         with an arginine D        While these data are consistent with the variant genes        identified on chromosomes  andor  being the gene that        underlies the respective QTL it is also possible that the        polymorphisms identified in these genes are merely linked        to the polymorphisms that actually underlie these two QTLs        Although         Slca Nrif Srda  and         Hsdb are promising candidates to        underlie these two QTLs a significant number of altered        genes were also identified that cannot formally be ruled        out at this time either in place of or in addition to        these three genes Additional fine mapping of these QTLs is        needed to eliminate as many false candidate genes as        possible from these QTL intervals In addition definitive        confirmation that         Slca Nrif Srda and         Hsdb or other promising candidate        genes if they arise are involved in predisposition to        physical dependence on ethanol will probably require        verification using transgenics for example allele        substitution or bacterial artificial chromosome        transgenics        Another feature of the approach described here is that        it not only rapidly identifies gene variants within QTL        intervals but because it will find many genes that are        unchanged between strains can also quickly eliminate large        numbers of genecoding regions as possible candidates        underlying the QTL Finally it should be pointed out that        even when a synonymous sequence difference is found between        QTL strains it can still be used as a new easily scored        marker to further narrow the QTL interval using        finemapping resources such as intervalspecific congenic        recombinant mice   In this regard we identified many        such synonymous changes between B and D that fall within        the proximal chromosome  or midchromosome  QTLs and        therefore can serve as new informative markers for fine        mapping of these QTLs        The approach described here has considerable general        applicability Many other murine QTLs encompassing a wide        range of complex phenotypes of interest have been        identified using mapping populations derived from two of        the five mouse strains for which wholegenome draft        sequences are now available and therefore lend themselves        to this         in silico approach When we carried        out a PubMed literature database search  QTLs        corresponding to  different phenotypes were identified        that utilized two of these five mouse strains Table         The QTL intervals that were used in the present study were        rather large and many other QTLs that use strains amenable        to an         in silico approach are considerably        smaller        While the present study focused on QTL genecoding        region comparisons because of their potential functional        importance   it should be pointed out that        generegulatory regions which are also of considerable        functional importance and have been shown to underlie some        QTLs    can be studied in the same way For        example the approach described here can be combined with        data from highdensity DNA microarray studies of the B and        D strains JMS unpublished work In such a scenario        interstrain comparison of the expression levels of tens of        thousands of genes would be carried out the genes that are        differentially expressed between strains identified and        their chromosome location determined from the genome        databases Those differentially expressed genes that map to        a QTL region would be selected and the upstream regulatory        regions aligned         in silico to search for sequence        differences that affect predicted transcriptional binding        sites Such bindingsite differences when present would        be promising candidates to underlie the QTL in which the        gene resides Although less is known about sequences        affecting gene regulation than about those affecting        protein sequence there has been considerable progress in        the past few years in our understanding of the sequences        involved in controlling gene regulation           It is also possible that sequence changes in the        noncoding regions of mRNAs can have functional effects For        example sequence in the  untranslated region UTR can        affect mRNA translation and sequence in the  UTR can        affect mRNA stability The  UTR region can also contain        enhancer elements that affect gene regulation and        expression Whereas less is known about the functional        relevance of sequence changes in noncoding parts of mRNAs        than those in the proteincoding region they can        nevertheless be functionally important and as such could        be included in surveys using the         in silico approach described        here        While Celeras SNP database has the ability to quickly        identify interstrain SNPs in QTL genes the information        available from the SNP database is not as complete as the        data generated by our         in silico approach Specifically        Celera uses a different strategy for assigning SNPs in the        mouse genome and the SNP database makes very conservative        SNP predictions fewer than half of the SNPs we identified         in silico and verified by inhouse        sequencing are in the SNP database The SNP database also        misclassifies some SNPs as missense mutations when the SNPs        are actually in the  or  UTR JMS unpublished        data And finally the Celera SNP database does not        indicate which regions of a genes coding sequence are        covered by reads in each strain and therefore does not        distinguish between completely sequenced regions in which        no variants have been detected and regions where no        variants are found because sequence coverage for one of the        strains is absent Such a limitation provides an incomplete        picture of the interstrain variants that exist in a given        QTL which in turn could result in passing over the        critical SNP underlying the QTL        Although the strategy presented here provides a        significant new tool in going from QTL to gene a number of        challenges still remain on the way to realizing this goal        For example functional confirmation that an interstrain        gene alteration underlies a QTL while feasible is not        trivial As more QTLlocalized genes are identified that        have potentially important sequence changes as described        here for example it becomes more difficult to test them        all functionally A related ongoing development that should        help this situation by reducing the number of potential        candidate genes that remain within the QTL interval is        reduction of the interval by fine mapping using specialized        congenic strains or recombinant progeny testing           A number of intervalspecific congenic strains have        recently been developed for a number of QTLs and although        straightforward fine mapping is still a largescale        enterprise because of the need to generate and test large        numbers of animals to identify and behaviorally assess        informative recombinants and because of the need for        markers to detect such recombination events        While such challenges remain the new genomics tools and        resources that are now available or are becoming available        are clearly providing a major impetus to this field The        power of highdensity microarray studies to identify        QTLrelated genes and pathways draft genomic sequences for        the primary mouse strains used for QTL analysis and        evolving bioinformatics tools and databases are all making        major impacts on this field with more improvements to be        expected For example after this work was completed we        used the         in silico approach on a QTL        identified using B and AJ strains and found that coverage        was considerably higher than reported in this study We        found that in an analysis of over  QTL genes the         in silico coverage for B and AJ was         and  respectively with a total coverage for both        of  JMS unpublished data Finally the anticipated        completion of the B genome sequence and deeper sequence        coverage of the D and AJ genomes in particular if        carried out would remove the last remaining obstacles to        virtually complete         in silico discovery of gene variants        for the several hundred QTLs identified using these        strains                    Materials and methods                  Identification of genes within QTL regions          A list of known genes within the  LOD confidence          interval for each QTL was found using the NCBI vs MGD          humanmouse homology maps at NCBI   This list was          screened for candidate genes on the basis of gene          expression within the brain and functional relevance to          the QTL phenotype GenBank accession numbers for the          complete coding region sequence of each candidate gene          were found on LocusLink Coding region sequences were          retrieved from GenBank and used as the query for BLAST          searches          A more complete list of genes and gene predictions          within the QTL was found on the Celera Discovery System            The genetic marker with the highest LOD score for a          QTL was localized on Celeras physical map and a list of          genes and predicted genes within an interval on either          side of this marker was generated and screened for          candidate genes Coding region sequences of the selected          genes were retrieved either from Celera or NCBI and used          as the query for BLAST searches                          BLAST searches          A MegaBLAST search of the mmtrace database on NCBI            was used to retrieve B sequences from the public          database Low complexity was filtered percent identity          was set to  and the number of alignments to return          was set to  Results were saved as a text file A          BLASTN search of the All Mouse Fragments masked          database on Celera   was used to search for D          sequences The evalue was set to  and the number of          hits to return was set to  The complete entries view          of the results was exported to a file which was given a          txt extension                          JAVA scripts to process BLAST results          A script named Mouse Gene Selection NCBI MGSNCBI          was written in JAVA and used to parse BLAST results from          NCBI This script filters the BLAST results and only          selects hits which have percent identity greater than or          equal to  and evalue which is a measure of the          statistical significance of BLAST hits less than or          equal to  The evalue is the number of hits with          the same degree of similarity one would expect to find by          chance if there were no true matches in the database          Another script Mouse Gene Selection Celera MGSCelera          was written in JAVA and used to parse BLAST results from          Celera This script filters the BLAST results and only          selects hits with strain name DBAJ evalue less than          or equal to  and percent identity greater than or          equal to  After filtering the BLAST results the          script saves each alignment as an individual text file          When one hit aligns with more than one region of the          query sequence the entire hit is discarded if any of the          alignments does not meet the above criteria As both          scripts are written in JAVA they can be run on Unix          Macintosh or PC platforms                          Alignment of filtered BLAST results          Filtered BLAST results were aligned using          AutoAssembler  For each gene one alignment file was          made of the filtered B BLAST results and a separate          alignment file was made of the filtered D BLAST results          The B alignment file was then compared to the D          alignment file to identify sequence changes When          sequence variations were found within a strain they were          regarded as true only if more than half the reads for a          strain contained the change This criterion was checked          for validity by inhouse sequencing                          Inhouse sequencing          Inhouse sequencing was used to test           in silico sequence predictions and          also occasionally to fill in gaps that remained in          certain genes CBLJ and DBAJ mice were obtained          from the Jackson Laboratory Animals were euthanized and          the brains dissected Wholebrain RNA was isolated using          an RNeasy Maxi Kit Qiagen cDNA was synthesized by          RTPCR using SUPERSCRIPT First Strand Synthesis System          for RTPCR Invitrogen CBLJ DBAJ AJ          XSvJ and SSvImJ genomic DNAs were obtained          from the Jackson Laboratory Primer software   was          used to design primers to amplify either cDNA or genomic          DNA Template DNA was amplified by PCR in the Perkin          Elmer GeneAmp PCR system  A typical reaction cycle          was denaturation for  min at C followed by  cycles          of denaturation for  s at C annealing for  min           s at C and extension for  min  s at C with a          final extension step at C for  min Products were          run on a  agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide          and purified using QIAquick Gel Extraction kits Qiagen          PCR products were reamplified when necessary          PCR products were sequenced using ABI Big Dye          Terminator v chemistry and cycle sequencing and          sequence traces read on an ABI PRISM  Gene Analyzer          When inhouse sequencing was done to fill gaps from the           in silico alignment a minimum of          one forward read and one reverse read was run for each          sample of PCR products Whenin house sequencing was done          to verify nonsynonymous changes found in the           in silico alignment a minimum of          two forward reads and two reverse reads was run for each          sample of PCR products Sequencing data for each strain          were analyzed with the Consed software suite            Sequencing was repeated for regions of poor quality that          is Phred score   Highquality sequence was          exported and B sequence was compared to D sequence          using AutoAssembler to identify changes between the two          strains
