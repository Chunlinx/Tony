                    Background        Mutations in         MYOC have been shown to be causative        for primary open angle glaucoma POAG              Glucocorticoids have been implicated in ocular hypertension        and glaucoma due to increased plasma cortisol levels            and altered cortisol metabolism     in POAG patients        and from the increased risk of developing POAG in        steroidresponsive patients      Myocilin has been        shown to be upregulated in glucocorticoidtreated human        trabecular meshwork TM cells      and there is        variable evidence for increased         MYOC expression in glaucomatous        individuals       In addition glaucoma patients        have a higher chance of responding to steroids than        nonglaucomatous individuals However an extensive study        of mutations in the proximal promoter and coding region of         MYOC found no sequence polymorphisms        associated with steroid responsiveness            Myocilin has been shown to be secreted both in human TM        cell cultures and in vivo in aqueous humor AH            Glaucomatous mutations however alter myocilin Triton        solubility    and prevent myocilin from being secreted            The glycosylation status of myocilin is somewhat        controversial Several groups have shown that myocilin is        glycosylated          whereas one group        suggests that myocilin is not glycosylated     In our        hands both an Nlinked glycosylated kDa and        unglycosylated kDa form of myocilin is detected in TM        cell culture media    and aqueous humor     The        basis for both secretion and Nlinked glycosylation of        myocilin is part of the focus of this paper        Rabbits have been successfully used as a model of        glucocorticoidinduced ocular hypertension                In order to study the association of         MYOC gene expression with        steroidinduced ocular hypertension it will be helpful to        know the sequence of rabbit myocilin We report here the        cloning sequence comparison and expression analysis of        rabbit         MYOC  We show that an Nterminal        signal peptide is necessary for myocilin secretion and we        identify the Nlinked glycosylation site found in human but        not rabbit myocilin                    Results                  Characterization of Rabbit MYOC          We have cloned a kb cDNA for rabbit           MYOC that encodes a  amino acid          kDa protein with a calculated pI of  Fig           Rabbit myocilin amino acid sequence is  identical to          human myocilin    and highly homologous across          species Table  with an overall  homology Rabbit          myocilin is  amino acids shorter at the Nterminus than          human myocilin and the same length as monkey              mouse      and bovine    myocilin Fig  As          in all myocilin orthologs cloned to date rabbit myocilin          contains a leucine zipper motif aa  to  Fig           A potential peroxisomal targeting signal is encoded on          the Cterminus SKI aa  Unlike human monkey          and mouse myoclin rabbit myocilin does not contain a          consensus Nlinked glycosylation site NXST human aa           monkey aa  mouse aa  Fig  The          nucleotide sequence for rabbit           MYOC reported in this manuscript          has been submitted to GenBank AY                          Secretion of Rabbit MYOC          Rabbit monkey mouse and bovine myocilin open reading          frames begin at amino acid  relative to human myocilin          The function if any of the extra Nterminal  aa          encoded by human myocilin is not presently known Rat          myocilin also contains an extra  aa Nterminal sequence              To determine if rabbit myocilin is secreted          despite the absence of the additional humanlike          Nterminal  aa we examined rabbit aqueous humor We          were able to detect myocilin in rabbit aqueous humor          Fig A This suggests that the human Nterminal  aa          is dispensible for secretion and that the rabbit myocilin          sequence is sufficient to direct secretion          Next we created a human myocilin expression construct          where the Nterminal aa were deleted          pcDNAhMYOCN forcing translation to begin at the          second methionine codon Fig  GTM cells were chosen          for this study based on their ability to grow and          transfect well and are a glaucomatous TM cell line          derived from a yearold female donor               Transfection of GTM cells with the Nterminal deletion          mutant resulted in a distribution pattern similar to          wildtype human myocilin Fig B The fact that we see          no discernable difference in the relative mobility          between transfected human wildtype myocilin and  amino          acid aminoterminal deleted myocilin Fig B and human          vs monkey myocilin in AH Fig A may be due to the use          of small format gels or possibly to the usage of the          second Nterminal methionine by the cell for synthesizing          human myocilin making human and monkey molecular weights          comparable          Nonetheless an Nterminal signal peptide is likely          necessary for directing synthesis of myocilin via the          ERGolgi pathway for secretion outside the cell To          determine what actually constitutes the signal sequence          for myocilin we conducted an analysis of signal peptide          cleavage sites using the Center for Biological Sequence          Analysis SignalP v Database          httpwwwcbsdtudkservicesSignalP A signal peptide          cleavage site was predicted to exist between rabbit aa           and  human aa  and      We directly tested          the importance of the signal peptide in myocilin          secretion by replacing the first  aa of human myocilin          with a single methionine pcDNAhMYOCN          Transfection of GTM cells with pcDNAhMYOCN          resulted in intracellular but not extracellular myocilin          distribution Fig B This is the result expected if          the signal peptide were necessary for secretion This          suggests that the first  aa of rabbit myocilin may          function as a signal peptide and are necessary for          myocilin secretion                          Myocilin Glycosylation          Human myocilin has been shown to migrate as a          kDa doublet by SDSPAGEimmunoblot analysis                  The modification accounting for this          molecular weight difference is hypothesized to be due to          differential glycosylation Nlinked glycosylation sites          were predicted using the Center for Biological Sequence          Analysis NetNGlyc  Prediction Server          httpwwwcbsdtudkservicesNetNGlyc Human monkey          and mouse myocilin contain a consensus asparagine          Nlinked glycosylation site NES near the Nterminus          whereas rabbit rat and bovine code for SES at this          position Fig  Having a serine present at this          position would eliminate Nlinked glycosylation and would          be predicted to result in a difference in relative gel          mobility between humanmonkey and rabbit myocilin          To test this hypothesis we analyzed human monkey and          rabbit AH myocilin sidebyside in SDSPAGEimmunoblots          The antihuman myocilin antibody  used in these          studies generated to human amino acids                crossreacts with rabbit and monkey myocilin With          human and monkey myocilin we see a clear doublet whereas          rabbit myocilin migrates as a single band with the same          relative mobility as the lower band of human and monkey          myocilin Fig A suggesting that the asparagine vs          serine amino acid difference is responsible for the          differential glycosylation          To directly test this theory we mutated human          myocilin amino acid  from Asn to Ser as found in          rabbit myocilin Media and cell lysate from transfected          GTM cells contained a single immunoreactive myocilin          band that migrated with the same relative mobility as the          lower wt myocilin band Fig B This suggests that the          kDa human myocilin doublet is due to differential          glycosylation and that the site of Nlinked glycosylation          on human myocilin is Asn           To determine the effects of deglycosylation on          myocilin we treated human monkey and rabbit AH with a          cocktail of glycosidases N and Olinked Our results          show that the upper band of human and monkey myocilin is          eliminated whereas the lower band remains unaltered Fig          A This indicates that the upper human and monkey          myocilin band is glycosylated In addition the single          rabbit myocilin band shifted downward slightly with          deglycosylation This may be due to removal of Olinked          glycosylation                            Discussion        We report the cloning and characterization of rabbit        myocilin Rabbit myocilin is highly similar to the other        myocilin orthologs Table  and contains a leucine zipper        motif encoded by exon  Fig  This conservation likely        reflects the importance of the leucine zipper motif in        directing proteinprotein interactions      Many        amino acid mutations encoded in the olfactomedin homology        domain of exon  that are known to cause glaucoma in humans        are also conserved in rabbit myocilin In fact all         amino acids  missensenonsense mutations total for        human myocilin documented in the Human Gene Mutation        Database        httpuwcmmlsuwcmacukuwcmmgsearchhtmlto        cause glaucoma are conserved in rabbit myocilin Fig                Myocilin has been shown to be secreted         in vitro and         in vivo by several investigators                    Secreted proteins typically        contain a  aa signal sequence on their Nterminus        which directs the completion of protein synthesis across        the ER membrane A signal peptidase cleaves the signal        sequence and the trimmed protein is shuttled through the        Golgi for secretion We demonstrate the functionality of        the Nterminal signal peptide in directing myocilin        secretion Deletion of the predicted Nterminal signal        peptide results in loss of secretion but not intracellular        appearance Fig B        There are conflicting reports on whether myocilin is        glycosylated Differential glycosylation of myocilin has        been shown in this report and by others      to        account for the appearance of a kDa doublet by        Western immunoblot analysis In contrast Huang et al           report that myocilin is not glycosylated This        discrepancy may be due to technical reasons Huang et al        did not resolve the kDa doublet using their SDSPAGE        system and only detected a kDa human myocilin band so        any deglycosylation PNGase F NANase II and        OGlycosidase occurring would be difficult to resolve A        positive control was not reported in their deglycosylation        experiment so their conclusion that myocilin is not        glycosylated may simply be due to inactive glycosidase The        lack of glycosylation seen in the         in vitro canine pancreatic microsomal        membrane translation experiment may again be due to poor        kDa myocilin doublet resolution or the inability of        this artificial system to faithfully glycosylate myocilin        However Caballero et al was able to detect        deglycosylation affects using similar methodology                   Nguyen et al    identified a kDa band as the        glycosylated and major extracellular form of human myocilin        and not the upper band in the kDa doublet These        authors claim that the lower band of the unglycosylated        kDa doublet is due to cleavage of the Nterminal         amino acid signal peptide In our hands we do not see a        kDa band on our antimyocilin Western blots even using        human aqueous humor as a source of myocilin We provide        evidence that the upper band of the kDa doublet is        the glycosylated form of myocilin Fig A Another group        has also reported the kDa band using an antimyocilin        antibody different from the Nguyen et al antibody            The reason for the appearance of this kDa is unclear        but may be due to crossreaction of the primary or        secondary antibody with another protein such as albumin        which has a molecular weight of kDa GenPept accession         NP To date protein sequence data identifying the        kDa band as myocilin has not been reported        Human myocilin Asn is part of an Nlinked        glycosylation consensus NES and is the only residue on        myocilin predicted to be Nglycosylated We provide both        sitedirected mutagenesis Fig B and deglycosylation        Fig A evidence that the upper band of the kDa        human and monkey myocilin doublet is the glycosylated form        The increase in mobility of rabbit myocilin with        deglycosylation Fig A is likely due to removal of        Olinked glycosylation Analysis of Olinked glycosylation        by the CBS NetOGlyc  Prediction Server        httpwwwcbsdtudkservicesNetOGlycidentified two        unique rabbit Thr and Thr and three common rabbit        Thr Thr and Ser Olinked glycosylation sites in        rabbit vs humanmonkey myocilin The additional Olinked        glycosylation sites in rabbit may be responsible for the        mobility shift seen in the deglycosylation experiment and        the relative diffusiveness of the rabbit myocilin band        A naturally occuring AsnAsp polymorphism may be        associated with JOAG    which if truly        diseaseassociated would suggest the functional importance        of Nlinked glycosylation Nlinked glycosylation is known        to confer stability on many extracellular proteins            Myocilin is similar to fibronectin an extracellular matrix        protein in that both a glycosylated and unglycosylated        form is secreted from the cell The unglycosylated form of        fibronectin is more susceptible to proteolytic degradation        than the glycosylated form     It will be interesting        to determine why two forms of myocilin are secreted in        humans and what functionality if any Nlinked        glycosylation imparts on human vs rabbit myocilin        It is still unknown how myocilin functions normally and        pathophysiologically However recent evidence suggests        that diseasecausing myocilin mutations are gain of        function Diseasecausing myocilin mutants are less soluble        in Triton    and are retained by the cell            Other studies have shown that a truncated form of myocilin        does not get secreted     and that mouse         MYOC knockouts are without        discernable phenotype     Furthermore a human        hemizygous individual containing an interstitial deletion        of chromosome  which encodes         MYOC  was without evidence of        glaucoma    and another patient homozygous for a        severly truncated form of myocilin had no evidence of        glaucoma    or other discernable phenotypes This        suggests that         MYOC haploinsufficiency is not        causative for glaucoma and that myocilin may even be        dispensable or redundant in normal human development or        only important when ocular stress occurs                    Conclusions        Rabbit         MYOC encodes a protein highly similar        to human         MYOC  Rabbit myocilin is secreted        and is detected in rabbit aqueous humor Secretion of        myocilin is dependent on an  amino acid Nterminal signal        peptide Unlike human and monkey AH myocilin rabbit        myocilin does not undergo canonical Nlinked glycosylation        due to the substitution of a serine in the analogous human        Nlinked glycosylation site N Rabbits may provide an        in vivo system for modeling some aspects of glaucoma such        as steroid induced ocular hypertension               and the gainoffunction hypothesis in POAG                        Methods                  Cloning of rabbit MYOC          Total RNA was extracted from
