                okay i dont know which end do we  push but okay   okay well um lets see i i think uh theres a lot of people that dont vote because they dont really think their their uh opinion is going to be heard and you know theres such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the United States and that you know their votes votes not going to make that much difference and whether you vote for one person or the other person the issues is what you know what you believe in and that person is going to have a lot of uh since theres so many issues this one person can believe a lot of different ways on all of them so   right   itd be really difficult to have that one person perfect person that believed exactly what you believed   yeah thats true you know a lot of people uh uh i think the that it ends up the people that uh vote every time uh elections come around are more the the polly uh the party type  followers the guys that uh you know follow the party lines you know and they you know just go in and if theyre Republican they vote Republican vote Republican every year you know and uh the people that are independent   hum yeah   you know are the ones that dont uh dont really uh show up every year because they cant seem to to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate   right yeah thats good   yeah yeah i always thought it was back when Anderson was running i was hoping that things would change and hed actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes but  that didnt work   yeah yeah theres uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the Democrats theyre real liberal now to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um the Democrat party being liberal like they are now you know would never be thought of it would be the other way that the Republicans were real liberal minded as far as like uh moral standings and those kinds of things   umhum   but   yeah yeah thats uh and and then people always get upset about it too because you know every year the the the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote they they each think that uh if more people vote theyll get more votes   umhum   im always amazed at that that each candidate thinks its going to be the people that come out that will vote for him you know   yeah yeah thats thats true i think in uh the Texas governor election i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody this time   yeah well that uh thats something i i know that theres certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a predominately predominately predominately Catholic type area   oh really   and when things start uh when when abortion comes on the issues then people just get all inspirational inspired you know and uh   right   still on the other hand were also uh this particular community is a Catholic community but uh uh down in DC where where things are a little bit different uh   umhum   you know its its womens rights and the and and that sort of movement and so its uh quite the opposite so elections start getting very uh the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones   yeah thats true and uh   but uh   yeah thats true that the different places in America that uh you know different issues would be a lot more important than say in another place   yeah i can understand why why some of the the rural areas the voter turnout isnt as much because it does seem sometimes like the lobbyists in DC are like controlling things for the the Midwest and uh it doesnt matter who they put in office theyre going to fall subject to uh   umhum   the pressure that lobbyists can put   right yeah and its uh   well     real true that uh you you know theyll say one thing to get elected and then once they do get elected they dont have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised you know beforehand   right   you know maybe it just wasnt possible at all in the first place you know like the no new taxes thing you know thats uh with the economy going the way it is and everything that was nearly ridiculous thing to   yeah   even try to do   yeah well i dont think hes going to have to worry about that next year i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected   right   uh   right after the war   uhhuh   that really uh   unfortunately thatll probably even drop lower the voters turn down even more uh turnout even more because more Democrats will think that they dont have a shot so they wont even bother turning out   uh thats true yeah   theyll just say oh well you know the Republicans have this election well see you in four years   right yeah   uh but yeah i hope some of the local well thats what they they keep saying that it seems like people with it with oldfashioned values are the ones that arent turning out at the at the booths they they say that these older voters that uh you know they they feel like the kids are running the the country so they they dont come out turn out to vote and theyre the ones that uh you know really know whats going on have the experience and have seen you know how politicians can you know screw up or whatever   umhum   but i know my grandmother hasnt voted in years   right thats right you know neither has mine as a matter of fact and uh thats true they i think they look at it as well everybody the majority of the people think this way when thats not necessarily true because you know thats what the media says well the majority believes this way so uh they dont even bother turning out to vote to express their uh opinions   umhum   so thats thats true   yeah wonder if theyre going to take into account with this commutiv uh this computerized conversation that theres little children you know bouncing in your knee the whole time your talking     yeah do you hear the dogs in the background here okay theyre   no i cant hear them   the children next door just opened the fence and they went off yeah but anyway thats i guess weve uh talked long enough and that was sort of interesting what part of the country are you from   oh yeah yeah uh Washington DC umhum   are you really wow this is im in from this is Dallas where im at the outskirts of Dallas   oh okay well i figured with Texas Instruments theyd probably have a few uh Texans on the line now and then   yeah do do you work for TI in any way   no huhuh   wow how did you how did they get you or   uh basically they they went through engineering companies and uh were communications i work i work in a com munications company   oh oh okay right i work for TI so we saw it on the uh the TV News one day and i thought wow that might be interesting   yeah   yeah we sort of different   yeah   they called me at uh ten oclock one night that was very strange   well yeah   i guess they were doing it Eastern Standard Time i was like well i dont know how long it takes whether it takes five minutes or twenty minutes so i   yeah Central Standard Times what theyre doing it by   yeah   yeah i still havent figured out what the zero through six days which day is which yet but       i didnt study it that hard so maybe ill figure it out   umhum   but anyway it was nice to talk to you and uh sort of meet you and that was an interesting topic   okay yeah okay well if youre ever in uh DC can look up Wayne Sherman youll say oh yeah talked to that guy okay     okay im im Kyle Hunt too if you ever come to to Dallas area well we live right by the airport   oh okay yeah yeah yeah so do we   oh okay   yeah right next to Dulles all right well ill talk to you later byebye   yeah okay bye
