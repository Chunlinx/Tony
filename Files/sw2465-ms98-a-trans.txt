        well do you own a PC   no i dont i have one at uh the company i work for furnishes so i can work at home   oh wow   and its just an old old compact that is super slow and but it does it does its job so   what processor does it have in it   um i dont know its so old   oh  what kind of work do you do on it   its one of um i do um television ratings and i process some ratings and put do graphics for their television stations those are their clients so   oh okay yeah   its basically just data entry and running you know some some software so it doesnt really have to be anything sophisticated you know   huh yeah i dont own a PC but ive ive yeah i work for TI and uh they   so yeah my husband does too so   well i have uh pretty fairly a fairly fancy one its a TI model its an S P one thousand which has a it has a fast processor in it a three eighty six   uhhuh   and i the the job that i do i do a lot of training of our customers for new products   uhhuh   and i have to develop uh functional specs and desk and desk top publishing and everything so its     uhhuh yeah   its kind of fun i mean i i i always say that i need to buy a computer for the house but i just havent got around to doing it yet   oh yeah id like to have one for the house too but sometimes my husband my husband says usually i work on the computer all day at work i dont want to come home and have to  work on one too   your husband what what group is your husband in   um something with the defense uh   oh DSEG defense systems and electronics group   yeah something like that yeah theyve changed their name so many times ive lost track so     i see yeah   he works up in Plano   oh okay yeah i work on uh printers and the peripheral products division basically   uhhuh   uh i work in the airline marketing marketing group   oh   so we we do a lot of   i didnt even know they had anything like that   oh yeah   man theres so theyre i learned so many things that they they do theyre into so many different things so       yeah i just kind of in for a while you know he had a he had uh one of those what are they top secret things you know where he couldnt talk about what he did so   uhhuh yeah   for a while but then he switched jobs i dont understand half the stuff he does and i have uh   is he a programmer   uhhuh software design engineer so as   i see   they call it so but i have a degree in information management   uhhuh   which is computer you know   right   its basically the more the business business end of it than the programming end of it you know   right   so but ive been at it for you know five years so everythings changed so much i probably couldnt even  get a job right now it seems like its changed so much so you know theyve made such advances in computers so   really so uh does your husband ever use uh a laptop or a notebook does he bring a little one home with him or   no huhuh sometimes he brings he brought home a uh a portable one   uhhuh   but uh it it quit working so he brought it brought it back and he just hasnt brought another one home but they did give him a new computer at work so   oh i see yeah we we build uh laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also   oh uhhuh   and those are really handy i mean we they they have modems in them you can send a fax from your PC   oh how nice no he doesnt have one of those so   but theyre theyre really whats that   he doesnt have one of those   yeah theyre theyre pretty handy because you know when i travel its easy to check messages just you know   uhhuh   plug in the phone to your computer and dial in and   yeah well my husband doesnt have to travel so   oh okay yeah i just found out im going to Denver Sunday night again   oh boy   so that kind of reeks havoc with plans   well at least you get to     but it its really not enough to become a big hassle   uhhuh       well thats good some people enjoy the travel but i dont think id like it if he traveled a lot so   i see   yeah i would love to have a computer they but theyre so expensive   well i dont know there you can get well depends on what you consider expensive i mean you can get real high powered stuff now   uhhuh   for under two thousand dollars where you know just a few years ago it would have been six seven eight nine thousand dollars   yeah yeah guess its not its all you know its inexpensive compared to what it used to be but its a lot to put into one   yeah its still i mean you know two thousand dollars isnt just just pocket change to a lot of people   thats right no its not  its its not pocket change so its major so but maybe when the kids get in school that will be you know when they start needing something you know then that will be different but   yeah when i started at uh TI i was a summer development student   uhhuh   and finishing up at school and so those papers really i mean it was nice having access to the   oh yeah   equipment to uh   yes i remember that i had to do some of my husbands papers because i had access to one but you know he his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing you know so   yeah   i did a lot of his papers yeah they come in real handy that was a lifesaver   well how many different types of packages do you use   at home   uhhuh   um all i the packages i i dont really use them i pictures is what i use thats the only um outside development that we use most of its just stuff thats been written in house that i use   oh okay yeah golly ive got up up at work anyway i use uh WordPerfect and Lotus and   yeah i know those two i worked   GemDraw which is a uh uh a a line draw package   uhhuh ive just used WordPerfect and Lotus   yeah you probably use D base or something like that for your uh data entry stuff that your talking about   um the most yeah yeah a lot of the data entr y stuff they used uh survey system and and um you know just inhouse programs to do what they needed i work   do you get to do you work at home all the time or just   well no i worked for this company before i had my first daughter   uhhuh   and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things so   oh that that was that worked out pretty good then   yeah it did you know i dont do i dont really dont do basic a lot of what i used to do i just do you know something really minor but   uhhuh   its something that nobody else wants to do   yeah   and its time consuming so   so it keeps you in the company huh   thats right you know it gives me a paycheck you know its only like the works only you know three weeks goes for like three to four weeks three times a year   uhhuh   you know its not something thats continual because you know the television ratings dont come out you know all the time they only come out four times a year so   yeah   but   boy i tell you if i could bring a computer home and do stuff here id get all kinds of stuff done phones always ringing and   oh uhhuh   people always asking me to do something else   yeah   ive got a lot of especially right now weve got several new products coming out and ive got lots of documentation i need to review and some i need to revise   uhhuh will they let you take a computer home to work   well yeah but you know i need to be at the office too you know  ive just got to deal with all those other things that happen but   oh uhhuh   a PC at the house would really take a lot of the load off   yeah yeah i bet yeah my husband he took one home when they when they had it you know they had a big deadline coming up and it was looking a little touchy to meet so   uhhuh well ive ive done that before on a couple times but that would make it just that much easier instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home a few floppy disks you know   yeah uhhuh thats right i thought that would be you know because its real nice with this because i dont even have to go into the office ive maybe been into the office once in the past three years you know   oh my   they just um they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever so you know   man that sounds really nice   yeah it is real nice you know i just deal with them on the telephone half the people dont even know who theyre talking to   uhhuh   but i you know worked i know most of them well i cant say that a lot of people changed around there but most people know who i am but i dont know who they are you know   uhhuh   a lot of them just know me by name and phone voice   right yeah ive got a lot of folks that ive worked with like that as well   yeah you just know them by the telephone so but well its been good talking to you i think weve just got the subject   yeah we sort of stayed to the topic anyway   yeah we tried its hard to sometimes okay well thanks bye bye   okay well well talk to you later bye
