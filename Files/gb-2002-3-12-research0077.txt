                    Background        Wholegenome analyses have allowed the study of gene        families both within species and in different species        Computational and experimental studies of genomes and gene        families are providing new perspectives on our        understanding of the evolution of specificity and cellular        metabolic organization These efforts remain limited        however by our ability to annotate gene function        accurately In yeast the number of open reading frames        ORFs with functions assigned by sequencesimilaritybased        methods is around    With the inclusion of extensive        experimental data this value is approaching           Meanwhile a search of the Protein Data Bank PDB for the        keyword unknown function retrieved  protein structures        Many of these are the result of structural genomics        initiatives As this number is likely to grow it has        become more important to develop computational tools to        deduce function from analysis of sequence information in        the context of structure        Assigning function by sequence homology alone is subject        to a number of caveats including the occurrence of        structurally homologous enzymes that catalyze different        reactions   and the propagation of error through        successive rounds of sequence annotation   Conversely        assigning function by structure alone can also be daunting        even if one ignores the implicit selection bias in        structure databases relative to sequence databases        Analysis of the CATH database revealed that whereas        function was conserved in nearly  of enzyme families        function had diverged considerably in highly populated        families   This has direct implications for        structurebased function predictions using threading        algorithms    Another serious complication in        structurebased deduction of function is the intrinsic        limit on our ability to compare distantly related sequences        and to recognize the role of specific residue subsets in        multifunctional proteins It can be difficult to recognize        whether a distantly related homolog belongs to a        superfamily with one functional site in common   or        whether that particular structural scaffold accommodates        multiple functional sites as with the G proteins          It follows that similarityfree functionprediction        methods are especially desirable Marcotte         et al    used correlated        evolution correlated mRNA profiles and patterns of domain        fusion for genomewide function prediction A method based        on local gene order of orthologous genes has been proposed          Proteinprotein interactions have been used to        assign function with surprising success   and        functional descriptors have been used to search structure        space   However the individual functionprediction        capabilities of current methods remain limited judging by        the gene annotation content of public databases        ET presumes that the branchpoints separating subclades        of a phylogenetic tree can specify molecular speciation        events and hence evolutionary selection of amino acids        Thus nodes can mark points in evolution where a protein        gains modifies or loses a binding or catalytic function          The original ET method relies on a partitioning of the        phylogeny This procedure results in sets of nodes at        different levels of percent sequence identity cutoff        PIC   However as phylogenies often contain extreme        branches as a result of distant homologs or rapid        speciation pairs of protein family members are not        represented uniformly across the sequenceidentity range        This is reflected in a skewed topology of the phylogeny        see for example the         Pseudomonas aeruginosa and         Streptococcus pyogenes hypothetical        proteins at the bottom of Figure  Hence the PICs        correspond to intervals of percent sequence identity and        the greater the number andor magnitude of outliers in the        family the larger the percent identity interval see        Figure  The presence of these outliers affects multiple        alignment and phylogenetic models and in ET analysis can        misrepresent the functional variability at the presumed PIC        level This issue has been addressed by normalizing the        score in the ET method with sequence variability and        sequence uniqueness measures   However numerical        normalization reduces the problem to numerical analysis in        effect disregarding evolutionary aspects In the case of        distant subclades ET analysis of appropriately chosen        subclades of the phylogeny will have the desired        normalization effect This approach can be used to correct        for positional variability sequence representation bias        and nonuniform phylogenetic topologies        Another limitation of the original ET method was the        definition of invariant and neutral position types        Uchtarge         et al    recognized that with        growing sequence databases the strict definitions of        invariance as a total lack of variance and neutrality as a        oneresidue variation in an aligned position in even one        family were destined to require amendment Inherently the        functional resolution in the ET method relies on an        optimization based on ET results from multiple partitions        each corresponding to unique definitions of subclade        invariance Although two automated ET methods exist        notably a public ET server by Innis         et al    and an implementation        by Aloy         et al    optimization of the        original ET method has evaded automation thus far The        result is that users have to resort to manipulation of the        underlying data and cycles of ET analysis and visual        inspection of the results mapped to protein structures        Aside from manually filtering and pruning the data        there has been no simple way of controlling which subclades        of the protein family are used in the analysis An elegant        solution to this problem is to allow the user to access all        possible subclades represented by the phylogenetic tree In        this way a number of ET variations can be performed        extending the analysis to multiple views of protein family        evolutionary data        JEvTrace is one possible implementation of protein        family analysis Such analyses which include experimental        techniques such as alanine scanning   and computational        techniques such as MSA coloring schemes   attempt to        organize the massive amounts of sequence and structure        data The results introduce the problem of choice of        strategies to identify biologically meaningful patterns In        general sequence and structure alignments are frequently        used to sort features of genefamily data Analysis of        alignments provides coherence to the understanding of        biological data especially from the perspective of        distinct features that may explain the unique functional        attributes of an individual entry As is common in ET        analysis these features may extend over sequentially or        spatially clustered sets of nucleotides or amino acids and        patterns are frequently difficult to identify without a        form of color coding Obviously color coding exploits our        cognitive patternrecognition skills  skills that have        been difficult to replicate algorithmically                    Results        An example of a protein with unknown function is PDB        GR representing the         ylxR gene from         Streptococcus pneumoniae           YlxR belongs to the putative         nusAinfB operon in         S pneumoniae  The operon contains        seven genes three of which are conserved in other        bacteria         rbfA nusA with its well        characterized gene product IF   and         infB  These three proteins are        involved in translation and ribosomal function during        coldshock response   The YlxR protein sequence has        been assigned to the cluster of orthologous groups COG           which contains the conserved aminoacid motif        GRGAYW in the singleletter aminoacid code The        proteins of COG  are predicted to be nucleotidebinding        proteins implicated in transcription termination Several        features of the structure of YlxR including the conserved        and appropriately spaced arginines that could form a        characteristic positively charged surface patch colored        red in Figure bc and a large bent groove reminiscent of        other RNAbinding structures support the argument that        YlxR is an RNAbinding protein        Structures of proteins in complexes with small molecules        have led to and confirmed predictions of protein function        The structure of YlxR is complexed with three sulfate ions        two of which are bound to the arginines R and R and        the third to a lysine pair K and K It has been        observed that the distances between the sulfate ions        correspond to distances between phosphate groups in an RNA        duplex   The predicted binding site also fully        encompasses two out of three of the sulfate ions and        borders the third        The protein family retrieved by PSIBLAST   consists        of  unique The hypothetical ancestor sequence has three        conserved arginines Although this is a relatively small        family for ET analysis a simple MSA suggests that only the        arginine of the conserved GRGAYW motif is absolutely        conserved However as the key arginines associated with        the predicted function are absolutely conserved this        implies that the predicted RNAbinding function is        conserved across this family        JEvTrace subclade trace analysis was performed on all        the subclades of this family ranging from  to         sequence identity Figure a After filtering out residues        that are inaccessible to the solvent the following        residues were identified in the vicinity of the conserved        arginines the conserved arginines are in parentheses        K V V S K r G R G R Y        R R and K and E R At least eight residues        form a spatial cluster in the vicinity of the conserved        arginines The residues K the backbone of S V V        S V G E K and V from the kinked        carboxyterminal helix a betaturn and parts of the        betasheet define a putative binding epitope Figure b        The epitope includes a collection of hydrophobic        interactions that have been correlated with the evolution        of residues forming a surface epitope in the vicinity of r        Figure b        There appear to be two distinct subclades within the        YlxR sequence family both consisting of proteins with        unknown or uncertain function S          and S           Figure a A subclade comparison        was carried out to analyze the conserved residues Such a        comparison is useful when a protein family has few        representatives or limited evolutionary diversity that is        few subclades In this family it appears that independent        sets of residues are conserved all in the vicinity of one        or more of the conserved arginines These amino acids        define a slightly larger and differently oriented surface        epitope Figure c than in the JEvTrace subclade trace        analysis Figure b We propose that the conserved        residues modulate the specificity of the predicted RNA        interaction and that the two subclades correspond to        specificity subtypes within the larger family possibly        with unique functional features The residues not        identified by subclade trace analysis but appearing in the        subclade comparison are responsible for a finer level of        molecular specificity In this case of a predicted protein        function JEvTrace analysis presented direct evidence for        additional binding functions and highlighted the presence        of potential subtypes in the RNAbinding specificity        Another interesting family of unknown function is the        bacterial YbaK proteins A structure of the homolog from         H influenzae has been solved by        Zhang         et al    This gene product has        been proposed to serve as a regulatory protein           Analysis of the sequence family in the context of the        structure revealed one conserved residue K in a small        putative binding site   The YbaK fold is related to a        circular permutation and truncation of the Clectin fold        However a saccharide binding function for YbaK is        unlikely because of a small putative binding site and lack        of saccharide binding residues   Zhang         et al  discuss the possibility of an        oxyanion hole formed by backbone nitrogens of the two        residues following conserved G with the exception of an        arginine in an unknown protein from         Mycobacterium        smegmatis AAD        The YbaK family is composed of three large subclades        related by an absolutely conserved lysine K The three        subclades are YbaK S          in Figure a an insertion domain in        the acceptor stem of prokaryotic prolyltRNA synthetases S                 in Figure a and a prokaryotic family        of hypothetical proteins S          in Figure a Seventyone sequences        were used in the JEvTrace analysis Of these  formed a        distinct subclade containing the         H influenzae YbaK sequence        JEvTrace parent trace analysis which relies on tracing        the conservation of the progenitor sequences of a single        selected node Figure a identified a number of neutral        polar and hydrophobic amino acids conserved in the YbaK        subclade on the conserved lysine face of YbaK Figure a        top This was consistent with the analysis of Zhang         et al    Among these conserved        positions JEvTrace identified a cluster of        solventaccessible residues above and beyond the proposed        oxyanion hole including Y H D E and R        Together these residues form a polar surface patch and the        wall of the putative binding site D and E contribute        to the negative face identified by Zhang         et al         The phylogenetic partition JEvTrace algorithm was        carried out using six partitions from the  average        percent sequence identity range Figure b The resulting        highestscoring position is S magenta and then T        T Y G I and S orange Most of these        positions are partially shielded from solvent andor        contribute mainchain hydrogenbonding interactions        Eliminating solventaccessible residues left S a        position that belongs to the neutral polar patch of the        putative binding site Considering residues with less        prominent scores gray blue cyan yellow the size of        the epitope identified by JEvTrace increases considerably        and encompasses nearly half of the K face Figure b        top Together these positions form a partially buried        cluster that defines the bottom and walls of the putative        ligandbinding site spanning the K face From the fifth        level on Figure  all identified positions are on the        conserved lysine face of YbaK Significantly the loop        immediately above the oxyanion hole is disordered in the        YbaK PDB DBX structure This loop formed by residues         is not conserved nor does it conserve chemical        properties across the phylogeny However a number of        subclades express invariance at these positions Because of        its proximity to the conserved G and one branch of the        Jshaped putative binding site this disordered region is        predicted to contribute to the functional interaction and        specificity of YbaK A number of structural studies by NMR        have shown that RNAbinding proteins are flexible and        undergo conformational changes upon binding                   Using GRASP   Zhang         et al    predicted a positively        charged patch on the face of the protein opposite K and        a negatively charged patch on a face adjacent to K        However the YbaK structure has the interesting feature of        a single conserved lysine separated by a ring of        hydrophobic or neutral residues from a circular arrangement        of mixed charged residues Asp Arg Glu Lys These        residues line the perimeter of the K face This is        reminiscent of numerous examples of proteinprotein        interaction where hydrophobic rings of residues are        observed to surround polar and charged residues with the        proposed purpose of screening ionic interactions from        solvent    This potential proteinprotein        interaction feature of YbaK is additionally supported by        evidence that the prolyltRNA synthetases S          in Figure a interact with other        proteins involved in protein synthesis There may be        additional surface patches of mixed positively and        negatively charged residues in YbaK However the        positively charged surface identified by Zhang         et al  contains the largest number        of high scoring positions in the JEvTrace analysis of        multiple phylogenetic partitions Figure b The lysine        perimeter patch Figure ab top and other potential        patches are not conserved nor are they identified        completely by the partition algorithm Figure ab side        and thus are not expected to be a predominant functional        feature of the YbaK family        JEvTrace analysis suggests that YbaK is involved in a        proteinprotein interaction requiring a binding site with        hydrophobic and polar patches and an oxyanion hole        opposite a conserved lysine Pursuing the proteinprotein        interaction hypothesis it appears that a protruding        Jshaped polypeptide volume involving an aspartic or        glutamic acid or a negatively charged cofactor is a        likely ligand for the YbaKbinding site The face opposite        this binding site presents a patch of positively charged        residues supporting the hypothesis of a nucleotide binding        function for at least some subclades of the YbaK family        Thus although the YbaK family subtypes only share one        conserved aminoacid across species the patterns of        subclade sequence conservation suggest a main binding        function characterized by unique specificity within        multiple clades that is spatially centered around the        conserved lysine K                    Discussion                  JEvTrace          The ET method has been a successful tool for analyzing          protein functional surfaces using the additional          information present in protein phylogenetic trees          However this approach has been limited by difficulty in          producing a dynamic graphical user interface to analyze          the data The optimization involved in producing ET          results has previously relied on manually manipulating          the underlying data while certain paths of analysis were          inherently inaccessible Thus identification of the          dominant spatial cluster of invariant residues has been          unwieldy To improve this operational challenge we have          constructed JEvTrace a JAVA suite of algorithms and          objects together with a graphical user interface The          algorithms allow the user to identify evolutionarily          relevant positions based on user selections of subclades          Figure ab or partitions of the phylogeny Figure          b This approach introduces new features and parameters          in ET analysis Additional algorithms for tracing          subclade conservation through parents or children of a          specific subclade Figure a and subclade conservation          comparisons Figure ac are also implemented The user          interface produces interactive graphical results and          access to the corresponding sequence phylogenetic and          protein structure data To map ET results and alignment          selections to the structural dimension JEvTrace is          dynamically linked to a Dstructure JAVA viewer WebMol                     These algorithms see Materials and methods allow          comparisons of features within a phylogeny in ways that          are not directly limited by the topology of the          phylogeny sequence representation bias or sequence          distance metrics The implementation allows an analysis          of any possible combination of subclades within the          protein phylogeny The resulting decompositions of          evolutionary sequence data allow multiple definitions of          sequence structure and function homology within a          protein family and hence grant new perspectives to          family sequence analysis          The original ET method relies on protein structures to          filter phylogenetic results in order to identify          predicted functional sites A recognized limitation of          the original method was filtering out buried polar side          chains within structural clefts   JEvTrace gives          access to the entire set of results before residue          solventaccessibility filtering Extensive structural          filtering not limited to solvent accessibility can be          carried out in WebMol            JEvTrace facilitates the analysis of other features of          protein families Conserved positions can be found for          any subclade in the phylogeny and the conservation and          variability between any set of subclades can be analyzed          subclade comparison Figure bc This functionality          can be used to distinguish homologous proteins with          different functions as first suggested by Aloy           et al    For a particular          subclade JEvTrace can perform a parent or child trace          identifying the subclade specific conservation within a          chain of parent or child subclades of a node Figure a          This method can be used as an ET surrogate if there is          lack of significant homology between subclades of a          protein family This was helpful in the analysis of YbaK          JEvTrace can identify the unique residues in a single          sequence relative to the considered sequence data This          was useful for our drugdesign efforts on a malarial          cysteine protease   JEvTrace also serves as a          sequence and structure viewer Any JEvTrace analysis of          the MSA or phylogenetic data can be visualized on          available protein structures This can be useful in          protein structure homology modeling by highlighting the          evolutionary contexts for structural analysis within a          protein family   All these informatics features          address sequence determinants of specificity and          similarity using distinct biological data          In general the ET approach is more difficult to apply          at lower percent sequence identity owing to the problem          of building accurate sequence alignments especially in          the absence of structural information    For          example annotations based on remote homology pairwise          alignments were a significant source of errors in the          initial yeast genome annotation   Known alignment          problems occur at the amino and carboxyl termini of a          protein and even more commonly in loop regions In          addition to an accurate alignment ET also requires a          minimal amount of sequence information and the related          parameter of evolutionary diversity within the protein          family Of the algorithms provided in JEvTrace the          parentchild trace and subclade comparisons can be          applied with as few as two sequences The partition trace          and subclade trace require more than a pair of subclades          and benefit nonlinearly from larger amounts of data          Overall the two largest effects of limited sequence data          are the signaltonoise ratio for the correlation of          invariant sites to functional residues and the ability to          identify functional specificity and specific functions          As a corollary until the sequence space of a protein          family has been sampled sufficiently insight into the          full functions and specificities within a phylogeny          remain limited                          SCF an MSA sequence coloring format          With rapidly enlarging biological data sources there          is a clear need for sensible standards We propose SCF a          file format that will encode any userdefined coloring          scheme for protein and nucleotide sequences as well as          their secondary and tertiary structures based on the          inherent structure of MSAs The format is simple easy to          verify manually and readable as text by any alignment or          structure viewer          An example protein alignment with a selection of          residues including absolutely conserved positions as          well as positions forming two structural epitopes in one          of the known protein structures is shown in Figure  It          is important to note that only selected positions are          encoded  which is both a performance and a storage          asset Our implementation of an alignment viewer allows          transparent interaction with tertiary structures using          the JAVA applet WebMol   In this setting the color          format serves to annotate protein structures with          multiple sequence information and allows comparisons          across multiple sequences and structures This format          should also aid the visualization of experimental results          pertaining to biological sequences and structures Most          important it will allow integration of visualized          sequence alignment results under a single representation          scheme                            Conclusions        We have designed a JAVA application JEvTrace        implementing the ET method   and its variations These        methods have in common the analysis of protein families        through MSAs phylogenetic trees and protein structures        The ET method has proved a useful tool for understanding        the sequential and structural aspects of protein function        including the analysis of variations relevant to molecular        specificity From an evolutionary perspective the function        of proteins within a protein family encompasses both        variation for example substrate specificity reflected in        amino acids lining substratebinding pockets and        conservation for example regions responsible for general        enzymatic activity or binding of a common molecular        scaffold While it is trivial to identify absolutely        conserved residues function discovery often requires a        context for the predicted or unknown function associated        with the absolute conservation pattern        Using the examples of YlxR and YbaK JEvTrace identified        residues clustering around the putative conserved        functional residues thus validating a functional        prediction These findings supported an RNAbinding        prediction for YlxR and most likely a proteinprotein        interaction interface for YbaK For discovery of additional        functional properties as in the case of a new binding        epitope in YlxR or the extensive putative binding site and        positively charged epitope in YbaK JEvTrace provided        phylogenetic evidence of clusters of residues on the        protein surface        It is hoped that the JEvTrace implementation will lead        to analysis of protein families at varying levels of        detail leading to useful decompositions of the data One        of these decompositions comes from evidence in the        evolutionary record of protein sequences As documented by        the biological applications of the ET method evolutionary        data presents evidence allowing the distinction of        conserved spatial arrangements of residues versus        evolutionary sequence changes with negligible or no effect        on function Together with experimental data the        decompositions of evolutionary data provided by JEvTrace        may enable us to make additional distinctions in the        molecular specificity kinetic and dynamic properties of        protein function                    Materials and methods                  Sequence family retrieval and analysis          We chose two protein structures of unknown function          and retrieved their protein families from the sequence          database The sequence of the structure was used as a          query for PSIBLAST   against the GenPept database          from the National Center for Biotechnology Information          NCBI The sequences were then aligned and phylogenetic          trees created with CLUSTALW   andor combinations of          software from the GCG package   including PILEUP              and PAUPSEARCH                            Algorithm          The binary phylogenetic tree and MSA data are          implemented as JAVA objects The phylogenetic tree          assumed to be binary is modeled as branches and nodes          along with an ordering such that each branch shares a          node with a parent branch and from zero to two child          branches Each node in the phylogeny corresponds to a          subset of sequences in the MSA Every phylogenetic branch          is represented with an abstract consensus sequence used          to model the corresponding subclade sequence          conservation The implemented algorithm derives a          consensus sequence for every subclade of sequences          represented in the phylogenetic tree This information is          used to dynamically generate results with the supplied          algorithms based on userdefined subclades or partitions          of subclades          The partition trace variation of the ET method assigns          nodes from the tree to a defined partition of the          phylogeny Partitions are perpendicular to the direction          of branches in the tree Figure  Sequence conservation          in each subclade is compared pairwise to conservation in          all other subclades within a given partition          Alternatively in the subclade trace algorithm requiring          user specification of a set of nodes the defined nodes          are algorithmically treated as a single partition The          subclade trace does not require partitions and is          therefore independent of the topology of the phylogeny          In both algorithms each position of the MSA is scored by          the frequency of conservation of different amino acids in          pairs of subclades at that MSA position In the partition          trace the score is cumulative across partitions All          scores are normalized if there are more than seven pairs          of invariant subclades at any alignment position The          numerical scores are mapped to a sevencolor scale          Figure  limited by graphical interaction with the          structure Scores can include normalization by the          sequence variability of the identified invariant          subclades          JEvTrace also provides the ability to perform a single          subclade trace The userdefined subclade is assigned as          a parent or child node and the subcladespecific          sequence conservation below or above that node is          identified Subcladespecific conservation is defined by          the set of residues that are conserved in a subclade but          not in its parent The results are a chain of related          subclades of the phylogeny with colorcoded subclade          sequence selections on the MSA and structure We call          this variation of the ET method a parent or child          trace and it is especially useful for families with few          subclades and cases of highly speciated specificity          JEvTrace generates results dynamically displays them          on the MSA and enables saving in standard graphics          formats or the SCF format As in the original ET method          absolutely conserved positions are inherently excluded          from the analysis Structural filtering is assigned to          the WebMol JAVA program packaged with JEvTrace          Concurrently with WebMol JEvTrace reads PDB data and          aligns the sequence of the structure with a selected          sequence in the MSA This alignment enables JEvTrace to          map results and selections from the MSA to the structural          dimension JEvTrace also presents the option of using the          ACCESS program   which calculates the static solvent          accessibility of a protein structure   This          solventaccessibility data can be used to filter results          of the phylogenetic analysis by three states of amino          acid solvent accessibility                            JEvTrace implementation          The program takes as input an MSA or an MSA with a          corresponding phylogenetic tree The PILEUP GCG          CLUSTALW   and New Hampshire   formats are          recognized Phylogeny is interpreted as a binary tree          with a hypothetical root Protein structure viewing is          designated to the JAVA structure viewer WebMol            Alignment selections in JEvTrace can be mapped to the          Chimera structure viewer   using an earlier version          of the SCF format available in JEvTrace As many proteins          lack representative crystal structures use of structures          in JEvTrace analysis is optional Currently JEvTrace          supports one active WebMol window per session          Users can select up to seven partitions of the          phylogenetic tree or choose any set of nodes A number          of operations including the ET method can be carried          out on the selected parts of the phylogeny The resulting          data are independent of structural information and can be          viewed and manipulated directly on the MSA of the protein          family To aid interpretation of the phylogenetic data          the tree can be annotated with the percent sequence          identity of all the subclades The identified positions          are visualized on the MSA as well as any available          structures Figure           Among the many sequencestructure features of JEvTrace          is the ability to highlight the residues in contact with          a selected position using a residueresidue distance          calculation and a distance cutoff A number of          sequencebased features are also available including          calculation of alignment position statistics for a          variety of physicalchemical properties molecular volume            average pKa   hydrogenbonding potential          number of rotatable bonds and hydrophobicity            JEvTrace consists of three graphical canvases a          binary phylogenetic tree a list of sequence identifiers          for example accession codes and an MSA The three          canvases are aligned by row such that the terminal nodes          representing individual sequences of the phylogenetic          tree align with their names and aminoacid sequences The          tree and alignment canvases are scrollable in two          dimensions and have a practical capacity of more than           sequences of less than  amino acids on a Pentium          workstation with  M of RAM All JEvTrace functions are          organized into menus and buttons allowing extensive user          interaction with the data Any results that are          represented graphically in JEvTrace or WebMol can be          printed or saved                          Sequence coloring format SCF          implementation          The colored format for the MSA is given as a text file          with the file extension SCF It is accurate with          respect to the underlying sequence data given that the          sequences remains unchanged in length and order As a          safeguard for underlying sequence data consistency the          SCF object calculates a MSA checksum variable see SCF          website   for details Relational databases and          software environments such as JEvTrace represent dynamic          extensions of the format The coloring data can exist as          an individual file or can be appended to the actual data          file  Multiple Sequence Format MSF GCG or CLUSTALW            files in the case of MSA and a PDB file   for          structural data Appending the coloring to the underlying          data can allow transparent annotation by color          The residue positions of sequences in an alignment are          uniquely indexed from top to bottom using sequence          numbers starting at one as rows and left to right using          alignment positions starting at zero as columns The          actual file format consists of six columns sequence          number residue number three columns for the primary          color space red green blue RGB designation of the          color and an optional commentproperty column Figure          c The last column can accommodate accepted coloring          schemes or can be used to define properties for colors          andor the underlying data This format accommodates any          bit digital color and allows highlighting of any          subset of residues in any subset of sequences of the MSA          The selections are encoded in a hierarchical sorted          manner that is smallest to largest sequence position          and within this group smallest to largest sequence and          within those groups smallest to largest color          values          Our JEvTrace implementation of the SCF format in JAVA          allows reading of MSF CLUSTALW and PDB data files and          interpretation of the SCF coloring data in each of these          contexts In addition the underlying sequence data are          modeled as JAVA objects whose properties are dynamically          updated In this implementation it is possible to          translate selections between different MSAs that share at          least one sequence Using a single sequence as a          translator any selections can be translated from one          alignment to another given that both alignments contain          the translator sequence This feature is useful in          bridging analysis of families containing distant          homologs performing independent analysis of multiple          subclades of a protein family or updating MSA data                          Hardware          The JEvTrace and SCF JAVA packages have been tested on          SGI MIPS Pentium Pro Windows and Linux and Macintosh          systems Both JAVA packages are compatible with  and          higher versions of JAVA                          Availability          A JAVA executable package and manual for JEvTrace v          is available on the web   A description and JAVA          source for the SCF v format are also available on the          web
