                    Background        Affymetrix microarrays are used by many laboratories to        study differences in gene expression associated with        experimental treatments diseases development aging and        other conditions Typically an arbitrary value for        expression ratios or foldchange values is chosen to        define significant differences in gene expression between        conditions For example in several studies of aging                 only differences  fold in magnitude        were considered to be significant None of the reports        indicated whether there were smaller effects that were        statistically significant It has been pointed out that        statistically significant differences in gene expression        often are of small magnitude sometimes as low as        fold and that larger effects often are artefacts of        high variance      For those interested in detecting        these smaller effects it is important to minimize        nonspecific sources of interarray variance        To understand the approach described in this report it        is necessary to understand the design of Affymetrix        microarrays and analysis software Microarray Suite There        are multiple probe pairs for each mRNA  for the arrays        used in the present study A probe pair consists of a         base oligonucleotide that matches an mRNA sequence perfect        match or PM probe and an oligonucleotide with a        mismatched base in the center MM probe The specific        hybridization signal for each probe pair is the difference        between the PM intensity and the MM intensity although the        latest version of Affymetrix Microarray Suite  has        special rules for handling MM probes that have higher        signals than their PM partner No single hybridization        condition is optimal for all oligonucleotide probes so it        is inevitable that there is variability among the signals        within a probe set The expression level reported for each        probe set by the Affymetrix absolute analysis algorithm        is based on a weighted average of the signals from the        individual probe pairs with signals near the median given        more weight than those far from the median We refer to        this as the signal method in this report The weights        assigned to each probe pair can vary from one array to        another but it is unclear whether variable weighting adds        significantly to interarray variance Microarray Suite        also has a procedure comparative analysis algorithm for        comparing two arrays at the level of individual probe        pairs With this algorithm ratios of signals PMMM for        each probe pair from one array to those of the other array        are computed first Weighted averages of these ratios are        then computed We refer to this as the ratio method This        method is supposed to be more precise than the signal        method for interarray comparisons Thus many        investigators use this algorithm for all possible        onetoone comparisons across groups eg  comparisons        for  arrays per group and report the average of the        ratios as the change in gene expression          A        problem with this approach is that there is no absolute or        relative expression level assigned to each mRNA on        individual arrays so that formal statistical approaches        eg ttests cannot be used to rate the statistical        significance of differences In this report we describe        how we circumvented this problem by using the ratio method        to generate a composite gene expression score for each mRNA        on each array        The procedure used to estimate the statistical        significance of differences determines which genes and how        many genes are defined as being differentially expressed        For a comparison between two groups the ttest is the most        commonly used procedure in biological research However        with  arrays per group even a single outlier can markedly        reduce the value of t even when there is no overlap between        groups Therefore we also used the nonparametric rank sum        test which is insensitive to a skewed distribution False        detection rates were estimated with the Significance        Analysis of Microarrays SAM program                        Results                  Normalization method          Comparisons among arrays are meaningful only after          accounting for variability in overall target          concentration target is the Affymetrix nomenclature          for a labeled cRNA that hybridizes with a probe          hybridization efficiency staining etc The          normalization procedure recommended by Affymetrix is to          multiply raw signals by a scaling factor such that the          trimmed mean excluding  highest and  lowest of          signals is always the same  in this study This          procedure could be problematic if a variable proportion           of the signals are beyond the linear range of          the system Another concern about the normalization          procedure was that the majority of the targets did not          produce signals that were significantly greater than          those caused by nonspecific hybridization After the          recommended normalization procedure was applied we          confirmed that there was negligible interarray          variability of the mean signal with  of signals          trimmed from both the high and low ends across the           targets that passed the presence  absence filter          described in the next section The trimmed mean was             standard deviation arbitrary units for the           arrays probing RNA from young muscle and    for          the  arrays probing RNA from older muscle These data          were not used to rescale the arrays because the variance          would have been reduced by less than  Plots of signals          from individual arrays versus the average of all           arrays generally showed the expected scatter around the          line of identity Figure A but a few showed systematic          deviations either above or below the line of identity for          signals   arbitrary units worstcase array shown          in Figure B While this problem might be addressed by          using a different scaling factor for highintensity          signals     few targets produced such high signals          and the magnitude of the effect was small Thus the          Affymetrix normalization method was employed without          modification                          Exclusion of targets based on the absolute          detection algorithm          Microarray Suite estimates probabilities that targets          are absent P           detection  based on ratios of signals          from PM probes to those of MM probes together with the          degree of consistency across the multiple probe pairs for          each target As illustrated in Figure  the average          signal from the multiple probe pairs cannot be used to          decide whether a target should be considered present or          absent We restricted the data analyses to targets for          which P           detection was less than  for at          least  of the  samples from either the younger or older          group This filter reduced the number of targets included          in the statistical analyses to  While excluding data          does not affect the nominal value of P for each          comparison made with a ttest or rank sum test it          significantly reduces the estimated false detection rate          see           tTests and           SAM below                          Signal method vs ratio method          When two arrays are compared the gene expression          ratios obtained by the signal method and those obtained          by the ratio method see           Background for explanation of terms          are highly correlated However the results often differ          by more than fold Figure  The advantage of the          signal method is that Microarray Suite provides for each          target a number describing the level of gene expression          in arbitrary units that can be used for ttests or          other statistical procedures However according to          Affymetrix Microarray Suite  Users Guide          comparisons between arrays are more precise when the          ratio method is used so the values on the horizontal          axis of Figure should be more accurate The Affymetrix          ratio method only provides ratios between two arrays and          does not provide gene expression values for the          individual arrays that can be used with standard tests of          statistical significance We therefore extended the ratio          method to generate a relative expression score for each          target on each array as follows          The first step was to name one of the arrays as the          baseline in the comparative analysis program Microarray          Suite  Every other array included in the study was          then compared with that baseline array This procedure          yielded for each target a set of  expression ratios                     r  representing the relative          expression level on each array compared with the baseline          array          The next step was to compute for each target the          expression level            R  of the baseline array relative          to all  arrays included in the study For array            R was computed with the          formula                    R                         r            vs             r            vs               r            vs            The value of  in the denominator of this formula          represents the comparison of array  with itself The          number of arrays is the numerator rather than the          denominator in this formula because the Affymetrix          comparative analysis program sets the baseline array as          the denominator so that values of           r are the inverse of the relevant          ratios          A different array was then named as the baseline          Eg for array  as the baseline                    R                        r            vs               r            vs               r            vs            These steps were repeated until all  arrays had been          named as the baseline The values R            through R            were then used for comparisons          between age groups with ttests rank sum tests and SAM          as described below          For the  probe sets that passed the presence           absence filter the expression ratios mean value in old          group  mean value in young group generated by the          signal method and those generated by the ratio method          were highly correlated r   There also was a          fairly good correlation between the signal and ratio          methods with respect to the level of statistical          significance log P of the agerelated differences r            The advantage of the ratio method was that it          usually reduced the withingroup variance so that the          same mean difference between young and old was associated          with a higher level of statistical significance The          average withingroup coefficient of variation CV          standard deviation  mean was  with the ratio method          and  with the signal method average CVs were the same          for young and old groups The distribution of CVs          improved significantly with the ratio method Figure           Table shows that more differences were detected by the          ratio method whether we used ttests rank sum tests or          SAM to define significant differences Moreover          consistency between the initial scan and the          antibodyenhanced scan was significantly improved by the          ratio method for both expression ratios and for the          statistical significance of differences between young and          old Table  With the signal method  of the          differences significant at P   by ttest on the          initial scan were also significant at P   on the          antibodyenhanced scan and  were significant at P            on the antibody enhanced scan With the ratio          method  of the differences significant at P            on the initial scan were also significant at P            on the antibodyenhanced scan and  were significant          at P   on the antibody enhanced scan                          tTests          A plot of expression ratio vs statistical          significance Figure  shows that differences with high          statistical significance by ttest usually were less          than fold in magnitude The validity of at least some          of the small differences is demonstrated by the fact that          fold differences were detected P   for           genes encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial          electron transport or ATP synthesis Table  This          finding replicates our previous research in which SAGE          and quantitative RTPCR assays demonstrated fold          declines in older muscle of several mRNAs encoding          components of NADH dehydrogenase cytochrome c oxidase          and ATP synthase complexes     For all of these          mRNAs both the signal and ratio methods detected the          differences at P   whereas the ratio method was          a bit more likely to detect them at P             genes than was the signal method  genes Table                    The P values generated by the ttests were not          adjusted for multiple comparisons However a Bonferroni          correction would be too stringent for exploratory          research     A useful alternative to P in studies          involving thousands of comparisons is the estimated false          detection rate which is the ratio of the expected number          of chance differences P  number of comparisons to the          number of differences observed If we use P   to          define a significant difference we should expect           chance differences    comparisons if there is          no effect of aging on gene expression Because           differences were significant at P   by the ratio          method the estimated false detection rate was           or  When no presence  absence filter was applied           probe sets included in the analysis the          estimated false detection rate ratio method increased          from  to  because there were fewer differences at          P   among the absent mRNAs than expected by          chance  observed vs  expected by chance                          MannWhitney rank sum tests          The MannWhitney rank sum test was used to detect          transcripts for which there was little or no overlap of          values between groups This test revealed  differences          at P   exact P   at rank sum cutoff          values when the ratio method was used We would expect          to find  differences by chance alone             genes so the false detection rate    is the          same as that estimated from ttests There were           differences significant at P   by rank sum tests          but not by ttests according to the ratio method Thus          for exploratory research being done to generate lists of          mRNAs that warrant further study use of both parametric          and nonparametric tests is one way to significantly          expand the list                          SAM          SAM computes a value termed d d  mean             mean            s           d  s             that is similar to t t  mean             mean            s           d  The exchangeability factor s             minimizes the number of extreme d          values among targets with small variances in signal          intensity When absolute signals are analyzed these          small variances are associated with targets that are more          difficult to quantify accurately because of low          concentrations We already have filtered most of these          targets from the analysis When data based on the signal          method were analyzed s            was very small lowest percentile of          the s           d values When relative expression          levels were computed by the ratio method all means were          close to  regardless of the absolute signal intensity          In this case s            was large rd percentile of the s           d values and lower s           d values were associated with stronger          rather than weaker signals This problem precluded the          use of SAM for data normalized in this fashion However          by multiplying each value of           R by the genespecific mean signal          mean of all  arrays we generated a data set          compatible with SAM          SAM lists genes for which d exceeds by an adjustable          threshold termed  the value that would be expected by          chance d           e  Values of d           e are generated by computing the d          distribution numerous times with random permutations of          the group assignments we instructed SAM to perform           permutations The average distribution from these          permutations defines the values of d           e  Reducing  expands the list of          significant genes but also increases the false          detection rate When we chose a value of  corresponding          to a false detection rate   there were           differences according to the ratio method but only           differences according to the signal method There were           differences for which the false detection rate was            when the ratio method was used including  for genes          involved in energy metabolism that are listed in Table           but none when the signal method was used When no          presence  absence filter was applied the highestranked          differences had false detection rates of  even with          the ratio method and only  genes achieved this level          Thus it is very important to remove noisy data before          using SAM                            Discussion        Careful subject selection and consistency in        experimental conditions sample collection procedures and        sample processing obviously are needed if small differences        in gene expression are to be detected A further reduction        in total withingroup variance can be achieved by using the        ratio method described in this report This method is based        on the Affymetrix comparative analysis algorithm which was        designed for comparisons between two arrays To use the        procedure for groups rather than individual arrays we        assigned each target on each array a score that was the        average ratio from all onetoone comparisons of that array        with every array included in the study The best        illustration of the increase in power gained by the ratio        method was the fact that that  differences were below the         false detection rate by SAM when this method was used        whereas no differences below the  false detection rate        were found when the signal method was used The major        drawback of the ratio method is increased computational        time        It has been suggested that interarray variance can be        reduced by ignoring data from MM probes or by using an        alternative computation to take advantage of the MM data               In previous versions of Microarray Suite        MM signals were always subtracted from PM signals which        often led to negative expression levels The newer version         used in this study has a different procedure for        dealing with high signals from MM probes It is not clear        whether alternative algorithms for using the MM signals or        ignoring MM signals would improve the accuracy of the        data We therefore used the Affymetrix algorithm which is        likely to be used by most investigators until there is        definitive evidence that alternative methods are        superior        There is no consensus about the optimal statistical        approach for finding differences in expression among        thousands of genes When a specific hypothesis is being        tested shopping for the best statistical test to support        the hypothesis should be avoided In contrast when the        goal is to generate descriptive information to guide        decisions about future research directions there is no        reason not to use multiple approaches to obtain as much        information as possible For a comparison of two groups        the ttest is simple and robust and does not require        special software Some investigators may be wary about        using ttests rather than mean differences to rank genes        because one or two extreme values can reduce t even when        there is no overlap between groups The rank sum test can        be used to detect such effects Log transformation of the        data also can minimize the impact of outliers with high        signals However log transformation reduces t when the        outliers are close to zero It has been suggested that this        feature of the log transformation is advantageous because        it can exclude effects that are artefacts of noisy data at        low expression levels     We prefer to filter noisy        data by using the P         detection algorithm        SAM    is an alternative to ttests or rank sum        tests The false detection rates computed by SAM were        markedly increased when we did not apply our presence         absence filter When the filter was used SAM generated a        lower estimate of the number of false differences than        estimates based on multiplying Pt or Prank sum by the        number of comparisons Perhaps this observation can be        explained by the fact that expression levels of many genes        are correlated with expression levels of many others The        number of random differences to be expected among thousands        of comparisons with ttests or rank sum tests is based on        the assumption that comparisons are independent of one        another SAM computes the false detection rate with a        method that does not rely on this assumption        Some of the arrays included in this study n   probed        RNA pooled from multiple subjects whereas others n          probed RNA from individual subjects The heterogeneous        nature of the samples conceivably could influence the        statistical properties of this data set However there was        good uniformity among arrays in terms of scaling factors        and percentages of probe sets with P         detection   and both age groups        were comprised of  pools and  individual samples which        should minimize the influence of using both pooled and        individual samples see Additional file  After the data        analyses described in this report were completed we        reanalyzed the individual samples along with  new        individual samples total of  individual samples per age        group using UA and UB arrays which have         probe sets with  probe pairs per set The reduction of        withingroup variance by the ratio method was replicated        Table  demonstrating that it is not unique to UA        arrays and is not an artefact of including both pooled and        individual samples We cannot guarantee that the same        reduction in variance will occur in all cases If variance        caused by biological heterogeneity or by inconsistent        laboratory procedures is very high then the difference        between the signal and ratio methods might be trivial in        relation to overall variance The proposed computational        method appears to reduce the inflation of variance caused        by variable weighting of individual probes within a set        but cannot compensate for variance from other sources        Additional Files        Source of RNA scaling factors and percentage of probe

risks were explained The research was          approved by the University of Rochester Research Subjects          Review Board                          Procedures          Subjects were asked to refrain from any activity more          strenuous than walking for  days before the muscle          biopsy Each subject stayed at the University of          Rochester General Clinical Research Center the night          before the biopsy to minimize variability between          subjects in the amount of activity performed on the day          of the biopsy The needle biopsy was obtained from the          vastus lateralis The skin and muscle were anesthetized          with lidocaine a few minutes before tissue removal The          muscle sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen within           seconds of removal then stored at C until          analysis                          Analysis of gene expression by high density          oligonucleotide arrays          RNA was extracted from the muscle samples as described          previously     All RNA samples were of high quality          as indicated by the pattern of staining with ethidium          bromide in an agarose gel after electrophoretic          separation RNA was probed with Affymetrix HGUA high          density oligonucleotide arrays which have  probe          sets Twelve arrays were examined four two for each age          group that probed RNA pooled from  subjects and eight          four for each age group that probed RNA from a single          subject Pooling of RNA was necessary in some cases          because most of the RNA from some samples had been used          for other purposes Additional file shows the source of          RNA scaling factors and percentage of transcripts          present P           detection   for each          array          Analytical procedures were carried out using standard          operating procedures developed and validated by the          University of Rochester Microarray Core Facility After          hybridization and washing arrays were stained with          phycoerythrinstreptavidin which binds to the          biotinylated cRNAs hybridized with the probes The          initial scan detected the fluorescence of the          phycoerythrinstreptavidin The analyses described in          this report are based on data from this initial scan          After the initial scan signals were amplified by          staining the array with biotinlabeled antistreptavidin          antibody followed by phycoerythrinstreptavidin Analyses          of the antibodyenhanced scans are not presented except          for correlations with the initial scans since the same          statistical issues are relevant to both scans These          scans supported the results discussed above Data from          both scans were deposited in the GEO and AMDeC          databases                          Software          The statistical algorithms of Microarray Suite           were used with the default parameters to generate          signals ratios of signals between two arrays and P           detection values Data generated by          Microarray Suite were exported to Microsoft Excel for          further analysis SAM runs within Excel                            Authors contributions        SW was responsible for data analyses and was the        principal author AIB
