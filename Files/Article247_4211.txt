                                 The Millenniums Most Intriguing People                        Dear Dad            I suspect some readers may be wondering what Kerensky Kafka and PrinceLazar are doing at the Breakfast Table I can only assure them that in ourfamily the breakfast table really is like this OK not always In fact notoften But sometimes            Your yearold grandson was sick and kept us up half the night nothingserious luckily and now hes tearing around the house like usual so if thiswere a real breakfast table my conversation would not be rising very far aboveoccasional groans grunts and frantic gestures towards the coffee pot Thisbeing the case Im not sure how coherently Ill be able to respond to yourinteresting thoughts about the living presence of history But Ill try            So Speaking of the Defenestration of Prague hows that for a conversationopener one of the funniest things about it is that one of the survivingvictimswho fell on a dungheap not a haystackwas subsequently knightedand given the title Freiherr von Hohenfall which translates roughly as LordHighjump            But more seriously you suggest we talk about the Millennium What hasinterested me as a professional historian about the medias coverage of thesubject so far has been how relatively little attention has been paid to thehistory of the planet between  and  I expected far more in the way ofexhibitions TV shows special editions of magazines polls commissioned onwho were the most significant figures of the past  years and so onparticularly given the enormous interest in history that is demonstrated bythings like the success of the History Channel history as a living presencein the living room All right there were the special issues of the NewYork Times Magazine  But not as much else as I would have thought            I suspect one reason is that a thousand years is just too long a period oftime There is too much to consider In one sense the second millennium infact contains nearly everything we think of as history for even if wearbitrarily define history as stopping in  something like  percentof all available historical source material dates from after the year  Iwould bet that all the extant written material from all human civilizations foreverything before AD  could probably fit on a single DVD disk It isalready possible to buy a single CDROM containing all the written materialavailable from classical Greece and Rome This is the reason why the TimesMagazine series never really worked and tended to veer off intointeresting digressions at best and postmodern silliness at worst            The difficulty of even generalizing about such a long period is probably thesame reason we are seeing very few predictions about what life is going to belike in the year  How can we even guess at such a thing Makingpredictions about the world in  is a very uncertain business as youstressed on Tuesday but its fun and you have at least a chance of beingright and if some of your predictions involve the lengthening of the humanlife span and you hit the mark there you may even still be around to see howyou did on the others But the world in  Even most science fiction isstill set within the next couple of centuries            Another reason for the lack of attention closer to my own concerns is thatWestern historians no longer have a simple story to tell about the history ofthe second millenniuma single metanarrative to use our jargon A hundredyears ago for most historians and for the general public as well the storyof the millennium was the story of the Triumph of the West If you had taken apoll of Americans in  about the most important figures of the millenniumIm sure Columbus would have come at or close to the top as an emblematicfigure of this triumph But today the picture is much more murky the triumphmuch more dubious I suppose political correctness has some role in this lossof focus However in my current grumpy and groggy state Im in absolutely nomood to discuss political correctness And anyway more fundamental thanpolitical correctness is surely the fact that the West has not exactlydistinguished itself in this last century of the millennium Hitler was a childof the West So were Lenin and Stalin The horror of World War I was a Westernhorror Mao and Pol Pot have a certain claim to being called honoraryWesterners given who their teachers were And now the century is coming to anend with the Russian army leveling Grozny as the paper reports thismorning            Talk to you later            LoveDavid
