                    Background        One of the major cellular serinethreonine protein        phosphatases is protein phosphatase type  PP     An        abundant enzyme expressed in all cells complex regulation        of PP is thought to be essential for proper temporal and        spatial regulation of PP catalytic activity towards        individual substrates     Three different isotypes of        the catalytic subunit designated PP PP and PP        are expressed in many different cell types     Studies        employing many eukaryotic systems all point to a crucial        role for PP activity in controlling cell cycle        progression and an absolute requirement of this activity        for mitotic exit        There is also evidence to        suggest that phosphorylation of PP and its associated        proteins by the cyclindependent kinases may regulate PP        activity in a cell cycle stagedependent manner              Hence current efforts are directed towards        identification of cell cycledependent substrates for PP        and how regulation of PP activity towards these substrates        controls the cell division cycle        One physiological substrate for PP appears to be the        product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene pRB              a demonstrated tumor suppressor The cell growth        and tumor suppressive activity of pRB is regulated by its        phosphorylation state pRB phosphorylation varies as a        function of cell cycle phase during G          the hypophosphorylated form        predominates while the hyperphosphorylated form        accumulates during S G          and M phase       It is this        hypophosphorylated form of pRB present during early and mid        G          which functions to modify gene        expression This is achieved by complexing with        transcription factors resulting in repression    or        stimulation    of transcription Under conditions        favoring proliferation the phosphorylation of pRB via        cyclindependent kinases CDKs in midtolate G          phase results in liberation of EF and        other pRBbound transcription factors which then activate        the transcription of Sphase genes     In late M        phase pRB returns to its growth suppressive        hypophosphorylated form due to the action of a pRBdirected        protein phosphatase belonging to the type  class of        serinethreonine protein phosphatases              Of critical importance is the question of the         in vivo effect of PP activity on pRB        and growth regulation To date several techniques have        been employed in this regard to demonstrate PP actions in        intact cells Berndt et al    used electroporation to        introduce PP protein into tissue culture cells having        noted that previous genetic attempts to accomplish        overexpression were not readily accomplished Using this        technique they showed a G block by PP that was dependent        upon the presence of pRB In another report        microinjection of PP decreased extractability of pRB from        nuclei presumably by increasing dephosphorylation and        increasing association with nuclear proteins thereby        playing a role in GS transition inhibition            Microinjection of antibodies to the PP catalytic subunit        has been shown to block cells in metaphase     Since        this is the time during mitosis when pRB is normally        dephosphorylated      it is tempting to speculate        that prevention of pRB dephosphorylation by inhibiting PP        activity impedes an orderly progression through mitosis        perhaps contributing towards a transformed phenotype        Here using the tetracycline induction system            we developed an inducible PP expression system to        investigate the regulation of PP activity We view this as        a first step towards addressing the question of the         in vivo effect of PP activity on pRB        and growth regulation Our results support the notion that        induced PP protein functions identically to endogenous        PP with respect to noncatalytic subunit binding and        activity towards phosphorylase         a and the tumor suppressor pRB        Localization of this protein to the nucleus also mirrors        that of endogenous PP         in vivo  When using this system to        forcibly overexpress HisHAPP there is a concomitant        decrease in endogenous PP levels suggesting the        existence of an autoregulatory mechanism by which PP        protein levels remain constant RTPCR analyses of isolated        polysome fractions supports the notion that this putative        autoregulatory mechanism is exerted at least in part at        the translational level                    Results and Discussion                  Induction of HisHAPP in LLWF cells          Figure shows construct of the tetracyclineinducible          plasmid used to express HisHAPP As shown in Figure          A  hr incubation with doxycycline in the medium has          no appreciable effect on endogenous PP protein          expression in the untransfected parent cell line UMUC          or a cell line transfected with the reverse tetracycline          transactivator plasmid pUHDneo only LLWO A time          course of induction by doxycycline was then carried out          in stable clone LLWOF Harvested at various time          intervals wholecell lysates were prepared and the          proteins were separated by SDSPAGE for western blotting          using antibody to the hemagglutinin tag As shown in          Figure B a protein with the anticipated molecular          weight of  kDa was detected A clear differential of          expression of HisHAPP indicated at the left of the          panel was observed at  hours after addition of          doxycycline which became more pronounced at later time          points The doxycyclineindependent increase in          HisHAPP is attributed to background expression when          using this system     As predicted for a protein          under the control of the doxycyclineinducible promoter          the abundance of HisHAPP decreases in the absence of          the inducer over time Figure C Subsequent time course          experiments revealed peak abundance occurring between           and  hr and remaining constant thereafter for at least           hr at which time the experiment was terminated As          such we have chosen the  hr induction time for all          subsequent experiments to ensure peak abundance of the          induced HisHAPP          As shown in Figure C a significant reduction in          HisHAPP abundance can be observed between  and           hrs following removal of doxycycline This reduction          continued through the  hr time point at which time the          experiment ended Taken together these data confirm the          dependence of HisHAPP protein production on the          tetOCMV promoter thus demonstrating inducible          expression of PP As expected     some lowlevel          expression of HisHAPP in the absence of the inducer          doxycycline can also be detected                          Biological and Biochemical Characterization of          Inducible HisHAPP          To begin addressing the biological and biochemical          characterization of inducible PP we next localized          this protein           in situ using immunohistochemistry          As shown in Figure  there is a predominant nuclear          localization of the hemagglutinin epitope panel A          compared to the lowlevel cytoplasmic and nuclear          background reactivity seen in the uninduced LLWOF          control cells panel B Thus not only can          doxycyclineinduced expression of PP be detected          immunohistochemically but localization of this protein          appears to be identical to that of endogenous PP                       Targeting of PP to the nucleus is due in part to a          PPassociated nuclear targeting subunit PNUTS              To further investigate the properties of inducible          PP we performed coprecipitation studies to determine          if PNUTS can also be found associated with HisHAPP          Towards this goal a fusion protein of GST and PNUTS was          tested for the ability to capture induced PP Lysates          from induced LLWOF cells were combined with GSTalone          or GSTPNUTSloaded glutathione Sepharose beads          Following separation by SDSPAGE and western blotting          antibody to hemagglutinin was used to detect any          associated HisHAPP Antibody reactivity would          indicate a link from the GST epitope to the hemagglutinin          epitope via a PNUTS to PP interaction As shown in          Figure  the hemagglutinin epitope was captured by the          GSTPNUTS fusion protein but not the GSTalone protein          These data support the idea that induced PP and the          nuclear targeting PPassociated protein PNUTS can form a          complex These results further support the view that          induced PP behaves similarly if not identically to          endogenous PP and provides a possible mechanistic          explanation for HisHAPP localization to the          nucleus          Two different approaches were taken to address the          biochemical activity of inducible PP First          immunocomplexed HisHAPP was tested for its ability          to dephosphorylate phosphorylase           a  Phosphorylated on a single          serine residue this substrate is often used to monitor          the biochemical activity of PP           in vitro     As shown in          Figure  greater phosphatase activity is detected in          immunoprecipitates from induced LLWOF cell lysates          compared to uninduced This is consistent with the notion          that inducible PP is enzymatically active Our second          approach involved testing immunopurified HisHAPP for          its ability to dephosphorylate the growth suppressor          protein pRB Having previously reported on the ability of          immunocomplexed endogenous PP to dephosphorylate pRB              we followed the same experimental approach Figure          shows a significant decrease in the P radiolabel          intensity for pRB following incubation with the          antihemagglutinin immunoprecipitate compared to the          normal mouse IgG control immunoprecipitate In addition          okadaic acid a potent inhibitor of PP activity              significantly inhibits pRB dephosphorylation in this          reaction Taken together these data indicate that          inducible PP is biochemically active                          Upregulation of inducible HisHAPP coincides          with downregulation of endogenous PP          One prediction would be that by increasing expression          of the catalytic subunit of PP overall PPspecific          activity within the cell would increase To address this          we tested the phosphatase activity of LLWOF wholecell          lysate using phosphorylase           a as the substrate To inhibit any          endogenous PPA activity which can also dephosphorylate          phosphorylase           a and thus interfere with PP          activity measurements these assays were carried out in          the presence of  nM okadaic acid which does not inhibit          PP activity     Although reproducible we observed          only modest increases in PPspecific activity found in          lysates from induced cells compared to the uninduced          controls Figure  One possible explanation for this          finding is that the overall level of PP within the cell          remains relatively constant regardless of induction          Indeed a time course of induction followed by western          blotting of whole cell lysates using antibody to PP          revealed diminution of the endogenous PP signal after           hr of induction while the HisHAPP signal increased          Figure  To further test this hypothesis          immunoprecipitation and western blotting experiments were          carried out using PP isoformspecific antibodies As          shown in Figure  top panel induced approximate          molecular weight of  kDa and endogenous approximate          molecular weight of  kDa PP are clearly resolved by          SDSPAGE As predicted both proteins are recognized by          antibody specific for PP when performing          immunoprecipitation or western blotting          Immunoprecipitation using PP antibody followed by          western blotting using the same antiPP reveals a          reciprocal relationship in PP abundance following          doxycycline induction endogenous PP levels decrease in          response to increasing levels of HisHAPP top panel          compare left two lanes This difference in abundance is          more striking in the wholecell lysate lanes endogenous          PP fails to be detected in lysates prepared from          induced cells compare middle two lanes Parallel          experiments performed using the same lysate and antibody          to hemagglutinin for immunoprecipitation and western          blotting show the position of HisHAPP and the fact          that endogenous PP is not recognized by this antibody          bottom panel Western blotting for additional isoforms          of PP reveals that this reduction in PP following          induction is isotypespecific when HisHAPP levels          increase concomitant with a decrease in PP levels          PP and PP levels remain relatively unchanged from          those found in uninduced cell lysate Figure  Taken          together these data suggest that an as yet undescribed          negativefeedback or autoregulatory mechanism exists for          PP which contributes towards maintaining a constant          level of protein expression and enzyme activity                          RTPCR of polysome and total RNA specific for          endogenous PP and HisHAPP          To address the possible autoregulatory mechanisms of          PP expression and activity we analyzed the RNA levels          of both endogenous PP and induced HisHAPP For          uninduced cells only endogenous PP RNA can be found          associated with polysomes Figure  second lane While          some HisHAPP RNA can be detected in the total RNA          the majority PP RNA detected in the total preparation          is endogenous fourth lane In contrast it appears that          for the doxycyclineinduced cells third lane there is          more HisHAPP RNA associated with polysomes than          endogenous PP However both messages appear to be          present at the same level in the total RNA preparation          fifth lane This apparent preference for HisHAPP          RNA association with polysomes suggest that          autoregulation takes place at least in part at the          translational level                            Conclusions        In summary we report on the development of an inducible        mammalian cell expression system for the catalytic subunit        of the isotype for PP This protein behaves similarly if        not identically to endogenous PP with respect to nuclear        localization complex formation to a recently described        PPassociated nuclear targeting protein and         in vitro enzymatic activity towards        phosphorylase         a and the cell growth and tumor        suppressor protein pRB        We observed that endogenous PP protein levels decrease        in response to increasing levels of induced HisHAPP        protein This observation suggests that an as yet        undescribed negativefeedback or autoregulatory mechanism        exists for PP which contributes towards maintaining a        constant level of this enzyme Given the difficulty in        achieving overexpression of PP protein and activity in        mammalian cells this suggestion provides an attractive        explanation This putative mechanism appears to be        isotypespecific since the protein levels of PP and        PP remained relatively unchanged in response to induced        expression of PP Precedent for an autoregulatory        mechanism comes from a report by Baharians and Schonthal            in which they demonstrate endogenous PPA protein        levels decrease in the presence of increasing amounts of        forciblyexpressed exogenous PPA Their report also        provides evidence that this control is exerted at the        translational level and does not involve regulation of        transcription or RNA processing Using a similar approach        of analyzing mRNA association with ribosomes as a measure        of translation efficiency a similar level of translational        control also appears to exist for PP If mRNA association        with ribosomes is truly a measure of translation        efficiency one conclusion from these data is that in        doxycyclineinduced cells HisHAPP RNA is more        efficiently translated than endogenous PP This would        help to explain why we observed a decrease in endogenous        PP protein expression in doxycyclineinduced cells Since        we did not perform rigorous analyses on PP regulation of        transcription or RNA processing we cannot rule out the        possibility that some level of transcriptional control also        exists Indeed the abundance of endogenous PP RNA found        in uninduced cells appears equal to or greater than the        combined abundance of endogenous and HisHAPP RNA        Figure  supporting the notion that some level of        translational control may also exist        These findings provided by the development of this        inducible PP expression system will afford new research        opportunities aimed towards addressing the question of how        PP activity is regulated This putative autoregulatory        mechanism for the catalytic subunit may help to explain why        the overall abundance of PP during the various phases of        the cell cycle remains relatively constant            Historically regulation of PP catalytic activity has        resulted from associated subunits inhibiting or targeting        the catalytic subunit towards substrates     While the        PP catalytic subunit is not found alone in the cell such        unassociated catalytic subunits have been shown to be        active at least         in vitro  Although speculative        there may be a threshold amount of catalytic subunit         in vivo above which associated        proteins are limiting Such a situation may compromise the        ability of associated proteins to effectively regulate PP        catalytic activity To guard against this scenario control        over the amount of PP catalytic subunit present via an        autoregulatory mechanism would be beneficial        The data presented here validate a useful system with        which to manipulate PP activity         in vivo for the purpose of functional        studies Just as is the case for PPA     it seems        clear that efficient overall increases in PP protein        abundance may not be achieved due to a putative negative        feedback or autoregulatory mechanism However induced        expression of exogenous PP which behaves identically to        endogenous PP while remaining physically distinguishable        can facilitate the use of mutants to address functional        questions particularly in the area of cell cycle        regulation and tumor cell growth suppression Indeed the        use of a constitutively active mutant of PP has already        been shown to result in pRBdependent G arrest in human        cancer cells     Placing this mutant into the        inducible expression system described here has the        potential to downregulate expression of wildtype        endogenous PP Doing so in a timed controlled manner will        permit         in vivo studies addressing PP        function during discrete phases of the cell cycle and will        be the subject of future endeavors                    Materials and Methods                  Tetracycline Induction System          The rabbit PP cDNA in pDR    was ligated into          pcDNA Invitrogen to create a fusion encoding           histidines His followed by an epitope YPYDVPDYA          from
