SafetyBoards announcement that EgyptAir s cockpit voice recorder indicates foulplay a story fronted above the fold by the NYT and the LAT             The NTSB did not give any specifics about the contents of the cockpit voicerecorder but the papers publish leaked details Just before EgyptAirsautopilot is turned off the cockpit door apparently opens and shuts severaltimes and then a pilot utters what appears to be an Islamic prayerwhether asan expression of alarm or of suicide is unknown Seconds later the plane goesinto what appears to be a pilotinduced dive and soon it appears that anotherpilot has reentered the cockpit and is working at cross purposes with thefirst Eventually someone apparently shuts off the engines The Poststory implies that this sequence of events is certain rather than merelyapparent The NYT and Post say that Arabic translators didnot notice the religious utterance at first but the Post says thatwhen Egyptiandialect specialists were brought in they spotted it right awayAll the papers report the NTSBs announcement that it might surrender theinvestigation to the FBI The NYT says that the NTSB offered to stepdown yesterday but that the FBI demurred USAT and the LATquote anonymous sources predicting that the transfer will happen today ThePost says that the NTSB tightened security at its headquartersConspiracy theories abounded in the  crash of TWA  the Postnotes partly because the FBI effectively took control of the investigation andran it secretively            The Post fronts an anonymously sourced report that the UN SecurityCouncil is near agreement on a resolution that would suspend the nineyearoldsanctions against Iraq in exchange for its compliance with international armsinspections The proposal would require the Security Council to reaffirm thesuspension policy every  days and any member would as usual have aunilateral veto            The NYT fronts a long feature on the backlash against ATM fees which tookform most concretely in last weeks ATMfee prohibition by the San Franciscoand Santa Monica city councils In response Californias two largestbanksWells Fargo and Bank of Americadenied ATM access to noncustomersBut the NYT fails to report that yesterday a US district courtissued a preliminary injunction against the fee prohibitionsa story offleaded by the LAT this same LAT storyruns inside the Post in abbreviated form            On the Wall StreetJournal opinion page thinktank scholar Bruce Bartlett mocks wouldbepresidential candidate Donald Trumps proposal to eliminate the federal debt byimposing a onetime  percent tax on the net wealth of every American withover  million To pay off our  trillion debt at a  percent rateyoud need a tax base of  trillion This Bartlett notes is approximatelythe net worth of every American including the businesses they own and everynonprofit organization in the country Even if the  percent tax wasapplied universallyas the numbers would seem to require in order to raise trillionthis would mean taxing university endowments foundationschurches and even the smallest bank accounts It would force the sale oftrillions of dollars of stock as owners either paid the tax or hid theirassets And in the end Bartlett writes Congress would likely replace the billion in annual interest payments with new spending            The NYT  LAT  Post  and Journal report that Al Gorereceived an interrogation by Microsoft employees upon visiting the companysheadquarters Peppered with hostile questions Gore defended the JusticeDepartments lawsuit and insisted that the nations antitrust laws represent abasic American value Throughout the session the Post notesGore attempted to defuse tension by making jokes mentioning obscurescientific theories and repeatedly announcing his Web site address Only theLAT and Journal report that Gore nonetheless received astanding ovation when he left Afterwards Gore dropped in on Todays PapersWell thats not entirely correct but he did stop by the offices of                  Slate               where his daughter Karenna worked severalyears agoto write a diary of his day at Microsoft To read it click hereThe vice president it should be noted missed his deadline            From the NYT s EgyptAir story                           Transportation investigators also stressed that they had not yetsynchronized the voice tape with the flight data recorder tape which wouldrecord events occurring on the airplane and could put the statements incontext For instance a prayer being said after the plane began plummeting sofast that passengers were rendered weightless would not be suspicious                        From the Post s EgyptAir story                           The key to understanding the sequence of events was that the safety boardlaboratory was able to correlate the exact timing on the cockpit voice recorderand the flight data recorder They therefore knew exactly when the troublingwords were uttered and when the door was opened in relation to the planesdive
