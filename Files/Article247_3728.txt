                                 Defining Deviance Up                        Dear Ester            I am not certain whether we were to wrap up our conversation yesterday ortoday however I will send at least one more message The quote from your lastmessage is of course the crux of the issue that Alan Wolfe raised and hasbeen at the core of much of my thinking            I too view myself as a religious person however Ive been mostly out ofthe church since I left a Lutheran seminary in  Having studied Christianexistentialism indeed all existentialism avidly in college and seminary Iwas wrestling with the idea of freedom from secular and religious institutionsin terms of my personal morality quite early And for me morality is a verypersonal issue Over time however as the power of authoritative institutionswanedchurch state even familyI was increasingly struck by the realitythat while many have handled their moral freedom responsibly many othershave used lack of external constraints to exploit and prey onotherspersonally financially sexually violently etc Moreover I becamepersuaded that societys reluctance to come down on such persons for minorincivilities and offenses in one sense trapped these peopleespecially youngpersonsinto believing that there were no consequences for anything So wedecriminalized virtually all minor offenses we refused to confront youngpersons meaningfully for minor offensesin New York City even burglary was forall practical purposes decriminalized police didnt even bother investigatingitand to use Moynihans phrase we defined deviance down To get intotrouble one really had to be a badassthat is be outrageouslyconfrontational and violent Authority was a bad joke to them until they raninto three strikes youre out the disastrous outcome for both society atlarge and individuals when society fails to meet its responsibility to takepreventive actions earlyboth nurturing and controlling actions            So I still wrestle with your phrase about moral authority How can societymaintain civility when everybody is free to define personal morality on theirown terms while some members of society are eager to use this freedom tointimidate exploit and prey on others            To provide an answer to my own questionWhy now does the greatdisruption seem to be recedingI would suggest that society in broad termscame to an understanding in the late s that we had largely lost control ofa relatively large number of youths and public spaces And a new ideadeveloped We had to enforce a balance between individual liberty and personalresponsibilitycertainly with nurturing and moral authority but even withstate authority            Anyway I hope that sometime we can really have breakfast I hope that yourkids are well I checked on my grandchildren four yesterday and all seem tobe doing well One refused to be seated in the school bus and consequentlyran into a massive assertion of parental authority            Be wellGeorge
