                 um i think um uh actually im uh fairly pleased with the benefits that we have at the uh working for a large corporation and for me theres absolutely no question whats the most important benefit   right   i think its health care its what i think everybody would say that   oh and then if you try to get it outside of your uh corporation youre gonna pay an arm and a leg   right belonging to a group is the belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you   right   um so the um  sometimes i think its more important than salary   uh do you also get dental     yes and um i dont know if i would rank that second but um since i have three boys uh it it can turn out to be important you know in a in a given year dental can dental expenses can really kill you   oh i know now my husband is with uh Northwest Airlines and he gets uh you know the full health and dental and uh we have four children and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous   right   and i dont know how people that dont have it can afford it   right its uh   or maybe they dont   right uh and then uh if the cleaning doesnt get you the orthodontics will   thats right thats right   uh i guess that would be up there uh im not sure if i would rank uh how i would rank that next to say compared to retirement or uh um um pre tax savings was another thing that i think is a a great a great benefit when i   uhhuh right   and i really i think its really something that the uh the government ought to encourage more because uh there are all these complaints about how were not a saving country and where the average savings rate is something like four percent in this country and fifteen percent in uh Germany and Japan   right   um   well its a lot easier to to save it when you dont get your hands on it first   right when you have the when you have the uh the economy to scale and everything that a large corporation has and you can uh offer some incentive       and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside you can really build up uh the savings and the that you wouldnt otherwise do and   right uh what about what about uh lesser uh benefits perhaps for you but for for the women in the in the uh corporation for example uh  oh   leave   yeah do they have even have do they have father leaves or anything like that     you know i i dont think so yet they may have uh just plain parental leave which either one can take uh i their uh i know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which i think is too short   uhhuh   uh   oh i do too     uh uh i really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks   oh i think i think its just a crying shame uh for a mother to have to go back to work at six weeks     right and and uh   she isnt recovered  and uh the infant needs her desperately at that point and time     there   there ought to be uh uh some compromise that could where uh where the person would be guaranteed a uh career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position uh in exchange for a longer period of time   umhum right i agree   its uh its so important to families then and uh and yet anybody whose gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up   oh sure especially in this day and age you dont want to start over again anywhere   um   that yeah youre right i think youve put your finger on the one benefit that i that i would most like to see uh changed  um the uh parental leave   well i think theyre at theyre coming theyve come a long way um at least some companies   right   some of them uh my girlfriend in particular that works for a a rental car agency and uh as manager and uh they have a very very poor leave policy and uh i just dont know how how women do it particularly single parents who dont have the support at the other end   right   uh   they do it by shortchanging their kids there no other way   thats right thats exactly right   i mean uh unless theyre part of some extended family which is unlikely um with people moving as much   right   and uh theyre just its just a terrible choice you shouldnt have to make it uh   umhum   right and uh   one of the benefits we get of course is travel   oh right boy would i like to have that   its wonderful  the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere but you cant afford to stay once you get there   yeah oh listen i have friends in a lot of different cities if youd just fly me there ill take care of that   thats right  you have to have an awful lot of fun just just getting there is has to be half the fun   right so  and uh i guess the uh the idea
