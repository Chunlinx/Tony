                um   so you have a son   i have a an older son yeah he doesnt have any children yet though   uhhuh   uh hes thirty seven and i dont know if hes ever going to have any or not but i do have some neighbor kids lots of little neighbor kids   umhum   that i go out and uh i play ball with them you know its because like this one that lives right next door her mother does some work at home on computers and it just seems like she doesnt have any time for them   umhum uhhuh   which is kind of sad you know   yeah   so the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them so i will go out and play catch with them or you know we have let the dogs outside and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs but uh actually i do think that the parents should have you know a little bit more time to spend with their kids   i would think so when you when when your son was at home did you um working did you work or were you able to stay at home with him   no when my son was at home i i did work and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about uh five other kids that she baby sat you know but we always had our days off together and we went camping on vacations so we had a lot of time together that way you know   uhhuh yeah well when my mom uh when i was growing up my mom worked too but she worked nights   uhhuh   and uh as a nurse and so she was always home for us   uhhuh   and i always i really appreciated that having her there when i was you know when i came home from school and when i worked but now when i look back at it it must have been a really difficult thing that she did for us   oh yeah well i am sure it was you know but uh i dont know what the families are really going to come to nowadays because they just there just doesnt seem like they do have time for their kids because most most of them the father and the mother both work you know   yeah   so its really rough um i have one neighbor thats uh the father is a fireman and he works like four days on and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days but he cant make enough as a fireman to support his family you know so hes got a second job   um   so hes you know hes not home very often   yeah   and thats you know the kids i know miss that you know   they really do uh a family without a father is its a its a really hard thing   yeah you know and i dont know i i suppose they are trying to get through to them that well daddy is not home because you know he is out working trying to make some money for you know we can buy you this bike and that toy and so forth you know   uhhuh   but uh   kids i think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway   oh im sure they would you know so  are you planning on to having any children or   oh yeah oh yeah our uhhuh but were um we just got married like like December so were going to wait a year and then we will try   umhum um yeah well thats good yeah thats thats what my uh daughterinlaw had told me that they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage   uhhuh   and they will be married nine years  this year       so i dont know shes a nurse you know and uh she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids so maybe they just decided that uh if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night   yeah thats a possibility yeah well we really want to have a family we feel like that that couple you know   you know but uh   youre not giving enough of yourself and you should you should be sharing your family   uhhuh uhhuh so   and giving your values to you know making something better of the world by raising up good kids and letting them know theyre loved and stuff give them give them an edge but   right right right   we feel like like the first year needs to be devoted to uh making the the family the couple strong and secure in their love for each other   uhhuh right right   but then a family is is definitely a high priority   yeah uh do you plan on staying home after you have your children or do you do you work or what   well i um im in a different situation i am a missionary   uhhuh   and im home on on furlough its called like ive worked for four years in Africa and i come home for a year   umhum umhum   and then we go back for four years but my husband and i will do the same job and well be living in in Africa and well be working together   umhum   so uh we will we will share the job of raising the family i mean as a mother ill have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have but still well share that job   umhum umhum   but we have then we have decisions that we have to make that are hard about schooling like do you want to home school your kids on a computer program   umhum   you know that kind of thing   umhum   or do you send them away to boarding school and if you do that when do you do it and thats a
