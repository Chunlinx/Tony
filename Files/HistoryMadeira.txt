                      A Brief History        Befitting a lush tropical island stranded in the middle of        the ocean Madeiras origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful        legend Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Platos lost        Atlantis or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of        Europe and America        The Portuguese Step Ashore        Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in        relatively recent times  just as the golden age of Portuguese        discovery was erupting Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator        caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve in southern        Portugal in search of foreign lands fame and wealth Joo Gonalves        Zarco sailing in the service of Prince Henry made the first of many        famous Portuguese discoveries which would culminate a century later in        Magellans historic circumnavigation of the globe Zarco happened upon        a small volcanic archipelago  km from Lisbon        Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading having        learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source After all        the waters of the Canary Islands only  km  miles to the south        had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century and        Genovese maps from the midth century depict both Madeira and Porto        Santo        More likely Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced        him onto the beach of Porto Santo If so then he was extremely        fortunate for he managed to land on the only large sandy beach for        hundreds of miles around Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto        Santo Holy Port        The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island        he had seen from Porto Santo and with him went Tristo Vaz Teixeira        and Bartolomeu Perestrelo They officially became the first men to set        foot on the heavily forested island naming it Ilha da Madeira Island        of Timber  The Portuguese Crown delighted with its first important        discovery immediately embarked on a program of colonization Zarco and        Teixeira were appointed cogovernors of Madeira while Perestrelo was        awarded Porto Santo        Starting from Scratch        Whoever first stepped ashore on Madeira discovered no signs        of previous habitationno StoneAge natives as the Spanish found on        the Canary Islands and no mysterious monuments to the past as on the        Balearics        Occupation of Madeira began in the early s as a        decidedly minimalist project colonists arrived with only as much as        they could carry from mainland Portugal They found plenty of water        pouring down from the mountains and more timber than anyone knew what        to do with So they set about clearing the land for agriculture        setting fire to massive tracts of forest Legend says that a great fire        burned for seven years on the island leveling it of all its trees The        fire provided the soil with a rich ash fertilizer which complemented        the luxuriant growing conditions of tropical sun and plentiful        water        The Portuguese saw valuable economic opportunity in their        new possession and ordered Malvasia grapes from Crete and sugar cane        from Italy in an effort to seed the islands first cash crops The        project was not a simple one Colonists had to locate enough level        ground to grow crops on and solve the issue of irrigating them Brute        strength without aid of machinery carved flat surfaces out of the        mountains and settlers built the terracesstill seen todayon the        steep slopes        The problem of watering crops was solved by the irrigation        system known as levadassimplydesigned water channels that wound        down from water sources on the verdant mountain tops The levadas were        largely built by slave laborers from Africa whose primary employment        was on sugar plantations New Madeirans traded sugar the eras        dominant luxury item with Britain and Flanders and they proved        skillful in the art of winemaking The islands burgeoning economic        significance propelled population growth and by the middle of the th        century Madeira was home to  families A  census recorded         inhabitants        In  Madeira welcomed a visitor who would greatly assist        the islands future wine trade Christopher Columbus not yet a sailor        of any renown sailed to Madeira on an assignment to buy sugar cane        His sojourn was unsuccessful as money failed to arrive for part of the        shipment Yet Columbus Columbo in Portuguese returned six years        later by which time evidence suggests that he had become an        experienced sugarcane merchant His later discovery of the New World        brought prosperity to the Madeiran economy the islands strategic        location on the great EastWest trading route meant that ships anchored        and took on food water and the valuable trading commodity of Madeira        wine        Columbus had his eye on more than sugar in Madeira He        married Dona Filipa Moniz Perestrelo the daughter of Porto Santos        first governor and lived on the island for a period fathering a son        there Even today there are those on Porto Santo who will tell you        that it was due to his time spent there that Christopher Columbus        learned navigation techniques and the ways of the ocean and found the        inspiration to undertake his voyage of         Invaders        In  Madeira suffered its worst disaster Well aware of        the islands burgeoning wealth and repository of supplies the French        pirate Bertrand de Montluc sailed into Funchal harbor with his        galleon armada and  men He unleashed a day reign of terror        that left  Madeirans dead stocks of sugar destroyed and the island        plundered By the time Lisbon mounted a rescue mission the pirates had        long fled though Montluc himself had been killed during the raid As        a result of the attack Porto Santo which had also been scourged by        these villains of the seas went on to build castles and early warning        systems which allowed the citizens to defend themselves or flee if        necessary On the mainland an invasion of even greater significance        followed in  when Philip II of Spain proclaimed himself king of        Portugal and marched his armies across the border The Spanish remained        for another  years and Madeira became a Spanish territory        In the th century Madeira surrendered its dominance of        the sugarcane industry to another much larger Portuguese colony        Brazil Sugar cane had taken a hefty toll on the Madeiran soil        exhausted plantations were supplanted by lessdemanding grape vines        Although sugarcane continues to be grown today for molasses and the        brandylike aguardente it has long ceased to be the islands major        crop        The British Are Coming        Britains political and economic connections to Madeira can        be traced to the th century In  Charles II married Portugals        Catherine of Bragana A provision written into the brides dowry        granted special favors to British settlers on Madeira had Charles been        more aggressive still perhaps the Portuguese would have agreed to hand        over the island to Britain in its entirety        Both Madeira and Britain benefited from a new regulation        that governed the shipment of Madeira wine and made it the only wine        that could be exported directly to the British possessions in the        Western hemisphere providing of course it was carried by a British        vessel All other wines had to be shipped to the Americas via a        British harbor Such trading rights attracted more Britons to the        island who founded dynastic families that in some cases still        constitute the islands economic elite Wine profits were huge and by         exports had reached nine million bottles per year Many of the        grand country quintas villas that still dot the island today have        their roots in the early Madeira wine industry        British troops arrived on the island in  to protect        against possible invasion by the French but they were withdrawn        following the Treaty of Amiens in  In  the Treaty was put in        jeopardy and the troops returned remaining until  Many of the        garrison remained and settled permanently on the island        War and Pestilence        The second half of the th century on Madeira was plagued        by natural disaster In  the islands precious vines were blighted        by mildew wiping out an estimated  percent of the total crop Just        four years later cholera claimed the lives of up to  Madeirans        and in  the dreaded disease phylloxera destroyed the remainder of        the vineyards Potato and sugar crops were also badly affected during        this period        Portugal took up arms during World War I siding with the        British and French Madeiras strategic position for Atlantic shipping        did not escape the notice of the German High Command and in December        of that year a German submarine bombarded the Funchal harbor and sank        three French ships        Modern Times        As mainland Portugal lurched into a political and economic        crisis that would bring down the countrys republican government many        miles away Madeira was busy looking after distinguished visitors and        its developing tourist trade In fact Madeira had been a soughtafter        destination since the middle of the th century attracting wealthy        British sunlovers minor royalty and aristocrats from many countries        The celebrated Reids Hotel had opened its doors in  and seaplane        service started operating from Lisbon in  Madeira was awarded        further cachet when the last of the AustroHungarian emperors Charles        I of Austria also Charles IV of Hungary chose Madeira as his home in        exile after the war        In  Portugal gained a new ruler and dictator        exMinister of Finance Dr Antnio Salazar Following a bloodless coup        in  called the Carnation Revolution Salazars successor Dr        Marcelo Caetano was overthrown and free elections were held Madeira        was then granted autonomy in addition to the right to determine its        own taxes and send a deputation to the Portuguese government        In  Portugal joined the European Economic Community        now the European Union or EU Funding from the EU has been heavily        invested in the islands infrastructure and fishing industry The        nonstop construction of roads and tunnels and the massive expansion of        the Funchal airport seem to indicate that Madeira plans to see the tiny        island accommodate as many people as possible For several decades        tourism has dominated the islands economy but Madeiras enduring        appeal lies in preserving it as a sublime tropical retreat far removed        from the rest of the world
