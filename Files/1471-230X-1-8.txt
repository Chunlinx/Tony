                    Background        Sulfasalazine SSZ is a widely used and highly        effective antiinflammatory agent in the treatment of        Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis       SSZ is        also being used with increasing frequency in the treatment        of various rheumatolgical disorders        SSZ is        preferred over other agents such as gold and penicillamine        in rheumatology patients due to its more favorable side        effect profile       Nonetheless rash fever and        dyspepsia occur in  to  of treated patients              These reactions are usually dose dependent and improve        with dose reduction or discontinuation      However        more serious but less common side effects have also been        reported           We now report a severe        systemic reaction to SSZ in a yearold female with        rheumatoid arthritis characterized by granulomatous        infiltration of the bone marrow colon and small bowel as        well as cholestatic hepatitis and seizures                    Case Report        A year old female was diagnosed with polyarticular        rheumatoid arthritis in  and was managed with naprosyn        Naproxen Roche Laboratories Nutley NJ for  years        Joint inflammation was well controlled with        hydroxychlorquine Plaquenil Sanofi Pharmaceuticals New        York NY from October  thru June  when        hydroxychlorquine was discontinued due to persistent anemia        and a flare in her arthritis despite adequate therapy The        patient was started on iron supplementation and a week        course of low dose prednisone in June July  Due to        persistent arthritis sulfasalazine was initiated on July          at a dose of  mg twice daily increasing to         mg twice daily Liver biochemistries were normal        immediately before and two weeks after initiating SSZ        Three weeks after starting SSZ the patient developed an        erythematous rash over the upper extremities and trunk that        improved with cetirizine Zyrtec Pfizer Inc New York        NY She then developed fatigue abdominal pain diarrhea        and night sweats which lead to hospitalization on         and SSZ was discontinued At presentation serum alkaline        phosphatase was  IUL AST  IUL ALT  IUL        bilirubin  mgdl and WBC was  kl with         eosinophils Over the next six days she gained  pounds        in fluid weight and had fevers of F despite broad        spectrum antibiotics She was transferred on hospital day          to the University of Michigan Medical Center for further        evaluation and management        The patient reported a prior history of infectious        mononucleosis at age  and was a nonsmoker and consumed        alcohol infrequently She denied any known drug allergies        or prior exposure to sulfa containing medications or        antibiotics There was no family history of allergy to        sulfa products        On hospital day  the patient appeared toxic with a        temperature of F pulse min and blood pressure of         Scleral icterus was present as well as deeply        jaundiced edematous skin with a macular erythematous        rash Nontender  cm lymph nodes were palpated in the        neck axilla and groin There were decreased breath sounds        with mild bibasilar rales and a hyperdynamic precordium        The abdomen was diffusely tender and distended Rectal        examination revealed brown hemoccult  stool Neurologic        examination was unremarkable        Laboratory studies revealed a WBC count of    L        with   bands  neutrophils  lymphocytes         monocytes and  eosinophils The WBC and absolute        neutrophil count nadired on hospital day   Table         Hemoglobin was  gdl platelets  reticulocyte        count  and serum ferritin  ng ml The serum alkaline        phosphatase was  IUL AST  IUL ALT  IUL total        bilirubin  mgdl albumin  total protein  gdl        and INR  Serum fibrinogen was  mgdl and ddimer        levels were elevated at  mcg ml Hepatitis A B        and C serologies and ANA and ANCA were negative CT scan of        the chest abdomen and pelvis revealed bilateral pleural        effusions splenomegaly and axillary paraaortic and        inguinal lymphadenopathy Stool         Clostridium difficile toxin B was        negative Because of her persistent diarrhea        hypoalbuminemia and anemia an upper endoscopy and        flexible sigmoidoscopy were performed on hospital day          to exclude a protein losing enteropathy Although both        studies were endoscopically normal histopathology of        random mucosal biopsies revealed characteristic features of        Crohns disease with granulomas in the colon and erosive        duodenitis with a single granuloma in the small bowel        Figure  Antigliadin and antiendomysial antibodies        were negative On hospital day   a bone marrow biopsy        revealed marked eosinophilia and multiple noncaseating        granulomas Flow cytometry of the bone marrow and        peripheral blood revealed no evidence of malignancy AFB        and fungal stains of the gastrointestinal and bone marrow        biopsies were negative as were cultures of the bone marrow         weeks later A PPD and candida control were both        nonreactive        Given the suspicion of a systemic drug reaction as the        etiology of her illness the patient was given high dose        intravenous steroids for three days starting on hospital        day   followed by a prednisone taper Within  hours        the patient had a rapid improvement of her diarrheal        symptoms followed by resolution of her peripheral edema and        lymphadenopathy There were also concomitant improvements        in her hematological and liver profiles Table  Figure         However the patient developed generalized absence        seizures on hospital day  Cerebrospinal fluid analysis        revealed an isolated increased WBC of  with a normal        protein level An MRI of the brain with gadolinium contrast        identified patchy and irregular signal enhancement in the        gray matter of the occipital poles frontoparietal regions        and cerebellar hemispheres The patient was started on        phenytoin and later changed to oxcarbazepine At  month        postdischarge the patient was markedly improved as her        steroid dose was tapered At  months postdischarge a        repeat upper and lower endoscopy with terminal ileum        intubation and random biopsies were normal At  months        after presentation off steroids the patient had completely        recovered with no evidence of residual hematological        gastrointestinal or neurological sequelae                    Discussion        Sulfasalazine is a widely used antiinflammatory agent        in the treatment of Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis              Recent data has demonstrated that SSZ is also        safe and effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis        and other rheumatological disorders      Sulfasalazine        is a dimer composed of aminosalicylic acid linked by an        azo bond to sulfapyridine The antiinflammatory activity        of SSZ is due to the aminosalicylic acid component while        the majority of the adverse side effects have been        attributed to the sulfapyridine moiety              Fever abdominal pain and rash may develop in  to  of        treated patients but these side effects are usually mild        and improve with dose reduction       Severe side        effects necessitating SSZ discontinuation occur in less        than  of treated patients            Our patient developed a severe systemic illness        following three weeks of SSZ therapy for rheumatoid        arthritis In retrospect her clinical presentation with        rash fever and lymphadenopathy within  weeks of        initiating treatment is consistent with severe SSZ toxicity            However in this case and others it can be        difficult to distinguish a severe drug reaction from other        disease processes such as infection and malignancy In our        patients case a concern of lymphoma was raised in light        of her underlying rheumatoid arthritis as well as prominent        lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly In addition a possible        opportunistic fungal mycobacterial or other atypical        infection was raised with the high fevers low grade DIC        and disseminated granulomas that persisted after SSZ        discontinuation Lastly Crohns disease or ulcerative        colitis with extraintestinal manifestations was a        possibility with her severe iron deficiency anemia        diarrhea and granulomatous enteritis It was only after        extensive evaluation that a preliminary diagnosis of SSZ        drug toxicity was made Occult inflammatory bowel disease        was not definitively excluded until followup endoscopy was        repeated  months later        This patients clinical presentation with multiorgan        involvement due to an immunoallergic reaction to SSZ has        not been previously reported The gastrointestinal mucosal        biopsies in this patient demonstrated multiple        noncaseating granulomas with prominent eosinophilia        suggestive of Crohns disease Figure  In addition the        patients bone marrow biopsy also demonstrated multiple        noncaseating granulomas and eosinophilia Although other        systemic illnesses such as untreated tuberculosis Q fever        fungal infections and lymphoma can lead to        gastrointestinal granuloma the acute nature of this        patients symptoms and rapid improvement with steroids make        these causes unlikely Furthermore special stains and        studies of the patients tissues revealed no evidence of        malignancy or infection To our knowledge only one other        case of a systemic granulomatous reaction to SSZ has been        reported which improved within  hours of SSZ        discontinuation     In other cases of granulomatous        drug reactions multiorgan involvement with fevers and        eosinophilia have been reported             Our patient had severe cholestatic hepatitis with        coagulopathy Although Stills disease can rarely lead to        hepatic involvement with cholestatic hepatitis the prior        history of rheumatoid factor seropositivity and a low serum        ferritin level made this diagnosis unlikely            Granulomatous hepatitis with marked elevations in serum        alkaline phosphatase and granulomas on liver biopsy have        been reported in patients with SSZ hepatotoxicity              Although liver tissue was not obtained in our        patient the predominance of serum alkaline phosphatase and        bilirubin level elevations and the presence of granulomas        in other tissues suggest that she probably had        granulomatous hepatitis The presumed mechanism of liver        injury in SSZ hepatotoxicity is an idiosyncratic        hypersensitivity response Both severe hepatitis and acute        liver failure have been attributed to SSZ               Patients with SSZ hepatotoxicity demonstrate a prompt        recurrence of symptoms upon rechallenge with SSZ or        sulfonamide        Susceptibility to the toxic        effects of SSZ and other sulfonamides may be due to the        interaction of metabolic pathways regulating Nacetylation        and specific detoxification of the metabolites of the drug             However it remains unclear if genetic        differences in drug metabolizing enzyme expression may        increase the risk of SSZ toxicity        Myelotoxicity in this patient was manifest by leukopenia        and neutropenia Table  SSZ has previously been        associated with neutropenia with an estimated incidence of         during the first  days of treatment     Bone        marrow biopsy specimens of patients with SSZ induced        agranulocytosis reveal a paucity of myeloid cells but full        recovery typically occurs within  days of drug        discontinuation       Although our patient had        adequate myeloid cells in her bone marrow biopsy she        developed absolute neutropenia by hospital day  that        improved with steroid therapy SSZ induced agranulocytosis        is believed to be mediated by immunological        hypersensitivity of myeloid precursors     Spontaneous        recovery from SSZ agranulocytosis is frequently seen        although fatalities have been reported and some patients        may benefit from granulocyte macrophagecolony stimulating        factor             A final clinical feature of SSZ toxicity in our patient        was the development of seizures Although this patient had        no known risk factors the onset of seizures began in        combination with other clinical manifestations of SSZ        toxicity Interestingly the MRI demonstrated diffuse gray        matter abnormalities Although central nervous system        vasculitis due to immune complex deposition or druginduced        lupus is a possible etiology of seizures in this patient        there was no evidence of immune complex deposition        elsewhere Another possibility is that this patient may        have developed CNS granulomas Seizures have previously        been reported in patients receiving SSZ often in the        setting of other clinical manifestations of toxicity              Although a brain biopsy would be needed to prove        our hypotheses there is a precedent for other systemic        granulomatous disorders such as sarcoidosis leading to CNS        granuloma formation and seizures      Fortunately        this patient has remained stable with no evidence of a        progressive neurological disorder  months after        presentation        Treatment of severe adverse drug reactions is primarily        supportive once a diagnosis has been established and the        offending agent has been discontinued However in this        patients case with her prominent features of a        hypersensitivity reaction and failure to improve after SSZ        discontinuation corticosteroids were administered to        hasten recovery Fortunately most of her clinical symptoms        promptly improved after steroids were begun The use of        steroids in the setting of SSZ toxicity is controversial        and not always effective In cases of fulminant hepatic        failure and agranulocytosis several patients have died        despite the use of steroids       Intravenous        immunoglobulin was reported as a successful rescue        therapy in a patient with SSZ induced fulminant hepatic        failure and erythroid hypoplasia who had not responded to        steroids     Due to the infrequent occurrence of        severe SSZ toxicity that does not improve with drug        discontinuation it is unlikely that randomized controlled        trials of steroids or other interventions will be        performed It appears reasonable to reserve steroids for        patients with severe systemic SSZ toxicity that fail to        respond to supportive care following drug        discontinuation                    Conclusions        Sulfasalazine is a commonly used and effective        medication in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease        and various rheumatologic disorders Side effects usually        develop within  months of treatment and are frequently        managed with dose adjustments However there is a subset        of patients who may develop severe and unusual systemic        side effects Although rheumatology patients may be at        increased risk of SSZ toxicity compared to IBD patients        there are no reliable laboratory or clinical predictors of        SSZ toxicity     Therefore practicing physicians        should be aware of the potential for severe unexplained        granulomatous reactions to SSZ that can mimic other        infectious malignant and autoimmune conditions Fever        rash and eosinophilia developing within  months of        initiating SSZ should alert the clinician to the        possibility of a drug reaction Patients with SSZ toxicity        should avoid exposure to all sulfonamide containing drugs        due to potential crossreactivity In addition some        inflammatory bowel disease patients have demonstrated        crossreactivity to ASA products     If severe        symptoms do not resolve with SSZ discontinuation a short        course of corticosteroids may be of benefit                    Competing interests        None declared
