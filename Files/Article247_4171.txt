                                 The Overblown BB Hype                        Even by the standards of this hyperactive stock market Fridays initialpublic offering for FreeMarkets was staggering The company had originallyplanned to go public at a price of  to  a share but by the time it cameto market the offering price had tripled to  a share That was still toolow though still impressive The first trade was at  a share and unlikethe way most IPOs trade FreeMarkets shares kept rising during the dayclosing at  a share The shares were down  today Ill take a guess andsay that was profittaking            FreeMarkets performance came as no surprise to anyone When investmentbanks triple the offering price on a stock its a good sign that the IPO isntgoing to crash and burn Thats not so much because of the company itselfwhich essentially runs online businesstobusiness auctions for corporationslike General Motors Rather its because investor appetite for Internetbusinesstobusiness BB stocks has suddenly become voracious BB is werebeing told the true wave of the future on the Web and so companies rangingfrom professional services firms to infrastructure providers to databasemanagers are now the darlings of the Street Mostin fact nearly allofthese companies remain unknown to just about everyone in America But over thepast few months you could have made a huge amount of money in stocks likeAkamai Ariba Sapient and Viant            There are as usual a host of studies by various research groups to justifythe swing in sentiment toward BB stocks There have to be because many ofthese companies are currently so tiny that estimating their present value onthe basis of their internal numbers alone would be futile FreeMarkets forinstance did  million in revenue last year but now has a marketcapitalization of  billion In any case these studies all show that theBB market for goods and services on the Web will soon dwarf the BCbusinesstoconsumer market One recent estimate cited by FreeMarkets in itsprospectus has the BB market growing from  billion this year to trillion in  If you can get even a tiny slice of  trillion thenyoure in great shape            The idea then is that within five years BC ecommercethat is what allthe investors piling into Amazoncom and eToys are hoping to capitalizeonwill be only a small part of the overall ecommerce market perhaps assmall as  percent This doesnt necessarily mean that etailers like Amazonare doomed as stocks that is But it does suggest that youd be better offlooking at BB stocks for the next true Internet titan            But there is one problem with this whole theory which is that the companiesthat are going to be doing all of the BB buying on the Web have to make themoney with which they pay for all their purchases somewhere And it cant justbe from selling to other businesses In other words at the end of the BBdaisy chain there have to be consumers On CNBC last week one analyst hypedBB by saying I paraphrase Think of all the parts that GM has to buy everyday just to keep its business going and multiply that by all the giantcompanies out there that have to buy parts But lets remember this GM spendsless on parts in a year than consumers spend on GM cars Thats by definitionOtherwise GM would go out of business In fact if you add up all the money GMand its suppliers spend on parts and databases and infrastructure its lessthan consumers spend on GM cars again by definition            In other words the hype surrounding BB has depended on the idea thatbusinesses that sell to other businesses are going to migrate to the Web whilebusinesses that sell to consumers are going to stay offline But while BBbusinesses will probably migrate more quickly and while obviously theres alot of business that will always be offline unless we figure out a way to geta virtual haircut its illogical that BB on the Web will explode while BCwill remain stagnant Especially when the former ultimately depends on thelatter The real message of the whole BB craze in fact may be that we shouldtake another look at companies like General Motors How much longer can it bebefore cars are actually being sold online instead of through the archaicdealer structure And when that happens imagine how much better GMs businesswill be
