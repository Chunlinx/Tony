                    Background        The cullinRING family of ubiquitin ligases comprises a        multifunctional set of enzymes controlling the stability        and activity of cell cycle regulators transcription        factors and signaling proteins reviewed in ref          Among the best studied examples of cullinRING enzymes are        the socalled SCF complexes SCF complexes share homologues        of the core components cullin  CUL SKP and the RING        domain protein HRTRBXROC which associate with        different Fbox proteins and ubiquitinconjugating enzymes          Fbox proteins specifically bind substrates        following their phosphorylation in response to activation        of various signaling pathways Although substrate        phosphorylation is one major determinant of SCFmediated        ubiquitylation   covalent modification of the CUL        subunit through attachment of the ubiquitinrelated peptide        NEDD also regulates SCF activity NEDD modification        stimulates SCFdependent substrate ubiquitylation         in vitro     and mutant CUL        resistant to NEDD modification is defective         in vivo   In addition fission        yeast mutants deficient in the enzymes that attach Nedp        or in the         ned gene itself are inviable                 In addition to CUL the human genome contains at least        five other cullins CUL   A B and  This diversity        is partially recapitulated in         S pombe  which encodes         pcu and         pcu  homologues of human CUL and        CUL for which there are no direct correlates in budding        yeast   All human cullins interact with HRTRBXROC          are modified by NEDD   and have ubiquitin ligase        activity         in vitro   Similarly the fission        yeast cullins Pcup and Pcup are neddylated and        neddylation is critical for their function         in vivo           While it is clear that neddylation affects the activity        of cullinRING complexes mechanisms controlling this        modification are just emerging A recent study by Lyapina         et al uncovered a novel connection        between the COPsignalosome CSN and cullin neddylation          CSN is a highly conserved multiprotein complex        consisting of eight subunits which have been implicated in        a wide variety of regulatory processes including cell        cycle control    signal transduction          transcriptional activation   and plant        photomorphogenesis    To date no distinct        biochemical activity has been identified that can reconcile        this diversity in CSN functions The eight CSN subunits        show a onetoone relationship to components of the S        proteasome lid complex     and like         pcu and         pcu  at least seven of the eight        human subunits are conserved in fission yeast but not in        budding yeast           Lyapina         et al recently showed that        disruption of         S pombe CSN subunit           caacsn  results in accumulation        of Pcup in the neddylated state   However it        remained unclear whether this reflects global control of        multiple cullins by Csnp as part of the entire CSN        complex We have examined this question by determining the        effect of disruption of several CSN subunits on Pcup        neddylation localization and ubiquitin ligase activity        Our results indicate that the entire CSN complex is        required for proper control of the neddylation state of        multiple cullins                    Results                  Pcup is modified by Nedp          Immunoblotting of protein lysates prepared from           S pombe cells whose           pcu chromosomal locus was modified          to encode Pcup with thirteen copies of the Myc epitope          attached to its Cterminus revealed two distinct species          of Pcup which migrated on SDS gels as two closely          spaced species of roughly equal abundance Fig A          Several findings indicate that the slower migrating form          of Pcup arose from covalent modification with the          ubiquitinrelated protein Nedp First overexpression of          a fusion protein of Nedp and glutathione transferase          GSTNedp converted the faster unmodified form of          Pcup into a high molecular weight species that reacted          with antibodies to GST Fig A Second replacing          lysine  which is homologous to the conserved          neddylation sites in other cullins with arginine          completely abolished the slower migrating modified form          of Pcup Fig B In contrast mutation of a          neighboring conserved lysine residue  did not alter          the mobility of Pcup Thus as with other           S pombe cullins   Pcup          undergoes covalent modification by ubiquitinlike Nedp          at lysine                           Multiple csnmutants accumulate neddylated          Pcup          Interestingly fission yeast           caacsn deletion mutants show a          set of defects which partially overlaps that found in           pcu disruptants slow growth cell          elongation and sensitivity to UVirradiation but not          hydroxyurea    With respect to the recent          implication of CSN in cullin regulation   we          considered the possibility that the overlapping          phenotypes of           csn and           pcu mutants could arise from          interference with Pcup function          Initial support for this hypothesis was provided by          the observation that disruption of           csn led to accumulation of Pcup          in the slower migrating form Fig A This shift in          migration is due to Pcup neddylation as shown by          overexpression of GSTNedp in           csn mutants This caused an          additional supershift converting a substantial portion          of the slower migrating form into a GSTNedp modified          species Fig B Importantly accumulation of          neddylated Pcup was also apparent in strains deleted for                    csn            csn  and           csn Fig A three genes          encoding other putative subunits of the           S pombe CSN which cofractionate          with Csnp upon size exclusion chromatography see below          Fig  However unlike           csn disruptants which have a          defect in S phase control resulting in slow growth and          cell elongation   deletion of           csn            csn  and           csn genes did not cause cell          elongation S phase delay or any other obvious growth          defects Fig C D data not shown This indicates          that the described phenotype of           csn mutants   is unlikely to          be a consequence of interference with Pcup activity          Pcup another fission yeast cullin also accumulated in          the neddylated form in all           csn mutants   Fig A          suggesting that CSN has a general role in the control of          cullin neddylation in fission yeast The accumulation of          neddylated Pcup was prevented in all           csn mutants by providing the          missing CSN subunit on a plasmid Fig                           The conserved cysteine box in Csnp is not          required for Pcup deneddylation          Lyapina           et al recently demonstrated that          partially purified CSN promotes the cleavage of          PcupNedp conjugates           in vitro   but it remained          unclear whether the enzymatic activity is contained          within one of the CSN subunits or a tightly associated          peptidase All peptidases known to cleave ubiquitin or          SUMOprotein conjugates are cysteinebased proteases          reviewed in ref   Csnp contains a motif closely          resembling the conserved cysteine box previously          recognized in the catalytic center of deubiquitylating          enzymes and in the budding yeast proteasome subunit          Rpnp   The complementation assay shown in Fig          allowed us to determine the potential role of this motif          in the control of Pcup neddylation by replacing the          critical cysteine residue with alanine This mutant Csnp          retained full activity for preventing Pcup and Pcup          hyperneddylation Fig Alanes  and data not          shown                          Pcup interacts with CSN          We next determined whether the effect of CSN          deficiency on Pcup neddylation reflects a physical          interaction of these proteins Size exclusion          chromatography of lysates prepared from cells harboring          epitopetagged Pcup or CSN subunits at the endogenous          genomic loci revealed precise coelution of Pcup with          CSN subunits    and  in high molecular weight          fractions corresponding to approximately  kDa Fig          A Interestingly Csnp unlike the other CSN subunits          showed a second peak in gel filtration eluting with an          approximate molecular weight of  kDa suggesting that          Csnp may also be involved in protein complexes separate          from the entire CSN Fig B          Based on the coelution of Pcup with CSN subunits in          gel filtration we determined whether Pcup and Csnp          interact           in vivo at endogenous expression          levels PcuMyc immunoprecipitated from lysates of cells          expressing HAtagged Csnp together with PcupMyc from          the endogenous promoters revealed coprecipitation of          CsnpHA This interaction was specific as it was not          observed with an irrelevant antibody Fig Cleft panel          or with lysate from a strain containing untagged Pcup          Fig C right panel In contrast immunoprecipitation          with HA antibodies failed to precipitate both CsnpHA          and PcupMyc potentially due to inaccessibility of the          Cterminal HA tag of Csnp within the CSN complex data          not shown          We therefore generated PcupMyc containing strains          overexpressing Nterminally xhistidineMyctagged Csnp          Csnp Csnp or Csnp Binding of each of the four          different CSN subunits to nickel beads resulted in          copurification of Pcup indicative of specific           in vivo interactions Fig C          Notably both modified and unmodified Pcup interacted          with CSN subunits Fig C We conclude that at least a          fraction of Pcup forms a stable complex with CSN           in vivo                           Pcup localization in csnmutants          In           A thaliana  CSN was shown to be          required for the efficient nuclear accumulation of the          putative RINGtype ubiquitin ligase COP   which          mediates ubiquitindependent degradation of the          photomorphogenic transcription factor HY   We          therefore considered the possibility that accumulation of          neddylated Pcup in           csn mutants is a consequence of          defective subcellular targeting Indirect          immunofluorescence staining indicated that endogenous          Myctagged Pcup is present in the cytoplasm but          enriched in the nucleus of wildtype cells Fig  This          localization pattern was fully preserved in all four           csn mutants indicating that CSN          does not regulate the subcellular localization of          Pcup                          Mutation of CSN increases Pcupdependent          polyubiquitylation activity          All human cullins have been shown to assemble into          complexes possessing polyubiquitylation activity           in vitro    To determine          whether Pcup is associated with such an activity and how          it is affected by CSN we developed a          substrateindependent           in vitro polyubiquitylation assay          similar to that originally reported by Lyapina et al            As Pcupassociated ubiquitin ligase activity was          not described before we first needed to determine which          of the fourteen different ubiquitinconjugating enzymes          UBCs present in the fission yeast genome associate with          the RING domain protein Pipp an essential cofactor of          cullin ubiquitin ligases      Binding assays          showed that overexpressed HAtagged Pipp specifically          associated with cooverexpressed xHisMyctagged Ubcp          Ubcp Ubcp Ubcp Ubcp Ubcp and Mmsp In the          next step we confirmed by immunoprecipitation that          both forms of PcupMyc bound endogenous Pipp in a          CSNindependent manner Fig B          PcupMyc complexes prepared by immunoprecipitation          with Myc antibodies were then incubated with human E          ATP ubiquitin and the recombinant UBCs that interacted          with Pipp Polyubiquitylated species were visualized by          antiubiquitin blot PcupMyc complexes isolated from           pcumyc cells did not show any          recognizable polyubiquitylation activity above background          with any of the seven UBCs tested Fig C lane  and          data not shown In contrast the ubiquitylation assay          with PcupMyc complexes purified from           csn mutants led to efficient          formation of high molecular weight species reactive with          ubiquitin antibodies Fig C This activity was          specific for Ubcp Fig C compare lanes             Appearance of multiubiquitin chains was inhibited by          mutant ubiquitin lacking all lysines indicating that          they were specifically generated in the reaction rather          than coprecipitated with PcupMyc Fig D Thus CSN          deficiency appears to stimulate Pcupassociated          ubiquitin ligase activity           in vitro  A similar stimulation          was obtained for substratespecific polyubiquitylation of          phosphorylated Rump by SCF Poppurified from           csn mutants unpublished          observation                            Discussion        Our data confirm and extend the recently discovered        connection between CSN and cullin regulation   by        showing that deletion of four putative CSN subunits causes        accumulation of Pcup in the neddylated state Fig A        Coelution of these four proteins in a  kDa complex        Fig B strongly suggests that they represent part of the                S pombe equivalent of the eight        subunit CSN complex found in higher eukaryotes            Thus cullin regulation through modulation of the        balance of Nedp modification appears to require the entire        CSN complex        Our study also provides some insight into the role of        deneddylation in cullin function as we were able to create        a situation in which Pcup and Pcup are fully neddylated         in vivo ref   and data presented        here Deletion of         pcu and         pcu results either in lethality or        in severe growth retardation respectively   The normal        growth behavior of         csn            and          mutants Fig C D where both        cullins seem constitutively neddylated argues against a        critical role for dynamic cycles of neddylation and        deneddylation in cullin function in fission yeast        Consistent with this notion the subcellular localization        of Pcup and Pcup were unaffected by mutations in CSN        Fig    Instead neddylated Pcup and Pcup        purified from         csn mutant cell extract exhibit        increased ubiquitin ligase activity         in vitro Fig B   Thus CSN        may exert negative control on Pcup and Pcup by promoting        their deneddylation However while mutation of         csn caused a modest twofold        increase in the steady state fraction of neddylated Pcup        Fig A Pcupassociated ubiquitin ligase activity        recovered from this mutant showed a much more dramatic        increase Fig C This suggests the possibility that CSN        represses Pcup activity by other mechanisms in addition        to its control of neddylation Further experiments are        required to determine whether recombinant Csnp or purified        CSN complex can inhibit Pcupassociated ubiquitin ligase        activity        Lyapina         et al recently provided evidence for        a cullin deneddylating activity of CSN by demonstrating        that a partially purified preparation of the pig CSN can        deneddylate the fission yeast cullin Pcup         in vitro   The results presented        here eliminate the attractive hypothesis that the cysteine        box in Csnp which is conserved in numerous        deubiquitylating enzymes   harbors a critical activity        for deneddylation Fig A In addition recombinant Csnp        failed to deneddylate Pcup and Pcup         in vitro unpublished observation        Our finding that hyperneddylated Pcup and Pcup accumulate        in all         csn mutants tested Fig A and data        not shown also suggests that control of cullin        neddylation results from cooperation of multiple CSN        components rather than from the activity of a single        catalytic subunit The CSN complex may for example serve        as a platform for recruitment of a separate deneddylating        enzyme A human NEDDprocessing isopeptidase has been        described previously   The potential role of CSN as an        organizing center for certain enzymatic activities may not        be restricted to the control of cullin neddylation as CSN        was also shown to mediate phosphorylation of cJUN IkBa        and p by a tightly associated kinases           So far we were unable to obtain deneddylation of        PcupMyc         in vitro by partially purified CSN        preparations active in deneddylation of PcupMyc data        not shown We can therefore not exclude that CSNs role in        the control of Pcup neddylation differs from its role        established for Pcup   For example binding by CSN        could protect Pcup from the Nedpconjugating enzyme        Ubcp thus maintaining a fraction of Pcup in a        deneddylated state As this shield is experimentally        removed through deletion of CSN subunits Pcup may        accumulate in the neddylated state In such a scenario no        enzymatic activity of purified CSN toward neddylated Pcup        would be expected         in vitro         Finally our data suggest CSN functions in addition to        cullin regulation that are not shared by all individual        subunits Out of the four mutants tested only         csn showed the previously described        defect in S phase progression   Fig C D thereby        underscoring the significance of our finding that all CSN        subunits tested here are involved in cullin regulation It        is likely that some subunits have very specialized        functions within the complex while others are required for        its broader activities such as control of cullin        neddylation On the other hand we found that a sizable        fraction of Csnp is dissociated from the putative CSN        holocomplex but enriched in a  kDa assembly Fig B        It thus appears that part of the diversification of CSN        function may arise from formation of smaller        subcomplexes                    Conclusions        Our study reveals a general role of the         S pombe CSN complex in the control        of cullin modification by Nedp Regardless of the exact        mechanism CSN may regulate the activity of multiple cullin        ubiquitin ligases through counteracting their stimulatory        Nedp modification Future studies will reveal whether some        of the other described functions of CSN also involve        posttranslational modification of regulatory proteins by        ubiquitinlike modifiers                    Materials and methods
