                                 SmallBiz Blarney            Everybody knows that smallbusiness creates all the jobs Why only last week during the vicepresidentialdebate Jack Kemp argued with evangelical passion for a smallbusinesscapitalgains cut to grow the economy faster How about the small businessmenand women of America that create  percent of all the new jobs he asked Afew weeks earlier during the minimumwage debate in which small business wasonce again singled out for favored tax treatment virtually every opponentargued that raising the minimum wage could hurt small businesseswhich createmost of Americas jobs            This mantra is repeated sooften that everybody believes it But everybody is wrong            What doesit take to kill a bad statistic More than a Nobel laureate apparently MiltonFriedman a conservative economist and proponent of freemarket solutionspointed out in a recent Journal of Economic Literature article that themyth of small businesses jobcreating potency is one of the most durablefalsehoods of Americas political economy Numerous other economistsand eventhe occasional columnisthave tried to debunk the myth but to no avail            For example in his paper titled On the Size Distributionof Employment and Establishments Jonathan Leonard finds that large firms arethe main job generators Three Census Bureau fellows S Davis J Haltiwangerand S Schuh recently published a report titled Small Business and JobCreation Dissecting the Myth and Reassessing the Facts in which they assertflatly Conventional wisdom about the jobcreation prowess of small businessrests on statistical fallacies and misleading interpretations of the data            Magazinesand newspapers have recently run articles like Debunking the Small BusinessMyth Small Is Not Beautiful Doing the Small Business Shuffle and TheReal Engine of US Economic Growth Might Be Bigger Than Any Believe all ofwhich have declared the smallbusiness lobbys claim phony                           Where theBad Data Come From                        Not only politicians butnewspaper reporters continue to perpetuate the smallbusiness fallacy usuallywithout challenge Take an article in the Los                Angeles               Times on July  which referred to  percent of all jobs since being created by businesses with fewer than four employees Where do thesenumbers come from The Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administrationwill gladly supply you with a table that might appear at first glance to lendsupport to such claims see Figure             Lookacross the second row for example which seems to tell you that firms with noemployees in  netted an astounding  jobs by                            Figure

                                  Firms with noemployees but some payroll expenses in                         Add in thejobs created by firms with one to  employees in  the next five rowsand you would compute that small businesses defined by SBA as having fewerthan  employees added all but  of the total  million net jobsgained by the economy over that period            Well whats the matter with that The matterof course is that the rows broken out by initial firm size tell only part ofthe storythe happy part What SBA doesnt make clear in the table it handsout though it will tell you if you persist is that the firmsize rows onlyinclude those firms that made itie those that stayed continuously inbusiness throughout the period                        And ofcourse it is a fact of Americas dynamic marketplace that while manyfirmsespecially small firmsopen for business every year and hire newworkers almost as many close their doors sending their workers onto theunemployment rolls Overcounting gains and undercounting losses in this andother ways is what produces the grossly exaggerated picture of small businessscontribution to the US economy Economists call the SBAs technique ofsorting firms by class size in a dynamic situation the regression fallacyFor a simple example of why it produces a misleading result click                            A Quick Fix

changesmostly net losses in job counts produced by firms that either opened orclosed during the period Looking down at the nowcomplete bottomrow totalsyou will get quite a different picture of where the net new jobs are By thiscalculation some  or almost  percent of the jobs still around in were added by firms with more than  employees in that yearie bybig business            Classifying firms by their endrather than startsize might also seem unfairsince some very successful small companies may end up big by the close of theperiod and vice versa We need a more dynamic model to get a real sense ofwhats going on                           Going With the Flow                        Getting agood fix on this phenomenon isnt easy because most government data arecollected to measure monthly employment changes and there are no current dataavailable on gross job flows by business size As a senior economist at SBAhowever I was able to specify the preparation of special tabulations by theCensus Bureau from business payroll tax reports for the entire private nonfarmeconomy These tabulations make it possible for the first time to study jobflows for the same firms as they migrate from one employment size classto another            Thesestatistics never released by SBA and published here for the firsttime tell a fascinating story of job creation and destruction Forexample the number of firms with employees increased by  in the periodbetween  and  This end result however was produced by some firm births a firm reporting no payroll in  but some payroll in which were offset by  firm deaths            Looking at job flows by firm size see Figure  we seethat firms that remained small including those that entered or went out ofbusiness lost  jobs during this recession period                           Figure                                        JobGeneration by Size of Firm in  and                         Numbers of Jobs inThousands            xxxxxxx             Net jobscreated

essentially offset by employment losses of firms that were large andbecame small But on net there was a job gain of  forboundarycrossing firms At the same time large businesses again includingthose that opened or closed added  to their payrolls Subtracting thesmallbusiness losses from the bigbusiness gains gives us a net total of jobs added to the entire economy during this period The analysis thusconfirms what earlier studies had suggested Big business not small businessis the primary generator of US jobs            Predictably SBAs counts show a totally different and false picture seebottom of Figure  By using the beginningyear counting rule SBA reportsthat small business generated  or  percent of the jobs If theendyear counting rule is used small business destroyed  jobs Neitherstatistic is reflective of the jobgeneration process they measure onlyeconomic volatility            Of course the period between  and  was one ofrecession However Census Bureau counts show that during the phase of rapidgrowth between  to  an equal number of firms in each size classreported job gains as losses This same result held true in the period from to  demonstrating again that irrespective of businesscycleconditions the probability that a firm will add or lay off workers isindependent of its size Analysis of the SBA netchange data for theexpansionary period between  and  also reveals that small businessescreated jobs in proportion to their numbersno more and no less            A simple economic explanationaccounts for these observations Firms are constantly competing with eachother Both small and large businesses expand when there is a demand for theirgoods and services that they can meet efficiently All the economic researchsuggests that there is no difference in the efficiency of small and large firmsonce a firm grows beyond a minimum size It is for this reason that CensusBureau data for the last  years show no evidence of any change in theemployment size distribution of firms and establishments            All this might not matter ifthe smallbusiness fallacy were not used by its promoters as justification forcarving exemptions and preferences for small business into virtually everypiece of economic legislation that passes Congress As the editor of thismagazine wrote in the Washington                Post in August  Smallbusiness is an important part of the American economy Most smallbusinessowners are admirable hardworking patriotic But the case for tilting publicpolicy in favor of small business is based on logical fallacies andlobbyists hokum
