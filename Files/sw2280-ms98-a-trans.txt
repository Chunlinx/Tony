        okay well uh i guess uh youre pretty aware that its uh been uh a little warm for this time of year   oh yeah   it uh the humiditys a little higher   it is this is muggy today like it wants to rain but it dont know what it wants to you know for this time of year   uhhuh you know about a month from now this wouldnt be so bad but uh boy for the end of March this is uh this is funny   no really bad yeah funny weather but bad because that means it either means one or two things its going to be a bad summer  or a not too good summer and a worse winter next year   oh jeez         well thats a good way to look at it   i always do that i got to do something like that with the weather   well if you do that then youll only be pleasantly surprised probably if its anything but that   thats right   thats uh thats uh but uh i i guess the winter the winter wasnt that bad down here really   no see thats it was a mild winter thats why i keep saying oh no      yeah looking looking forward to a really bad summer and hot summer   yeah i think its going to be really hot this year   well hopefully you know if its humid now maybe itll i remember last year it rained an awful lot or uh you know for the last couple of years its rained an awful lot and maybe thatll help to defeat some of the heat   yeah umhum   and if uh if it rains a lot but uh but uh   if it rains if it rains any more and gets really hot then we have this problem with mosquitoes   oh yeah youre right yeah yeah i used to live in up north up in the upper midwest and uh   see   and we had had mosquito mosquito problems thats for sure   well see i would prefer the cold im from southern California   oh really   but see the heat out here  aint nothing   well you know its its that easy to say but boy when its forty below and youre shoveling snow and its forty below its uh   no i dont want to get that cold now   it uh  thats just the bad thing you either you either have to take the take this kind of weather or uh or take the really really cold weather     i dont think no i dont want to go no where up north no where   does it go in any any where north of the Red River   huhuh i dont even want to go anywhere yeah thats about it   thats uh i thats what ive heard people say is theyll never go north of the Red River again     thats right its too cold up there   umhum   and then last year thats when they really had that cold spell   umhum   you know it was like um record breaking below temperatures and stuff in Alaska where your gas your car was freezing while it was running you know the gas oil or the gas would turn to slush huhuh see i cant handle that           yeah i i know what you mean because uh because you got to have like little oil heaters where they plug in the uh plug in uh your car   umhum yeah   and uh thats not good thats not good at all and uh   no something happens then what   well i guess the only thing to do is to hope that this is the worse that it gets this year   yeah its not that bad right now i just hope it dont get any worse   yeah or if it if it does get worse it doesnt stay for very long   thats about it im just waiting because see its tornado season   oh thats right thats right because   yes it is its tornado season   already already hit Oklahoma and probably right down here soon so   umhum you see this is this is tornado weather boy people dont know it but when it gets hot like this   yeah   and you know like theyre predicting the weather to be cold well when it gets cold real fast   umhum umhum get a northerner through here   theres your tornados thats right and so theyre predicting this weekend probably drop something like thirty degrees i say huhuh see that aint right   thats right no no       no its uh   but thats thats tornado season   yeah and i guess i guess thats shows what they say about Dallas if you dont like the weather just just wait a day yeah itll change on you   wait a while itll change thats right thats about like it is too because yesterday was really nice   umhum uhhuh   and the wind was blowing but today is muggy but the wind is still blowing but you know i dont know the weather   well anyway i guess thats about all i got to say about the uh the weather   thats about it thats about all you can say about the weather   okay talk about it but cant do anything about it uh okay     thats right all righty thank you byebye   all right byebye
