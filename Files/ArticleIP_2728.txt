occasion Zercher says she pushedopen an unlocked lavatory door to find Clinton standing there unzipped Shesays he said to her Well why dont you come in and shut the door Thenthere was the time he saw the flight attendants reading Gennifer Flowersinterview in Penthouse  Zercher says Clinton kept asking them what thebest part was Schiff finally said that it was Flowers comment that he wasgood at giving oral sex Thats pretty accurate Zercher recalls him sayingIts one of my favorite things            He alsotold them that one thing he was afraid of reporters uncovering was a storyabout a couple who were friends of his They were getting divorced because thewife found the husband cheating on her with barnyard animals Zercher recallsher reaction My God can you imagine if he becomes president that we weresitting here talking about farm animalsand hes the one that brought itup            Finally theres the orange incident Clinton got a fruitbasket that contained an orange that was in Zerchers words shrivelled anddeformedit looked like a womans sexual organ Clinton brought it to thegalley to show the flight attendants He said Im going to keep this This isso great because I havent been getting any of this lately He carried itaround and flashed it at Zercher for the next two weeks until someone finallyhad to take the deformed orange away from the future leader of the freeworld            This isnt the first timeZerchers name has surfaced In a  Washington Post story she saysthat after being contacted by reporter Michael Isikoff who wanted to knowabout events on the Clinton

herexperiences Its become a pattern in reports of Clintons sexual advances thatfriends of the women in question confirm the advance but often say it wasntunwelcome Sure enough a Zercher friend tells the New York Daily Newsthat Zercher who is now an executive assistant in New Jersey told her severalyears ago that Clinton groped her and grabbed her breasts But instead offinding his behavior humiliating as she now tells the Star was thecase the friend says she laughed it off            Schiff hasalso appeared recently in the tabs The Star has an account fromClintons former chief White House steward Mike McGrathwho has testifiedbefore the grand jury investigating the current White House scandalabout theSaturday that Schiff locked him in the pantry off the Oval Office andreportedly

nottrue McGrath also solves the mystery of the account of the stained Kleenexreportedly found by another steward Bayani Nelvis McGrath says Nelvis toldhim he saw Monica Lewinsky emerge from the presidents study looking shakyand in shock in late  Like some of the other women who reportedly emergefrom the study her hair was mussed and her clothes askew After she leftNelvis told McGrath he went into the study where he found towels smeared withlipstick on the floor            In the world of the tabloids Clintonsexploits are just an appetizer for someone whose sex life they really careabout Titanic star DiCaprio who has obviously chosen Clinton as a rolemodel and who at only  has a good chance of surpassing the presidentsaccomplishments According to the Globe  after he sorrowfully bid adieuat the airport to his latest love singer Alanis Morissette he began chattingup a blonde waiting to get on the same plane He has been on a dateadayspree for almost a year friends tell the publication Though DiCaprio hasgone out with a string of models and actresses including Liv Tyler ClaireDanes Juliette Lewis and Kate Moss a friend says he is no snob and that awoman doesnt have to be famous to merit his advances Leos motto is Somany girls so little time  In this too DiCaprio is like his mentorClinton The Star s story on the depositions of the Arkansas statetroopers who acted as Clintons bodyguards says of his liaisons Some wereongoing affairs others just stands of one night or even one hour The womennamed included aides wives of major supporters executives reporters beautyqueens barflies and even a judge            TheWright brothers probably never anticipated their contribution to priapism butlike Clinton DiCaprio is also an advocate of airborne sex For one womanaccording to the Globe  he hired a jet He served her champagne withfresh strawberries and ice cream and they made love while looking at thestars The publication does not mention if any oranges were involved            And both DiCaprio and Clinton have found themselves in afew cockups over their sexual escapades This week the Enquirer reportsthat while in Cuba DiCaprio ran into model Naomi Campbell and the two swamnaked at a Havana hotel But Campbell became outraged when she found outDiCaprio was simultaneously dating an yearold Cuban model Later howeverDiCaprio and Campbell were seen together in Paris and London although theNew York Post quotes a Campbell representative who says the two are justgood friends            There isyet another DiCaprio love triangle the Star reports this weekAccording to the publication DiCaprio was smitten with actress ElizabethBerkley but in a strange Cyranolike move he had a friend conduct a phoneromance for him During one phone call Berkleys boyfriend picked up thereceiver and became furious DiCaprios friend told the boyfriend to meet himin front of the New York hotel where DiCaprio and his pals were staying Abrawl ensued although DiCaprio emerged from the hotel bar only after thefight to smoke a cigarette As for the black eye DiCaprio is now sporting theGlobe reports that the actor was accidentally hit by a mens room doorat another New York bar            All these high jinks have the Globeworried that DiCaprio could end up with the same medical condition for whichthe Star says Clinton is receiving treatment Clinton has secretlybegun therapy for sexual addiction in a bid to save his presidency thepublication reports According to the Globe  DiCaprio is still only asex addict in training To avoid this fate a pal warns the actor needs tosettle down and find out what real love is all about            No one is worrying about thefate of talk show host Jerry Springer The Star labels his lines asdumb and dumber in an account of how he tried to pick up a Los Angeleslovely with an offer to fly her to Chicago and give her tickets to his showI burst out laughinghe just looked so desperate the woman says Springerdoes have one thing in common with Clinton He likes to use staffers toapproach women for him The Star reports that Clinton while governorwould spot women in the audience while he was speaking According to onetrooper he would then say The lady in the red dress the lady in the greendress  would you go get me her name and phone number She has thatcomehither look Springers approach is similar says the publication Hepeeks at the audience before the show to pick out pretty girls then sends crewmembers to get their phone numbers says an exstaffer            Perhaps no ones openingline is lamer than Frank Giffords Youre as pretty as my wife was hispathetic yet successful approach with Suzen Johnson the former flightattendant with whom the Globe taped him having sex Perhaps the lessonhere is that guys with sex problems should take Amtrak But now theEnquirer reports theres hope for men who stray in even the most publicways After being wooed back for almost a year Giffords wife and talk showhostess Kathie Lee has told a friend she forgives him At first I thought Iddie But now Ive come to love Frank more than ever Kathie Lee told thefriend who told the Enquirer  And I know our love
