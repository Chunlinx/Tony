                uh i mean i guess i get it most people i get it from uh the paper and the TV and   okay   i guess probably now the TV first the paper second and radio third   yeah same here uh i hardly ever listen to news on the radio i dont even know if they have it anymore   yeah i was just kind of think of the order you know but uh   yeah what do you think about uh you know the second part of that question was are they doing a good job im beginning to think you know especially this week with all that stuff coming out about Clinton uh   yeah yeah i think its uh i dont know i mean       its getting a little bit ridiculous i mean this this i dont know if you saw it yesterday but uh where i was at had it on CNN and uh they had that press conference with that uh Jennifer Flowers uh Clintons alleged uh mistress whatever and uh it just got to be so i mean its ridiculous because you know one of the questions was uh do did uh Clinton use a condom and all that i mean it was uh uh the whole press corp was just laughing   yeah i i got a feeling that you know cause from from what you know i got most of my information from the Larry King show and uh it was like nobodys verified her story at all and it just came from the tabloids and everybody jumped on to it   right   without and nobodys been able to verify that shes telling the truth all the only thing they know is that she lied about everything else   yeah i think i mean he probably did it i mean thats my belief i just think that you know if he did it  you know he should have said so on Sixty Minutes and cause i mean American public is pretty forgiving and most times yeah if you do something i mean what else can you say how can you   would you go on national television and and uh tell the world that youd had an affair and you know and your wife and her parents are listening and   well now with   that would be kind of rough to do   yeah but i mean the fact is now that hes left himself the fact that he wouldnt deny it or confirm it was hes just left himself open to further digging from other reporters now you know theres all types of rumors now that   yeah   Miss uh America Miss Arkansas all the way down to Miss Teen Arkansas well allegedly had a thing with him i mean its just going to keep dogging him i i think hes going to be out of the race in two weeks just because this is going to keep getting the fact that he wont confirm or deny i mean i mean he hes this has been going on for years though i mean hes always had rumors and stuff and   yeah i thought we were kind of through with this a few years ago when Gary Hart uh got caught messing around and i thought we would kind of leave private lives out of this the politics but uh   yeah and he no its just i know its just i think  is just the fact that he uh he just flat out lied to the public that he didnt and it was totally proven wrong and then he challenged you know the press to you know prove it and they did and thats what killed him and Clinton on the other hand if he if he   yeah yeah were waiting   i mean he took a big risk just even going on TV the other night with his wife but i think his wife came off better than he did but   yeah   in the end i think hes just going to his people now are you know the the fund the campaign you know theyre going to wait and see what happens and you know when he keeps more stuff more stuff keeps coming out about him and then i think hell be out uh you know hell be out of the race eventually because the money is what uh  the only thing that matters in the end and if he doesnt have any money theres not   yeah well when i heard i guess it was yesterday i heard that shed gotten in excess over a hundred thousand dollars to talk to the this tabloid thing   oh yeah she shes a bimbo i mean you know   i thought well golly gee shes got to be lying id say i slept with him for a hundred thousand bucks you know maybe  but   the   yeah but i dont know i mean its just the press is always going to be like that i think and you know i mean Americans most i think that most people in America know   well   i mean my people my age you know probably probably really dont care i mean what they i really dont you know care what they do as long as it doesnt   yeah why has the press gone overboard in telling us things and   but when the press says that you know some its its important its got to be important because i mean they control i mean whats said and everything yeah i think its i mean yeah i think its totally gone overboard and i mean its  issues and everything and the timing of this can can be more worse for him but he hes clearly the front runner now hes about to get blown out of the water at this time   well if if if if somehow he clears himself from this he is all of a sudden jumped out in front because everybody knows his name and and knows where hes from and knows what he looks like and im not sure everybody knows all the other people at all   yeah uh i mean he he he had i mean he had the thing won but now i mean   that are   i i just dont think hell be around i mean this this if you go by past history and you know hes hes dodging the subject now you know he says he clearly stated you know what he had to say on Sixty Minutes he didnt say anything all he said was that the American public knows that im mean you know okay what what do you mean uh Bill and you know im not going to confirm or deny anything i mean thats where you
