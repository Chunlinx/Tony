                                 Norse by Norsewest            Earlier this summer anoutoftown friend and I were taking in the Ballard Seafood Festival an annualcelebration of music troll dolls and pickled herring in the Seattleneighborhood that serves as Scandinavias unofficial outpost            Ballard annexed by Seattlemany years ago maintains its culture and loyalties without much considerationfor national or civic boundaries Its residents solid and conservative in lookand outlook are often referred to as square heads which suggests a stolidstupidity many associate with the Swedes but all Scandinavian flags fly hereThe kindly King Harald V of Norway visits every year or so to ensure thatBallard remains within the realm The children grow strong by enduring the painand suffering of having to eat lutefisk  the kind of dish that offers achallenge to the character much like haggis for the Scots Lutefisk iscod that is treated with lye and is transformed in the process into agelatinous fishy white mass that I imagine is not unlike sperm whale sperm When I was growing up we had to eat it every Christmas eve Nolutefisk no gifts was no doubt a Lutheran law            As westrolled the festival I mentioned to my friend that a statue of Leif Ericsonstands guard at nearby Shilshole Bay He gave me a sideways look LeifEricson he sneered Did he ever come here             The question and the tone turned me snarky Why the hell doI have to justify Leif Ericson Did Christopher Columbus ever sleep inColumbus Ohio Did he ever reach the Columbia River or British ColumbiaAmerica and the Pacific Northwest are monuments to people who never came hereAmerigo Vespucci for one Washington state is named for George Mount Rainieris named for Peter Rainier a British admiral and enemy of the United Stateswho never sailed these waters And the Strait of Juan de Fuca is named for aGreek navigator who likely never existed at all And my friend questions LeifEricson            Seattlesship traffic passes under the statues gaze Undoubtedly it brings good luckto local seafarers many of them named Thor Einer or Ole But it is also agreat symbol When this bold figure of Ericson was unveiled in the s andlater used in a US postagestamp design it stood for the righting of one ofhistorys great wrongs Only Seattle had the guts to tell the truth and to cutthat truth in stone by paying tribute to the real European discoverer ofAmerica and the people who explored and settled Vinland half a millenniumbefore the Italian pretender acting for Spain            My friend sad to say had revealed himselfwith his inquiry as a Vinland doubter a man who has not read The Sagas a man still waiting for more proof than contemporary maps detailed writtenaccounts and carbondated archaeological evidence In short a typicalAmerican            I am feeling less snarky andmore cocky these days however because the answer to my friends questionmight actually be closer to a yes than I ever expected Ericson might nothave slept here but his Norse ancestors might have you betcha A recentdiscovery along the banks of the Columbia River may provide key scientificevidence that proves it            Butbefore we get to the science let me introduce a pet theory of mine that therewas an ancient link between the Northwest Indians and the Norsemen            Consider the parallels The Northwest Coast Indian tribesforayed south from their villages in the north along the Alaska and BritishColumbia coast and lived off the sea and plunder They raided in canoes notunlike Viking ships They were also fishermen and whalers as many are todayIn fact the Olympic Peninsulas Makah Indians have asked for permission tojoin the Norwegians in resuming whale hunts an ancient custom theScandinavians never gave up despite international pressures Northwest Coasttribes like the Tlingit took heads and slaves as did the Vikings And theyhave a rich mythology with characters and themes not unlike those found in theNorse myths Where Raven brought daylight to the Indian world he alsowhispered words of advice into the ears of the supreme god Odin At the veryleast the Indians were kindred spirits with the Scandinavian warriors ofyore            But thelinks may also be genetic or at the very least the result of ancientancestral contact Last July a couple of locals found a skeleton along theColumbia River in Kennewick Wash Carbondating traced the remains ofKennewick Man to between  and  BC The bones proved to be those of amale who was tall for his time  feet  inches He was also a tough guyaspear point was found lodged in his pelvis along with evidence of other warriorwounds He survived these and lived to be about  Oh yes it also appearsaccording to experts who have carefully examined the skeleton that he wasCaucasian            No horned helmet was found but the discoveryis complicatingperhaps overturningtheories about the settlement of NorthAmerica Did the ancestors of the Indians really come from Asia over theAleutian land bridge Or did they arrive after an earlier migration orsettlement of IndoEuropeans from Central Asia or early Europeans CouldKennewick Man have come by a route similar to Ericsons say via skin boats orover an ice mass connecting North America Greenland and Norway Oregon StateUniversity anthropologist Rob Bonnichsen thinks the latter is a possibilitywhich would explain why some ancient American tools are more similar toEuropean ones than to Asian ones            Not surprisingly an Indiantribe the Umatilla has already demanded that the bones be reburied as if theywere ancient native relics and federal law backs them up They argue thatscientists are merely desecrating the dead But the Smithsonian calls KennewickMan a national treasure and anthropologists want to conduct DNA tests whichmight offer clues to his origin Some Indians already resent suggestions theyare descended from ancient Asianssuch contentions fly in the face of theircreation myths Imagine how theyd feel if tests revealed their ancientancestors were white men  Worse imagine how Ken Burns would feel            I suggest a test to resolvethe matter Check to see if Kennewick Mans skull is slightly squared aroundthe edges suggestive of a cube Look for evidence of a crew cut and afishreliant diet If such evidence is present return Kennewick Man to hisrightful tribal reservation In Ballard
