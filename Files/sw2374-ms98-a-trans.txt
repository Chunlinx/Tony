          well whos the team   well i think uh NCAA is going to go to Kansas   oh really well i im picking Duke because uh they just won it   they just won it   yeah   holy cow i just walked in i i didnt even i guess its i cant believe its over already   its just yeah its just over just uh about five ten minutes ago i guess it was a good game uh they won by about eight i think   what was the score   either five or eight it was a good game but uh Duke was just too much for them Kansas just couldnt couldnt hang with them   well i suppose they must be still must be pretty good if they took on UNLV so   oh yeah and see i was i was really thinking that they might have a let down because i i i was in a basketball pot and i picked uh Kansas for i guess more or less an upset but i i was thinking that uh Duke might have a let down after playing such a tough game with UNLV but uh i tell you what they uh they came back and put it to them it was a good game but i i i had thought all the way through that UNLV was going to be the team that would just walk away with it   well you and everybody else   thats right thats right i tell you what they uh they they looked like they were just men among boys but they they they fell i tell you   well a lot of pressure on them though i think uh i dont think they had the same type of enthusiasm enthusiasm or attitude probably too conservative or too   yeah yeah they they just need to go for it instead of uh worrying about the other team because i think if they would play their game i dont know if theres anybody that could that could keep up with them   uh yeah yeah well what about professionally   but uh i i was since the   im out in uh Phoenix uh Phoenix there so the Suns are starting to look pretty descent but there  i think yeah   yeah thats right yeah here in Dallas ill tell you what the the Mavericks are having just all kinds of problems   yeah   i tell you   well i used to live out there and uh seems like theyve well Tarpley just got pulled over again   oh really yeah so he hes uh hes probably going to be going to jail and and the problem with him is hes on a guaranteed salary like for three years so whether he plays or not theyve got to pay him ten million dollars so if they       uh they cant hardly trade him because nobody wants to pay that much for him and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guys got Dallas in a big old bind but uh they they i think theyve just got to forget about him and uh try to build a team without him maybe go for some good they ought to get some good draft picks this year   who who else do they got on that team now i   theyve uh theyve got Derek Harper thats a real good point guard him and Rolando Blackman   yeah   and uh really theyre about it theyve got a guy named Herb Williams that that i guess sort of was supposed to take the place of uh Tarpley but he uh he just doesnt have the offensive skills   yeah   and then theyve got James Donaldson whos been there forever playing center and uh   yeah hows he doing this year   just all right but hes getting to where uh i dont know if its his age or what but he just cant play the whole game theyve got to get somebody young that can uh run the court thats still big   how about the guy from North Carolina   oh uh not McCrae but uh lets see are you uh Perkins   Perkins Perkins   they traded Perkins Sam Perkins they traded him he was from North Carolina and uh they traded him to the Lakers last year and that he was a good player and then they theyve got a   thats right thats right okay yeah he was a finesse player he was good   yeah and then they they uh last year went out and got oh Fat Leever and uh Alex English and and Rodney McCrae   Dantely didnt they get Dantely   yeah they didnt and im not for sure what the deal is on him i think hes been hurt but he hadnt played he hadnt played in probably two months and ive ive gone to about three or four of their games and i dont even think he was on the sidelines so i i think he hurt his knee or something but he he definitely didnt turn out to be anything like he was supposed to so uh   i think that was involved with the Perkins Perkins trade to tell you the truth   it uh you know i i bet it was   oh oh no no no no no no it was what is his name McGuire that was McGuire  yeah   thats right thats right from uh uh Detroit thats right thats who that was yeah because i dont think they got anything from Perkins i think he was a free agent or uh   yeah   yeah free agent his contract ended and they didnt sign him and uh   i dont understand that i thought that he was always a good player   you know he was but he just went for the the big bucks i think Dallas was going to pay him like sixteen million over five years and he got something like eighteen or nineteen million from Las Angeles so he just went where the bucks were and shoot you cant blame him man thats thats a phenomenal amount of money but uh yeah the Mavericks are sucking it up i tell you   are they over five hundred   uh no i dont think so they they were right before the uh uh oh what do you call it allstar break but ever since the allstar break uh shoot theyve theyve played terrible   umhum   and uh so now itd be really to their benefit to to really play uh some bad ball and and hopefully get a lucky uh lottery pick       because uh theres no way they can even i think mathematically theyre out of the playoff scene now   yeah   so you know they they need to just play for a playoff pick   yeah i think i think the Suns are   or a you know the Suns are are pretty good   well they had i dont think it was last year the year before they were doing really good and i think they had an off year last year   theyre uh yeah and they did they made some trades uh oh they had one white guy i cant think of his name that was real good   did you say white or black   white uh Chambers yeah and uh   Chambers yeah hes the big guy yeah   you know if if they could get somebody to help compliment him you know i think theyd be uh awesome because that guy can play that Chambers is is something else but uh i dont know itll itll be interesting   i havent been i dont follow basketball real close but   i i really dont follow the pros that close either they they just play so many games that uh you know its just hard t o keep up with them but college i really enjoy college basketball   yeah       the big ten didnt fair too well in the tournament   the most no they sure didnt sure didnt   im im from the  midwest so   oh okay so you keep up with the   yeah yeah i kind of watch you know see whats happening   uh yeah more of a football powerhouse i guess   but uh whats that   more of a football powerhouse up there i guess   well no basketball is you know Michigan won it last year   is basketball pretty big do what   yeah Indiana and Michigan uh and uh Iowa and   i   Ohio State Ohio State was ranked like number two most of the year   thats thats true that is right   Michigan won the NCAA last year and and you know theres always about six teams that go to the tournament uh from the big ten its its   yeah so thats a tough conference   they are theyre really good in all the sports they   huh   actually in the last few years um football you know looks like has gone down a little bit so   yeah because Ohio State used to be just a perennial powerhouse   yeah and uh   but uh and Michigan too but uh well i tell you what i appreciate uh the conversation and uh well have to well have to see how Phoenix ends up   yeah well see   you too byebye   alrighty well uh have a good one okay byebye
