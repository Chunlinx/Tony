                                 On Rereading            Old age is the new rageThat was apparent even before John Glenn aged  went up into space Thereare more old people than ever Many of them have word processors Many of thosepass their free time writing And following the advice of all teachers ofwriting they write about what they know which is old age So there is a lotof writing on that subject Even Jimmy Carter has written a book about oldage            Wantingto keep up with this trend I have just reread the classic on the subjectMarcus Tullius Ciceros De Senectute The last time I read it was  yearsago I read it then in Latin Today I read it in the wonderful Loeb ClassicLibrary edition with the Latin on the left page and the English on the rightI read the right page I can hardly believe that I read it in Latin when I wasa junior in high school And I cant imagine what I learned about old agereading it in my teens We didnt read De Senectute to learn about old ageMy Latin teacher believed that reading Latinany Latinmade tiny grooves inyour brain that increased your general intelligencenot just your capacity toread Latin            Cicero wrote the essay in  BC when he was  yearsold One might think that was pretty old for a Roman of that time but Ciceroevidently didnt think it was old enough to qualify him to discourse on thesubject He wrote in the voice of Cato the Elder in the year  BC whenCato was  years old In fact Cicero did not live to experience much old ageThe year after writing the essay he was executed for being on the wrong side ofa political dispute            The essayconsists of a long answer by Cato to questions posed by two younger men one and one  They ask him on what principles we may most easily support theweight of increasing years Cato breaks down the question He identifies fourreasons why old age appears to be an unhappy time First it withdraws us fromactive pursuits Second it makes the body weaker Third it deprives us of allphysical pleasures And fourth it is not far removed from death            He then discusses these four concerns            Translating the answers intothe English of  they almost all consist of saying that the quality ofones old age depends on the investments one made in earlier years I dontrefer and Cicero didnt either to financial investments that assure one acomfortable income in old age Cicero came from a wealthy family I am surethat financial investments are important and I dont suppose Cicero would havedenied that But there are other kinds of investments implicit in Cicerosdiscussion            The mostobvious is investment in ones health and bodily strength I dont think theRomans of Ciceros time had a cigarette problem But it seems clear from theexamples he gives that having a satisfactory old age depends on adequacy ofphysical exercise and moderation of eating and drinking in the yearsbefore            Another investment important for old age is friendshipsCicero has Cato say I have always had my club companions Cato takes pridein having been instrumental when he was  years old in establishing certainclubs in Rome and therefore I used to dine with these companionsin analtogether moderate way yet with a certain ardor appropriate to my age whichas time goes on daily mitigates my zest for every pleasure            Being aStoic CiceroCato does not regret but rather welcomes the decline of appetitefor what he calls sensual pleasure Cato quotes a man who asked Sophocleswhether being old he still indulged in the delights of love When I lookacross the page at the Latin I see rebus veneriis  which looks more likesexual lovebut its a long time since I studied Latin and I may be wrongIn any case he praises the value of the intellectual and aesthetic pleasuresin which an old man can still indulge But to fully appreciate art scienceand nature in old age requires some prior investment in cultivating them            An even older source reminds me of aninvestment for old age at which Cicero only hints Genesis  says AndAbraham was old well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in allthings According to my rabbi I dont want to pretend to be a student of suchthings later commentators said that meant that Abraham was blessed with therecognition that he had passed the trials of his life with valor and devotionand could now enjoy a peaceful retirement content in his own eyes and in theeyes of God He had in todays parlance paid his dues That is anotherinvestment one can make for old age so to conduct oneself in prior years thatone can feel one has paid ones dues            On the final question of howto invest to prepare for the proximity of death in old age Cicero is not veryhelpful Who is He offers his philosophical view Death brings at least anend to those troublesome appetites and may open the way to something betterhedoesnt say what Perhaps one could indoctrinate oneself in that attitude inyouth and so prepare for old age But obviously Cicero did not find thatphilosophy sufficient As the introduction to the Loeb edition says InFebruary  a year before he wrote De Senectute the death of his adored andonly daughter drove him into a frenzy of writing in an effort to forget hisgrief He did not accept the fact of his daughter Tullias death with thethought that she had at least escaped all appetites His philosophy might haveprepared him for his own death it did not prepare him for the death of one heloved            Later hewrote an essay titled Consolatio which probably dealt with this subject andwhich I have not read If he was rescued from his grief it was apparently timeand work not philosophy that rescued him             Herbert Stein thanks hishighschool Latin teacher
