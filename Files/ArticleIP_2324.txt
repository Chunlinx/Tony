                                 The Flytrap Blame Game            One of the few truthsuniversally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary BettyCurrie deserves our sympathy an honest loyal civil servant dragooned into ascandal she had nothing to do with            But does Currie deserve suchsanctification After all she knew Clintons history when she took her jobthen enabled Clintons sleaziness anyway She stood by while Clinton cuckoldedhis wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice And did sheprotest Not as far as we have heard Did she quit on principle No Currie maynot be Flytraps chief malefactor but nor is she the saintly innocent that theAmerican public believes her to be            TheCurrie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration            Monica Lewinsky for example has fantastically lowapproval ratings much lower than Clintons One poll I saw pegged herfavorability rating at  percent even Newt Gingrich manages at least percent Now Monica certainly isnt the heroine of Flytrap She did seduce amarried man damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex lie frequentlyand insouciantly and blab her secret affair to anyone whod listen But shewas also sexually exploited by her older sleazy boss had her reputationsmeared by Clintons lackeys and was betrayed by her friend Linda Tripp Shehardly deserves such universal contempt            Others besides Currie havebenefited from the publics excessive generosity George Stephanopoulos hasbecome a white knight of Flytrap the former Clinton aide who had the courageto turn on his boss And bravo to George for chastising Clinton But it smacksof hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to discover in  that Clinton is a lyingwomanizing dog He has after all known this since  Back thenStephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clintonslying denials He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions Mickey Kausfirst noted Stephanopoulos unbearable sanctimony in this Chatterbox item in January And while loyalty isnt a universalgood it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at themoment Clintons stock was about to plunge            Sometimes of course the publics rating is dead on target Linda Trippsalliesa group that includes her lawyers Kenneth Starr the Goldberg familyand absolutely no one else as far as I
