              well what books do you like   um a broad spectrum  my tastes seem to change over the years um i like uh uh  mysteries adventure some science fiction i like uh Sagan i read i read just about everything that he puts out   uhhuh   um Robert  Ludlum   great   and ive just started uh i got a whole set of books on uh Sherlock Holmes   uhhuh   so im just getting into that uh thats kind of uh interesting its unique   yeah   how about yourself   yeah those are great uh ive been a Sherlock Holmes fan for years and i think ive read most of his stuff multiple numbers of times   oh you have   uh i just find it very relaxing and very enjoyable and i always hope for my memory to to fail me so after a couple of years i can pick up a story and read it again   uh oh okay uh i got a whole set i got a set for Christmas   thats great   so ive just started into some in to him i havent uh ive uh i think uh they had uh uh Sherlock Holmes uh miniseries on uh  on educational TV   uhhuh   uh channel two up here im not sure what it is down there and they had uh uh some of his i i started watching that and i got interested in it so thats why i got the gift   yeah yeah   so youve been doing it for a long time   yeah i started reading them years and years ago and i its and i im not really much of a mystery reader although ive always liked Sherlock Holmes and then somebody turned me on to a guy named Dick Frances um and hes uh a former jockey and he writes mystery stories and they always involve horse racing in one form or another hes very very good if uh youve never read him that would be a great opportunity   no i mean is Dick Frances   his name is Dick Frances and any book store owner will know who Dick Frances is   um yeah   and you can pick up any of his stuff and you can just sort of try it and if you like his style well hes written id say twenty or twenty five   oh okay yeah um   novels you know hes quite quite clever   my taste runs runs to uh Ludlum you know that type of   uh the adventure stuff   yeah adventure yeah uh some of that gets i dont know i think theyve got ghost writers now on a lot of them and uh they just put their name to it because years ago either that or my tastes are changing um   yeah   they just dont have the same depth that they seem to have before   huh yeah you know i always suspected uh uh uh Michener of doing that you know i read some of his early stuff and then it seemed like his later stuff they would be these long long long passages that were just of inferior quality it   it was yeah it was uh just to fill a page   yeah i mean i just got the feeling that he sort of has a coterie of of students and he says okay go write three chapters on this and he and he kind of he might write some stuff i dont think he writes all his stuff every word i may be wrong   yeah youre probably right um uh im trying to think of that uh Stephen King   yeah   have you read any of his   ive read a couple of his things i i just wasnt that crazy about him       which really puts me in the i know in the vast minority   no no no no ive ive read a couple of them that werent too bad um my oldest boy is into him so hes oh youve got to read this dad youve got to read that dad but im not thats not really not my uh cup of tea   yeah   except the the latest one hes got out uh its uh fourteen hundred or fifteen hundred page he had he had published it about ten years ago   huh   and hes got it out now with the with the the full text no cuts and no he he explains that when he did it the first time because of publishing costs they asked they asked him to cut it back a third   yeah   so thats what he did now hes got it out and i cant even think of the name of it but its starting out pretty good um its something thats not   huh   like his present style   yeah yeah   um but other than that um ive read Dune i dont know if youve read Dune   i read Dune years ago and i again you you i uh i just did not care for Dune i read through it all it was laborious i i   uh   felt i had to get through it and when i put it down i never wanted to read another thing by that guy again   to read it again yeah ive read uh i like the original       Dune and then they had hes had two others after that which i didnt care for at all so i kind of fell off   yeah yeah yeah   um   but again i realize i mean i all my friends were saying how great Dune was and i just could not could not get into it i read the whole thing but i didnt enjoy didnt enjoy it that much   have you read any science fiction at all   i really read a lot of science fiction and Asimov is one of my favorite authors   yeah   i think his stuff is is great just going back to his very early works and almost anything he writes i try to read   uh even i havent read any of his recent but ive read some of his old uh uh  things and in yeah i i like him hes hes not too bad some of its uh not him but some of the other science fiction i mean its just so uh uh like uh Tolkien   yeah   i never could get into him   interesting and i was just crazy about Tolkien i read his stuff and i reread it and i read the whole twelve hundred pages aloud to my son when he was uh a young boy when he was about eight or nine we would just read ten pages every night and i just did that you know for a half a year until id read the whole thing out loud   huh thats interesting   and uh     yeah my um both my boys are into him but i dont know its just something i i dont know if i had the time or put myself in the frame of mind for it   yeah yeah   what do you do what do you do for um educational anything   well uh uh being a college professor theres just a certain amount of academic reading i do as a matter of course   oh so you have to youre forced into it no matter what   well well well yeah forced is probably not too strong a word but     yeah yeah   to keep up in your field you usually have to do some uh some technical reading but uh i actually like um for technical reading i like to read what i call uh soft core science like uh Discovery Magazine   thats i get that   which i like very much and uh and then uh National Science Foundation puts out an excellent publication called Mosaic with uh the and they get some of the best scholars scholars and scientists in the country to write articles that can be understood theyre not highly technical but theyre not probably not as simplified as in Discovery   huh   but theyre very good except i couldnt i just got on their list somehow because at one time i did some research for them and im not really sure how one would go about getting this but its its excellent uh for finding out whats going on in fields other than your own   yeah have have you ever heard of the Source Book Project   i dont believe so Source Book Project   uh it deals with anomalies um whether its uh animal vegetable or mineral or or geologic anomalies   oh no no   you know like uh  uh rain fish you know that type of thing   oh that would be fascinating   or the uh the uh is it the Mima mounds in um Kentucky i think or Tennessee   i dont know what what about them   well its just the Source Book Project  um it gives you a short uh synopsis of of whatever theyre talking about and then it gives you all the sources that you can look up   uhhuh   if youre interested in it   i see okay that would be a very interesting thing   and they they tried to uh uh throw out the uh sensationalism you know like flying saucers and all that kind of stuff   right   the things that they that they publish are documented sightings you know and an or digs or whatever   uhhuh   um im kind of in to that im uh uh i belong to the Narragansett Archeology Society so i like going back and you know digging up things it gives me you know uh its kind of a a thrill to see something that nobodys looked at for two or three thousand years   yeah do you have any interest in Stonehenge or did you ever have any   uh as far as being uh yes that type of thing yeah thats what these Mima mounds were supposedly like early Stonehenge in America um yeah im fascinated with that kind of stuff in fact just recently uh a few days ago they discovered a cave
