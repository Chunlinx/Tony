                            Stuttering with its characteristic disruption in verbal fluency has been known for        centuries earliest descriptions probably date back to the Biblical Moses slowness of        speech and tongue and his related avoidance behavior Exodus   Stuttering occurs        in all cultures and ethnic groups Andrews et al  Zimmermann et al  although        prevalence might differ Insofar as many of the steps in how we produce language normally        are still a mystery disorders like stuttering are even more poorly understood However        genetic and neurobiological approaches are now giving us clues to causes and better        treatments                    What Is Stuttering        Stuttering is a disruption in the fluency of verbal expression characterized by        involuntary audible or silent repetitions or prolongations of sounds or syllables Figure         These are not readily controllable and may be accompanied by other movements and by        emotions of negative nature such as fear embarrassment or irritation Wingate         Strictly speaking stuttering is a symptom not a disease but the term         stuttering usually refers to both the disorder and symptom        Developmental stuttering evolves before puberty usually between two and five years of        age without apparent brain damage or other known cause idiopathic It is important to        distinguish between this persistent developmental stuttering PDS which we focus on here        and acquired stuttering Neurogenic or acquired stuttering occurs after a definable brain        damage eg stroke intracerebral hemorrhage or head trauma It is a rare phenomenon        that has been observed after lesions in a variety of brain areas Grant et al         Ciabarra et al         The clinical presentation of developmental stuttering differs from acquired stuttering        in that it is particularly prominent at the beginning of a word or a phrase in long or        meaningful words or syntactically complex utterances Karniol  Natke et al         and the associated anxiety and secondary symptoms are more pronounced Ringo and Dietrich         Moreover at repeated readings stuttering frequency tends to decline adaptation        and to occur at the same syllables as before consistency Nonetheless the distinction        between both types of stuttering is not strict In children with perinatal or other brain        damage stuttering is more frequent than in agematched controls and both types of        stuttering may overlap Andrews et al                     Who Is Affected        PDS is a very frequent disorder with approximately  of the population suffering from        this condition An estimated  million people in the United States and  million people        worldwide stutter Prevalence is similar in all social classes In many cases stuttering        severely impairs communication with devastating socioeconomic consequences However there        are also many stutterers who despite their disorder have become famous For instance        Winston Churchill had to rehearse all his public speeches to perfection and even practiced        answers to possible questions and criticisms to avoid stuttering Charles Darwin also        stuttered interestingly his grandfather Erasmus Darwin suffered from the same condition        highlighting the fact that stuttering runs in families and is likely to have a genetic        basis        The incidence of PDS is about  and its recovery rate is up to about  resulting in        a prevalence of PDS in about  of the adult population As recovery is considerably more        frequent in girls than in boys the maletofemale ratio increases during childhood and        adolescence to reach three or four males to every one female in adulthood It is not clear        to what extent this recovery is spontaneous or induced by early speech therapy Also there        is no good way of predicting whether an affected child will recover Yairi and Ambrose                The presence of affected family members suggests a hereditary component The concordance        rate is about  for monozygotic twins Andrews et al  Felsenfeld et al         about  for dizygotic twins Andrews et al  Felsenfeld et al  and  for        siblings of the same sex Andrews et al  Given the high recovery rate it may well        be that the group abnormalities observed in adults reflects impaired recovery rather than        the causes of stuttering Andrews et al                     Changing Theories        Over the centuries a variety of theories about the origin of stuttering and        corresponding treatment approaches have been proposed In ancient Greece theories referred        to dryness of the tongue In the         th century abnormalities of the speech apparatus were thought to cause        stuttering Thus treatment was based on extensive plastic surgery often leading to        mutilations and additional disabilities Other treatment options were tongueweights or        mouth prostheses Katz  Figure  In the th century stuttering was primarily        thought to be a psychogenic disorder Consequently psychoanalytical approaches and        behavioral therapy were applied to solve possible neurotic conflicts Plankers         However studies of personality traits and childparent interactions did not detect        psychological patterns consistently associated with stuttering Andrews et al         Other theories regard stuttering as a learned behavior resulting from disadvantageous        external usually parental reactions to normal childhood dysfluencies Johnson         While this model has failed to explain the core symptoms of stuttering Zimmermann et al         it may well explain secondary symptoms Andrews et al  and guided early        parental intervention may prevent persistence into adulthood Onslow et al  The        severity of PDS is clearly modulated by arousal nervousness and other factors Andrews et        al  This has led to a twofactor model of PDS The first factor is believed to cause        the disorder and is most likely a structural or functional central nervous system CNS        abnormality whereas the second factor reinforces the first one especially through        avoidance learning However one should be careful to call the latter factor psychogenic        or psychological because neuroscience has shown that learning is not simply        psychogenic but leads to measurable changes in the brain Kandel and ODell         In some cases arousal actually improves stuttering instead of making it worse        Consequently some famous stutterers have treated their stuttering by putting themselves        on the spot Anecdotally the American actor Bruce Willis who began stuttering at the age        of eight joined a drama club in high school and his stuttering vanished in front of an        audience                    Is Stuttering a Sensory Motor or Cognitive Disorder        Stuttering subjects as a group differ from fluent control groups by showing on average        slightly lower intelligence scores on both verbal and nonverbal tasks and by delays in        speech development Andrews et al  Paden et al  However decreased        intelligence scores need to be interpreted carefully as stutterers show a schooling        disadvantage of several months Andrews et al  Associated symptoms comprise delays        in tasks requiring a vocal response Peters et al  and in complex bimanual timed        tasks such as inserting a string in the eye of a needle Vaughn and Webster  whereas        many other studies on sensorymotor reaction times yielded inconsistent results Andrews et        al  Alterations of auditory feedback eg delayed auditory feedback        frequencyaltered feedback various forms of other auditory stimulation eg chorus        reading and alteration of speech rhythm eg syllabletimed speech yield a prompt and        marked reduction of stuttering frequency which has raised suspicions of impaired auditory        processing or rhythmic pacemaking in stuttering subjects Lee  Brady and Berson         Hall and Jerger  Salmelin et al  Other groups have also reported discoordinated        and delayed onset of complex articulation patterns in stuttering subjects Caruso et al         van Lieshout et al  The assumption that stuttering might be a form of        dystoniainvoluntary muscle contractions produced by the CNSspecific to language        production Kiziltan and Akalin  was not supported by a study on motor cortex        excitability Sommer et al         Neurochemistry however may link stuttering with disorders of a network of structures        involved in the control of movement the basal ganglia An increase of the neurotransmitter        dopamine has been associated with movement disorders such as Tourette syndrome Comings et        al  Abwender et al  which is a neurological disorder characterized by repeated        and involuntary body movements and vocal sounds motor and vocal tics Accordingly like        Tourette syndrome stuttering improves with antidopaminergic medication eg neuroleptics        such as haloperidol risperidone and olanzapine Brady  Lavid et al  Maguire et        al  and anecdotal reports suggest that it is accentuated or appears under treatment        with dopaminergic medication Koller  Anderson et al  Shahed and Jankovic         Hence a hyperactivity of the dopaminergic neurotransmitter system has been hypothesized to        contribute to stuttering Wu et al  Although dopamine antagonists have a positive        effect on stuttering they all have side effects that have prevented them from being a        first line treatment of stuttering                    Lessons from Imaging the Brain        Given reports on acquired stuttering after brain trauma Grant et al  Ciabarra et        al  one might think that a lesion analysis ie asking the question where do all        lesions that lead to stuttering overlap could help to find the location of an abnormality        linked to stuttering Unfortunately lesions leading to stuttering are widespread and do        not seem to follow an overlapping pattern Even the contrary has been observed a thalamic        stroke after which stuttering was cured in a patient Muroi et al         In fluent speakers the left languagedominant brain hemisphere is most active during        speech and language tasks However early studies on EEG lateralization already strongly        suggested abnormal hemispheric dominance Moore and Haynes  in stutterers With the        advent of other noninvasive brain imaging techniques like positron emission tomography        PET and functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI it became possible to visualize        brain activity of stutterers and compare these patterns to fluent controls Following        prominent theories that linked stuttering with an imbalance of hemispherical asymmetry        Travis  Moore and Haynes  an important PET study Fox et al  reported        increased activation in the right hemisphere in a language task in developmental        stutterers Another PET study Braun et al  confirmed this result but added an        important detail to the previous study Braun and colleagues found that activity in the        left hemisphere was more active during the production of stuttered speech whereas        activation of the right hemisphere was more correlated with fluent speech Thus the        authors concluded that the primary dysfunction is located in the left hemisphere and that        the hyperactivation of the right hemisphere might not be the cause of stuttering but        rather a compensatory process A similar compensatory process has been observed after        stroke and aphasia where an intact right hemisphere can at least partially compensate for        a loss of function Weiller et al  Right hemisphere hyperactivation during fluent        speech has been more recently confirmed with fMRI Neumann et al         PET and fMRI have high spatial resolution but because they only indirectly index brain        activity through blood flow their temporal resolution is rather limited        Magnetoencephalography MEG is the method of choice to investigate finegrained temporal        sequence of brain activity Consequently MEG was used to investigate stutterers and fluent        controls reading single words Salmelin et al  Importantly stutterers were reported        to have read most single words fluently Nevertheless the data showed a clearcut        difference between stutterers and controls Whereas fluent controls activated left frontal        brain areas involved in language planning before central areas involved in speech        execution this pattern was absent even reversed in stutterers This was the first study        to directly show a neuronal correlate of a hypothesized speech timing disorder in        stutterers Van Riper         Thus functional neuroimaging studies have revealed two important facts i in        stutterers the right hemisphere seems to be hyperactive and ii a timing problem seems        to exist between the left frontal and the left central cortex The latter observation also        fits various observations that have shown that stutterers have slight abnormalities in        complex coordination tasks suggesting that the underlying problem is located around motor        and associated premotor brain areas        Are there structural abnormalities that parallel the functional abnormalities The first        anatomical study to investigate this question used highresolution MR scans and found        abnormalities of speechlanguage areas Brocas and Wernickes area Foundas et al         In addition these researchers reported abnormalities in the gyrification pattern        Gyrification is a complex developmental procedure and abnormalities in this process are an        indicator of a developmental disorder        Another recent study investigated the hypothesis that impaired cortical connectivity        might underlie timing disturbances between frontal and central brain regions observed in        MEG studies Figure  Using a new MRI technique diffusion tensor imaging DTI that        allows the assessment of white matter ultrastructure investigators saw an area of        decreased white matter tract coherence in the Rolandic operculum Sommer et al  This        structure is adjacent to the primary motor representation of tongue larynx and pharynx        Martin et al  and the inferior arcuate fascicle linking temporal and frontal        language areas which both form a temporofrontal language system involved in word        perception and production Price et al  It is thus conceivable that disturbed signal        transmission through fibers passing the left Rolandic operculum impairs the fast        sensorimotor integration necessary for fluent speech production This theory also explains        why the normal temporal pattern of activation between premotor and motor cortex is        disturbed Salmelin et al  and why as a consequence the right hemisphere language        areas try to compensate for this deficit Fox et al         These new data also provide a theory to explain the mechanism of common fluencyinducing        maneuvers like chorus reading singing and metronome reading that reduce stuttering        instantaneously All these procedures involve an external signal ie other readers in        chorus reading the music in singing and the metronome itself All these external signals        feed into the speech production system through the auditory cortex It is thus possible        that this external trigger signal reaches speechproducing central brain areas by        circumventing the frontocentral disconnection and is able to resynchronize frontocentral        decorrelated activity In simple terms these external cues can be seen as an external        pacemaker                    Future Directions in Research        There are numerous outstanding issues in stuttering If structural changes in the brain        cause PDS the key question is when this lesion appears Although symptoms are somewhat        different it would be interesting to find out to what extent transient stuttering which        occurs in  in childhood is linked to PDS It is possible that all children who show        signs of stuttering develop a structural abnormality during development but this is        transient in those who become fluent speakers If this is the case it is even more        important that therapy starts as early as possible if it is to have most impact This        question can now be answered with current methodology ie noninvasive brain imaging        using MRI        Given that boys are about four times less likely to recover from stuttering than girls        it is tempting to speculate that all stutterers have a slight abnormality but only those        that can use the right hemisphere for language can develop into fluent speakers Language        lateralization is less pronounced in women McGlone  and might therefore be related to        the fact that women show an overall lower incidence in PDS Again a developmental study        comparing children who stutter with fluent controls and most importantly longitudinal        studies on these children should be able to answer these questions        It is unlikely that stuttering is inherited in a simple fashion Currently a        multifactorial model for genetic transmission is most likely Moreover it is unclear        whether a certain genotype leads to stuttering or only represents a risk factor and that        other environmental factors are necessary to develop PDS Again this question might be        answered in the near future as the National Institutes of Health has recently completed        the data collection phase of a large stuttering sample for genetic linkage analysis
