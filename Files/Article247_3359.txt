                                 Daniel Bell the Once Famed New York Intellectual                        Daniel Bell who recently turned  cuts an odd figure on the intellectuallandscape Although he is generally considered to be the greatest livingAmerican sociologist surprisingly few people today have heard of him He isprobably better known in Europe than in the United States There is no Bellianschool of sociological thought He has been called a sage without afollowing In the s when the book we are discussing was originallypublished he had a higher profile One survey placed him among the ten mostrespected intellectuals in America No doubt that had something to do with his volume of essays The End of Ideology  which Bell himself oncecalled the most cited and least read of books            Although Bell did not coin the term postindustrial it was his book thatlaunched it into the popular lexicon where it was subsequently banalized byuntold mindless repetitions That of course is not Bells fault Indeed itwas with some excitement that I opened this new edition of The Coming ofPostIndustrial Society  hoping to recover the rigorous and prescientthinking behind the clich I was also curious to see how Bell in a newlywritten foreword of some  pages would retrospectively appraise the validityof his theorizing and the accuracy of his predictions            I dont know about you David but I was at first put off by the ratherunleavened prose the endless morphological distinctions systems ordersspheres situses axial principles dimensions  and the paragraphsfull of academic throatclearing But the limitations of forecasting are alsoevident The further one reaches ahead in time with a set of forecasts thegreater the margin for error since the fan of projections widensnot tomention the typos factual errors and shoddy copyediting of the newforeword            Bell may have been one of the more sparkling of the New York intellectualsin his heyday and he was also of course a writer for Henry LucesFortune in the s and has even retained some Timeese ticssuch as referring to Plato in a footnote as the famed Greek philosopher Buthe has been since the s an academic sociologist first at Columbia whichgave him a PhD after they hired him for his writings as a public intellectualand then since  at Harvard And sociologists cannot help generatinggrand sterile abstract schematics to describe society            Curiously if you look at the wonderful anthology of parodies that DwightMacdonald put together long ago you will find a burlesque of sociologese byDaniel Bell called The Parameters of Social Movements A Formal Paradigmwhich was allegedly a revision of an earlier scheme titled The ConfigurativePatterning of Social Movements The parody is not all that funny What ishilarious is that a couple of sociological colleagues to whom he sent itmistook it for the real thing One of them he writes sent me back a seriousletter about some of the categories while the other not knowing whether itwas a spoof or not wrote You are too good a sociologist not to have createdsomething which itself is quite useful And a third asked me for a copy of myearlier scheme             I seem to have left it to you David to say just what Daniel Bell means bythe postindustrial society Forgive me
