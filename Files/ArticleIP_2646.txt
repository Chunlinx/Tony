                                 The Planet Hollywood Syndrome            In the days when corporatedownsizing was all the rage Wall Street took a lot of flak for judgingcompanies too harshly and setting the bar for corporate performance so highthat executives felt their only option was to slash payrolls Oralternatively Wall Street was praised for its relentless focus on the bottomline and its insistence that corporations become more productive and moreprofitable Either way the point was that investors were taskmasters Marinedrill sergeants whipping corporate America into shape Now this was never astrue as Wall Streets critics or its supporters wanted it to be but in anycase it is somewhat beside the point now A quick glance at the Street todaymakes one thing clear Boot camp is over            TakePlanet Hollywood This is a company that  has been a consistent money loserfor almost its entire existence  has constructed an entire business aroundthe highly questionable proposition that people will overpay for mediocre foodin order to sit next to the motorcycle that Bruce Willis rode in PulpFiction  and  is spending large sums of money to pay an executive to livein Hollywood and build relationships with upandcoming stars This is acompany in other words that should not exist with should implying nothingabout the morality of the burgermovie star alliance and everything about itsbusiness prospects            Though it has seen its stock price hithardjustifiablyby its most recent woes Planet Hollywood is forging aheadwith plans to build a giant hotel in Times Square that will feature Hollywoodthemed rooms and suites You can sleep in a bed just like LindaBlairs in The Exorcist  In order to build this hotel PlanetHollywood announced last week that it will raise  million by sellingsevenyear bonds And Bear Stearns which is handling the deal is confidentit will be able to sell them One analyst told the Wall Street Journal I think its going to go all right After all its only  million            Ah yesWhats a couple of hundred million dollars among friends            Or take Pan Am This isnt the Pan Am whose oldcarryon bags are all the rage with urban hipsters This is the tiny Floridaairline that owns the Pan Am trademark now which went bankrupt last month butnow looks as if its going to be taken over by a soccer team owner from theformer Yugoslavia Pan Am has nevernever that isturned a profit and whenit filed for Chapter  it had  million in assets including the value ofthe name and  million in liabilities If Pan Am were a dog it would beput to sleep But the odds are that it will be resurrected and chew up somemore capital            You cantell hundreds of similar stories about the real estate market where a hugeconstruction boom in suburban office space continues even though no one seemsto know how the space will be filled in an economy growing as moderately asours is And still more about the market for initial public offerings whichafter a mild slump last fall is booming again We seem to have reached thepoint where any company that wants to go public can even if it has neverreported anything remotely resembling earnings And if its an Internet companygoing public fuhgeddaboutit Go ahead and buy the Ferrari            As                   Slate               s Michael Lewis haspointed out Silicon Valley now offers the curious spectacle of capitalism withtoo much capital But the same spectacle seems to be on display throughout thecountry Certainly since the Asian economies collapsed enormous amounts offoreign capital have poured into the United States even as domestic capitalhas been more likely to stay at home Americans are not saving significantlymore But the flood of money into mutual fundswhere all the money is turnedinto investment capital as opposed to savings accounts that require apercentage to be held in bank reserveshas given fund managers more money thanthey know what to do with With the market on a seemingly unstoppable risefund managers feel the need to stay fully invested which means thateventually even struggling companies will come back into favor Theres justtoo much money out there for them not to            Thereare though a couple of problems with this picture First the concept of toomuch capital is a kind of macroeconomic impossibility If the supply ofcapital truly exceeds demand the rate of return will drop until the supplyshrinks Second the idea that too much capital can be a bad thing makes littlesense in a world where investment is the key to economic growth So the imageof lovelorn investors chasing standoffish borrowers cant really be right atleast not for the economy as a whole And in fact there is no shortage ofwouldbe borrowers Consumer debt is nearing alltime highs The junk bondmarket is booming with companies issuing  billion in junk bonds last yearIn the subprime loan market people pay interest rates of more than  percentand risk their houses to get access to capital And although government bondrates have dropped over the past two years the real interest rate is stillhigh today relative to the s There is a demand then to match the supplyThe only problem is that this may not be such a good thing            What an economy really wants after all is notmore investment per se but better investment It wants capital to flow tocompanies that will create valuenot in the form of a rising stock price butin the form of more goods for less cost more jobs and rising wagesbyenhancing productivity In the absence of an omniscient central plannerthough the way to get better investment is to get more investment The PlanetHollywoods are the price we pay for the Intels and Gillettes            In the short term thoughits possible to get too many Planet Hollywoods and not enough Intels This iswhy Japanese banks continued to pump money into overbuilt Southeast Asian realestate and Korean chaebols and why a third of all the junk bonds issued inthe late s ended up defaulting Markets get caught in selfperpetuatingcycles of undue optimism and hysterical panic The consequences are neverpretty which is whats so troubling about the ever rising stock market thebooming junkbond market and the real estate boom            This is an economy afterall that is doing well but not great that is still growing slowly inhistorical terms and that has still not shown significant evidence of a realboom in productivity with the notable exception of the manufacturing sectorYet investors are acting not simply as if there were only sunny skies ahead butalso as if every company every investment were going to enjoy the warmth ofthe sun And this means that capital is not playing its necessary discipliningrole You cant fuel real economic growth with indiscriminate credit You canonly fuel it with wellallocated longterm investment Unfortunately thats aprinciple that doesnt seem to be at work in a capital market that just cantsay no
