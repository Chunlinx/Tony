                                 A Blair Witch Bitch            No selfrespecting cultural critic could resist a potshot at Time andNewsweek for putting The Blair Witch Project on theircoverseven though it is the best movie showing at the moment So heregoes The media are right to hype this movie but theyre hyping it for thewrong reasons Theyre playing it as a breakthroughinmarketingstorysmalltime filmmakers hit on bigtime strategywhen its actually the oldest marketing story in thehistory of culture scaring and delighting audiences and making oneself richand famous by pushing back the boundaries of what is commonly thought of asrealistic            This would be a fairly obvious thought to have if you saw the movie as Idid in the eastern Catskills a few miles away from the outlandishMoorishstyle mansion called Olana built by the richest and most famous inhis day of the Hudson River School of painters Frederick Edwin Church On the one hand Church was as much of a marketing genius as theBlair Witch distributors are said to be His bestknown painting is agiant canvas of the Ecuadorian mountains called Heart of the Andes  which he displayed as if it were a theater of the real untoitself He had it framed by heavy curtains surrounded by semicircular benchesand lit by gaslight so people could sit and stare at it at night as if inattendance at a play He charged a quarter per visitor and handed out operaglasses or special metal tubes so viewers could pick out this detail and thatone This was a whole new way to exhibit art and it made him not only the mostnotorious artist in Americathe Steven Spielberg of his generationbut alsothe first mere artist who could afford to build a mansion on what was then thesuperritzy Hudson            The painting that makes Church worth remembering though came two yearsearlier when he took the most overrepresented theme in American art to dateNiagara Falls and convinced everybody theyd never seen it before Inretrospect Churchs style doesnt seem realistic at all at least as we tendto mean the word today He left out the factories and hotels that lined thebanks of the tourist trap as well as the thousands of visitors whorubbernecked there every year But his painting felt more real than what hadcome before it because it was bigger and wider and more maniacally detailedand because every brushstroke contributed to the general sense of the watersferocious power as it rushed to the edge Coming as it did not long after theinvention of photography Niagara Falls exploited that reigningconvention of the real to communicate a sense of what lay beyond realitythedivine forces just under the surface of things there for America to harness onits way to its Manifest Destiny                           The Blair Witch Project is more Niagara Falls thanHeart of the Andes  The reason its so scary is that it feels so realeven though being a work of  supernaturalism it breaks all the rules ofsocalled reality The reason it feels so real is because it uses the latestsignifier of realismhome videoand not just because its the style of themoment the reason most music video makers employ the technique but becauseits the best way to get across the filmmakers Gothic vision of the world justoutside your doorthe nameless evil just beyond the video cameras little poolof light Oddly as visions go its not depressing in the least Whatsdepressing is critics who celebrate a movie like this for its commercialrather than its aesthetic triumphs
