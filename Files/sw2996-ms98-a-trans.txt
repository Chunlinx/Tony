              well i always think im paying too much taxes how about you   yeah oh definitely  seems like     although at least Texas doesnt have a state income tax yet i mean you know they keep threatening us that maybe therell be a day that theyre going to uh enact this i think uh the um other means of providing income for the state have been dwindling so they keep trying to say we may need a uh state income tax   yeah i think that uh we probably will have to have to uh have a state income tax because uh Texans dont approve of such things as lotteries uh uh well i i come i come here from New York and New York had a state lottery and it really raised a lot of money for the for the state   uhhuh   uh although we in New York we had to pay a state and a city uh tax and it was really a great relief when i got to Texas that i didnt have to pay that city income tax though   yeah makes quite a bit of difference in your uh well your income level you know because other states take chunk quite a bit a chunk out for uh city and state taxes so youre uh looking at your yearly salary it makes quite a difference   right it sure does make make a difference   a little more take home here   uhhuh do you live in Dallas   yeah Richardson area   oh you do oh   yeah i work at uh well mainly the Expressway Site is where i work   oh i do too   oh okay   okay and then you know too that uh taxes are are less like if you live in Mesquite   yeah   you know some people will go shopping in Mesquite at the malls out there uh   or up to Collin County somewhere that youre getting out of the um Dallas County area because what do we pay like eight and a half percent something like that for the uh sales tax   uhhuh eight point five umhum   which yeah that really is pretty high   is it the same is it uh less in Collin County than it is in Dallas County   i think so although i really i dont go up there too much i mean i i normally just kind of go to Richardson Square Mall or Valley View Mall just kind of for the convenience uh   yeah   i guess maybe if i was going to buy a car or something maybe i would consider where i was buying it to try to you know save a little bit on that sales tax because on a car that really matters kind of mounts up   umhum umhum yeah it sure did and then once you could deduct at least some of that um off off your income tax and you cant do that anymore   yeah   it really hit me yesterday i had uh air conditioning service for my car done and i had a little little uh coupon special that was twenty two dollars for um air conditioning service where they   uhhuh   uh checked it and charged recharged it and put one one pound of freon in and if you needed another pound of freon they gave it it was like seven dollars and something and then with the with the twenty two dollars and the seven something it all came out to i i ended up paying like thirty four dollars and i couldnt believe it and it the tax you know really hits you   yeah yeah thats true although i wish i wish you know overall theyd try the lottery again when did you first come to Texas   umhum and then oh its been ive been here for nine years   okay well thats about the same time as me i came down in eighty two   really whered you come from   um well Ohio kind of my parents live in Ohio i had lived a little while in Michigan but you know basically i went to high school and college in Ohio and lived there uh more years than i ever did in Michigan   oh uhhuh umhum umhum well uh i did visit uh Michigan i visited Kalamazoo once my sister used to live there   oh okay but you know when we first came down here i really thought this place was somewhat backward i mean i was just shocked that we couldnt shop on Sunday   uhhuh thats true i tell you what hit me the first year i was here uh Christmas eve in New York there used to be stores open the department stores wouldnt close uh   remember that   well id say they closed maybe eight or nine oclock the department stores on Christmas eve but uh there were stores that you could go to uh you know like discount stores and   uhhuh   and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to and you could shop till like twelve or one oclock that night and that was like that was really the only night they were open that late but it was Christmas eve and when i came to Dallas   uhhuh   i thought i was going to do that Christmas eve and i couldnt find hardly anything open  after five oclock in the afternoon and i was oh i was i really i really was stuck     were you shocked like oh no im stuck i need to buy stuff   and i think Target was the one that stayed open later than anybody anybody else and uh i was able to pick up a few things in there but boy i was i was really shocked and then another shock i had  well when i went to uh to buy a slice of pizza and found out that i had to buy the whole pie   uhhuh oh few places now seem to do it by the slice but   yeah now but they but back then they didnt when i first came no   right   anyway   well the the uh there was other things too i mean i think its taken us Yankees influence down here to get them to uh come to the the the you know the correct decade here and century um       yeah   i couldnt believe that you could have open containers of beer or alcohol whatever in the car   right right   i mean you could always um uh be careful about that back then because uh you know if you if a cop stopped you then you would um you know get arrested or whatnot and people would just drink openly   uhhuh uhhuh it yeah and talk a talking about alcohol and beer look at the taxes on that and the taxes on a package of of cigarettes i used to smoke you know and uh     uhhuh   that would have been enough to to make me me give them up the price of them now but i gave them up couple a couple years ago because i had some sinus problems   oh well i dont smoke so i dont really know what the taxes are and stuff on it   well well theyre like two or i i believe theyre hitting two dollars a pack now   um   maybe a little bit a little bit a little bit more in some places   so you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes   uh well i believe its a little more than twelve dollars for a carton i think its maybe thirteen or something   huh gee   uh because i remember we went to to Oklahoma to this this bingo place this Choctaw bingo uh a couple weeks ago and somebody that went with me bought a carton for uh uh ten dollars and something and they really thought they were getting a big discount   theyre cheaper there   well because its you know the Indians i dont think they pay tax   oh   in in Oklahoma   oh i got you okay   and uh it was a Indian it well its a bingo hall for the benefit of the Indians there although i didnt see very many Indian people in there  there were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because its its   uhhuh   the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth  i won a dollar  yeah i had fun uh couple people on the bus won some money one one guy won two   well howd you do a dollar oh well but you had fun playing right
