                well um i dont have strong feelings about changes to be made in the uh jury system do you   uh not at all in fact im graduating from college in about a week and this past semester ive taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials   oh well then you must know a lot more about this than i do           um i think i think uh the system the system right now you know should you know is fine i think it should be by a jury i dont think the judge should have i mean hes just there kind of like the referee   umhum umhum   uh i dont i dont even think that it should be unanimous either um   well what about the idea that one is only guilty uh when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt i thought that was the point of uh a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees   umhum   then there shouldnt be any reasonable doubt but if there are some people who dont agree   right exactly   um then there must be it seems to be there must be at least a reasonable doubt for some people   uhhuh um i dont know i uh you you rarely hear you hear of course theres cases where someone has been put in in in uh prison uh falsely accused but uh more than likely the people that are on the the jury know what theyre doing um i mean you   really have you served on a jury   never   i never have either but my friends my few friends who have uh say just the opposite they say theyre uh remarkably incompetent and uh dont know what theyre doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out and to to air and all that   huh well you would think that they would get that in the uh when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out and i i i know they automatically when you go through uh when youre chosen is youre automatically like a a a professor in criminal justice or something like that that youre automatically no they dont want you on the jury   right in other words they dont want anyone with experience anyone with particular experience or knowledge of the legal system   exactly uhhuh exactly uh   and they tend and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they dont want to do it i mean you know its its anyone can get out of jury just about and uh so it its um its not really my peers that if i were arrested lets say i were arrested falsely or not   umhum   and put up for a jury i wouldnt feel that uh i would be being tried by a jury of my peers id be i mean id be tried by a jury of you know people who had nothing else to do and werent very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things and uh i dont know i i get a little bit nervous about it and uh   umhum ive ive never ive never even been called to jury duty   yeah i i was called once but i was out of the country and apparently i apparently they thought i served so i didnt i didnt make any noise about it       i came back and they said the record showed i served but i was out of the country at the time so im pretty sure i didnt       um   yeah i um i dont know i think the i guess theres a lot of problems with the legal system     yeah well i  i i dont know i definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous because um you know theres the classic sort of To Kill A Mockingbird kind of story where you get you know jury which   umhum   can have all kinds of prejudices and things that a judge at least officially isnt supposed to have though of course they can too   umhum   and um it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much browbeat you know browbeat the jury a majority in the of the a majority of the jury thats hard to say um   umhum   so its its uh you know saying well look we dont like the way he looks and lets uh lets throw the rascal in jail and stuff   right   and you also get a lot of um juries are extremely uh and from what i hear i i have i have some friends who do expert wist witness testimony and they say that uh juries are extremely vulnerable to uh sort of emotional pitches you know the prosecutor will want to uh oh i dont know show the show the mugging victim you know show what the nice person he was and what a family life and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim and uh or or uh if its a corporation that was uh you know harming harming some individual or something like that they get very much well you know its just a big faceless company corporation lets lets make them pay as much as possible things like that   umhum   so not i i mean im the problem is i cant guarantee that a judge judge would be necessarily be much better than a jury but id be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be on things like that   right i um i uh i dont i i dont think the judge should just make the decision alone least with the jury you have twelve people you know   yeah umhum   that are gonna decide you know youre the the persons fate   well how about having a jury jury and a judge work together on it somehow i wonder if thats possible i guess the judges time is worth too much though   uh exactly i was talking about judge     they pay that judge they pay those jury members very little money compared to that judge  he makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together   right exactly probably yeah yeah but um no its its sad though that um that the people though that you you somebodys life is in twelve peoples hands and sometimes those twelve people could care less   umhum umhum   and uh or they fool the the defense in thinking that theyre you know because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want   oh of course its its political maneuvering the the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will you know want to hang everyone and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic theyre not looking for someone whose going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror neither side wants that they want to find a juror thats going to uh be most persuadable by their arguments you know   exactly   um i wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually i mean i know it it its tricky because i know you know an awful lot of intelligent people who just well im too busy to serve on a jury so ill tell them that and they wont   uhhuh   or just you know just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that you know they just say do you believe in such and such um   oh yeah well i guess its just that maybe people are you know upset at court you know if it was if it was a a family member of theirs though that was innocent and then theyd want to be on that jury   right course theyd be they would be barred but     but uh if everyone would take it i think if everyone took it seriously   umhum   and um i mean something you have to do   yeah well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury i i hope were called up before too long   yeah i would love to be called im ready to go  they j ust havent called me up yet   they will they will eventually       okay well it was nice talking with you   it was nice talking to you   byebye   byebye
