              so what do you think about mandatory public service   well um um personally i think its good   uhhuh   i think um theres a lot of things that that um you can learn from helping other people and doing things that need to be done and as i look around i see most of the things that i enjoy like i just got back from vacation and the freeways were were built by somebody else paid by somebody else and and um wouldnt hurt to do some of that myself   right were you ever in the military or public service of any kind   i i did a two and a half um  two and a half year volunteer um how shall i say it uh service in the Far East for my church   oh really   yeah   what denomination   uh Latter Day Saint church   uhhuh   and um so it was it was um it was a great uh thing and and i know some other people that whove that have um come back from that and joined the Peace Corps and you know went on uh contributing and and like i say in every case uh they benefited and im they have lifelong happy memories about about uh the things that they did now does that mean that everybody is going to have happy memories well  i dont know but in Europe and in many states in Europe they do the same thing they they want everybody to to uh not necessarily join the military military but have you know mandatory uh volunteer service of some kind   right   so how about you   i think its also a good idea people that ive i was just thinking this morning about how are you there   yes   okay hi um i was just thinking this morning about how people tend to get off into a to one narrow track and one narrow focus and dont get an opportunity to go out and look and experience other people and other ways of doing things so in particular i was thinking about up in lately visiting around to a lot of different congregations and the preachers that ive heard that have just grown up and stayed into one particular denomination are not nearly as good and um expansive as the ones that have come from a different denomination to the one theyre in now so in terms of having life experience and a better appreciation for other people and other points of view i think the mandatory volunteer service is a great thing great idea the problem is that as you say not everybody will have a great experience       the ones that are wanting to do it tend to have great experiences though some of our friends that joined the Peace Corps have been really lonely   yeah well well thats part of the how shall i say it thats part of the experience i think because not every oh how shall i say it not every uh not every place we go has has great weather i uh you know sometimes you come back and and you say um that was an interesting trip  but i guess what im saying is that that overall the the benefits of of uh volunteer service uh are just infectious they they get you remember the people you helped and its not all money money money money   right   and uh its really useful to to making you well like i say feel like you contribute i know after i spent my time in the Far East i came back and i said well of all the bad things ive done in my life and of all the times i wimped out and havent done anything at least ive done something for that period of time   uhhuh   and uh you know its um how shall i say it its not a cure all but uh   right   the other thing that ive that i like i say i feel is that theres a a lot of people out there that that just have tons of time and uh they dont know what theyre going to do with their life and and as you pointed out if theyve get out and see if uh uh life from a from a different uh perspective then uh  they have a better focus   uhhuh   and and lets see what else i i think the only difficulty is going to be um if it becomes well i think wed have to learn a lot from the European uh style uh because i know that in America theres sometimes theres a tendency to let everybody do their own thing to the point that that uh it might become
