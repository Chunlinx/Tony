  uhhuh   but it seems as though if you really want to set a time side time to read the Bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading   uhhuh yeah it does it   and i i been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart and he really has its getting to where a just really want to read it   thats good thats good it it  its uh its hard for me to find time also to read uh a lot of times i do just read magazines and stuff like that for for you know because i dont have a lot of time but when i do get to sit down and and read i like to read the Bible and i like to read i read to my daughter a lot too   do you   and uh i like to read you know Bible i have Bible storybooks so i like reading those to her and she really enjoys those   uhhuh

like that because its a its real easy to   uhhuh   uh follow for her you know uh gosh if if i read straight out of the Bible to her shed  never understand any of it   well its hard for me   thats right       it is it is real hard to to follow and understand and   uhhuh   uh ive got a Bible that uh has a little bit of a uh a glossary in the back and it helps explain who people are thats thats about the hardest thing is whos related to who   i know it and especially its hard to keep your interest in those begats   yeah yes yes it sure is but but it is good reading and its good for us and

uhhuh i love that book though i thought it was great   yeah it really was and i loved The Shining   ooh yes   that was that was my favorite   oh those hedges when they started moving whenever they  they made that into a movie i was thinking oh my gosh if they show that ill just die for some reason that scared me more than anything   yeah yeah yeah yeah that is he just brings stuff alive you know you could just visualize everything thats   yeah and that was a pretty scary movie too   yeah i think they did a pretty good job but  they didnt follow it exactly but they did give it you know do it justice   yeah uhhuh thats right   but uh most of the time they dont with when follow books very well when they ma ke them into movies   yeah thats true i liked it as well   yeah yeah uh i did too
