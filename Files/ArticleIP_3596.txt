                                 Why History Is on Clintons Side in the Impeachment Fight            After weeks of televisedpalaver the legal division of the Flytrap commentariat has given up Indetermining grounds for impeachment the Constitution just isnt much helpArticle II Section  allows for the presidents removal if the Senate convictshim of treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors But how highis high Clearly high crimes was referring to serious serious crimes liketreason and bribery which are examples said one legal pundit on PBSNewsHour With Jim Lehrer  In other words no one really knows            Thisleaves history as our only guide Unfortunately for scholars if fortunatelyfor presidents Congress has undertaken impeachment proceedings against onlytwo chief executives Andrew Johnson  acquitted and Richard Nixon resigned That doesnt yield much in the way of precedent Then again therarity of impeachment proceedings may itself be a sort of precedent If soPresident Clinton should relaxbecause given what we know so far hes onpretty firm ground            The first and only presidential impeachment trialJohnsons has generally been viewed as a partisan vendetta by the RadicalRepublicans in Congress The Radicals who favored the abolition of slavery andsupported black suffrage despised Johnson for his timid plans for readmittingthe South to the Union after the Civil War Johnson a Tennessee populist whothought blacks inferior to whites wanted to give Southern states wide latitudein shaping their own laws and governments regardless of the consequences forthe freed slaves He vetoed key pieces of Reconstruction legislation includingan  bill that would have granted basic civil rights to blacks and heopposed the  th Amendment Political warfare ensued            Althoughthe Republicans once drew the scorn of historiansthey were seen asintemperate ideologuessince the s theyve mostly been cast as the goodguys in the Reconstruction fight Changing attitudes toward race in the lastgeneration have helped overhaul the old interpretation of Reconstruction as abad idea gone wrong Except that is on the impeachment episode Here eventhe acknowledged wisdom of the Republicans Reconstruction plans hasnt changedthe consensus that they acted from partisan motives            The impeachment fight began when theRepublicans in their tug of war with Johnson passed some dubious laws thatshifted power from the president to Congress One the  Tenure of OfficeAct prohibited presidents from firing their own Cabinet members anotherrequired that Johnson deliver all his military orders via Gen Ulysses SGrant When Johnson removed his secretary of war Edwin M Stanton on Feb  the Radicals struck They passed  articles of impeachment ninerelating to these two laws Two other articles accused Johnson of ignoring ordisgracing Congress            TheSenate trial focused on Stantons removal the most substantive charge Johnsonoffered a somewhat contradictory defense On the one hand his lawyers saidLincoln not Johnson had appointed Stanton and so the Tenure of Office Actdidnt apply on the other hand they claimed Johnson had deliberatelyflouted the law to test it in the Supreme Court Still the case againstJohnson was weak It was hard to construe the act of a president firing his ownsubordinate as a high crime Johnson was in the last year of his term anywayand when he passed word that hed stop obstructing the RepublicansReconstruction plans his survival seemed assured In the end the Radicalsvoted to convict while the Democrats and seven moderate Republicans voted toacquit Impeachment fell one vote short of the required twothirds of theSenate though other Republicans would have supported Johnson if necessary            In resting their case on an alleged violation of the lawand not on policy differences the Republicans conceded that impeachment had toamount to more than a parliamentarystyle vote of no confidence BeforeJohnson this had been an open question after him it wasnt Further theRadicals defeat suggested that successful impeachment charges against thepresident would have to allege substantial crimes on his part Allegations ofcriminal wrongdoing that essentially served to cover for political differenceswouldnt be likely to topple a presidenteven if they were technicallyaccurate            Johnsonssurvival combined with the passage of  years made impeachment by the timeof Watergate seem like an altogether unlikely scenariothe equivalent ashistorian Stanley Kutler has written of a nuclear first strike In retrospectof course Watergate has come to mean the vast tapestry of that began tounravel with the June  breakin of the Democratic National Committeeheadquarters But as late as the spring of  the scope of thesemisdeedsincluding critical details about Nixons involvementremainedunclear So improbable did impeachment seem that April that Nixons AttorneyGeneral Richard Kleindienst defied Congress to try it confident it wouldrelent            As Nixons troubles worsened however hiscritics grew bold After the July  disclosure that Nixon had taped his OvalOffice conversations Democrat Robert Drinan of Massachusetts introduced thefirst impeachment resolution in the House October brought the Saturday NightMassacrein which Nixon had to fire his attorney general and deputy attorneygeneral in order to get rid of Special Prosecutor Archibald Coxand four moreimpeachment bills including one introduced by a Republican After months ofnew disclosures including the release of transcripts of damning White Houseconversations the House Judiciary Committee began impeachment deliberations inearnest on May   By July nine fencesitting members of CongresstwoSouthern Democrats and seven Republicanswere ready to endorse some form ofimpeachment articles            Thecommittee held its final deliberations from July  through July  July it voted  to pass the first article of impeachment which focused onobstruction of justice paying hush money to the Watergate burglars usingthe CIA to block the FBIs Watergate investigation lying to Congress and toinvestigators and otherwise covering up crimes Two days later it passed asecond equally devastating article by a  vote This abuse of powerarticle charged Nixon with having the Internal Revenue Service audit hisenemies spying on private citizens setting up the Plumbers unit that brokeinto the Watergate office building and antiwar activist and Pentagon Papersauthor Daniel Ellsbergs psychiatrists office and otherwise using federalagencies for personal and political advantage Finally on July  thecommittee passed a third slightly weaker article  which charged thepresident with having willfully disobeyed subpoenas Two other articlesurgingNixons impeachment for concealing the bombing of Cambodia and for taxevasionwent down to defeat moderate Democrats wanted to play only theirstrongest cards That didnt matter much though Nixon knowing he was lickedresigned  days later            While Johnsons survival deterred members of Congress fromconsidering impeachment in Watergate Nixons ouster has had the oppositeeffect emboldening Clintons foes Watergate remains for many an unhealedwound and Clintons critics delight in needling him with Watergatecomparisonswhether to Whitewater or Flytrap Impeachment once taboo nowseems like a legitimate weapon a way to settle the score The principle ofMutually Assured Destruction after all dictated that once nukes are launchedretaliation becomes much easier            Still ifthe relative freshness of Watergate works against Clinton the enormity of itworks in his favor In effect Nixons misdeeds  so dwarf Clintonseven themost severe charges of suborning perjurythat Republicans could wind upbollixed They are left either arguing preposterously that Clintons crimesare just as bad as Nixons or claiming that Nixons crimes far exceeded thethreshold for impeachable offenses and shouldnt be the standard for judgingClintons In this situation Johnsons impeachment looms as the operativeprecedent a case of men who despised and battled their presidentperhaps withgood reasonbut whose zeal in pursuing flimsy impeachment charges turned thejudgment of history against them                           If youmissed the links in the article you can
