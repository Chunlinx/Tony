                                  Wag the Doubt            Did President Clinton wag the dog by bombing Iraqon the eve of the House impeachment debate Politicians and pundits launchedthe rhetorical war over that question even before the first missiles fell inBaghdad While the damage mounts in Iraq the debate at home is draggingpolitics to new depths Heres a glossary of the debaters latest tactics inmorally descending order                            OvertCynicism The politician accuses Clinton of wagging the dog ExampleIt is obvious that he is doing this for political reasons Rep GeraldSolomon RNY                                                         Cynicism by innuendo The accuser phrases the dogwaggingcharge obliquely so that he can deny having made it Example We have hadeither hostilities or threatened hostilities at interesting times throughoutthe last year incoming House Speaker Bob Livingston                            Backhandedcynicism The accuser implies dogwagging by saying either a he cantbring himself to believe Clinton would wag the dog or b the White House hasassured him its not so Example While I have been assured by administrationofficials that there is no connection with the impeachment process  boththe timing and the policy are subject to question Senate Majority LeaderTrent Lott                                           Cynicism aboutprinciple The accuser argues that because Clinton is inherentlyunprincipled any seemingly principled behavior on his part is fishy ExampleClinton must have bombed Iraq to avoid impeachment because how else toexplain the sudden appearance of a backbone that has been invisible up to nowSolomon                            Cynicism by association Theaccuser doesnt allege a causal relationship between the impeachment processand the bombing but he blames Clinton for the correlation anyway ExamplePresident Clinton has indelibly associated a justified military response with his own wrongdoing  Clinton has now injected the impeachment processagainst him into foreign policy and vice versa Jim Hoagland WashingtonPost                             Vicariouscynicism Rather than stand behind his cynicism the accuserattributes it to others Example It is dangerous for an American president tolaunch a military strike however justified at a time when many will concludehe acted only out of narrow selfinterest to forestall or postpone his ownimpeachment  Wall Street Journal editorial                                           Fake idealism aboutcynicism The accuser says other peoples cynicism makes it impossiblefor Clinton to govern well Example The point is not whether this presidentwould wag the dog  but for some significant portion of the population there must be that doubt And that doubt is the crucial nexus  Apresident must have credibility when he makes decisions about peace or warformer Reagan lawyer Peter Wallison New York Times oped                            Fakepatriotism about cynicism Democrats say Republicans who accuseClinton of wagging the dog are inadvertently aiding and comforting theenemy Example Shame on you Republicans for playing into the hands ofSaddam Rep Martin Meehan DMass                                           McCarthyism aboutcynicism Democrats say Republicans who accuse Clinton of wagging thedog are deliberately aiding and comforting the enemy Example The GOPsremarks were as close to a betrayal of the interests of the United States asIve ever witnessed in the United States Congress Sen Robert TorricelliDNJ                            Recidivistcynicism Having accused Republicans of cynicism for suggesting thatClinton cynically used the Iraq conflict to delay the impeachment voteDemocrats use the conflict to delay the vote Example The House should nottake up impeachment until the hostilities have ended It shouldnt come up aslong as our troops are in harms way House Minority Leader RichardGephardt                                           Cynicism aboutcynicism While publicly accusing Republicans of tactics aimed atgaining political advantage Democrats privately gloat that the tactics willgive Democrats a political advantage Example  The rules weve always had isthat politics stop at the shore one senior White House official saidspeaking on the condition of anonymity Somebody changed the rules and itwasnt us But Clinton advisers said that they expected Mr Lotts comments tobackfire  New York Times                             Reversecynicism While accusing Clinton of invoking the Iraq conflict todelay the impeachment vote Republicans invoke the Iraq conflict to expeditethe impeachment vote Example I dont see any reason to postpone the voteThat plays right into Saddam Husseins hands Thats what terroristswantdisruption Rep Bill McCollum RFla                                           Cynicalanticynicism While accusing Democrats of cynicism for suggestingthat impeachment would undermine the war effort Republicans argue thatimpeachment is the best way to honor the war effort Example As those troopsare engaged now even now defending  the Constitution of this nation theyhave a right to know that the work of the nation goes forward And inconsideration of this it is our intention Mr Speaker to begin considerationof impeachment House Majority Leader Dick Armey                            Circularvicarious cynicism Unable to prove that Clinton wagged the dogRepublicans argue that the mere suspicion of dogwagging is grounds forimpeachment Examples The suspicion some people have about the presidentsmotives in this attack is itself a powerful argument for impeachment ArmeyPerceptions that the American president is less interested in the globalconsequences than in taking any action that will enable him to hold onto powerare a further demonstration that he has dangerously compromised himself inconducting the nations affairs and should be impeached  Wall StreetJournal editorial
