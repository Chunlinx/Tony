                    Background        Microarrays are a powerful tool to investigate        differential gene expression of thousands of genes of a        cell type tissue or organism      While traditional        microarray experiments strive to establish the global        view of the activity of         all genes ie the genome in        response to environmental conditions they may also be used        to characterize and quantitatively describe gene expression        behavior of a selected set of genes as a true genotypic        correlate of a particular phenotype Applicationtargeted        arrays and array reagents are already commercially        available Operon Clontech Incyte Pharmaceuticals        Affymetrix for research in diverse areas such as cancer        stress and aging toxicology hematology cell cycle        neurology and apoptosis Contrary to genomewide chips        customfabricated microarrays are less expensive and more        readily adapted to the economically sensitive environment        of the molecular diagnostics laboratory where relatively        few interrogations are relevant for clinical investigation        of a patient specimen        Because typical microarray results are usually burdened        with substantial amounts of noise     rigorous        statistical methods must be applied to interpretation of        data Methods for systematically addressing noise in the        analysis of the microarray data are only beginning to be        described           Such noise in microarray        experiments may arise from nonspecific hybridization of        the labeled samples to elements printed on the microarray        printtip effects slide inhomogeneities and variability        in RNA isolation purity labeling and detection                Among these hybridization variance contributes        most significantly to the overall variation            Nonspecific hybridization can be measured through the        use of specificity controls on the microarray and addressed        as a statistical problem      The most common        strategy in microarray experiments is to focus on        fluorescent signal ratios in twocolor competitive        hybridization experiments The problem with using ratio        data alone is that it does not take into account the        absolute signal intensity measurements used to calculate        the ratios While this approach may work adequately for        ratios of moderate to highly expressed genes that yield        bright fluorescent signals weak signals arising from low        transcript levels may be masked or biased by noise        nonspecific hybridization Nonspecific hybridization is        a characteristic of cDNA microarray hybridization and may        be attributed to the uniform hybridization condition        applied for all sequences on the chip       The        frequently used fold change threshold values of  to        define a significant change are often arbitrarily chosen        and do not take into account the statistical significance        of absolute signal intensity For example microarray data        showing a fold change derived from low signal intensities        may have no statistical significance whereas a  fold        change derived from strong signal intensities may be highly        significant in terms of reflecting actual changes in mRNA        concentration within a biological sample Thus focusing on        foldchanges alone is insufficient and confidence        statements about differential expression must take into        account absolute signal intensities     In this study        we have adapted a statistical method that utilizes absolute        signal intensities from a reference set of positive        controls and negative nonhomologous control sequences to        determine the absolute intensity range in each channel that        may be used with a certain confidence level on a particular        microarray to calculate expression ratios The method of        analysis proposed in this paper was originally developed        along with radar and detailed results go back to the area        of signal processing ROC curves have been used for many        years in numerous other areas including psychology             and other areas of medical diagnostics     For        this purpose diagnostic accuracy ROC curves have been used        to depict the pattern of sensitivities and specificities        observed when the performance of a diagnostic test is        evaluated at several different thresholds Here receiver        operating characteristic curves describe the ability of a        particular parameter eg fluorescence intensity to        discriminate between two conditions eg specific and        nonspecific hybridization We illustrate our approach        using gene expression data from a study comparing        expression profiles of highly invasive and poorly invasive        human melanoma cell lines     The goal of these        experiments is to identify candidate genes that may        regulate the invasive behavior of melanoma cells The area        under the ROC curve may be used to assess the quality of        individual microarray hybridizations which is particularly        important because the quality of microarray hybridization        can vary significantly      The statistical        evaluation of a reference set of genes to measure the        sensitivity and specificity of each microarray        hybridization reaction dramatically improves the ability to        quality control the resulting data a key requirement for        the use of microarrays in diagnostic applications Here we        propose the design of a prototype diagnostic microarray        with respect to control sequences and we show how a ROC        analysis using percentile ranks of specific and        nonspecific hybridization signals can be used to establish        signal detection thresholds and hybridization quality        assessments for each individual microarray experiment                    Results        The reliability of ratios measured to describe changes        in gene expression depends on the absolute signal        intensities While ratios from highly abundant transcripts        may be accurate rare transcripts give absolute intensities        that may be obscured by nonspecific hybridization Thus        both ratio and absolute signal intensity are important to        evaluate differential gene expression properly Calibrating        the appropriate signal and noise intensity thresholds for a        given microarray hybridization requires the analysis of a        set of positive and negative reference genes At low signal        intensities both reference groups yield overlapping signal        distributions Figure aand b Test signals from array         and  falling within the overlap region cannot easily be        categorized as either present or absent and calculating        ratios may lead to the identification of false positives        or false negatives Figure cand d        Traditionally cutoffs for microarrays have been        calculated from negative controls Here we compare three        widely used thresholds T         X  mean  T         X  median T         XSD  mean   standard deviations to        the ROC analyses derived threshold T         M  the threshold with maximum        specificity and senitivity T         M  obtained as the point of        intersection in figure  in terms of specificity Sp and        sensitivity Se Table  For T         X and T         X the Se is   however the Sp        would only be   indicating that approximately every        second signal would be a false positive arising from        nonspecific hybridization As a benefit however         of test genes would be included in data analyses Table         If T         XSD or T         M is the desired threshold the Sp can        be increased to  with only minor reductions in Se        however the tradeoff is an increase in the number of        genes excluded from analyses Table  If Sp and Se are        plotted as a function of the thresholds the intersection        point of the two curves indicates maximum Sp and Se which        can be directly read from the graph Figure  As the        criterion for a positive test becomes more stringent the        point on the curve corresponding to Sp and Se point c        Figure a point d Figure b moves down and to the left        lower Se higher Sp if less evidence is required for a        positive test the point on the curve corresponding to Sp        and Se point a Figure aand b moves up and to the right        lower Sp higher Se The area under the ROC curve Figure         Table  is a measure of how well positive and negative        signal can be distinguished in individual microarray        experiments and indicates hybridization quality        The discriminatory power of a threshold based on the        receiver operating characteristics depends on the proper        controls included in the study and this choice will affect        the interpretation of the data Unlike spots containing        printed control DNA plant bacterial or viral blank        spots printed with X SSC often show strong signals        indicating that unusually large amounts of label are        inexplicably deposited on these manifestly blank areas        The morphology of SSC spots giving relatively high signals        are quite distinct from spots where DNA has been deposited        often showing small highly concentrated areas of        fluorescence The cause of this fluorescence is not well        understood Their signal distribution is skewed towards        large signals as compared to plant bacterial and viral        genes data not shown Consequently the inclusion of SSC        spots results in a considerable overlap with positive        controls resulting in increased thresholds and a lower        overall discriminatory power Table         To illustrate the importance of signal threshold        detection we categorized differentially expressed genes of        the melanoma study    according to confidence based on        our predictive model Table  For this purpose we use T         M as the threshold Group A contains        gene expression ratios derived from signals that exceed the        selected threshold in both channels and are assigned high        confidence ratios In group B either Cy or Cy signals        were below that threshold whereas in group C signals from        both channels were below the defined detection limit        Risky absolute intensities can be flagged and displayed        when further processing the data eg clustering        analysis                    Discussion        Microarray data are generated from multistep        biochemical reactions scanningdata collection image        analysis and data processing This process is inherently        prone to variability that affects the specificity and        sensitivity of the assay thus requiring evaluation of each        microarray data set       In order to calibrate the        sensitivity and specificity of the output data appropriate        statistical tools applied to reference sequences composed        of positive and negative controls may be used to quality        control data from a given hybridization We argue that any        procedure which uses raw intensity ratios alone to infer        differential expression may be inefficient and thus may        lead to excessive errors        Since ratios are simply the result of uneven signal        distributions between Cy and Cy channels analyzing these        distributions will help interpret the biological relevance        of an observed ratio Signals are the result of specific        and nonspecific binding when a complex probe DNA mixture        is incubated on the slide surface containing target DNA        The quality of DNA microarray data rests on the ability to        measure nonspecific components of a spot signal and        eliminate them from ratio analysis Such a component        analysis on spotted DNA microarrays is not possible with        todays technology and the proportion of nonspecific        binding will vary for each spot because of competitive        binding in the presence of sequence specific hybridization        Note GeneChip arrays from Affymetrix using perfect vs        mismatch oligonucleotide pairs do to a certain extent        measure the nonspecific binding component of every        sequence see technical note discussing probe length and        performance        httpwwwaffymetrixcomsupporttechnicaltechnotesmertechnotepdf        Since the influence of nonspecific binding is more severe        for probes where no or little specific hybridization occurs            we treat the problem as one of detecting a        threshold value that is both determined by the highest        signals attributable to spots representing nonspecific        hybridization and the lowest signals from spots where        sequence specific hybridization must be assumed Simply        put we determine a threshold separating specific from        nonspecific hybridization assuming that the former usually        results in stronger signals than the latter     A        similar approach has been reported for Affymetrix GeneChip        arrays so called LUT based scoring system    tables        to check noise level of particular chips or noise filtering        look up tables        Methods used to determine a signal threshold include the        use of arbitrary fluorescence intensities     relative        errors in CyCy ratios      or certain        signaltobackground ratios     However these methods        lack information about the specificity and sensitivity of        the threshold which are crucial parameters for estimation        of the diagnostic accuracy of microarray hybridizations To        select a threshold we have exploited a reference set of        positive and negative control genes based on presence or        absence of their cognate labeled cDNAs in the hybridization        mix        Positive controls may be spiked RNAs from nonhomologous        species or transcripts known to be expressed in the sample        ie housekeepers      Signals from positive        controls should cover the range of test signals This can        be achieved by appropriate spiking andor selection of        housekeeping genes that fulfill this criterion        The negative controls should be chosen to lack sequence        homology to test genes however choosing appropriate        control sequences for a ROC plot analysis is crucial we        conclude that SSC spots show a distinct signal pattern        different from plant bacterial and viral DNA deposits        Unlike spots containing control DNA blank spots are not        representative of nonspecific hybridization to cellular        probe DNA do not behave well as control spots and should        be disregarded for threshold detection on custom        arrays        The robustness of ROC analysis to yield T         M and ROC area values to discriminate        good from poor microarray hybridizations relies on the        relative positions of signal ranges from positive and        negative controls as well as from target genes We can        imagine two szenarios making ROC analysis inappropriate for        determination of threshold andor microarray hybridization        quality i If the set of positive controls is in the high        signal range ROC analysis will yield a higher T         M and ROC areas close to  indicating        good microarray hybridization because positive and        negative signals are well separated irrespective of the        distance between the greatest observation in the negative        and the lowest observation in the positive sample        Consequently a large portion of target genes will be        discarded because of the relatively high T         M  ii Alternatively if the positive        controls are spiked below the detection limit of        microarrays ie typically  wtwt their signal        range may resemble the one from negative controls This        scenario will produce a low T         M and ROC areas close to  falsley        indicating poor hybridization        The overall performance of individual microarray        hybridizations can be assessed by the position of the        receiver operating characteristic line Figure  using one        single parameter the area under the ROC curve Table         Poor microarray hybridizations have lines close to the        rising diagonal or values  whereas the lines for        perfect hybridizations would rise steeply and pass        closely to the top left hand corner or values  where        both the specificity and sensitivity are  In        highthroughput applications such as routine diagnostic        examinations where a large number of hybridizations may be        performed using a standard microarraydesign the ROCplot        area may be used as a hybridization quality checkpoint to        either accept or discard individual microarray        hybridizations for example  for array  and  Table         The area under the ROC curve represents a summary        statistic of the overall performance of individual        microarray hybridizations A modification of the Wilcoxon        ranksum procedure may then be used as a statistical test        to determine whether two ROC curves are significantly        different            Among  thresholds calculated here we have compared Sp        and Se of  commonly used cutoffs with the ROC        analysisderived threshold T         M Table  The median or mean of a        negative control group is regarded an adequate measure for        nonspecific hybridization     however due to low        specificity  we conclude that neither thresholds        should be used if maximum specificity is required In such        a case we find that the widely used cutoff value defined        as the mean plus two standard deviations of the negative        reference sample may be used adequately for DNA        microarrays The underlying rationale of using this        threshold is to establish a cutoff value providing a        specificity of       In our own example Figure         skewness to the left makes the T         XSD overly conservative which will        sacrifice sensitivity unnecessarily Hence T         XSD may be inadequate and to adjust the        sensitivity one should use T         M  Most importantly the T         XSD procedure does not account for the        sensitivity of the threshold Although the ROCanalysis        derived cutoff resembles closely the cutoff defined as        the mean   SD it is entirely possible that choosing a        finergrained partition of the signal space would alter the        relative positions of theses two points Likewise this may        be a characteristic for the  exemplary microarrays        Usually the cutoff selection procedure is an informed        decision based on the motivation of the individual to        accept false positives high Sp or false negatives high        Se that takes into account whether it is crucial to        exclude any false positives high Sp or to cover the        broadest signal range possible high Se Which cutoff to        use depends on the objective of the experiment If one        needs to make sure that the present or absent call for        a particular gene is correct a cutoff with high Sp should        be chosen whereas if one is willing to accept        falsepositives where signals are low high Se will be the        driving force        The signal intensity is the most critical parameter that        influences the informative value of ratio estimates            Therefore ratios should be judged based on the absolute        signal intensity of each gene To diagnose the metastatic        potential of highly versus poorly invasive melanoma cells        we compared their gene expression profile with our        metastasis chip which contains genes critical for aspects        of the metastatic process including tumor cell motility        and the ability to form primitive tubular networks             Each ratio was tested for the Null hypothesis that        there is no difference between the means of the ranks of        the Cy and Cy signals over  replicate spots representing        a unique sequence At signal intensities below the        threshold with maximum specificity and sensitivity some        genes gave a ratio greater than fold at a confidence        level of p   In such a case however ratios are        not optimal estimators because the low denominator value        introduces large artifacts     Therefore we sought to        determine ratio confidence categories based on the absolute        signal intensities     Assuming that the ROCanalysis        derived threshold is an appropriate cutoff for        distinguishing absentpresent genes the proposed        confidence categories may be interpreted as follows        A The gene is present in both samples and this is the        best estimate of the true ratio while further statistical        evaluation should be applied to take into account the        variability of the measurements        B The gene is present in one sample and absent in the        other Ratios are meaningless but this is still an        extremely significant biological result        C The gene is absent in both samples Not only are the        ratios meaningless but so are the intensity estimates        As a result of threshold setting certain genes may be        falsely included false positives or less frequently            falsely discarded false negatives from further        analysis ie ratio calculations clustering analysis        etc as exemplified here with the microarray experiment        for investigating invasion in cancer The ROCderived        threshold correctly classifies the signal for Laminin         as absent whereas the mean or median derived        thresholds would produce a falsepositive result Since        this gene product plays a significant role in vasculogenic        mimicry     Classifying the expression level is        biologically crucial ROC analysis leads to a result Type        B above that is in line with data obtained otherwise        whereas both mean or median derived threshold would have        resulted in accepting falsely a change type A above in        Laminin  expression        Collectively the present study demonstrated that        microarrayderived signals from positive and negative        controls may be used to compute accurately type I and type        II errors for a series of signal thresholds We have        introduced a new model for signal threshold determination        for gene expression microarray experiments that greatly        eases the interpretation and comparison of these data This        model is based on analysis of signal intensities and        distributions of a reference set of positive and negative        controls included on each microarray It provides a        framework for determination of detection limits confidence        about fluorescent ratios and for preprocessing data for        subsequent data analyses such as cluster analyses                                Materials  Methods                  Synthesis of PCR products          IMAGE cDNA clones

Specificity Sp             j and Sensitivity Se             j obtained with each threshold value            T             j are calculated as the proportion            of positive results in the positive and negative            results in the negative reference group respectively            Note that these calculations are estimates of type I            and type II errors equivalent to  and  errors for            each threshold             Draw a ROC curve by plotting the false positive            rate or   specificity on the xaxis The yaxis            shows the true positive rate or sensitivity The area            under the ROC plot is an estimator of the            discriminatory power of selecting a cutoff and varies            from array to array The area of the ROC plot was            calculated as the sum of            Area                tn               tn               tn             where tn denotes the threshold n                 alpha error and  beta error For a
