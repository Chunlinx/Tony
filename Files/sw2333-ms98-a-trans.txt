        all right so were supposed to talk about food maybe well get a call back saying hey youre not youre not talking about food     um no no you can talk about anything you want these these things are just suggestions   yeah oh golly well i live in Dallas what what area do you live in   uh North Carolina   North Carolina oh really   it is boring here   oh really well   boring   in the Carolinas they did have uh huh and Jimmy Baker   um yes yes were     hes hes not a subject of great pride   oh yes its its one of our prouder  right along with Jessie Helms     oh yeah   i think i think they were pardon the phrase all in bed together or something   twins separated at birth kind of thing   yeah somebody somebody let the brains run out on the floor though   somebody dropped that baby when it was born  oh   yeah oh man Jim Bakker oh what a what a dangerous individual   i i i know uh how how did Jessie Helms get reelected thats thats what i want to know   thats a well thats a good question um   what does he do does he just do the people the are there just stupid people where you live or something okay   yeah basically yeah yeah thats   well   thats thats most of it and he plays very heavily on the race issue   oh yeah   and its still thats still a big thing here in this backwards state   yeah thats too bad because i mean ive been in the Carolinas and you know there are some places in the Carolinas its really nice there   uhhuh yeah my favorite place is Ashville its right over there in the mountains its a beautiful place   in  like yeah yeah   its just that you know i mean if you took all the people out of the state it would be a great place   yeah   these folks are so backwards its just ridiculous its pathetic   i i know i think literacy probably the biggest problem there   yeah and i i mean the papers are just full of all of this stuff about the educational system theyve been changing their standards and this that and the other and claiming this is going to make everything better   yeah   uh Durham the county right next to us big city   yeah   had an enormous jump in the uh in the SAT rate   oh really   and everybody was huh   howd they do that oh let me guess what they did they had classes on the SAT   oh no it was even worse than that they falsified the data   oh really oh Plano Plano started having   yeah just just students   Plano actually they went out and they had the where where i live they had the they had the classes on the SAT ive never heard anything so preposterous in my life           theyre preparing people for the test by having a class specifically for the test how ridiculous i mean of course it has the highest   right   SAT rate well it also has the highest teen suicide rate too so i mean that and this is national  i dont know where its all going to  where its all going to go   oh well   i dont know i dont i dont know whats i mean public education is just going down the tubes i mean theyre throwing more and more money at it and it just seems to be getting worse and worse   yeah and you know whats bad i mean like im going into you know an education related field and i just you know it just you know it really kills me you know i mean its it it really is a shame that you know you know United States somehow we spend more money on each student and the teachers are paid so little i mean i mean how do how do they figure that out   oh yeah i dont know thats thats the one thing that ive ive never been able to figure out why you can pay garbage men more than you can pay teachers   yeah   um   well the prestige of being a teacher is also pretty nil well i think a lot of that has to do with the fact that they say well since this is a woman dominated field we can treat them like dirt  you know   oh yeah yeah i guess   that that that must be the rationale for for where it comes from United States   it it must be i bet you know i i im not knocking the garbage men i mean theyre necessary but theres a lot of unemployed people out there who would gladly take jobs as garbage men rate for less money   yeah hey thats a hey thats a hard job to get really   it is   in in in Texas in Texas its hard because its almost like a father to son thing   yeah well its its its hard in New York too and i mean they get paid twenty eight thousand a year to start   gee thats thats ridiculous   and teachers only get paid twenty four   man id carry garbage for twenty eight thousand a year   you bet you you bet you   man i worked as a welder and i was you dont even get paid that much   man id id go out and dump garbage all the time for that kind of money   yeah   good exercise you get outside shoot   yep you have  dogs are your friends  knock over a can now and then and leave it open for the dogs you know   well     ah thats what my thats what my garbage man does       i went out the other morning and my my garbage can was sitting in the middle of my driveway                 jeez i get tired of this ive got a theres a nice little wooden platform out there for the garbage cans and then they throw them anywhere they want to   yeah yeah     and sometimes they dont even take everything that thats the biggest kick   oh so you live in the Carolinas huh   the Carolinas   uh do much skiing   no im not im not a fool   oh okay   uh   i im im not really impressed with i mean i lived in Germany for three years i i was im not impressed with skiing now i like i like other you know winter sports but im not real thrilled about them   i i its okay to watch people go out and break their legs but im not going to climb on a couple of pieces of wood and go racing down a slick mountain side i mean thats       ive got better things to do with my life   uh     when i uh when i was uh stationed in England i used the opportunity to travel around Europe a lot and one of my favorite places to go was Switzerland      uhhuh    uhhuh   and it was just great to sit out there in uh Zurich or Bern just sit in the sidewalk cafes      oh yeah the cafe um my my wife her favorite actually she was stationed at in in Germany with me too and   and   uh she she fell in love with Salzburg Austria   yeah Salzburg nice Austria nice Europe is nice   well well its well its such a its its it makes the Germans look like slobs i mean Austria and Switzerland do both but   yeah yeah really i mean Switzerland is so clean     oh   not even a scrap of paper on the ground you know   well they have these there these real like real strict laws you know they have to hose down the streets like every every other day or something   yeah yeah that its   pretty ridiculous   i loved it there though   yeah   i loved it   yeah i did i did like the food in Germany it was pretty good   um well i i like Europe except for Belgium   yeah i im i really dont know what the Belgians i mean they have do they really have an identity  or i mean i think they have they have an identity crisis a lot of these countries they they really dont know you know what supposed to do   no yeah i think i do because half of them are yeah half of them are Middle Eastern and the other half are French Expatriates   yeah umhum   and since i hate the French anyway       the Belgians try to act like the French   yeah   and i it was just miserable i hated that place       i hate it almost as much as i do France   oh my wife and i we had it when we drove through France we paid in tolls to go to Spain and we drove from Germany like the southern southwestern most part of Germany we drove on the tolls and we spent forty six dollars in tolls one way oh and it was like uh it was   yeah   it was about an eighteen nineteen hour drive   sure   oh God what a headache what a pain in the butt and   yeah   and the fuel was so expensive i mean i i just i cant believe i mean when we when we came back on our way back i mean       well my wife and i we first we were in Barcelona and we bought like we found this really great cafe that it was like a delicatessen   umhum   and we like we bought we filled a full a cooler full of food of all this delicatessen food  and then       we ate it all the way going up to the France because the food was so so bad and then when we came into Germany i had five centime left i mean thats like thats thats five one hundredths of a franc which is worth   yeah   it it was probably worth about a twentieth of a penny and and i mean i i i just about kissed the guard i mean when i got there he was like i was like were so happy to see you hes like youre sort of knew why   yeah couldnt even use it       yeah really i used to take the ferry over from Dover over to Calais and and drive across France uh horrible i only did that one time   yeah yeah i ive done that before uhhuh what well actually actually ive gone where were you stationed at in England     uh Mildenhall   oh really i was um i was TDY at Bent Waters   oh good old Bent Waters   for a little while yeah my brother my brother was stationed at Bent Waters for a long time   yeah thats a nice place   yeah   Bent Waters is a is a very nice little place nice little base out in the country   yeah   nobody messes with them a lot Mildenhall was pretty uh well it was big and it got a lot of attention   yeah   but uh        yeah Bent Waters Upper Hafford all those neat little places thats where i really wanted to be   hum    yeah my my brother got stationed eventually at Oxbridge he he really enjoyed it there and well well his his wife was British so they had   oh Oxbridge yeah   they had quite a good time   yeah Oxbridge is nice ah everywhere in England is nice   i mean a lot of the people i mean its funny  theyre just i dont know the standard of living is not as high as you would expect you would think   but on the other hand its its in a way its better   yeah   that what t hats what i like about it for one thing everything was cheap   yeah   um i mean i can still remember going going to the store and getting a pint of milk a pound of butter and a loaf of bread and getting change back from my pound   yeah   you know you cant even buy a loaf of bread in this country
