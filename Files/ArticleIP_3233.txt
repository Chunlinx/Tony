                                 The Happy Pornographers            I suppose it sounds strangeto call Boogie Nights yet another drama of family values The filmfollows a wellhung stud in the Los Angeles pornflick industry and it doesntshy away from recounting his lewder adventures It even invites us to love himand all his scummy sinning friends Our hero Eddie Mark Wahlbergbut thissounds all wrong you still want to call him Marky Mark is recruited into theworld of porn in  when he is  This happens because Eddie still lives athome with his awful parents a wimpy father and a drunken mother who runsaround the house calling him stupid He dreams vaguely of stardom but for thetime being works as a dishwasher in a nightclub One night a customer JackHorner Burt Reynolds who happens to be a porn director spots talent beneathEddies bulging zipper Back in the kitchen Jack asks him to pull out his lovegun His suspicions are confirmed and he tells Eddie to call him about gettinginto the business We know we should be horrified but were not Weve seenEddies mom We know how badly he needs a pat on the back Against our betterinstincts we think Go with this nice older man            Thewriter and director of Boogie Nights  Paul Thomas Anderson waits awhilebefore playing his cards The early scenes unfold with a patience thats rarein movies these days Like a kinder gentler Robert Altman Anderson takes timeto introduce us to his underground drifters Eddie goes for his audition whichturns out to be sex on Jacks couch with a pretty but inappropriately cheerfulrunaway Rollergirl Heather Graham so named because she lives her whole lifeon skates Soon hes shooting his debut movie under the name of Dirk DigglerHis first day on the set is a classic noviceinHollywood scene except thatthe logistics of the shoot involve the cleansing of vaginas and politewhispered negotiations about where to ejaculate The atmosphere is supportiveeven wholesome until Anderson finally stirs in some sicko stuff A woman at apool party ODs Another woman who is married has sex with a stranger on thedriveway while five strangers stand around watching Slowly Anderson cooks upa simultaneously lighthearted and sinister mood as if this were a thriller setat summer camp            He seems to be saying that there are two sides to everysituation and hes helped out immensely by Wahlbergs charismatic and subtleperformance as EddieturnedDirk This is a character to whom it would be easyto condescend but Wahlberg captures his nobility without skimping on hisstupidity When Eddie starts out he thinks of sex as a calling a gift he cangive to people Wahlberg is heartbreakingly natural as this ignorant naif hecries out to be protected like a puppy whose paws and ears are stilldisproportionately large Hes vulnerable without the narcissism that hascharacterized so much vulnerablemale acting since Brando I suppose itscentral to his appeal that his looks even shift from macho to feminine Atdifferent points his tiny eyes and wide thinlipped mouth reminded me of thepreppy convicted rapist Alex Kelly and the French Canadian actress GenevieveBujold                           BoogieNights follows Dirk from  when promiscuity was still sociallyacceptable and porn actors still dreamed of being recognized as legitimateartists through  by which time a combination of Reaganera values and therise of lowquality video has brought the industry crashing back to earth Itsan ambitiously wide time span to take on especially since the audience islikely to know it intimately but for the most part Anderson gets the tightshirts and the lightblue eye shadow and the fake wood paneling right Thereare scratches on the veneer of authenticity though The soundtrack is lessevocative than hyperactive It runs the gamut from Eric Burdon  WarsSpill The Wine to Rick Springfields Jesses Girl and the songs areusually heard several years later than people in real life would have listenedto them And Rollergirl should have thrown out her skates long before the movieended in  As I recall it the entire country spent the early s in aseizure of revulsion over the late s and the brief discoera rollerskatingfad placed a close second to Vietnam in terms of national shame Theres anindiscriminateness to these lapses an overconfidence In the press kitAnderson is quoted as saying with amazing chutzpah that he called on hisvery specific memories of the way Los Angeles looked and felt to recreatethe period The press kit also informs us that Anderson is  which means thatwhat were seeing is based on the memories of a yearold            In a way this sloppy handling of the retroelements is refreshing Anderson is young enough to be posthip andpostironic if such terms are possible can anything still be postanythingnonironically Hes got a sense of humor but hes more interested incharacter and motivation Jack Horners entourage is explicitly presented as adysfunctional makeshift family Besides father Jack and sister Rollergirl Dirkfinds a mother figure in the porn actress Amber Waves Julianne Moore who doesa good job of looking beautiful in one scene and puffy in the next and abrother in the ugly dumb goodnatured hack actor Reed Rothchild John CReilly Dirk and this group slowly isolate themselves from the world Theyshield and indulge each other they snort coke together the way a regularfamily might grill hot dogs And as a shrink might say they lack boundariesAmber is sad because she has a little son shes no longer allowed to see Soshe tells Dirk that she loves him as if he were her baby and then she seduceshim Their strong feelings for each other are real but they are alsoastonishing feats of denial and Anderson acts as both sympathizer andjudge            The idea that wherever weare we need a family is interesting up to a point It was the main conceitin Andersons first film Hard Eight  a neonoir set in Reno Nevabout an exmobster who takes on an imbecile protg and loves him like a sonBut like any idea it gets simplistic when carried too far and late inBoogie Nights it explodes into cheap melodrama Without a good rolemodel to guide him Dirk snorts so much coke that his one real talent poopsout He slides downhill and gets beaten uppunished essentially for havinggone too far with this fantasy family and having lost his grip on reality Andin an extremely sadistic overlapping scene we see Rollergirl momentarily burstout of her passive bubble and brutalize one jerk for all the abuse men havesubjected her to over the years Without guidance shes lost all morals andturned into a cauldron of rage These late scenes are over the top as mean andreductive as editorials in a tabloid and they nearly extinguish the moralsubtlety of whats gone before One even hopes they are insincere an attemptby Anderson to stay in step with the Zeitgeist of the s and thePromise Keepers It would be a shame if someone this talented meant them
