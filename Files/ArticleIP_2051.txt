                                 Justice            Two hundred years ago alawyer named William Blackstone said its better for  guilty people to gofree than for one innocent person to suffer And for two centuries legalscholars have considered Blackstones pronouncement a profound statement ofprinciple Apparently none of those scholars has thought to ask the obviousfollowup question namely why  Why wasnt it  or eight The answer ofcourse is that Blackstone invented a number out of thin air That kind offlippancy amounts to a defiant refusal to think seriously about the tradeoffsinvolved in designing a criminal justice system But for  years legalscholars have cited Blackstones refusal to think and mistaken it for anexample of a thought            Theresnothing profound about recognizing a tradeoff between convicting the innocentand acquitting the guilty The hard part is deciding how many false acquittalsyoure willing to accept to avoid a false conviction That number matters Itmatters whether it is  or  or eight because every time we rewrite acriminal statute or modify the rules of evidence we are adjusting the terms ofthe tradeoff So its got to be worth it to think about what terms we want toaim for            Heres one approach Imagine how a guilty man going free ora free man getting convicted might affect your life Or so we dont get toodeeply sidetracked into your personal idiosyncrasies how the guilty going freeor the free getting convicted might affect the lives of your neighbors On theone hand your neighbors risk being falsely accused and convicted On the otherhand they risk being victimized by criminals who have been falsely acquittedor by others who were emboldened to become criminals because of the frequencyof false acquittals In principle the cost of either disaster can be measuredin dollars In practice we can approximate those measures by making areasonable guess as to how much your typical neighbor would be willing to payto avoid a year in jail or to avoid being robbed on the way home from work            Afterestimating the costs of being either an imprisoned innocent or a crimevictim we can estimate the probability that your neighbor will actuallyface each of these problems But once we know the cost and the probabilityassociated with a given risk we can infer a lot about how undesirable thatrisk is We can do this for example by observing the way people behave ininsurance markets Suppose you want to know just how unpleasant it is to face a percent chance of a  loss Then all you have to do is look at thosepeople who face a  percent chance of losing their  homes in a fire andsee how much they are willing to pay for fire insurance            If you dont like insurance markets you canlook at labor markets How much extra must you pay a worker to get him to takea  percent risk of say losing an arm If we believe for independent reasonsthat the value of an arm is  no I dont mean to say that isthe value of an arm this is a hypothetical example then we have another wayto put a dollar value on the unpleasantness of a  percent risk of a loss            Or youcan use data from financial markets How much more interest must you offer aninvestor to get him to accept a  percent risk of a  financial lossThats relatively easy to observe and it gives yet another measure of how muchpeople dislike this particular level of risk            False acquittals and false convictions are each associatedwith certain levels and probabilities of risk By examining behavior ininsurance markets labor markets and financial markets we can make somereasonable guesses about how much people dislike each of these prospects andalso the extent to which people are willing to trade off one kind of risk forthe other That will give an indication of whether we ought to be expanding orrestricting the rights of defendants            It would take quite a bit ofwork to complete that project and at the end all youd have is a roughestimate Your final number would be suspect in a hundred ways For examplethe data from insurance and labor markets tell a pretty consistent story aboutpeoples aversion to risk but the data from financial markets make the degreeof risk aversion appear much higher There might be no entirely satisfactoryway to resolve such inconsistencies But until youve done some kind ofanalysis quoting a number such as  is both dishonest and disreputable
