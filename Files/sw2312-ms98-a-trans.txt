                so what TV shows do you like do you like comedies or   i like comedies and i like sitcoms i like to watch TV for escape im not much interested in   uhhuh do you like uh do you like Cheers   yeah  i like that and i like L A Law and i like Thirty Something   Cheers Night Court   i like Night Court in fact its on right now   yeah i i think thats pretty much what i like is my favorite TV show is Cheers and then after that is uh Night Court but i also i also like Star Trek and thats kind of an adventure i guess you would call it   yeah i never really got involved in Star Trek and i dont really care to watch movies because its committing too much time i think   yeah   you know you never know whats going to come up you know if you commit thirty minutes or an hour to watch some TV shows its a little different than   yeah thats true   you know two hours for a movie especially you know things that are i hate things that are continued   yeah especially like uh have you have you seen that movie uh Dances with Wolves   no i havent   you dont want to see it its like three hours long and it just drags on forever   thats what ive heard     well i like i mean i like you know things that are funny and and all you know like like Cheers you know is really funny it it makes you laugh or you know so its not like uh uh a show that goes on forever even though its only half an hour   i think yeah and its a just a nice escape and you know its something to laugh at and enjoy   yeah something to remove you know something to remove me from reality for a little while get away from real life   right exactly exactly thats thats what i like   because i i mean i dont know its just something i think something we need   as you know as human beings something to remove you from reality to relieve the stress   yeah   and Cheers does it i dont know i like the way i like the way the people act in Cheers its its pretty funny its its kind of you know the extremes of certain characters   yeah yeah youre right about the other youre right they are now that i think about it yeah i watch it its on its on here um like three or four times a night on various cable channels im sorry i think i mustve ive probably seen every episode about thirty five times   yeah the syndicate yeah they when theyll show one one episode in one channel and like the next day theyll show it on another one   well yeah but right um lets see here theyve got it theyve got it at like six six or six thirty and then they have it again at ten and ten thirty you know on a different channel   yeah   and so you know   where where i where i where im at right now is in a dorm and we dont have the uh we dont have cable so i just get regular TV but   oh okay   we see it uh every day at six oclock   uhhuh the older one   yeah right and then the new one comes on at nine Thursdays   yeah im trying to think what other shows i like there theres just television has changed so much and uh theres just not as many really good shows on i think as there used to be   yeah   i guess a lot of people think that the shows that i watch are kind of stupid and most of my friends and the people i know dont   well how about the Wonder Years do you like the Wonder Years   yeah i like that   thats pretty good i mean its its not something you see every day so its i guess it that that keeps the quality a little higher   well yeah and what i like about that show is that the time the time period that that takes place in is exactly the age i was during that time period   uhhuh so its even closer to you   yeah its kind of funny to you know sit back and remember it brings back a lot of memories um i dont know i like do you like um i dont know if if youre you would know like Barney Miller do you ever watch that or the old Bob Newhart Show   uhhuh i never ever really got into Bob Newhart   never got into those the old im talking about the old one when he was a psychologist   no i dont i dont i never never saw that   dont remember those i dont know my friends dont like my TV TV they think its trashy but uh well yeah   i kind of i kind of stayed away from the TV for a couple of years when i first came up here so i you know theres a gap in my TV viewing but recently thats basically what i watch is Cheers and   yeah   and uh and Night Court because theyre right they show them back to back   back to back when i was in college you know we didnt have TVs and so i remember somebody happened to have one in their room it was a really big deal and everybodyd get together like one night a week to watch TV but i hate that span of giving you have to give up a lot of TV when you when youre  when youre going to school lot of things you have to give up when youre going to school     yeah   but uh   well   sounds like we have real similar tastes we have tastes i mean as far as the sitcoms go what about the do you like L A Law or   yeah no no i dont i dont particularly get into those shows because they dont keep my interest ive seen um L A Law i think once or twice and the episode wasnt that great so i just i figured they were all like that so i dont waste my time   is that all uhhuh   looking at that and you know and if its if its funny or if it keeps my interest if its exciting ill watch it if not i dont and times that i saw that or pieces of that it wasnt any it wasnt great Thirty Something i watched a few times because there was a few good episodes and then after that it it i just lost interest in it   yeah um   but i guess its because its not aimed for an audience of my age   yeah probably not   no im im in my twenties my early twenties and so i guess Thirty Something is not is definitely not for me   about ten years yeah ten years down the road for you but um those are really the only two drama shows that i like and i tell everybody dont call me       but other than that i you know i like i um im recovering from surgery and so i read and watch a lot of television so   uhhuh   i get to see just about everything   yeah well that that way youll youll get to see all the shows and you get to really form good opinions on which one is really good and which one is really   yeah but who cares about my opinion   yeah   i like the uh i dont know it seems like some of the best shows they take off the air one of my favorite shows was Wise Guy and they took that off the air   what was wise guy   it was a cop show   oh   but   i mean i heard of it before but i never i never seen it   yeah i have to stay up if i want to see it i have to stay up till eleven thirty and then its all reruns and the guy that was started out in it isnt in it and anyway its a long   did you have you ever seen that that show they i mean they they trashed it before it ever got started but it was like i think they showed a couple of shows of uh what is it a Cop Rocks or something like that   i heard a lot about it but i never saw it now   i heard i heard it really sucked   did it   because uh it was supposed to be something like a show uh singing and like like a musical but yeah   oh really     like a musical like right in the middle of acting they would sing songs or something   youre kidding   no   maybe i should have  surely it maybe it would have been pretty funny i dont know   i can see why it crashed   i dont think it was supposed to be funny though       you know   well it was nice talking to you   nice talking to you i guess youll get to watch all of Night Court   yeah   ive missed the first ten minutes   oh well ill get off the phone and let you watch it then and good luck on your recovery   im sorry im just teasing thanks   all right bye   bye bye
