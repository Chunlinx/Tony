        okay  what kind of home do you have   well we we bought more than we can afford   uhhuh   and uh so were in a fairly uh exclusive neighborhood and got a big house     uhhuh     five thousand square feet with   wow   a bunch of kids running around   uhhuh   and horrible real estate taxes and and everything else   oh really   so its about all we can afford   yeah i know what well mines i guess i live in a upper middle class type home uh neighborhood uh most of them are all professionals in the neighborhood uh i live by myself what i uh i have more than i need i have a two story home which i dont need but uh   uhhuh   i got it as a steal and property taxes i mean property in Texas you know i bought uh came i used to live in Texas and i moved to Florida for four years and i moved back and when i moved back was in a slump and so i really stole this house for you know for peanuts it was a one of those corporate buy outs a couple had had moved in it lived here three months and and got transferred to uh Atlanta so their corporation was trying to sell it you know they just want to get rid of it so they took and offer i gave them which was very low   uhhuh   i know the neighbors probably hated me because it kind of ruined the resale you know i think what though the average i think when you go to sale but we dont have too many homes for sale in this area because its it is growing and building fast   well thats interesting because i ive i heard around Dallas that uh real estate was up for grabs   yeah its its improving now where i live i live out by DFW airport and uh its really growing like mad i mean theyre just building and theyre   uhhuh   im talking two and three hundred thousand dollar homes uh and theyre just building them yeah faster than people can move in them and that you know i understand that the slump in the market didnt affect didnt affect that price range chunk because those people are going to buy you know whether its you know rich people like that are going to buy you know there its the the middle income people i think and the lower middle income theyre that are hurting you know that   uhhuh   sixty and seventy thousand dollar homes that are hard to get rid of   yeah   but and then ive heard pros it has its picking up though now it has   well weve sort of got the other end of the spectrum going here the uh we had Mobil Oil Corporation move their corporate headquarters here about five years ago   uhhuh   and i bought this house uh just before they moved down   uhhuh   and when they moved in here the price on houses just about doubled all over the area   did it really huh   and uh   that tells you something   so we we got ours at a a fairly good price   uhhuh   but it stimulated a lot of the builders to start building fancy homes   umhum   and so weve got a lot of houses within a a few miles of us that are one million million and a half   yeah i i know i do too   and uh   it helps though it helps the value your property   yeah it helps the value of our property except we   it helps makes your taxes go up too though   except we had a neighbor here  just about gave his house away   uhhuh   uh he sold it for only slightly more than he paid for it uh four five years   really   and uh so hes kind of knocked down the neighborhood for a little while until that that average goes out but an awful lot of these fancy homes are not selling   yeah yeah right yeah oh really   because they built them and put all this money into them and nobodys interested in buying   oh okay well boy theyre sure buying them here grabbing them up it theyre gorgeous homes but ive never seen so many two story homes and theyre really building a lot of two stories all of the really fancy ones are all two story you just dont find any sprawled out one story homes anymore for some reason theyre just and boy the area i live in is really really growing fast in fact theyre just fixing to right behind me was a a house sat behind my property it was on fourteen acres it was just a kind of a nice little brick home had some horses and you know and a developer bought them out about six months ago and so they were going to build some really nice nice homes back there which will you know really help my house but like i said except for my taxes are going to go up because of these nice homes you know i theyre going to jack the prices up you know so i mean taxes that so we end up probably having to pay more taxes but   uhhuh    well theyre doing some some strange things here i think that the price of real estates gotten so high and theyre trying to get the value out of the homes so they subdivide around here theyll put a million dollar home on a half acre lot   oh do they   and you know you put a five thousand square foot house on on a half acre lot or one acre you know half acre lot and you can clip the lawn with a pair of scissors   uhhuh yeah you are right man we have some in Dallas has some of those zero lot line homes are you know five hundred thousand dollar homes sitting on a zero lot line and you can you know wave at your neighbor you know and hear their stereo well they build them really where you cant hear them they put the living areas opposite one another so i guess its all right i dont know i i have a lot i have an enormous backyard a really much much more than i can take care of which i dont i have it done because i cant afford i i tried taking care of it myself the first year i moved here and i said ill go without groceries but im going to have my yard done i just i cant do it you know it just wasnt worth it       so i have it done and i its a best money ive ever spent is having it done   yeah   and its just so regular and i just just dont have to worry about it   well sometimes it uh keeping after the yard gets me we enjoy sailing quite a bit   uhhuh   and sometimes we go off on a one week cruise   uhhuh   and i come back its rained quite a bit while were gone i can hardly find the house   oh yeah i know i know when i lived in Florida my mother visited me she says you know you can almost watch your grass grow down here cant you and i said yes you can i mean it just grew and i could have mowed it twice a week down there if i had the inclination which i didnt but uh thats when i started and when i lived in Florida i had my yard done down there too it was the humidity was so bad that i just i couldnt get out there and do it as much as i wanted to   uhhuh   i like yard work no i dont if i did id do it uh if i had to i would do it ill put it that way i dont have to so i dont do it but if i had uh i bought myself i bought the the best of equipment i said if im going to do it im going to get myself a good lawn mower and get all the bells and whistles and and i did and now it sits out in the garage and hasnt been running in over two years   um   but im but everybody in the neighborhood keeps a very nice yard thank goodness and that   yeah thats one of the things i have to face up to theres uh quite a few retired people in our neighborhood   oh okay   and it seems like all they have to do is is go out there and put down lime and spread fertilizer and pull up dandelions and   uhhuh i know it   take care of their lawn as beautiful beautiful lawn and i come over and look at my lawn and this nicely cut crabgrass and uh dandelions and plantains and everything else under the sun coming up   i know it     um the uh   oh i know but you know usually there in this uh new ive got one on this theres usually one neighbor in the in on a block that doesnt doesnt take care of their yard as or doesnt do anything to the yard and i keep thinking why do the people buy homes if theyre not going to keep their yard why dont you stay in an apartment if youre not going to touch your yard youre not going to you know you just ruin it for everybody else i think i know where my daughter lives theres a woman that lives behind them that the yard has never been watered and she lives in a real nice neighborhood and it its i saw it for the first time this morning what a eyesore eyesore that was i said id run her out thats a shame that somebody let their yard she has poison ivy growing over her garage can you believe poison ivy and shes got children   um   and its just oh what an eyesore terrible but no i i really do like my neighborhood its close enough to DFW i can be at the airport in ten minutes but i cant hear the planes flying i can see them uh from upstairs i can almost watch them land on the runway but i cant hear them for some reason   yeah   and uh uh i like living real close to an airport because when i get home from a trip i want to get home i dont want to drive forty five minutes you know after i get home i want to be home so i i always choose to live by an airport in Orlando i did the same thing i lived right by the airport so i could get right home   yeah   and the the noise isnt real i say i cant hear this and when i lived in Orlando i couldnt hear the airplanes either i guess if i lived right on the flight pattern it would be different but uh i dont i like i like to watch airplanes a fact i can lay in my bed at night and watch the planes coming in DFW and im i i know if theyre two seconds apart or just watch the lights come over they must come all in from the same pattern   uhhuh   and i can just lay there and just just watch one come past the the roof line of the people across the  street from me and uh just like seem like every two seconds ill see them come in from about you know nine oclock to ten fifteen theyre just streaming in   is that your version of counting sheep   yeah i guess so  must be  they i hadnt thought of that but i guess it is       and sometimes i have uh come downstairs at night and used my telephone downstairs if it rings and uh and i look out my kitchen window and there must be thirty airplanes circling above not over my house but over DFW   uhhuh   its the weirdest looking sign i thought my i guess theyre i dont know why theyre all circling i guess theyre but its weird looking so many lights up in the sky   yeah   but i i guess its interesting uh i like to look at airplanes   well were kind of fortunate were right about halfway between National Airport and Dallas   oh are you   and so theyve uh sort of established sort of a no mans land here   uhhuh   and so we dont get any traffic from Dulles over the house and we dont get any traffic from uh National   oh okay   and but you can sit in the backyard and you can watch the planes uh lining up for the approach   yeah thats nice i have a girlfriend lives in Alexandria west is it Virginia Alexandria she works for the government shes a   yeah thats thats not well its about forty five minute drive from here yeah      oh is it
