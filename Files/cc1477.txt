                    Introduction        Mortality prediction systems have been advocated as        means of evaluating the performance of intensive care units        ICUs   These systems allow adjustment to the severity        of illness of the patient population Acute Physiology and        Chronic Health Evaluation APACHE II and Simplified Acute        Physiology Score SAPS II measure severity of illness by a        numeric score    based on physiologic variables        selected because of their impact on mortality the sicker        the patient the more deranged the values and the higher        the score The numeric scores are then converted into        predicted mortality by using a logistic regression formula        developed and validated on populations of ICU patients        Mortality Probability Models MPM II differ slightly in        that they use categorical variables with the exception of        age for mortality prediction          Before the clinical application of any of these systems        they must be validated on the population under evaluation           These systems have been assessed for validity in        several countries     We report here the result of        our validation study of the four systems in ICU population        in a tertiary care center in Saudi Arabia                    Methods        King Fahad National Guard Hospital is a bed tertiary        care center in Riyadh Saudi Arabia The bed        medicalsurgical ICU has  admissions a year The        hospital also has a coronary care unit and a cardiac        surgical intensive care unit Patients admitted to these        units were not included in the study The unit is run by        fulltime intensivists and has hour immediate access to        other medical and surgical specialties Our        nursetopatient ratio is approximately  This high        ratio has been maintained because of the high acuity of        care Our ICU database was established in March  to        record ICU admissions The present study presents        information on all consecutive admissions between  March         and  December  Data were collected by one of        the intensivists YA SH or RG To minimize        variability in data collection one physician YA        coordinated the overall process In addition a written        reference with the definitions used in original articles        was made Patients aged  years or more were eligible for        the study with the exception of burn and braindead        patients For patients admitted to the ICU more than once        in the same hospitalization data from the first admission        were used Approval from the hospital Ethics Committee was        not required because the information had already been        collected for clinical reasons        The following data were collected demographics APACHE        II and SAPS II scores and MPM variables MPM II          data were obtained on all admissions        whereas MPM II           APACHE II and SAPS II data were        obtained on patients who stayed for  hours or more in        ICU APACHE II and SAPS II scores were calculated in        accordance with the original methodology using the worst        physiologic values in the first ICU day    The only        exception was Glasgow Coma Score GCS Many of these        patients were under the influence of sedation and the worst        GCS would reflect the effect of sedation more than the true        underlying mental status We therefore used the worst GCS        value for nonsedated patients and the presedation score        for patients under sedation as described previously             The main reason for ICU admission whether the        admission was after emergency surgery and the presence of        severe chronic illness were documented in accordance with        the original definitions   Postoperative patients with        sepsis or cardiac arrest were included with nonoperative        patients with these conditions   ICU and hospital        length of stay LOS and lead time the interval from        hospital admission to ICU admission were calculated Vital        status at discharge from the ICU and from the hospital was        registered        Predicted hospital mortality was calculated with the        logistic regression formulas described originally            Standardized mortality ratio SMR was calculated by        dividing observed hospital mortality by the predicted        hospital mortality The  confidence intervals CIs for        SMRs were calculated by regarding the observed mortality as        a Poisson variable then dividing its  CI by the        predicted mortality          Validation of the systems was tested by assessing        calibration and discrimination Calibration the ability to        provide risk estimate corresponding to the observed        mortality was assessed by calibration curves and the        LemeshowHosmer goodnessoffit         C statistic   Calibration        curves were drawn by plotting predicted against actual        mortality for groups of the patient population stratified        by  increments of predicted mortality To calculate the         C statistic the study population        was stratified into ten deciles with approximately equal        numbers of patients The predicted and actual number of        survivors and nonsurvivors were compared statistically        with the use of formal goodnessoffit testing to determine        whether or not the discrepancy was statistically        insignificant          P          Discrimination was tested by receiver operating        characteristic ROC curves and    classification        matrices ROC curves were constructed as a measure of        assessing discrimination with  stepwise increments in        predicted mortality    The four curves were        compared by computing the areas under the curves        Classification matrices were performed at decision criteria        of   and  Sensitivity specificity positive and        negative predictive values and overall correct        classification rate were calculated        Minitab for Windows Release  Minitab Inc was        used to perform statistics Continuous variables were        expressed as means  SD and were compared by standard         t test Categorical values were        expressed in absolute and relative frequencies and were        analyzed by  test Linear regression and logistic        regression analysis were used when appropriate         P   was considered        significant                    Results                  Patient population          The demographics of the  eligible patients are          shown in Table  It is noteworthy that  of all          patients had one or more severe chronic illnesses Severe          hepatic disease was the leading chronic illness followed          by immunosuppression severe respiratory illness renal          illness and cardiovascular illness Some patients had          more than one severe chronic illness In comparison with          survivors nonsurvivors were older had a longer lead          time and ICU LOS but shorter hospital LOS They had          higher APACHE II and SAPS II scores The type of          admission was more likely to be medical or emergency          surgical in nonsurvivors and to be elective surgical in          survivors Severe chronic illness was more common in          nonsurvivors especially liver disease                          Mortality predicted by the four systems          Table shows the actual mortality and predicted          mortality by all four systems and also SMRs and their           CIs SMRs for all system were not significantly          different from  indicating accurate overall mortality          prediction                          Predicted mortality by subgroups          When subgrouped by categories of main reasons for ICU          admission Table  SMRs by the four systems were not          significantly different from  with few exceptions MPM          II            and MPM II            overestimated mortality for the          category nonoperative trauma admissions and SAPS II          underestimated mortality for the category other          medical When subgrouped by the source of admission all          SMRs were not significantly different from  with the          exception of the underestimation of mortality of SAPS II          for patients admitted from the floor                          Calibration          Calibration curves are shown in Figure  Of the four          systems SAPS II stands out as deviating from the          identity line in most of the strata including those with          large numbers of patients The SAPS II curve shows an          underestimation of mortality in lowrisk patients and an          overestimation of mortality in highrisk patients          leading to the skewed appearance of its calibration          curve The curves of the other three systems fell on the          identity line in the strata with large number of patients          and deviated in some other strata          The results of LemeshowHosmer goodnessoffit tests          are shown in Table  The           C statistic was best for MPM II             with           P   For the other three          systems calibration tested by the           C statistic was poor These          results indicate that of the four systems MPM II            had the least statistically          significant discrepancy between predicted and observed          mortality across the strata of increasing predicted          mortality                          Discrimination          Figure shows the receiver operating characteristic          ROC curves for the four systems The corresponding          areas under the curves were as follows MPM II              MPM II              APACHE II  SAPS II           These reflect the better discriminative power of          the first three systems than that of SAPS II          The results of the  classification matrix are shown          in Table  The overall correct classification rate was          highest for MPM II            and lowest for SAPS II at the          different cutoff points MPM II            and APACHE II had intermediate          rates This was consistent with the results of ROC curve          testing                          Correlation of predicted mortalities by the four          systems          On the basis of linear regression analysis          mortalities predicted by all four systems correlated with          each other            P   for all combinations          The closest correlation was between MPM II            and MPM II

hospital          mortality          By univariate analysis lead time was a significant          predictor of hospital outcome odds ratio   CI           per day           P   However when adjusted          to the severity of illness estimated from the mortality          predicted by any of the four systems lead time was not          an independent predictor of hospital outcome Similarly          ICU LOS was a significant predictor of hospital outcome          by univariate analysis odds ratio   CI           per day           P   but not when adjusted to          severity of illness by multivariate analysis                            Discussion        The main findings of this validation study on a Saudi        Arabian ICU population can be summarized as follows         overall mortality prediction estimated by SMR was        reasonably accurate especially for MPM II          and APACHE II  MPM II had the        best calibration by         C statistic  SAPS II had the        lowest calibration and discrimination        There is great international variability in patient mix        and severity of illness        Some of the        differences are inherent in the patient population For        example patients with cirrhosis have a high severity of        illness and poor prognosis when admitted to the ICU            Case mix is also affected by the type of hospital        for example whether it is primary or tertiary or a        transplant or trauma center Patients referred from other        hospitals have a higher severity of illness and mortality        compared with direct admissions   Other factors are        practicerelated An important example is the do        notresuscitate DNR practice    Early preICU        determination of DNR status reduces the number of futile        admissions to the ICU leading to a probable reduction in        overall severity of illness Another example is related to        ICU bed availability It has been documented that        physicians tend to be more selective in their ICU        admissions at times of bed shortages with patients with        higher severity of illness being admitted   In our        study the relatively high level of severity of illness was        probably related to a combination of all these factors        Being a tertiary care center our hospital receives        referrals from other hospitals some of them directly to        ICU Table  Being a transplant center we have a large        population of endstage liver disease The concept of DNR        is evolving in Saudi Arabia Our hospital has been leading        in the country in this field by establishing a written        policy for DNR orders and raising the awareness among        physicians about this issue Nevertheless there is room        for improvement Frequently the DNR status is discussed at        a very late stage or is not discussed at all before        admission to the ICU Consequently many desperately ill        patients are admitted to the ICU with very high severity of        illness and no meaningful chance of survival The nursing        shortage in our ICU led to selecting the sicker admissions        and decreasing the number of elective admissions        In this study we showed that the overall mortality        prediction was accurate but calibration was inadequate        Potential reasons for insufficient calibration might        include the following  factors related to the        calibration methodology itself  reasons related to data        collection namely intraobserver and interobserver        variability  variability in GCS  differences in        case mix  differences in DNR policies and         differences in medical care        The results of LemeshowHosmer statistics are dependent        not only on the calibration of the model but also on        patient numbers and the distribution of the estimates          The results of the calibration tests in our study        might seem inconsistent with the overall estimate of        mortality of the whole population and with the mortality        estimates of the subgroups Table  This apparent        inconsistency is probably related to the distribution of        estimates The overestimation of mortality in certain        strata of severity of illness is counterbalanced by        underestimation in other strata Table  leading to        perfect estimation when the whole population or a        specific subgroup is considered        Interobserver variability in data collection has been        documented in several studies     This is        potentially relevant to our study because data collection        was performed by several physicians and over a relatively        long period  months We tried to minimize variability        by having a written reference of definitions based on the        original articles of the various scoring systems and having        one person coordinate the process of data collection        Similar approaches have been shown to minimize variability           MPM II systems have been documented to have high        reproducibility which might explain the better calibration        of MPM II          in our study          The variability of GCS determination in sedated patients        accounts for much of the variability in scoring APACHE II        Several approaches in determining GCS have been used        previously For nonsedated patients we used the worst        value in the first  hours for sedated patients we used        the presedation GCS This approach has been shown to be        associated with better performance of APACHE II than the        approach that assumes normal GCS for sedated patients          This approach also follows the original MPM II article        definitions   and is consistent with the approach        described by Knaus and others           Another potential reason for the inadequate calibration        is the differences in case mix between our database and the        development databases of the mortality prediction systems        Medical patients constitute a larger proportion in our        database  than in the development databases MPM II            MPM II            SAPS II  APACHE II             When the main diagnostic categories in our        database are compared with those in the development        database of APACHE II some interesting differences appear        The post cardiac arrest category which is associated with        a high mortality risk APACHE II diagnostic category weight        is  accounts for  of our admissions compared with         in the developmental database of APACHE II The        postoperative category peripheral vascular surgery which        is associated with a low mortality risk APACHE II        diagnostic weight is  accounts for  of our        admissions compared with  of the development        database Our database also has more severe chronic        illnesses  compared with  in different        participating ICUs in the APACHE II development database        This is partly related to the high percentage of patients        with endstage liver disease admitted to our ICU  of        all patients        Differences in admission practises to the ICUs might        also have an impact on ICU outcome The delay in DNR orders        is mentioned earlier This factor probably contributes to        our high severity of illness and could have affected system        calibration        Finally one must examine whether the inadequate        calibration is related to differences in medical care        However in our study overall actual mortality was not        different from predicted mortality as is evident in the        SMRs Table  Furthermore when the calibration curves        are examined there is no consistent pattern of        overestimation or underestimation of mortality among the        four systems in the different strata of severity of        illness This suggests that the inadequate calibration is        inherent in these systems when applied to this population        and less likely to be related to gross variation in medical        care        Our study has some limitations First it is a        singlecenter study which makes it biased towards a        certain case mix Second as discussed above collecting        the data over a relatively long period by different        physicians has implications for consistency of data        collection The use of a written reference of definitions        and assigning a coordinator to oversee the whole process        probably decreased variability as has been shown        previously    In addition variability has been        found to be random and of little impact on the overall        estimates   A multicenter study would have addressed        some of these concerns        In conclusion the four mortality prediction systems        gave accurate overall estimates of mortality especially        MPM II          and APACHE II Calibration was modest        for MPM II          and inadequate for the others SAPS        II had the lowest calibration and discrimination The local        performance of MPM II systems particularly MPM II           in addition to their ease of use        makes them attractive models for use in Saudi Arabia        However a multicenter national study is needed to confirm        these findings                    Competing interests        None declared                    Abbreviations        APACHE  Acute
