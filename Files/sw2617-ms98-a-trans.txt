              uh i have uh i guess a lot of thoughts about the Vietnam War um i i guess i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on and so theres probably a lot of things i remember and a lot of things that i really didnt have a clue as to what was happening   yeah   um looking back like maybe some of the things that i know now i im not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives that was one of the questions that she asked us to think about because i because we never went to war i dont think we were committed to winning it and getting out and i i feel like it went on and on   right   and i i guess i see such a contrast like as opposed to the Middle East War we just had where President Bush went out and got worldwide support for for what was happening   right   you know i just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman and im not sure thats our role but   yeah i i agree with that i was i was fairly young at the time too i i really dont have very many memories about it at all in fact and uh my husband is a Vietnam veteran and i you know he in looking at the Persian Gulf war that just went on he i it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the Vietnam vets did not have from the people or the administration either one   dont you think that maybe thats why we had it this time i mean i do think that i i its been too long in coming but i feel like maybe the American people and and and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didnt support that that those so many people were opposed to the war what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it and those guys were there doing their duty   right thats right i mean they werent there by choice and and i think   yeah and i i think that we learned from that and i think it its one of those things that you learn the hard way it was a tragic mistake the way that they have been treated over the years and i believe thats just now turning around   right   turning around Just now you know trying to be rectified and im and im not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally on so many of the people   right no i dont think you can and i i agree with you that i i think that the the time difference between the two wars has allowed a lot of people to see the mistakes that were made in in in every aspect of it and i i agree with you also that i feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war i mean theyre still not settled over there   no theyre not   and i have a feeling that the Persian Gulf crisis is going to be the same way   yeah   i think were going to end up back there in a few years or if if not sooner   well i i appreciate the feel i feel like President Bush is in a hard spot he went over there to get them out of Kuwait which he did and then he has backed out he has pulled out and i realize theyre still saying well here youre encouraging us to get rid of Saddam Hussein so why arent you helping us and you see i think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another Vietnam situation   i think it would too   and i dont think the US will stand for it i dont think he would do that uh i think we learned too much   no yeah i agree with that   of the effects uh you know whether it was justified or not i know that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause i i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and and beat the communism but   uhhuh   but i think somewhere that got lost you know in the long term effects of the of the war and   yeah yeah well you have to i you know you have to give Bush a lot of credit for he he said thats what we were going there to do and he did what what he said and he did pull out before it got any further than that where where it would have turned into more of a police action     yeah      uh or more of a political action i guess you getting into their governmental affairs which you really cant do as as another country   yeah   i mean that my my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries and we have so many problems here at home that we dont address   that we dont get fixed   thats right and and thats thats what frustrates me more than anything   i know and i i believe that we have to have a military and i believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us   right   but i also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward   i think theres a lot of waste and and they dont i if they could just cut out all the fat and and get it lean and start addressing some of the other issues i think we could take care of everything and quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world you know who just end up using things against us later on anyway     i know i do think that in the Middle East war um i think that maybe a lot of the Arab countries that were so hateful towards the United States have come away with uh kind of a different attitude   uhhuh   uh i think that maybe were not their big bad enemy any more   right   and uh and i think thats good you know i think thats a good   yeah yeah a lot of good has come from this one   i think so too   and i think i guess in in uh ironic way a lot of good came from the Vietnam war toward this war because like we we said earlier that you know the a lot of eyes were opened after years and years of of that war and and   and perhaps the reason that good came out of the Mid East war is because we had the experience of Vietnam   right exactly   so i i i do think that weve learned from it   uhhuh   you know i i i wish there werent war   yeah no kidding   but uh i do think we learned   and i just i just hate the emotional price a lot of the Vietnam people paid   yes   for you know uh nothing i mean it was theyre they still dont know what they were there for   no there was no feeling of accomplishment no goal no   no   we went in but what did we do we lost lives and and what were we trying to do who knows   yeah thats true   and i i think youre right uh i think youre right there um i do remember when it was over i remember when they were coming home uh but i remember the feeling back then you know like i feel like right now i feel like this country has been behind this war   uhhuh   uh yeah theres a lot of people that arent for war im not for war   right   but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right i dont remember that feeling back in Vietnam   right   i just remember oh yeah our guys are over there and its sad and we shouldnt be fighting a war but there was no lets support them you know   right well the when this war broke out it frustrated me all this the antiwar people and   yeah   you know their all the demonstrations that were going on i felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity because those kind of people i mean you know theyre the kind of people who are w hove always got to have a cause whether its good bad of indifferent theyve got to have a cause and   thats right   and i you know nobody says because youre supporting the troops that youre youre supporting the war you you have to support the people that are there   thats right thats right   and some for some reason those people dont see that   they dont see it as supporting the folks the people   no no they dont and you know theyre just real shallow people   i would agree with you there   yeah   i i agree um and i and i recall when President Bush said that you know he said look i you know im sorry that youre opposed to the war theres a lot of us that are opposed to war but uh youre not helping the people that are over there by what youre doing and i remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that   yeah i mean theyre not helping anybody thats the thats the whole point theyre not doing anything for anybody except themselves   but their not thats true   and i dont even know what theyre doing for themselves you know   uh giving a soapbox to stand on   yeah     but well i just i im glad weve learned im sorry we had the experience of Vietnam   yeah   and uh and im im im especially sorry for the people that are you know have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally because you know until the last past four or five years nobody ever really worried about that for them   thats true yeah   and and i think thats where we as American people really failed you know failed them   yeah   so i dont know well do you have anything else you want to say on this   no i guess not   i think this is the first time that i havent been cut off by the computer   i know we get cut off all the time too   usually i can talk all day but this is something to me thats sad   yeah it is   so well have a good day and i appreciate the conversation   thanks same here   byebye   byebye
