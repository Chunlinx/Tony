                    Background        Sickle cell anemia Hb SS results from homozygosity for        a AT substitution at codon  of the globin gene        GAGGTG leading to a glutamic acid to valine GluVal        substitution in the  globin chain of human adult        hemoglobin Despite this common genetic background        phenotypic expression of sickle cell disease is widely        variable ranging from a mild asymptomatic course with        survival into the sixth or seventh decade to a very severe        course with multiorgan damage and early mortality            Some of the genetic factors contributing to this phenotypic        diversity particularly those linked to the globin genes        ie thalassemia and globin gene cluster haplotypes        have been well recognized            Stroke is a devastating complication of sickle cell        disease which occurs in  of the patients by  years of        age as shown by the multicenter Cooperative Study of        Sickle Cell Disease CSSCD      In sickle cell        patients  years of age stroke is predominantly        ischemic and results from the involvement of medium sized        to large intracranial arteries Ischemic stroke in the        general population is considered a multigenic disorder             In many cases it results from multiple genegene and        geneenvironment interactions In the case of sickle cell        disease only a few genetic factors are known to influence        the stroke risk     For example thalassemia is the        only well characterized protective genetic factor            Thus genetic factors that lead to the development of        cerebrovascular disease and stroke in children with Hb SS        are not well understood        Studies conducted at the Medical College of Georgia        MCG in the mids have shown that transcranial        doppler TCD can identify children at high risk for stroke        by detecting high flow rate in major intracranial arteries             Children with flow velocities of  cmsec or        higher in middle cerebral or internal carotid arteries        normal   cmsec for sickle cell children had a        stroke risk of  per year which represents a fold        increase over that for unselected children with sickle cell        disease These observations then led to the multicenter        STOP Stroke Prevention Trial in Sickle Cell Anemia study        in which sickle cell children age  years from         centers in the US and Canada were screened by TCD            One hundred thirty patients with flow velocities of         cmsec were randomized to observation or to receive        periodic blood transfusions to reduce  Hb S to  The        study was stopped early by the Data and Safety Monitoring        Board due to the finding of a significant reduction in the        number of strokes  reduction p   in the        transfusion arm  strokes in the observation arm vs one        in the transfusion arm     Thus the STOP study        established that transfusion was an effective means of        primary stroke prevention in children with sickle cell        disease at risk for stroke as determined by TCD The        recently funded STOPII study to be conducted in         centers will investigate the duration of stroke risk and        the feasibility of discontinuing transfusion after         months in patients whose TCD velocities have normalized        after transfusion        Data from the STOP study showed that  of patients        with Hb SS between the ages of  years are at risk for        stroke as determined by Transcranial Doppler TCD        velocities of  cmsec or greater     TCD velocity        elevation can be due to two factors reduction of arterial        diameter due to stenosis andor increased volume flow        through the artery In the case of sickle cell disease        both factors are often present Velocity elevation        corresponding to increased cerebral blood flow in all        patients with anemia has been noted with an approximate        linear increase in velocity for decrease in Hb or HCT            There are also data to suggest that patients with Hb SS        have higher flow velocities than those with normal Hb A at        comparable levels of anemia suggesting the amount and        composition of the Hb are both involved in the velocity        elevation of sickle cell disease            While some of the risk factors leading to the        development of cerebral vasculopathy and stroke in sickle        cell disease low hematocrit elevated white blood cell        count normal complement of globin genes have been        identified in previous studies CSSCD MCG cohort and        STOP many remain unknown The observation has been made        that strokes in sickle cell disease are clustered in        families but no clear epidemiological confirmation of this        has been published In terms of TCD velocities it was        noted in the STOP study that sibling pairs were common        among abnormals ie TCD   cmsec and there were         pairs among  randomized patients suggesting that other        genetic factors may in part determine propensity for stroke        RJ Adams unpublished observations        Various mechanisms have been proposed to account for the        hypercoagulable state observed in patients with sickle        cell disease These include increased platelet activation        increased thrombin generation and more recently elevated        levels of circulating tissue factor     Over the past        decade mutations in a number of genes have been identified        as the cause of thrombophilia in a large number of patients        from different populations around the globe The molecular        basis of inherited thrombophilia now includes mutations in        the genes for Factor V prothrombin        methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase MTHFR and several        others     in addition to those encoding proteins such        as antithrombin protein C and protein S whose role in the        homeostasis between procoagulant and anticoagulant        activities in the circulation is well established Unlike        rare mutations involving antithrombin protein C and S        which are clearly associated with a hypercoagulable        phenotype mutations we propose to study appear to have two        distinct features i they occur with a significantly        higher frequency in many populations and ii they seem to        contribute to a thrombophilic state in the presence of        additional acquired environmentalnutritional or        inherited interaction with other genes factors        It is likely that the coinheritance of one or more of        these mutations in sickle cell disease would tip the        balance toward a hypercoagulable state and act as an        additional risk factor for the development of        cerebrovascular disease Additionally the effect of the        thermolabile MTHFR mutation  CT on plasma        homocysteine levels in heterozygotes has been shown to        depend upon the availability of folate with higher levels        seen in folate deficient individuals It is possible that        increased folate requirements due to chronic hemolysis in        sickle cell disease would lead to a relative deficiency        state which in the presence of MTHFR mutation would        result in higher homocysteine levels as an additional risk        factor for vasculopathy        Thus we propose to study polymorphisms in genes        involved in a number of systems and pathways related to        stroke risk     genes associated with coagulation        factors and thrombophilia Factor V Prothrombin        Fibrinogen Factor VII Factor XIII PAI Thrombomodulin        TM and MTHFR as well as polymorphisms in genes that        are involved in vascular reactivity ACE platelet        activationfunction GpIIbIIIa GpIb IXV and GpIaIIa        endothelial cell function MTHFR TM VCAM ESelectin        LSelectin PSelectin and ICAM inflammation TNF        lipid metabolism Apo A and Apo E and cell adhesion        VCAM ESelectin LSelectin PSelectin and ICAM        These candidate genes will make it possible to study not        only polymorphisms associated with a hypercoagulable state        but also to study the genes involved in pathways that may        lead to the development of vasculopathy genes involved in        endothelial cell function inflammation and adhesion        platelet activation and responsiveness Thus this will        provide the rationale for studying potential genetic risk        factors that may contribute to the pathogenesis of an        intermediate phenotype such as vasculopathy    rather        than a thrombotic endpoint ie stroke TCD remains the        only proven indicator of cerebrovascular disease and stroke        risk in Hb SS Therefore a large casecontrol association        study of the role of genes in the development of        cerebrovascular disease and stroke risk based upon TCD is        likely to provide more accurate information and may resolve        the controversial results obtained in smaller studies            Furthermore an attempt will be made to perform a subset        analysis of patients who go on to have an ischemic stroke        during the study period in terms of the associations with        genetic polymorphisms As of the termination of the study        in   of the  patients randomized in STOP have        been adjudicated to have a stroke        In summary we have designed a casecontrol association        study to elucidate the role of genetic polymorphisms as        risk factors for cerebrovascular disease measured by a        high TCD velocity in children with Hb SS The study will        consist of two parts a candidate gene study and a        genomewide screen and will be performed in  cases and         controls Cases will include  patients randomized in        the STOP study TCD   cms as well as  patients        found to have high TCD in STOP II screening Four hundred        sickle cell patients with a normal TCD velocity TCD          cms will be used as controls The candidate gene        study will involve the analysis of  genetic polymorphisms        in  candidate genes see Table  References for the        polymorphisms listed in Table are provided in the        additional file  The genomewide screen for a large number        of SNP markers may uncover the association of novel        polymorphisms with cerebrovascular disease and stroke in        sickle cell disease DNA samples will be pooled in the         cases and in the  controls and these pools will be        genotyped for a large number of validated SNPs we estimate        to need at least  SNP markers using highthroughput        methods Purpose of this paper is to give a detailed        description of the design of this study        Additional File         The  polymorphisms that will be

Subjects          AfricanAmerican children who are between the ages of           and  years with Hb SS or S thalassemia from          participating STOP and STOP II centers form the subjects

randomized STOP patients n            stored in the STOP Core Laboratory will be utilized          An additional  patients with high TCD velocity and           control patients with normal TCD velocity will be          identified through STOPII screening With an abnormal          TCD rate of  it is expected that at least           new patients from  participating Centers will need to          be screened as part of the STOPII study to identify           new patients with TCD velocities  cmsec DNA will          be extracted from the  ml blood collected in EDTA and          shipped to the Core Laboratory collected during TCD          screening as part of STOPII          Cases and controls will be matched for age sex and          weight which are the most important covariates The          effect of any remaining differences in additional          confounding variables between cases and controls will be          explored by adjusting for these covariates in the          analyses for example through using conditional logistic          regression models                          Human Biological Materials          To ensure confidentiality and protect the privacy of

                  SNP Genotyping          DNA will be extracted from peripheral blood          mononuclear cells and  g of genomic DNA from each          subject will be used for each multiplex SNP genotyping          assay the STOP DNA bank has  g of DNA from          randomized patients The  polymorphisms in           candidate genes and the SNP markers in the genomewide          screen will be genotyped by highthroughput SNP screening          using the MassARRAY System Sequenom Inc San Diego          CA The principles of this method are detailed in          references    and     Briefly approximately           bp fragments of each candidate gene with the SNP site in          the middle will be amplified by automated PCR procedure          Multiplexing of the PCR reactions will be used as          determined by the Sequenom software One of the          amplification primers includes a  biotin tag which is          targeted in a streptavidinmagnetic bead purification          step to generate a single stranded template for the          primer extension reaction An extension primer          complimentary to the template at a region directly          adjacent to the SNP site is added to the single stranded          template This is followed by the MassEXTEND reaction          during which the primer is extended across the SNP site          by using a sequencing polymerase reaction This is          controlled by a mixture of dideoxy and deoxy nucleotide          triphosphates the ratio of which varies depending upon          the assay design protocol obtained from the          SpectroDESIGNER software Sequenom The primer          extension products will differ depending upon the          polymorphic base present at the SNP site The difference          in molecular weight between these products is detectable          by mass spectrometry Following the extension reaction          the original sample template is separated and removed          from the extended primers by the use of a resin The          purified samples are then transferred onto a SpectroCHIP          from either a  well or  well plate with the          SpectroJET dispenser The CHIP is placed into the mass          spectrometer which takes advantage of the MALDITOF          Matrix Assisted Laser DesorptionIonization          TimeofFlight mass spectrometry The mixture of the          test molecules extension products with the organic          matrix produces a crystalline dispersion The matrix is          hit with a pulse from a laser beam The sample and matrix          are vaporized and the primer extension products are          expelled into the flight tube As the primer extension          products are negatively charged when an electrical field          pulse is subsequently applied they are launched down the          flight tube toward the detector The time between          application of the electrical field pulse and collision          of the primer extension products with the detector is          known as timeofflight and is a very precise measure          of the products molecular weight The SpectroTYPER          software gathers the timeofflight information and          applies algorithms to provide accurate automated          genotype calling This method is fast and more accurate          compared to hybridizationbased methods of SNP detection               The whole process is automated                          Data Management          Webbased data entry will be used to load the data          from this study into the passwordprotected STOP II          database at the New England Research Institutes NERI A          data entry screen specific to this study will be          developed for this purpose Adding the data to the STOP          II database will greatly facilitate linking the          genotyping data to other patient characteristics eg          TCD status during data analysis The database was          developed using NERIs browserbased data management          system ADEPT and an ORACLE relational database engine          As part of standard QC  of the records will be          randomly selected at NERI for double data entry Any          problems with high error rates will be brought to the          attention of laboratory personnel immediately If          necessary further records entered by the same individual          will also be reviewed                          Statistical analysis for the candidate gene          study          As a first step in the analysis the genotypic          frequencies for each gene will be tested for departure          from HardyWeinberg equilibrium Statistically          significant departures could indicate biased sampling or          they could indicate that the study population is          experiencing detectably strong natural selection at that          locus          The null hypothesis to be tested for each gene is that          the genotypic frequencies in patients with normal and          high TCD are the same This will be tested using a          chisquare test of association of TCD status and genotype          for each gene Heterozygotes will be pooled with          homozygous mutants to form    tables mutant          presentabsent vs TCD status Fishers exact test will          be used instead of chisquare tests if the frequency of a          given allele is too low to justify the assumptions of the          chisquare test Rejection of the null hypothesis of no          association between genotype and TCD status will lead to          the conclusion that the proportion of patients with          mutant alleles is different in patients with normal and          high TCD The Bonferroni correction for multiple testing          will not be used because correcting for tests at  loci          would produce an extremely small critical pvalue In the          absence of such a correction the results of this study          will need to be considered with caution and replication          of significant findings in an independent sample or          followup study will be important          A multivariate approach will then be employed to          determine if TCD status varies with combinations of          different genes ie to determine if the probability          that a patient with mutant alleles for two or more genes          is a case ie has high TCD differs from the          probability that is predicted from the independent          effects of those genes Loglinear models will be employed          for this     Suppose for example that the data          from two genes are combined with TCD status to form a               table Rejection of the null hypothesis of no          threeway association in the table would lead to the          conclusion that the proportion with high TCD depends upon          the joint effects of the two genes rather than on their          separate effects The cell frequencies in the table would          then be inspected to determine which combinations of          alleles accounted for the statistically significant          results ie to identify the combinations that occur          with elevated frequency in patients with high TCD Bishop          et al    provide methods for calculating standard          errors for the cell frequencies for this inspection          Generally statistical tests of threeway and higher          order associations are less powerful than tests of          twoway associations in the same table More specific          statements regarding power are difficult without explicit          statements regarding the magnitude of interaction to be          detected and there is very little information available          on which to base the latter Therefore the analysis of          individual genes should be considered the primary          analysis in this study Interactions involving more than          three or four variables are generally very difficult to          interpret Therefore the analysis will be limited to          tables involving no more than two or three genes Even          that restriction is unlikely to be sufficient given the          large number of tables involving either two or three          genes that could be formed from the data Therefore          multivariate modeling will begin with any genes that were          statistically significantly related to TCD status when          the data for each gene were analyzed separately                          Power estimates for the candidate gene study          In the calculations below heterogyzotes are pooled          with homozygous mutants to reduce each population to two          states mutant present or absent The power to detect a          difference in genotypic frequencies between two          populations was determined by Monte Carlo simulation The          simulations were based on three assumptions i only two          alleles are involved in the comparison for a given gene          ii the populations are in HardyWeinberg equilibrium          and iii genotypes will be obtained from  cases and           controls The simulations proceeded as follows           Specify the proportion of homozygous mutants in          each population p            for cases and p            for controls The proportions of          homozygous wild type and heterozygous patients in the i          thpopulation are then   p           i  and p           i   p           i  respectively           Draw random samples of size  and  from the          two multinomial populations defined above Pool the          heterozygotes and homozygous mutants to reduce each          population to two states mutant presentabsent           Compare the genotypic frequencies in the two          samples using a chisquare test           Repeat steps   times for each combination          of p            and p             Estimate statistical power as the          percentage of simulations in which the null hypothesis          was rejected          Results are presented in table  On the assumption          that the goal of the study is to identify mutant alleles          that occur with increased frequency in patients with high          TCD the table is limited to cases in which p             p             To save space the table is          further limited to entries that just span the range of          differences p             p             that can be detected with           power for each specified value of p             Based on these power analyses we          conclude that we have good power to detect realistic          differences in frequencies of alleles that increase risk          of cerebrovascular disease and stroke in cases as          compared to controls                          Design of DNA pooling for genomewide association          screen          DNA pooling is a practical way to reduce the cost of          largescale casecontrol association studies because it          allows measurement of allele frequencies in groups or          pools of individuals thereby reducing the number of PCR          reactions and genotyping assays dramatically Primer          extension is the technique that has been most commonly          used in pooling studies to genotype SNPs and the results          have been very good     Resolution of allele          frequency differences between cases and controls in          pooling studies is limited however by so called          poolmeasurement and poolformation errors Differential          amplification of different SNPs during PCR and the          limited accuracy of the detection method lead to          poolmeasurement errors For example allele frequency          estimates of pools using MALDITOF mass spectroscopy have          been reported to deviate from real by approximately               Another source of error is caused by unequal          amount of DNA being contributed by individuals that make          up the pool poolformation errors In principle the          power of pooling studies can be improved by creating          multiple pools from the same individuals reducing          poolformation errors and multiple measurement of allele          frequencies reducing the poolmeasurement error          However for our study we propose to follow the          recommendations as recently outlined by Sham et al              They state that a twostage design in which markers          showing positive association in a pooling study are          followed up by confirmatory individual genotyping might          represent the best tradeoff between the cost savings of          pooling and the full information provided by individual          genotyping We propose to test the full marker set of           SNPs in the genome screen using pooled assays          with a relatively liberal pvalue eg  to          allow adequate power even with information loss Markers          that show significance in the pooled assay will then be          genotyped in all individuals of the original casecontrol          sample to confirm the association                            Discussion        Identifying genes for polygenic ischemic stroke has been        a difficult task and most human studies have employed a        candidate gene approach    although at least one        genomewide linkage scan in affected sibling pairs is on the        way     We propose to use a combination of a candidate        gene association study and genomewide association scan in        children with Hb SS at high  cases or low         controls risk for cerebrovascular disease as determined by        their TCD velocity        Association studies of candidate genes for complex        diseases have been criticized because of nonreplication of        results    and studies of genetic risk factors in        ischemic stroke have been no exception      Rish           has argued that the most likely reason for the high        falsepositive rate is the low prior probability in most        candidate gene studies that the examined polymorphisms are        causally related to the disease outcome All         polymorphisms in  candidate genes that we propose to        study have been shown to be associated with a        hypercoagulable state or have been shown to be involved in        pathways leading to the development of vasculopathy and        therefore have a high probability to be related to the TCD        velocity phenotype        One of the causes for conflicting results in candidate        gene studies and in particular for spurious associations is        believed to be population stratification or admixture            Population stratification refers to the presence of        subgroups eg ethnic groups in the sample and can        potentially cause a spurious association between the locus        and trait A spurious association due to population        stratification can only occur when two conditions hold i        the population strata differ with respect to the phenotype        and ii the population strata differ in allele        frequencies Although population stratification is        frequently used as an explanation for nonreplicable        associations in the literature there are few actual        examples to support this assumption    and experts in        the field now agree that the problem has probably been        overstated     For example Wacholder et al           argue that population stratification of an extent large        enough to distort results is unlikely to occur in many        realistic situations Ardlie et al    evaluated         moderately sized casecontrol studies for the presence of        population structure and concluded that carefully matched        casecontrol samples in cosmopolitan US and European        populations are unlikely to contain levels of population        stratification that would result in significantly inflated        numbers of false positive associations We therefore        believe that hidden stratification is unlikely to be a        problem in our casecontrol study of AfricanAmerican        children with sickle cell disease at high or low risk for        cerebrovascular disease based on their TCD values However        methods are being developed by which unlinked genetic        markers can be used to detect stratification and even        correct for it when it is present      In the        unlikely event of spurious association results we will be        able to use these methods to detect and adjust for the        effect of the population stratification present        Furthermore the study of other genetic markers namely the        distribution of globin haplotypes and the frequency of        deletional thalassemia among AfricanAmerican patients        with sickle cell disease from different centers in the        United States do not show significant differences arguing        against significant population admixture in this group                      Our genomewide association scan aimed at identifying        novel polymorphisms associated with stroke risk will        necessarily have a somewhat exploratory character The        reason is simply that this approach has only recently        become possible with the advent of high throughput SNP        genotyping and we are not currently aware of any published        studies that have used genomewide association for        identification of susceptibility loci of complex traits        Two issues are worth discussing at this point i the        optimization of selection criteria for the case and control        pools and ii the total number of SNP markers needed to        provide adequate coverage of the whole genome        Our definition of cases and controls in this study is        based on absolute cutoff values for TCD velocity For        quantitative traits like TCD velocity loss of efficiency        in a pooling design is due to loss of information from        withinpool phenotypic differences In the absence of        experimental errors this information loss can be minimized        by optimizing the criteria for selection of individuals        from the extreme tails of the distribution for the two        pools which turns out to be the upper and lower  of        this distribution     Interestingly this optimal        pooling fraction is largely independent of marker frequency        and mode of inheritance of the trait Exploration of        alternative selection criteria for cases and controls in        our genomewide association study will be dependent on the        combined TCD distribution of the  to new patients        that will be screened as part of the STOPII study and the         patients TCD   cms from the original STOP study        that are already available        The number of SNPs that are required for wholegenome        linkage disequilibrium LD mapping has been a hotly        debated issue in the last few years Initial simulation        estimates based on monotonic population expansion suggested        that useful LD was unlikely to extend beyond  kb implying        a number of  SNPs necessary for a wholegenome scan            Another study looking at real data found that LD        extended over much larger distances and arrived at an        estimate as small as  SNPs or  SNP per  kb            Recent evidence suggests that the genome consists of        blocks of high LD haplotype blocks separated by        recombination hot spots     Within each block a        limited number of common haplotypes three to five        typically capture about  of all chromosomes which means        that a reduced number of SNPs would be needed to        characterize these haplotypes     Thus the recently        initiated construction of a haplotype map of the human        genome may facilitate selection of SNP markers for        genomewide association studies like ours In the meantime        replication of significant associations detected in the        candidate gene part of the study with our genomewide        approach should provide us with practical estimates for the        likely density of SNP markers needed for successful LD        mapping        The practical and clinical implications of potential        findings of this study remain unclear The association of        one or more polymorphisms in the candidate genes with a        high TCD high risk phenotype will enable the        investigators to streamline the screening and followup        programs towards those with high risk as determined by        genetic testing The incorporation of any preventive or        therapeutic measures into this program will depend not only        on the findings of association of high TCD phenotype with        certain SNPs but also on the results of the ongoing STOP II        study which is studying the optimal duration of        transfusion in these high risk children        In conclusion we believe that our dual approach of a        candidate gene and wholegenome association study will        yield important information on genetic risk factors for        cerebrovascular disease in sickle cell disease Not only        will this generate important knowledge for improving        treatment and prevention options of patients with Hb SS        polymorphisms showing a significant association will also        be strong candidates for stroke risk in the general        population Such associations can efficiently be confirmed        in banked DNA of large cohorts of stroke cases and controls                               List of Abbreviations
