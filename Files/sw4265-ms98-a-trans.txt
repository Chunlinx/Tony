        a loaded question what do you think about gun control     Rick well as a person living in one of the areas thats got both the uh one of the most restrictive set of laws and one of the uh highest murder rates in the uh country   uhhuh   um i happen to be an opponent of gun control   well thats interesting     i happen to be um kind of funny of course i had a radical turn around in my attitude about that about four or five years ago and um along with some other political uh what do you call it um changes too i formerly was one of your typical New York left wingers   that you know thats what i suspected   and um     talking to a New Yorker i thought that id hear someone who was totally for gun control   uhhuh well were not all like that um       about a year ago i engaged in the arduous six month prices process of getting a fire arms license   oh my   and um not long after that my wife engaged in a similar process and now when we get a chance which is entirely too infrequently we can go down to the range and shoot together   yeah       i used to do a lot of that it it can be a lot of fun   all right where you are you can go to Sears right   uh yeah i think so   really yeah   im not im im not sure about Sears but i know the sporting goods stores and i know Sears used to sell guns i just im aggravated with Sears right now   yeah yeah you know the stores the stores are here but its you know you walk in and id like to look at that okay fine let me see your paperwork         uh its kind of funny because um we are going out to California in a while and uh out there you can walk into apparently there are ranges where they rent which is something that to me is completely foreign   bet   but uh yeah i may get a chance to try out some things ive never tried out before   yeah yeah well i grew up in New Mexico and you know guns were a fact of life   ah umhum   uh my granddad hunted and what not you you mentioned uh uh that youve gotten the fire arm permit is this for a hand gun or does are there uh there are the laws as restrictive for rifles and shot guns   yeah uh for rifle and shotgun youve got to sign the federal form but thats about it   i see   um and i really dont know where they stand on semiautomatics these days   yeah   uh theyve been getting a lot of bad press   yeah   um its uh   well you know i guess i could summarize my feelings about it as that uh i would like no restrictions on me and a total ban on most people   sounds fair         um   my exhusband would choke if he heard me say that   uhhuh well you know it um you know its kind of interesting you say that because we had a series about a year and a half ago of murders here four within the space of about two months and the profile of all of them was a couple got separated the guy had menacing the his exwife um they filed the court order to keep him away he got picked up once or twice and then the last time he didnt get picked up he just came in there and uh and killed the woman   oh   and there were four of these within a couple of months and nobody seems to connect with the idea that um you know there are you know that maybe just maybe she couldve uh had a better shot at it if um shed been armed   literally yeah   you know at uh   and in all those cases were those murders by guns probably   um i dont think so i think that there made a strangulation or stabbing in there you know i dont know the specifics but um you know it uh  what was that oh my wife is screaming shotgun   oh   either go get it or uh       or what um what do you call we had uh friend of mine who would maybe this is fundamentally my attitude changing uh when he pointed out that the purpose of the police was not to prevent crime and uh you know thats something we all actually  except that is the purpose of the police and i said what do you mean by that and his comment was well in order to prevent a crime the police have to be where the crime is taking place now they cant be everywhere they can be very good at deterring crime   right   they can be very good capturing criminals and enforcing the punishment of crime but they cant be good at preventing it   uhhuh   so if the police arent going to prevent it who is   i see     and uh i thought it was you know um um a very nice elegant piece of logic there and its absolutely true you know it you know so and i imagine the more rural you get that the truer that is   yeah   you know um kind of funny i was just looking at a book today where some fellow was screaming his his car had been stolen and he was screaming at the police primarily because about two days before you know they were telling him were spread to thin to enforce car theft and a few days before theyd given him a ticket for parking fifteen minutes late at a meter       you know  a matter of priorities i guess   yeah  yeah i can understand that   yeah but um     uh are you a member of the NRA   as a matter of fact   are you  recently   yeah card carrying um its about uh i think it was renewed for the second or third time   is that right   and um   my ex was a long term member of the NRA   yeah yeah its interesting of course one of the things that um yeah i i dont know
