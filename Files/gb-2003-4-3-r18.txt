                    Background        Dimorphic sexes are the norm in animals although there        are rotifer species that consist solely of parthenogenetic        females   corals that produce longlived clones that        reproduce by fragmentation   and some lizards and fish        that spinoff parthenogenetic lines that survive for        multiple generations   Among the vast number of animal        species that reproduce with males and females sexual        differentiation is controlled either chromosomally or        environmentally Flies and worms are among the        invertebrates that determine sex by doses of Xchromosomal        information Within the vertebrates there are several        mechanisms that account for sexually dimorphic development        Because temperature controls sexual development in        crocodiles many turtles and some lizards environmental        sex determination ESD has been proposed to be the        primordial vertebrate mechanism for sexual differentiation          Some reptiles and most birds and mammals have        chromosomal sex determination CSD systems and these        systems involve remarkably different chromosomes and genes          CSD strategies then may have evolved to program        genetically the developmental routines that occur in        response to temperature in the vertebrates that use ESD        The natural history of vertebrates suggests that there were        multiple solutions to the problem of CSD        Nearly all mammals have the XX female and XY male        system with XXY individuals being male and Xo individuals        female These observations led to a search for the        testisdetermining factor on the Y chromosome culminating        in isolation of the         SRY gene   which is        sexdetermining in humans    and mice   Beyond         SRY  there are several autosomal        genes including the         SRY related         SOX gene            MIS            SF           WT   and         DMRT   that contribute to sexual        organ formation alterations of which can cause        maletofemale sex reversal in XY males Because there are        rodent species with no         SRY gene and no Y chromosome          any of these genes or the Xlinked         DAX gene   might be considered        candidates for a sexdetermining gene in the XX rodents        such as mole voles whose body plan is not so different from        that of mice        In birds males are the homogametic sex with two Z        chromosomes and females the heterogametic sex with one Z        and one W chromosome Z and W are not related to mammalian        X or Y chromosomes and furthermore it is not known if the        W chromosome confers femininity andor if doses of the Z        chromosome confer masculinity   In mammals and        invertebrates diploid animals of genotype Xo and XXY were        crucial in establishing that doses of X confer femininity        in invertebrates and that presence of Y confers masculinity        in mammals Diploid birds with one or three sex chromosomes        were last reported  years ago   but triploid birds        with ZZZ and ZZW karyotypes have been observed While ZZZ        triploids seemed like normal males that produced abnormal        sperm ZZW animals appeared female on hatching and then        developed some male gonadal and behavioral characteristics        as they matured   These studies suggest that the        dosage versus determining factor argument is a false        dichotomy in birds doses of Z chromosome appear to        masculinize while presence of the W appears to        feminize        According to theory a pair of autosomes can evolve into        sex chromosomes by mutation of a control gene   If a        control gene confers sexual development by dosage it might        become lost from the alternative sex chromosome         DMRT is a candidate dosagedependent        gene for masculinity in birds and alligators on the basis        of Zlinkage   conservation and geneexpression        patterns   Alternatively if a control gene confers        sexual development as a dominant determining factor it may        have evolved as an allele of a gene on the opposite sex        chromosome This latter mechanism is thought to relate         SRY to the Xlinked         SOX gene in mammals          Histidine triad HIT enzymes are a superfamily of        nucleotide hydrolases and transferases that contain a        catalytic motif related to the sequence HisHisHis        where  represents a hydrophobic amino acid and act on        substrates containing a nucleoside monophosphate          Branch  of the HIT superfamily includes the ubiquitous        Hint enzymes   plus two enzymes with a more        phylogenetically resstricted distribution namely        Aprataxin which is lost in humans with ataxiaoculomotor        apraxia    and the scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme        Dcps    While Dcps enzymes are specific for        hydrolysis of cap structures such as meGpppG           prototypical Hint enzymes such as rabbit Hint and yeast        Hnt hydrolyze adenosine monophosphoramide substrates        such as AMPlysine to AMP plus lysine   Loss of this        enzymatic activity renders yeast cells        temperaturesensitive for growth on galactose medium and        hypersensitive to mild mutations in the yeast homolog of        mammalian Cdk that is Kin the kinase component of        general transcription factor TFIIH   Loss of Hnt        enzymatic activity also renders cells hypersensitive to        mutations in the cyclin H homolog Ccl the MAT homolog        Tfb and to Cak the activating kinase for Kin all of        which lead to destabilized Kin complexes and a likely        increase in concentration of Kin monomers          Consequently it was suggested that a Kin monomer is the        likely target of Hint regulation potentially because it is        posttranslationally adenylylated and is a protein        substrate of the lysinedeadenylylating activity of Hint          Indeed twodimensional electrophoretic analysis of        Kin is consistent with Kin being subject to a        posttranslational modification in addition to        phosphorylation    that appears to be controlled by         HNT genotype A Krakowiak and CB        unpublished results Finally it is important to note that        Hint is a dimer with two identical purine        nucleosidemonophosphatebinding sites per dimer   The        aminoacid residues that have remained most constant        throughout evolution are those that form the dimer        interface and make direct contact with AMP          Chickens and many other orders of birds are dimorphic        for         HINT related genes on their sex        chromosomes The chicken Z chromosome contains the locus        for a typical         HINT gene predicted to encode a        polypeptide  identical to rabbit Hint   However on        the genepoor femalespecific W chromosome the         ASW avian sexspecific Wlinked        gene was identified    encoding a predicted Asw        protein with striking similarity to Hint with the specific        exception of residues involved in AMP recognition As shown        in Figure  the degree to which the nucleotidebinding        site was altered is remarkable Although human biochemists        can depress activity more than  fold in Fhit           and Hint   with a single activesite His mutation hens        apparently continued to peck at the sequence of Hint        altering all four of the absolutely conserved His residues        In all  of  normally conserved residues identified in        immediate proximity to the adenine base the ribose and the         phosphate   are altered in Asw                ASW is absent in the ratites emu and        ostrich   which have indistinguishable sex        chromosomes but is tandemly repeated approximately         times on the W chromosome of all the nonratite birds        examined   Confirming the subtractive manner in which         ASW was cloned both groups found        that         ASW mRNA is highly expressed in the        female urogenital ridge at the stages preceding and during        sexual differentiation    Additionally         HINT mRNA is expressed at levels        about twofold greater in males than in females in        developing chicks more than in adult chickens and at a        message level oneseventh to onetenth the level of         ASW in stage females           ASW was cloned a third time as a        message that is increased in cells lacking the splicing        factor ASFSF   Surprisingly ASFSF did not affect        splicing of the         ASW message but rather destabilized        the mRNA   Involvement of ASFSF in the regulation of                ASW mRNA is interesting because        sexspecific splicing of         doublesex mRNA in         Drosophila  a sexdetermining gene        for which the mammalian         DMRT genes were named is mediated in        part by ASFSF   Although the initial cloning of         ASW predated knowledge that Hint is        an enzyme both groups suggested that Asw might function by        a dominantnegative mechanism through heterodimerization        with Hint thereby inducing female development           Heterodimerization was also discussed in the review        literature   also without awareness that Hint function        depends on enzymatic activity                      Results and discussion        Genomic and expression data suggest that the purpose of        Asw is titration of Hint function How might this work In        the simplest case a normally dimeric enzyme with two        active sites that is produced as a heterodimer with one        good and one bad active site would be expected to have         of the specific activity of the homodimer This is not a        scenario for dominant negativity and in fact such a        scenario does not explain why Asw is produced at all If        Asw were simply an inert dimerization partner for Hint a         reduction in Hint cellular specific activity could be        obtained if there were no         ASW genes on the W chromosome Males        would have two doses of         HINT and females one dose such that        twice as much Hint dimer could be made in males as in        females Furthermore if         ASW were simply a lossoffunction        allele given the paucity of genes on the W chromosome        sexchromosome theory   suggests that such a gene would        be lost The repeated and highly expressed nature of the        gene suggests that it has evolved to be dominantly        interfering  the challenge is to determine the mechanism        of dominance over the Zencoded         HINT         One might expect a HintAsw heterodimer to have        substantially less than  of the activity of a Hint        homodimer if Hint homodimers showed cooperativity with        respect to substrate binding andor hydrolysis For        example if the first nucleotide substrate were to bind        weakly but the presence of the first bound substrate        promoted efficient binding of a second substrate then a        heterodimer containing one functional and one nonfunctional        active site would retain only one lowaffinity binding site        and be severely defective This mechanism can be largely        excluded however because sigmoidal substrate saturation        kinetics were not observed with AMPNH            The data for both rabbit and        yeast Hint enzymes indicate that the dimers two        crystallographically defined nucleotidebinding sites          bind nucleotide independently and fit well to a single        submicromolar K         m for each enzyme Figure           As cooperativity is difficult to invoke in this system        we consider that for Asw to titrate Hint enzyme activity by        heterodimerization Asw must carry a signal for        mislocalization andor proteolysis andor somehow alter        the Hint active site We therefore constructed a molecular        model of the proposed HintAsw heterodimer by superimposing        the chicken Hint sequence on the determined Xray structure        of rabbit Hint and threading and minimizing the Asw        sequence on the opposing monomer This analysis suggested        first that Hint and Asw do retain sufficient sequence        identity at the dimer interface to form a heterodimer        second that Asw has an insertion sequence at the bottom of        the dimer that could be a site of alternative localization        or proteolysis and third that Gln a residue that Asw        has substituted for Trp of Hint may interfere with the        function of His in Hint across the dimer interface        Although altered specificity of a putative HintAsw        heterodimer is conceivable the simplest enzymatic        mechanism for dominant interference is that Gln from Asw        depresses activity from the Hint active site        The dimer interface of Hint is formed by antiparallel        interactions between helix  and its symmetry mate and        strand  and its symmetry mate   These sequences are        contiguous in the primary sequence of Hint and form the        region of greatest identity with Asw Figure  Apart from        the curious substitution of  of  nucleotideproximal        residues in Asw the most dissimilar region of Asw consists        of a five aminoacid insertion between strands  and         and substitution of GlyAlaPro Asw for AspGluSer        Hint at the aminoterminal end of helix  Both these        changes are located on the bottom surface of the dimer          The bulky amino acids in the Asw insertion        ProLeuTrpThrArg which in Hint is an extremely tight         turn may be a handle for altered localization or        proteolysis Cellular localization of green fluorescent        protein GFP fusions to Hint and Asw was investigated in        male chick embryo fibroblasts   GFPHint was found to        be distributed in the cytoplasm and the nuclei though        somewhat concentrated in the nuclei with respect to the GFP        control   GFPAsw was found to be essentially confined        to nuclei   Though localization of Hint in        Aswoverexpressing cells was not examined if Hint has        extranuclear that is Cdkexclusive functions then        excluding Hint from the cytoplasm may be an important        function of Asw        The crystal structure of nucleotidebound forms of        rabbit Hint showed that the carboxyterminal amino acids of        each Hint monomer extend across the dimer interface and are        buried near the opposing nucleotide The Trp residue in the        extreme carboxyterminal TrpProProGly motif is buried        near His the final His of the HIT motif of the        opposing monomer   His corresponds to His of        Fhit which was localized in low barrier hydrogenbonding        distance to the  bridging oxygen of a bound ApppA analog        in cocrystal structure with Fhit HisAsn   On the        basis of mutagenesis of the conserved His residues in Fhit          and the location of these His residues in crystal        structures of Hint and Fhit    a catalytic role was        proposed for His   The structures show that His        is in the same plane as His with the N of His         positioned to accept a hydrogen bond from the N of His        This geometry was considered critical for the enzymatic        activity of Hint and Fhit As shown in Figure  Asw        sequences contain a substitution of Gln for Trp of        Hint As shown in Figure  Gln of Asw is predicted to        alter the conformation of Hint His such that His is        not positioned for productive hydrogen bonding dominantly        depressing hydrolase activity from the Hint active site In        short loss of the AMPbinding site is predicted to account        for negativity of Asw Gln and possibly insertion        sequences that may have a role in stability or localization        are predicted to make Asw dominant                    Conclusions        Identification of sexlinked         ASW and         HINT genes in birds has raised new        experimental questions It will be interesting to learn        whether Asw and Hint heteromultimerize and what the         in vitro and         in vivo stabilities of        heterooligomers are with respect to the homodimers It will        be interesting to determine whether Asw homodimers display        any binding to Hint substrates what degree of Hint enzyme        activity is retained by the putative HintAsw heterodimer        and whether Gln is required for depression of Hint        enzymatic activity in HintAsw heterodimers Turning to        genetic analysis if         ASW has a significant role in        feminization of birds then viruses that increase        expression of Asw may promote female development in ZZ        eggs potentially in a manner that requires Gln If         HINT is part of the Z chromosome that        works by gene dosage then viruses that direct expression        of Hint may promote male or intersexual development in ZW        eggs as was seen with ZZW triploids   Finally if it        is true that Hint enzyme activity is important in making ZZ        chicks male or if Hint inhibition is important in making ZW        chicks female then it will be interesting to learn whether        Hint is involved in establishment or maintenance of sex in        other animals
