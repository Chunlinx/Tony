                                 The New Pol Pot            The traditional Cambodianshawl is still wrapped around Pol Pots neck but the hair is grayer andsparser and the round face is lined with wrinkles He needs a cane to walk andoxygen to breathe He is nearly blind in the left eye and he cant stand themosquitoes that swarm around his hut He is older now and he is wiser            The mancritics once maligned as a genocidal maniac is living quietlydyingquietlyin the jungles of his native Cambodia With age has comeintrospection with introspection has come regret Our movement mademistakes he admits softly sincerely in his first interview in nearly twodecades After  long hard years Pol Pot has made peace with himself            Once upon a time way back in the early s Pol Pot wasthe fieriest of revolutionariesBrother No  the Original Cambodian Hewas enthusiastictoo enthusiastic he realizes nowto bring glorious Marxismto his suffering people to free Cambodia from the yoke of Vietnamese invadersto abolish the twin evils of Western materialism and class privilege Pol Potdreamed of a society of equals a grand new Cambodia And so he madeerrorsthe errors that young eager men everywhere make            The sof course were a difficult decade We all did things we have come to regretand Pol Pot is no exception A million or two of his countrymen lost theirlives because of his mistakes Starvation was epidemic Cannibalism was commonPol Pot abolished religion education medicine commerce money He drove citydwellers into the countryside and he forced them to farm Tens of thousands ofhis subjects were tortured and murdered at his behest Some critics said hereturned Cambodia to the Dark Ages Others called him names bloodthirstybarbaric cruel             To hear those words today pains Pol Pot Icame to carry out the struggle not to kill people he says a look ofmelancholy shadowing his face Even now and you can look at me am I a savageperson The plaintive question echoes in the moist warm air of thejungle            Severalmonths ago the Khmer Rouge sentenced Pol Pot to life under house arresthutarrest reallyfor the murder of Son Sen an old friend and colleague whoplotted a coup against him this spring Fourteen of Son Sens family membersincluding infant grandchildren also were killed Pol Pot regrets the murdersThey too were a mistake he says his voice filled with pain So Pol Potcan accept his arrest What he cant accept is his betrayal at the hands of hisfriends The men who tried and sentenced him are his oldest comrades thesoldiers he led through good times and bad            Who is Pol Pot He is a man who has always had difficultytelling others about himself Im quite modest I dont want to tell peopleIm a leader he says Other revolutionaries have courted the press Castropractically lives for sound bites and the Zapatistas are better at planningpress conferences than battles But Pol Pot has never had the gift of the gabespecially around the camera and he has never learned how to play to thepress Reporters saw him only as a coldblooded killer they missed his pensiveside The adulation that journalists showered on Castro and Marcos and HafezalAssad passed Pol Pot by So too did the personal wealth that otherdictators amassed Pol Pot has never believed in greed Not for him thediamonds of Mobutu the snazzy clothes of Duvalier the shoes of Marcos theSwiss bank accounts of them all When Pol Pot fell from power he walked intothe jungle with nothing but the clothes on his back            But thats all in the pastThe new Pol Pot is about the future He wants to make the most of his goldenyears His politics have mellowed Today the elder statesman advisesCambodias leaders to seek rapprochement with the West When I die my onlywish is that Cambodia remain Cambodia and belong to the West he says It isover for communism and I want to stress that            The oldPol Pot worked tirelessly on the revolution neglecting his health hisfriends his family The new Pol Pot is a family man His wife and theircharming yearold daughterthe apple of his eyeshare his captivity PolPot rests quietly during the day while his daughter goes to school and his wifehoes the vegetable patch In the evenings they share a modest meal and PolPot asks his daughter about what she learned that day In captivity he hasfulfilled a lifelong dream He has found the very thing he sought to give hisfellow Cambodians during the s a quiet life on a country farm To see PolPot today is to be reminded of Voltaire We must cultivate our             OK OK I give up It wont work not even asparody The reemergence of Pol Pot is a landmark moment in celebrity cultureAt last someone who cannot be forgiven            AsMatthew Cooper wrote in the latest Newsweek  there is a standardforgiveness ritual for sinning celebrities After theyre caught theydisappear for awhile then reemerge apologize for their venality usually toLarry King and retake their place in the pantheon Dick Morris managed thisin a matter of days Michael Milken got sick and became a belovedphilanthropist Cancer Superb Larry King told Newsweek  RichardNixon served only a decade in exile before returning triumphantly as astatesman            So the rejection of Pol Pot is heartening Onepersonperhaps only one personexists in the world whose evil is so greatthat it cannot be neutered Pol Pot is in captivity he is sick and he ismildly apologetic Yet not a single word has been murmured on his behalf Anyother infamous personOJ the Unabomber Timothy McVeighcould rescue adamaged reputation But Pol Pot is irredeemable Can you imagine a             There is one irony in therejection of Pol Pot In making him a pariah the world is legitimizing men whoare almost as awful The man who imprisoned Pol Pot is a onelegged Khmer Rougegeneral named Ta Mok His nickname is the Butcher and he carried out many ofthe brutal massacres ordered by Pol Pot Yet Ta Mok is being feted for havingcaptured his old mentor He has received favorable press coverage for openingschools and permitting markets in his remote northern stronghold Ta Mok haseven been given credit for putting Pol Pot on trial and sentencing him to lifeunder house arrestas opposed to summarily shooting him in the head which isthe Khmer Rouges usual idea of justice Some writers hint that the only reasonTa Mok bothered with the trial and the life sentence is to burnish the KhmerRouges bloody image If so it seems to have worked            As for the supreme villainhe is unlikely to appear again in public The remarkable interview Pol Pot gaveNate Thayer of the Far Eastern Economic Review last month was his firstin  years and it will undoubtedly be his last According to Thayer Pol Potis very near death Survivors of his terror can take some satisfaction in thisPol Pot is bound for the death that you would wish on a tyrant the death thatHitler and Stalin managed to duck He is going to die slowly a captive who isimpoverished in great pain betrayed by his friends and unredeemed by a worldthat would redeem anyone else
