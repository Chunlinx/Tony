                uh how do you feel about gun control   uh on the scale they gave one to ten id say im probably a four im not totally im not one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns but i dont think we should be carrying Uzis either  you know what i mean  yeah i know i mean i dont think machine guns automatic weapons i dont believe in things like that but i think   some people do i know   that everyone should have the right to have a hand gun in their house if they so choose and but i think there should be some  restrictions when you buy one you know they should do more background search on you they should i think it should be harder to buy one   right yeah theres a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a gun because they dont really ask a lot of questions when you walk into those stores   yeah no they dont they dont ask anything except how old you are i dont think thats kind of scary   im from California  my mom the last time i was like purchased a gun my  my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted like an antique one  and   uhhuh   they he had to fill out some forms but i guess California might be tougher i dont know   yeah they might be or you know how we are here in Texas its like everybodys a hunter so  im not much of a hunter but   yeah its   ive never even bought a gun myself my dads given it to me or someones given me one so im probably real illegal you know carrying guns that arent even mine     yeah its a its a hard decision to make   it really is uh the only problem i have with gun control is that they the radicals wanna ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people carrying guns are gonna be be the people who are gonna kill you anyway   like the bumper sticker  its true yeah   yeah exactly right it really is because theyre gonna get them one way or another they will always have a way look at drugs they always have a way to get that so   right right right   and theyre illegal so i dont think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together     no i yeah i i i i i agree that it would be like people in people that are uh criminals are the ones that are gonna get them and then you have no defense against these people when they do  come into your house or something   right thats true i think they ought to teach people how to shoot them too how to take care of one how to act around one when they buy them   yeah i have have gun gun have have gun management    right yeah exactly you cannot take the gun home until youve taken this course sign up here  something like that   yeah or required required required for every college student  oh   right exactly  before graduation   God gun control  its its such a heated topic in the the and people get so emotional about it   yep oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it all the ive worked with a lot of people that hunt and they just they they dont see any sense in it at all they think its ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course theyre hunters they know what theyre doing they dont realize therere a bunch of crazy people out there that   some of them are crazy too  whew yeah yeah they go out there and get drunk and start shooting   dont use it for that  well yeah thats true  they shoot each other thinking theyre a deer  yeah darn i thought you were a deer Bob sorry my mistake   yeah Marge i dont know what happened to your husband he just never came back   looked like antlers i dont know   yep that happens a lot too   yeah  oh   but i guess thats it thats my opinion on it  so what now     im not sure   uh uh i think we just hang up yeah okay  thanks bye   i lets see yeah yeah we just say goodbye and hang up okay okay okay thanks byebye
