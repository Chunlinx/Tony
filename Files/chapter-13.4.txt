commonly recognized method for the exchange of money                For example a US resident who wanted to send money to a person in another                country such as Pakistan would give her money in dollars to a USbased                hawaladar The US hawaladar would then contact his counterpart in Pakistan giving                the Pakistani hawaladar the particulars of the transaction such as the amount of                money the code and perhaps the identity of the recipient The ultimate recipient                in Pakistan would then go to the Pakistani hawaladar and receive his money in                rupees from whatever money the Pakistani hawaladar has on hand As far as the                sender and ultimate recipient are concerned the transaction is then complete The                two hawaladars would have a variety of mechanisms to settle their debt either                through offsetting transactions eg someone in Pakistan sending money to the                United States using the same two hawaladars a periodic settling wire transfer from                the US hawaladars bank to the Pakistani hawaladars bank or a commercial                transaction such as the US hawaladar paying a debt or an invoice in dollars                that the Pakistani hawaladar owes in the United States Hawalas typically do not                have a large central control office for settling transactions maintaining instead a                loose association with other hawaladars to transfer value generally without any                formal or legally binding

assessment is based on an extensive review of FBI files and interviews with                agents and supervisors at FBI Headquarters and various field offices             Although there was an increased focus on money laundering several significant                legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to close vulnerabilities in the US                financial system failed to gain traction Some of these such as a move to control                foreign banks with accounts in the United States died as a result of banking                industry pressure Others such as the regulation of money remitters within the                United States were mired in bureaucratic inertia and a general antiregulatory                environment In any event it is an open question whether such legislative or                regulatory initiatives would have significantly harmed al Qaeda which generally                made little use of the US financial system to move or store

reconsider DOJs denial of the                FBIs original counterterrorism budget request in light of the continuing threat It                was not uncommon for FBI budget requests to be reduced by the attorney general or by                OMB before being submitted to Congress this had occurred during the previous                administration             In chapter  we discuss how this problem arose By  it had become worse                During  the FBI had erred in preparing some of its applications for FISA                surveillance misstating how much information had been shared with criminal                prosecutors and the nature of the walls between the intelligence and law enforcement                functions within the FBI In March  Judge Royce Lamberth chief judge of the                FISA Court chastised the FBI sending a letter to Ashcroft announcing he was                banning an offending supervisory agent from appearing before the court Judge                Lamberth also met personally with Ashcroft and his acting deputy Robert Mueller to                complain about the performance of the FBI and the Office of Intelligence Policy and                Review OIPR Judge Lamberth letter to Ashcroft Mar   John Ashcroft                interview Dec   In May  Ashcroft altered the FISA application                process to ensure greater accuracy See DOJ memo Ashcroft to Freeh The Foreign                Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA Process May              In July  the General Accounting Office criticized the way the  procedures                were being applied and criticized OIPR and FBI for not complying with the                informationsharing requirements of the  procedures This was the third report                in as many years by a government agency indicating that the procedures were not                working as planned In October  December  and March  proposals for                reform to the  procedures were put forth by senior DOJ officials None resulted                in reform One impediment was that the respective DOJ components could not agree on                all the proposed reforms A second impediment was a concern that such reforms would                require a challenge to the FISA Courts position on the matter This was considered                risky because the FISA Court of Review had never convened and one of the judges had                previously voiced skepticism regarding the constitutionality of the FISA statute                Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson did ask the court to accept the modifications                described in the text which were distributed as part of his August  memorandum                reaffirming the  procedures See DOJ memo Thompson to the
