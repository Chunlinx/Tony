                uh i guess ive always kind of liked golf i i worked on a golf course at at one time and thats how i picked up golf and uh i dont know its just a kind of a challenging game   it sure is i play at least three times a week   umhum   im on it   i havent gotten the chance lately though to play im trying to get back into it uh so uh i got to start all over again its not like riding a bicycle you do tend to forget   no well im one of those rare left handed golfers   oh yeah   and i do enjoy playing     whats your handicap   right now its three   okay yeah i was down at about four or five quite awhile ago its probably up there to twenty now if if i was ever to start again   well if you play with some consistency though you can get it right back down   yeah yeah i got to try and get out there i i know with uh our long winters i i enjoy watching it i dont know if its just because i like the game or i just like to to see the warm weather   uh well we can usually play here year round sometimes in January its not too comfortable to play   umhum   but theres usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play and im pretty much addicted to golf so i get out there one way or the other     yeah thats the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter you almost have to relearn every spring to to get back out   its a good game though its very challenging and the reason i like it so much is because im essentially playing against myself   yeah   thats the way i look at it i i play in in lot a lot of groups and but i dont they keep score and between themselves but i really dont care um i go out and each shot i say well this is what im gonna try to do and then i see how close i can come to that   umhum right yeah you always work on trying to improve each day and   yeah and inevitably inevitably one facet facet of my game isnt working at one time or another either im not driving very well or im not hitting long irons very well or im not putting well or but sometimes it all comes together   yeah yeah i i know what you mean i when i used to golf out there id putt well but i i wouldnt uh chip well one of the two uh or something would go wrong but i always managed to to get near par anyway   well we just had the tour championship here in Pine Hurst   oh   and i went to that and Craig Statler won in the playoffs   umhum   but we uh this is a big golf area   yeah   we have a lot of uh id say we probably have  within fifteen miles twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course Pine Hurst and we still have the Greensboro Open here every year   umhum do you have uh long waits uh to get on the course   yes we do as a matter of fact it it uh its only been that way in the last five years but now you uh most of the courses have a uh   yeah   two day advance tee time you have to call   yeah okay yeah i just moved into this small community so im gonna try and get in one of their golf courses here and       im hoping it wont be quite i was from the uh twin cities area   thats some cold golf too isnt it   yeah       are you sure you guys arent having the bad weather   we have cold   yeah   usually January and the first two weeks in February     well i wish thats all we had   but um last week we were in the seventies and somethings coming through now so its like in the low forties right now   oh   but uh its supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties we have very windy winters   hm   and very cold   yeah   but we dont get any snow anymore i dont i dont know what changed that pattern we used to get four or five inches a year now we get nothing its been probably five years since weve had any measurable snowfall   oh i see well at least it that doesnt uh get in the way of golfing so   no but i have played golf in the snow before   that   yep get out my orange golf ball and go out and   yeah yeah now thats what they do here sometimes you hear about it where theyll take the orange ball out there but if you got
