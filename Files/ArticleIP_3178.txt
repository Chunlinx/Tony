increasingly quaint and may eventuallybecome obsolete Isaac Asimov in his futuristic Foundation Trilogynovels imagined a thickly settled universe where the familiar hour day isan accepted convention

theorized that theutility of at the end of the day has been augmented by the variousunresolved episodes lumped under the word Whitewater which call for aneconomical way of expressing the thought when things finally get straightenedout             Robert WBurchfield the longtime editor of the Oxford English Dictionary  treatsthe phrase with magisterial derision in The New Fowlers Modern EnglishUsage he dismisses it as one of the ignoble clichs introducedinto the language in the c first recorded in  And yet the phrasethough lately putting in overtime is not so young The Random
