                                 The British Election on the Web            Ask a British schoolchild toname his favorite political party and you might be surprised Instead of LaborLiberal Dem or Tory you might hear Loony            Yes the Loonies are anofficial party with candidates and a Web site The only problem is that justas Great Britains elections approach their climax its been down Thatsbecause the Loony Webmaster fell ill In recent days all youd find at TheOfficial MonsterRaving Loony Party Site was a picture of some strangelooking people and apromise the site will be back online very shortly            TheLoonies are far from the only British party to invade the Internet As thepolitical eyes of the world turn to watch whether the heavily favored BillClintonlike Tony Blair and his Labor Party trounce the longrulingConservatives and their stiff Prime Minister John Major some snazzy Web sitesare waiting to show them whats really going on            While the proportion of Brits with Internet access is muchsmaller than in the United States British politicians seem to be somewhatahead of their American counterparts in using the Net to communicate withvoters They are eager to participate in online forums such as the one onUK Citizens OnlineDemocracy to reach out to young voters            What they said in that forumwasnt much different from what youd hear in a televised US debate JohnMajor showed a traditional British acerbity Labors manifesto he wrotewas more revealing for what it left out It didnt say that in six weeks theywould sell out to Europe In three months they would raise billions of poundsin tax in their emergency summer budget And in  months they would hand morepower back to the unions and start the process that could lead to the breakupof the United Kingdom            Bycontrast the media savvy Tony Blairs responses as one participant in thesubsequent online discussion noted only seemed to be an advert for the Labourmanifesto  whereas all the other replies seem to have taken some time intheir approach to the questions Perhaps suggested another thats becauseBlairs advisers had probably moved him onto something they thought moreurgent half way through the piece like buying Rupert Murdoch a drink andsomeone else finished it off            In Britain to be sure only about  of the members of Parliament have email In the United States more than percent of members of Congress had Web pages by November But in Britain votesare cast for the individual candidate not the party Perhaps as a result thesites maintained by the United Kingdoms major parties tend to be far moreinteractive and userfriendly than the  US party sites which were littlebetter than electronic billboards

Post  and the National Journal fathered PoliticsNowand Time and CNN sired AllPolitics  and most major papers and TVchannels notably the new MSNBC had election pages But except on electionnight these were a relatively small part of their Web sites let alone theiroverall news In Britain however major news organizations are spendingheavily to make their election sites the main focus of their overall Web sitesFor example the Financial Times has its UK Elections  page withguides polls and an election shareprice index The Guardian and theObserver have a broad site packed with information And the BBC whichis adding five people to its person Web operation plans to provide liveaudio and video streams on election night            Early in  US punditsexperts and consultants heralded the Year of the

the Internet influenced the way they votedAnd on election night television networks saw their ratings drop whileInternet users flooded electionoriented sites in record numbers            Already this year Britishpundits experts and consultants have been predicting that the Internet willmake a difference in the UK elections To watch politicians fawn over onlinetools and techniques many might think so There is however one thing forsure On the evening of May  British political Web sites will be flooded byenthusiastic users Some sites will crash There will be delays in gettingreturns And more than likely historians will point to the May  election asthe political dawn of Great Britains Age of the Internet
