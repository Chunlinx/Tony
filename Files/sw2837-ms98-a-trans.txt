                are you going to tell me what youve been doing lately in the okay   sure uh ill offer anything that i can on the subject uh my husband and i just bought a just moved here recently and uh we bought uh this house about uh i dont know year and a half ago what we have here now is just a basic three bedroom two bath brick house which is uh completely different from what i had had before when i was working and before i married uh i lived in a little town south of here that is just full  of old homes and uh historic old houses and things like that so i uh tried to i was in the process of renovating a house and uh that was about seventy five years old   oh my   so um it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled jacked up um new plumbing new wiring wallpaper paint everything you can think of that house had to have   you uh you are experienced i would say   well i i really did enjoy it uh you know it was amazing what i found out i could do on my own if i just put my mind to it yeah   well i agree i have done done something uh like that too only not nearly nearly as extensive   umhum   but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch style home uh after having a   it is it is yeah   one that was historical looking   thats thats true when uh i met my husband he was living in an apartment at the time and and uh the town that i was living in only about eighty miles from here so um you know i we really it was just the market was so good we hadnt really planned on buying and as you probably heard from the in the Dallas and Texas area period the housing market is just unreal i mean you can get things for such a song   yes   so thats thats really why we ended up in a house like this his is not what we you know what we want to stay in forever because i have to have my ive found that after doing this other house i have to have my hands into stuff and   uhhuh   you know im always just wanting to paint and and wallpaper and redo and redo so um you know i im ready to get ahold of another one that i can have a little more input into  so   well maybe you can uh make that one charming and and make a little bit money uh   yeah thats thats the key you know the thing is uh when we moved in they had just um painted wallpapered were you know wallpapered new carpet and everything so i feel sort of um you know like its sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now and do it over just because im in the mood to do it so uh well see well see how much longer were here   yes well we just moved to Charlotte from Enid Oklahoma   umhum oh Oklahoma of all places   so i know of what youre talking about as far as the market was concerned and ill tell you uh we we had kind of a charming house it was a cedar shake house and very weathered and   yeah uhhuh right oh yes uhhuh   uh it was about fifty years old but not traditional not really uh   umhum   traditional looking particularly   umhum umhum umhum   and uh so i tried to make it after i sold my business i in in i spent almost three years redoing   oh yeah   and i considered it a full time job   oh it is yeah   and when we did uh we kind of had planned this uh trek to the east because were both originally from this part of the country   umhum umhum i see uhhuh   and so i think some of the things that i did paid off for instance one thing that i did that might even be a good suggestion for you uh was something i did on the outside i love old estate estate sales   umhum umhum yes yes   i happened to go to just a little estate sale that just a little white frame house where the couple uh was very old and had gone into nursing homes and   umhum umhum umhum oh yeah   uh all the men started going down to the barn and so i thought well shoot im going to   huh oh thats where i need to go   yes im going to the barn too   exactly   they uh auctioned some tools and things like that but then they went over and started uh   yeah uhhuh   auctioning this big stack of bricks   oh   and so well i thought gee ive been wanting to do some brick uh walkways for a time   umhum work right right uhhuh   anyway it ended up after some pretty uh heavy bidding that i got all those bricks for forty dollars   umhum oh my word   and so my husband and i loaded bricks in his pickup truck for days     oh no oh my word   but what we ended up with was about four thousand   for forty dollars oh my   for forty dollars and so what we did we had built a deck on the back of that house but it needed and it was quite large out to into the yard but on either side of it to the ends of the house   umhum something uhhuh umhum   it just needed to be all tied together so we made brick patios   right   and walkways   oh how fun oh how nice   and so for and he he did the digging which was about six inches but i figured the sand and all had that delivered and leveled it and and placed most all the bricks   umhum uhhuh right right umhum   and it turned out beautifully   oh i bet and what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way   yes well it nearly killed me   yeah but but you did stagger stagger back and say oh doesnt this look nice     i hated to leave it   well let me ask you when you laid those bricks i know my parents bought a house about ten years ago theyre fixing to sell it again but and move again theyre kind of my moms like i am shes a renovator a lover of old things   umhum   and you know they have to be doing something constantly and the patio that came with that house um was not laid on a like i dont know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something under uh on top of the sand and then lay the bricks but they have they have a problem with these little tiny like sand bugs or something   no we well i   that drill in between all these bricks and of course you know you have the uh the weeds that come up in between the bricks or and things like that   well no i i didnt have that trouble because um we laid the i did get some material  and studied every bit of material that i could study but we laid those bricks about as close as you can get them because when you start and we put them on a base of four inches of sand sand   uhhuh yeah i see oh okay yeah   and then we uh we swept sand in between but but it was an error to to leave like an eighth of an inch or whatever you just put them together as close as you can   umhum as tight as you can thats probably because they had you know every spring my mom says were going to have a party a barbecue and tell everybody guess what were going to were going to redo the patio you know were going to pull up all the bricks but uh they just they j ust havent brought themselves to do it   um umhum yeah well and i also used a rubber hammer a lot to um you know if it wasnt quite level or something id just get that rubber hammer and um   so uhhuh uhhuh right   and and probably you know i think that they could if they have problems with uh sand bugs of some kind i think all they need to do is probably put some insecticide down in there on a   uhhuh yeah   oh a fairly regular basis for a while anyway   right right well the thing thats funny is theyve done uh theyve done things like that you know ill catch her out there spraying around and then its like in two days time she theyll come home from work and those little things are back its just theyre the most resilient little characters and so i dont know what theyre finally going to do she may just hopefully theyll sell the house and go somewhere else and then she wont have to worry about it   well i think she i think she needs to take them to the extension agent and ask him what they are and   what are these things   yeah is it Diazinon or what is it that will uh Dursban or something like that   right yeah what it what it is thatll thatll take care of them   Dursban i think in this area or most all areas they use you know for ticks and fleas and you know theyre awful hard to do anything with   yeah right oh thats true thats true but my my dad farms and you know shes always telling him isnt there something that that you can bring home with you that kills everything that you spray you know out in the out in the field that you can get rid of these bugs but   yeah i bet Dursban would do it   um it might it might do it yeah shes got so many flower shes got just a gorgeous yard so many um flowers and her her four cats you know so shes sort of uh real funny about what she sprays   yeah i think uh you probably just need to make sure that it dries very very carefully uh well before she lets her cats out or something like that   umhum umhum yeah yeah   well gosh Deb we could talk all day couldnt we   i know i i was just you know it just seems like i as i said when i heard the what the subject was i thought oh gosh i havent thought about uh what i went through at that other house in so long ive been so busy but uh i dont know of everything that i did i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do but um gosh you know i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house   yes   um up up the stairway even you know i just had a ball with it it was so much fun yeah and ive sworn up and down my moms um   wow oh oh good   my moms great grandparents had this huge Victorian house in Paris Texas and the one thing that she ended up with is was the old door that was that was on the front door of that house   uhhuh yes   and she has that up in her attic and i have sworn that it im going to find a house to put that door on before she does so as far as looking toward the future       you know thats my plan im going to have to move fast i think though because um you know as i said
