            hi   im Bridget   im Barbara   its nice to meet you   well its nice to meet you where are you from   im in Lubbock   oh im in Garland   are you   uhhuh   okay good you ready for me to push one then okay   yes i am     so what kind of clothes do you wear to work   i wear dresses skirts um that type of attire im a secretary   uhhuh are you   uhhuh   okay well this is kind of a hard topic because i dont work   you dont   no im in college so   oh so you can dress carefree right   but i think thats right i have on a sweat shirt right now and and jeans  and i feel great       what is your best mode of clothing   pardon   what is your best mode of clothing you like blue jeans best   yeah but i think if i was going to go to work and stuff i think a dress or more like a suit would would be more appropriate for sure   yes thats what i wear mainly is suits cotton or um gabardine   umhum   wool  sometimes in winter but here in Texas you dont really need wool that often   yeah doesnt get that hot   yes   i dont know i cant i would i wouldnt like to have to wear a suit every day though i wouldnt like that at all   no i dont do it every day   yeah   just occasionally do you have a certain fabric you like better than others   um with dress clothes   uhhuh   i honestly i dont know because i havent had to wear that many dress clothes yet to be honest you know     uhhuh   i really dont think i i dont even i couldnt even tell you but i would say i dont know   well i like cotton the best its easier to take care of and its its uh a much fresher freer and freer fabric   yeah thats true anything you dont have to iron that you can just send to the cleaners sounds great     well cotton you have to iron unfortunately or send to the cleaners but theres some fabrics like you said that uh gabardines and suedes and that that have to go to the cleaners all the time   really do you wear really dressy dresses to work   yes yes yes im up in corporate   do you oh okay so you go all out and everything   yes   yeah well that would be important though i mean you would have to   yes because the first person they see is the secretary before the boss and uh i couldnt uh get away with blue jeans and a Tshirt   uhhuh         i bet you couldnt     do you wear sneakers do you wear um brand names or do you just get something off the shelf at the stores   um i usually get like i usually get Nike   umhum   with shoes and stuff like that im real big my feet get real sore real easily so i have to have really well padded shoes   i see do you like sweaters   uhhuh yeah i love sweaters   do you wear them often   yeah because it gets really cold up here i mean you get the turtle neck sweater jacket thing a lot   um   so i mean i would say mostly like now its like you could wear like a Tshirt or sweat shirt because its usually chilly in the morning but its its warmer at night   umhum   but in the winter you have to bundle up because it gets really cold its a lot different because i im from Dallas   oh are you   yeah i think its a lot colder than it does in Dallas thats for sure with all the snow and everything     that was my next question is to how you where you used to live and how you dressed in comparison to where you were before   yeah because i because i am from Dallas and i live in Richardson so   uhhuh   i mean it gets cold there but its not cold like it gets here and i think here it gets cold and it gets windy you have a you know wind chill at twenty miles an hour and it gets like bitter cold   umhum   and you have to walk across campus and stuff so you really wear a lot of clothes i mean everybody has on like gloves and scarves and ear muffs and everything   are you into hats   uhhuh yeah   do you wear hats and for dress up too or just in winter   um hum i have like one and i wear it when i dress up but otherwise i dont have that many though i dont think about it im not real good at picking out clothes like if someone were to buy me an outfit and put out with it i would wear it all the time but as far as me picking out clothes myself oh its not very good   umhum   hum in your new uh career after college you going to need clothes a lot   yeah i probably will go to graduate school because i want to be a marriage counselor   uhhuh   but ill still need nice clothes you know whatever i do if i do that or if i go into business then ill still need dress clothes like nice dresses and nice suits and stuff like that   umhum   thats what i plan on waning wearing to work when i go to work to the   do you like clothes for uh different seasons or do you like just to wear the basically the same type of thing and just add or take away from it   um
