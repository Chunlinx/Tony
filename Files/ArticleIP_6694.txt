                                 Why Buy Bose            Youve seen the ads TheBose Wave Radio is no ordinary radio Its a sonic marvel a genuinebreakthrough Such a little thingbarely the size of a shoe boxyet it putsout the full rich sound of a primary music system It costs startlingly high for a clock radio but not unreasonable if the claims are notoverstated            Are theclaims overstated Come on How could they not be            Not that the Bose is bad In fact it may be thesecondbest tabletop radio out there But just this month what may be the besttabletop radio hit the market Its the Cambridge SoundWorks Model  and at its very nearly everything the Bose Wave claims to beat a little overhalf the price The Cambridge delivers a smoother more coherent morerhythmic more dynamic more tonally true picture of the music            For example on a VladimirHorowitz piano solo the keys sounded clangy a bit metallic on the Bose theywere warmer but no less hammered on the Cambridge When the quartet Anonymous sang a medieval chant I wasnt sure on the Bose if there were four singerswere there three fivethere was no doubt at all on the Cambridge When theHeath Brothers played a hardbop jazz tune the hihat cymbal sounded smearedon the Bose I couldnt hear the accent on the beat On the Cambridge I gotthe percussive thwack as well as the shimmering whoosh all around it Andthough the Bose hit the low octaves of the acoustic bass the Cambridge caughtthe fingerpluckings of the bass strings            Thedifferences werent night and day But they were of the sort that over timemake you feel at ease or slightly tenseand which in a moment of leisuremake you want to stop and really listen or move on to something else            After a while I hooked up each unit to acompact disc player Both radios sport input jacks in the back for plugging ina CD player computer tape deck television or VCR I used not some humdrumportable but the DiscoveryPentagon CD a topoftheline machine thatretails for  And I pulled out two of my most sonically demandingdiscsHenryk Goreckis Third Symphony  by the London SymphonyOrchestra on Nonesuch and Kendra Shanks Afterglow  achanteuseplusjazztrio session on Mapleshade            Thosefamiliar with the Gorecki know that on some fullsize if not very goodstereo systems the first minute or sobass violins growling quietlycomesoff as a vague rumble its melody barely audible Both the Bose and theCambridge navigate this passage clearly However the Cambridge gets more ofthe bowing on the basses more of their rhythmic inflections When a secondlouder bass line starts in about a minute into the piece the Bose cracks upfor a second The Cambridge doesnt exactly keep everything straight teenyspeakers and teenier amplifiers can do only so much but it keeps goingitdoesnt lose the thread            On the Shank disc when she modulates her voice accentinga certain word or dipping another to a whisper the Bose makes it sound as ifthe engineer is sharply turning up or down the volume The Cambridge gets thesubtleties right            How dothese radios eke such relatively big sounds out of such small boxes The Boseisnt exactly a technical breakthrough but it is clever In the back of thespeakers is a  foot tube that has been folded into a thin tight maze to fitinside the radio box The frequency of a sound wave is defined by its lengthThe longer the wave the deeper the bass Such a long tube gives sound waveslots of room to enlarge Each speaker is also powered by an amplifier equippedwith circuits that boost the bass as you turn up the volume However once thespeakers get to the middle and upper octaves their limitations become moreapparent hence the steely pianos smeared cymbals ungainly dynamics and therest            The Cambridge SoundWorks  half an inchtaller but otherwise the same size as the Bose takes a different approach Itsbass comes from a   inch woofer cone which takes up twothirds of theradios internal space and is powered by its own amplifier The two smallermain speakers each of which has its own amp are freed up to focus theirenergies on the less burdensome middle and treble octaves The  also has aseparate volume knob for the woofer so you can adjust the bass level whichwould otherwise depend greatly on room placement            The  isdesigned by Henry Kloss a hifi legend who made his mark with the KLHspeakers of the s and the Advents of the s by figuring out how tomanipulate electronics so that a speaker sounds smooth from octave to octaveHe applied  years of experience with this art to the rather skimpy componentsof the Model  which explains how he gets such a smooth coherent sound fromnot only a small box but also a cheap one            Bose is the property of Amar Bose a man long regarded ashifis most brilliant marketer but whose products tend to be built around atechnical fad His Bose  loudspeakers the companys premium line for years have nine speaker cones positioned all over the cabinet so that thesound bounces around your room just like in a concert hall One problemamong many is that most peoples living rooms arent Carnegie Hall as aresult the music just sounds muddy His methods also encourage high pricesThe s cost  a pair some companies make  speakers that soundbetter because nine cones cost more than two or three the Wave radio costs because that  foot tube was a bear to design The Wave is one of Bosesbetter devices But he stretched too far in his price tag and his claims andnow Kloss Cambridge has delivered his comeuppance            Both radios are sold throughmailorder the Bose from  BOSE the Cambridge SoundWorks from FORHIFI
