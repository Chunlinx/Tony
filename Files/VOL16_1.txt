                              Word Law            I saw an ad once in the back of a magazine promisingthat if I sent in some money I could have a starin the firmament named after me  For the same lowprice I would receive a certificate and a photograph ofthe galaxy where my star was located  I might even beable to see that star if I possessed suitable magnifyingequipment  I was not tempted by the offer but it didoccur to me that while I would not like to have a staras a wordsmith I might like to own my own word            Is it possible to own your very own word  TheEnglish language may belong to all of us but some ofits words are the property of individuals or in mostcases of lexical ownership of corporations  I am referringto the registered trademarks and service marksprotected under federal law from the infringement ofunscrupulous competitors  Now I am a language professionalnot a manufacturer or a lawyer so if youwant competent advice in the latter areas you shouldsupplement the summary of the complex trademarkpicture that follows            The law of trademarks which fills more than twovolumes of the Annotated US Code in the local lawlibrarythe source of the following informationgivesus some guidance as to what words canand cannot be staked out as private property and whatthat notion of privacy really means when it comes tothe use of language            For one thing you cannot simply coin a word andlay claim to it  You must also sell the goods named byyour trademark or perform services named by yourservice mark  In law a trademark is a name logotypedesign or any combination thereof adopted and usedby a manufacturer to identify its goods and distinguishthem from articles sold by others  A service mark identifiesyou as a provider of specific services rather thanof vendable articles  For example Kodak is a trademarkFotomat  a service mark  Your trademark orservice mark may be registered but you may haverights to the mark even if you have not registered itThe symbol you choose for your mark may be pictorialas the bearded representation of the Smith Brothersof coughdrop fame who as some would have itare named respectively Trade and Mark  But a trademarkmay also be a word or a group of words            Sounds simple really  You come up with a nononsenseproduct designed to remove widgets patent itand market it under the straightforward name WidgetTerminator  Maybe the Widget Terminator does its jobwell finds a niche in the market and over the yearseven makes a little money for you  Only now yourbrotherinlaw decides he is going to get into the actand beat your price  Of course he calls his knockoff theWidgetBuster a much snappier moniker and he packagesthe product behind a picture of a widget inside abarred red circle  Since his product works differentlyfrom yours you cannot get him for violating patentlaw so you haul him into court and sue the pants offhim for infringing on the implied trademark you haveestablished with your Widget Terminator            Keeping it all in the family you get your cousinBenny fresh out of law school and eager for work toargue that the public has come to love and trust theWidget Terminator and that people will be confusedand deceived by the similarity of the name of the rivalWidgetBuster  As a result of this confusion of productsyour reputation will be damaged and your sales hurtYou ask that the WidgetBuster be withdrawn from themarket and that your brotherinlaw pay you trebledamages and that he pay your cousin Benny as well            Do you think you will win  That depends on howwell Benny did in his Intellectual Property Lawcourse  The law recognizes two basic kinds of trademarkthough it allows for a measure of degree in theirdefinition a strong trademark is one used only in afictitious or fanciful manner while a weak trademarkis a meaningful word in common usage thatdoubles as a suggestive or descriptive trademark  Weaktrademarks are more difficult to establish and theyare entitled to narrower protection than strong onesYour brotherinlaws counsel will argue that you mayhave an invention but its name is not a trademarkbecause a trademark cannot be an ordinary word particularlya descriptive one if that word is used in itsordinary sense  Both widget and terminator are commonEnglish wordsa widget is a gadget or gizmoin case you did not knowand they literally describethe function of the product which is to remove peskywidgets so you cannot claim them as your own orprevent others from using them            Of course if you have ever talked to a lawyer youknow that things are never what they appear when itcomes to the law  There have been trademarks thatwere fairly literal for example CocaCola   CocaCola which is a trademark of long standing originallycontained both cocaine and an extract from thecola nut  The cocaine went out when it was declared acontrolled substance early in this century  Interestinglythe makers of Coke which is also a registered markonce sought to prohibit the marketing of somethingcalled TacolaCola  as well as any other drink with theword cola in its name  But the courts ruled that becausecola was a common word describing what was inthe beverage any soda containing cola derivativescould be called a cola   Cokes trademark was upheldagainst CheroCola ClioCola Coca and Cola  andElCola  ruled to be noninfringing were Koke DopeCherryCola RoxaCola  and DixieCola   As for othersodas Moxie won its case against Noxie  but PepsiColalost against Pep  as did SevenUp against Cheer Up             On the other hand if the name of your product isa common word which is applied in an arbitrary orfanciful sense you should be able to claim it as atrademark  The courts have ruled that Cyclone  whennaming a fence and Innocent  as a brand of haircoloring suggesting as the ruling noted the veryantithesis of innocence are legitimate trademarksbut while Yellow Pages was found to be a trademarkalthough it is clearly descriptive raisin bran andspearmint were not granted exclusive status            Manufacturers are fond of deforming the spellingof an ordinary word to make it distinctive for exampleNU for new KWIK for quick  or Bonz for bones unfortunatelythis last a dog food lacking the socalledsilent e is frequently mispronounced  But a clever orphonetic spelling of a common descriptive word doesnot entitle you to own it as a trademark  Rather acommon word can become a trademark only if it acquiresa secondary meaning if in other words it isused so long and so exclusively by one producer that ithas come to signal to the general public that the productin question is made by that producer and thatproducer alone  The courts have insisted repeatedlythat to be a trademark a word or symbol must call upnot the product or service but its source the produceror provider            If your brotherinlaw can afford to wait timemay be on his side in the battle against widgets  If youstop selling a product for two or more years you maylose the right to its trademark  The courts frown onmanufacturers who pretend to sell a few samples of aproduct each year just to hold on to the name forfuture use  But you may be able to withhold the productfrom the market while you experiment with waysto improve it and you can change the product significantlyand still retain possession of its name as themakers of Tabasco did when they altered the formulaof their hot sauce but successfully defended their rightto exclusive use of the trademark            Under the former trademark law shredded wheatwas considered a generic term and hence not registrableBut because the process for making it was patentedno other company could produce it hence thepatent holder had exclusive rights to the name of aunique product  When the patent expired new manufacturerssimply used shredded wheat as a descriptiveterm  And although dictionary maker Noah Websterwas instrumental in passing our first federal copyrightlaws to protect an authors intellectual property thename Webster ceased to function as an exclusive trademarkwhen the original Websters copyright ran outAs early as  G  C Merriam of SpringfieldMassachusetts who claimed to be the literal publishingdescendants of Noah Websters lexicographicalprojects attempted to restrain the sale of other dictionarieswith Webster in the title  In a series of decisions Merriamv Ogilvie  F  Merriam VSaalfield  F   F the US CircuitCourt of Appeals ruled partly for Merriam partly forthe competition Merriam lost its right to the exclusiveuse of the name Webster  but since that company hadbecome known to the public as the publisher of NoahWebsters dictionaries wouldbe Websters were orderedto disclaim on their title pages any connectionwith the original word book  In the early s WorldPublishing Company producer of Websters NewWorld dictionaries obtained a ruling to quash the disclaimerrequirement  In a more recent action initiatedby Merriam in  the Court of Appeals againaffirmed the right of other publishers to use Webster indictionary titles and enjoined the defendants fromusing any variation or combination of the wordsworldfamous authentic original genuine  or renownedto suggest a connection between their productand the MerriamWebster line of dictionaries Merriamv Webster Dictionary Co   F d   It is clearthat for many Websters has become a generic wordDespite the fact that this synonymy is one that thecourts have repeatedly upheld no dictionary is willingto define Websters simply as dictionary            Normally a title cannot function as a trademarkwhich is why different books can have the same titleas long as their contents are different and there is nointent to deceive the public  Two manufacturers maybe allowed access to the same trademark if their productsare so different that their markets will not overlapand if there is no indication that the public will beconfused by the names  Thus CondNast the publishersof the magazine Vogue  which is a trademark wereunsuccessful in a suit to force the owners of the VogueSchool of Fashion Modeling to change its name  AndVERBATIM the language quarterly registered as atrademark in  failed in its suit against the manufacturerof Verbatim floppy disks introduced in though the Verbatim disk company agreed never toproduce anything but blank recording media whileVERBATIM is enjoined only from producing blank mediaThe owners of the popular  movie titleGhostbusters have extended the range of their trademarkwith a television show toys and other licensedproducts bearing its name and distinctive logo andVERBATIM the language quarterly is free to do likewise            Ironically success can sometimes weaken yourright to a trademark particularly if your productname has become a generic term  Cellophane failed toprotect itself in an infringement suit when the defenseattorney asked the Cellophane representative for thegeneric name of the product  Unable to come up witha synonym for cellophane the manufacturer lost itstrademark  Celluloid remained a trademark muchlonger though it too has now become a generic term                           Thermos and Zipper were both originally trademarksBut both products became so popular thattheir names began to function as generics in the publicmind and because of that the courts have ruled thatother companies could use these words uncapitalizedso long as they did not attempt to confuse or deceivethe public  However a design or distinctive style oftypography can be a trademark and the distinctivemanner of printing Thermos as a symbol remainsprotected            Federal law regulates only in the broadest sensewhat words can or cannot serve as trademarks  Priordecisions have little value in trademark claims andeach case must be argued on its own merits  As aresult trademark rulings may seem idiosyncratic orcontradictory  The law clearly specifies though that atrademark cannot be immoral deceptive scandalousor disparaging  Glass Wax  a glass cleaner which containsno wax successfully defended its trademarkagainst a charge that the name was deceptive but inthe early s the courts refused to recognize Madonnaas a trademark for wine because it was ruledscandalous  The soft drink Old Monk  which was notperceived to threaten public morality was permittedTastes change of course in wines as well as scandalsand though Old Monk is gone from the shelves todayscourts seem not to be offended by the brand of wineknown as Blue Nun             Foreign words can serve as trademarks in theUnited States but their legal status is determined thesame way as that of English words  Thus Selchow Righter makers of the game Parcheesi  could not prohibitother manufacturers from selling games undersuch names as Pachisi Parchisi  or Parchesi  variantspellings of the common Hindi word for the old Indianpastime  Similarly Duncan was unable to retain exclusiverights to the name yoyo because the toy is calledthat in the Philippines where it originated and becauseit has no synonyms  On the other hand bothScrabble and Monopoly are trademarks for games  Despitethe fact that both are ordinary English wordsthey meet the secondary meaning test being easilyrecognized as exclusive product names although thecourt also upheld the trademark rights of a gamecalled AntiMonopoly over the objection of Monopolyowner Parker Brothers  That decision remainsconfused            A trademark can be longer than a word or even apair of words  You can lay claim to an entire slogan ifit has become widely enough identified with yourproduct but the courts do not let you monopolize thelanguage  They will limit your power to control sentencessimilar to yours just as they stymied AnheuserBuschthe owners of the slogan Where theres lifetheres Bud who failed in their attempt to prevent useof all slogans beginning Where theres life includingas far as I know the ageold proverb Wheretheres life theres hope            At any rate it seems that where theres a trademarktheres hope for a lawsuit  The Xerox Corporationrecognizing the potential danger of success hasin the past gone out of its way to protect its right to thewords it owns  Though I have found no reference toany trademark suits brought by Xerox against othermanufacturers the company has tried to regulate theuse of its trademark in ordinary English  For examplesome years ago the xerography pioneer took out halfpageads in the New York Times to remind us thatXerox is a trademark to be used only as a proper nounas in Xerox machine  or a proper adjective as in Xeroxcopy   In either case warned the ad we must capitalizeXerox   Despite such entreaties the word xerox seemsto have become generic if not according to the courtsthen at least according to current American usagewhere it occurs freely as noun adjective and evenverb with or without capitalization  Xerox persistsbecause unregulated use by others may cause a trademarkto be deemed abandoned            Many publishers either fearing litigation or simplybecause they are sensitive to questions of ownershipof the printed word prefer to take a cautions approachto trademarks capitalizing words like Xerox Coke and Formica in print though at least one major dictionaryrecognizes the uncapitalized form of xerox and allows it to function as a verb  But no contemporarylexicon either desksized or unabridged recordsfor Websters the commonlyfound meaning an Englishdictionary even one not actually attributable tothe lexicographer Noah Webster            But back to the hypothetical case of Widget RemoverMfg Co of North America v WidgetBusterSA   While you may not be able to restrain yourbrotherinlaws trade you can hope that his marketshare will become so large as to draw the attention ofthe owners of the Ghostbusters trademark and thattheir battery of highpriced studio lawyers might beable to get the injunction that your cousin could not            Clearly owning a trademark can be worth somuch that a manufacturer will object willynilly toany and every use of it by another  In one case thecourt told a manufacturer that there can be no monopolyon love  No one may preempt the field withrespect to marks having love as a portion thereof andthus exclude all others from the use of any mark composedin part of such word  But owning a word can dolittle for a writer like me except perhaps in the egodepartment since according to the law a word can bea trademark only if such status does not deprive othersof their right to the normal use of the English languageSo if you were planning to give someone a wordfor his birthday think again  Words that do not fitcannot be returned  And owning a word is not likeowning a ball even if the game is not going the wayyou planned you cannot just pick up your word andgo home                              The family said they would try to bury him againtomorrow  Dan Rather CBS Evening News

        Senator Warren Rudman July              The Irancontra hearings drenched us in a stunningarray of colorful words  For several weeksan august group of intelligent men and women met inthe Senate Caucus Room on the third floor of the CapitolsOffice Building  During those several weeks ofearly summer the world could listen to articulatespeakers of English who have the ability to manipulateour minds and twist our emotions with wordimagesThrough the clever and sometimes masterful use oflanguage the same activity or event was made tosound logical or patriotic or it could appear to besordid and bordering on treason  For example considerthis clever exchange between Senate committeecounsel Arthur Liman and Lieutenant Colonel NorthLiman And you therefore were told to get rid ofthe memoranda that reflected thatNorth I was told to clean up the files                        One statement suggests concealing or hiding somethingthe other implies good sound bookkeeping runninga tidy ship  The participants wanted to convey thenotion that they were not concerned with languageRather they were only concerned with getting at thefacts  They wished to bring the message of what actuallyhappened and show a concerned world that truthand justice would triumph  Still for this to happen allparticipants recognized that language was importantto ensure that the public would understand acts andevents as the speakers wished them to be understood            During the hearings we watched unfold before usa variety of words and phrases to indicate the conceptof not telling the truth  Seldom did anyone admit tolying but statements were often couched in terms colorfullyindicating that the speaker had abandoned verityFor example John Nields Jr the House committeesmajority counsel asked Are you sayingthat he told you to write down a different version ofthe facts  And moments later he continued Are yousaying that you decided it was appropriate to put out afalse version of the facts  In Lieutenant ColonelNorths response he used the words a version of thechronology that was inaccurate   Later Nields used thephrase the chronology with the false version in it   Hethen followed with a question staying with thisstronger phrase false version   Norths response containedthe clause this version of the document waswrong intentionally misleading   Earlier he had usedthis version was incorrect   Once Nields had used falseversion  he stayed with that for a while  Then he usedfalse story   This word story presents interesting possibilitiesUsed in a straight forward positive sentence itcarries a favorable connotation We want to get outthe whole story or Col North will tell his story tothe committee  But used with words with unfavorableconnotations it assumes a pernicious meaning ofmakebelieve for example Is that still his story  orWhat is his story now            Other euphemisms for lying that were used includedexcessive statements outright misrepresentationdissembled prudent to change those chronologies and radically different from the facts   Theconcept of plausible deniability is a variation on thetheme of avoiding the recognition or the admission oflying  Implicit in the term is the idea that one haschosen to do something that one may want to denylater  One must then consider if such a denial is reasonablethat is believable  If one denies something isit possible that the denial that is the lie could beexposed  It might be possible to establish an equationto determine the Plausible Deniability Factor PDF ofany statement  Psychologists and social scientists coulddo a lot with that            The deleteriously loaded term elaborate schemepopped into the hearings with Representative JackBrooks words this elaborate scheme was tocarry out these activities  In American Englishscheme strongly implies craftiness secret intentwhile not as strong as plot  it certainly lacks the neutralqualities of plan and conveys a meaning far beyondits dictionary definition            Near the close of the session Wednesday July ththere arose a clever word game after Mr Nields characterizedsome of Col Norths responses as severalspeeches   Mr Brendan Sullivan Jr Col Norths counselobjected to the term declaring it to be pejorativeChairman Senator Daniel Inouye said somepeople consider lengthy statements to be speeches  MrNields replied Im perfectly happy to use the expressionlengthy statements  And Mr Sullivan cameback with How about using lengthy answerSpeeches in this context carries with it too much of theidea of pontificating which Mr Sullivan did not wantWhile statement is better answer gives the mental pictureof completion  Someone who knows can give ananswer we are left with a positive image  Responsewould have been a good neutral word but neither sidewas thinking neturality that late in the afternoon            Another classic example of a loaded word jumpedup several days later when Mr Liman asked a questionthat began And after you became involved linkedwith This word linked is a sneaky little devilWhile it means simply to couple or connect the connotationis always negative  No one is linked to theAmerican Red Cross or the Humane Society but peoplemay be linked to the Communist Party or the MafiaWhen we hear that someone is linked to an organizationor cause of which we have never heard we feelominously that this must be bad            Early in the proceedings we saw a catandmousegame develop over what to call money that is excessover expenses in a business transaction  Mr Nieldsasked what did the President know about thediversion of the proceeds of the Iranian arms sale tothe Contras  North responded I never personallydiscussed the use of the residuals or profits from thesale  This was one of the few times Col Northused profit  choosing to stay with the more charmingresiduals  as used here meaning remainder            When Mr Nields used diversion again Col Northresponded with Well you insist on referring to it asdiversion my use of Websterleads me to believethat those were residuals and not divertedtheonly thing we did was divert money outand put itto better use  Nields countered with Im notasking about words now Colonel  Im asking youwhether you didnt continue to send memoranda seekingapproval of diversions or residuals whatever theword  While Nields seemed uninterested inwords he nevertheless stayed with diversionthroughout the questioning and North continued withresiduals  Divert means to change from one course oruse to another or to turn aside  In some contexts theword can connote secrecy and deception a diversiontactic  for example  Used in another context it is perfectlyharmless waters of a river for instance may bediverted to prevent flooding            The words profit and proceeds are almost equal inmeaning  When Nields used proceeds  he was passingup a chance to irritate or challenge North for theconnotations are completely different  It is much betterto refer to the proceeds of a raffle rather than theprofits  Profit is deeply rooted in the world of businessand too often associated with moneygrubbing andgreed  Later Representative Jenkins referred to aprofitmaking business  which sounds harsher than ifhe had chosen to say profitmaking enterprise   Butproceedproducing enterprise would have soundedeven more innocuous  Shortly after this North usedthe terms revenue producers and deserving of fair justreasonable compensation   These phrases are two moresynonyms for profit that alter our perception a little            As with the myriad words surrounding profit there was a plethora of words surrounding the BolandAmendment  Col North used the phrases complyingwith those Boland Proscriptions the constraints andproscriptions of Boland  and working around theproblem that Boland would have created   Mr Limanresponded to this last phrase with Well anotherword for working around for people who have hadsome Latin is circumvent  Circumvent does meanto work around and implies ingenuity and strategyCircumvent is much more precise than the term workaround and suggests a planned detour to avoid thelaw  Norths statement that he sought a means of complyingwithBoland and his work around remarkmean essentially the same but complying soundsmuch nicer conveying the idea of adhering to regulationsOn the other hand circumvent suggests avoidingwhat is mandatory and at the same time returns amore formal legalistic atmosphere to the questioning            Two terms that surfaced during Mr Limans questioningwere fall guy and scapegoat  both terms introducedby him and not Col North  Websters NinthCollegiate Dictionary tells us that a fall guy is onewho is easily duped  A second definition reveals it tobe synonymous with scapegoat   But fall guy is a lessformal term and suggests ignorance  Many of us recallthe old gangster movies of Humphrey Bogart andJames Cagney  Either Bogart or Cagney must havesaid You aint gonna pin this rap on me  I aint nofall guy  Scapegoat  on the other hand means onewho bears the blame for others it is a political wordthat carries with it a certain nobility and martyrdomthat fall guy doesnt imply            The rich and rewarding and often necessarysport of quibbling over words arose early in the questioningwhen Col  North responding to a questionfrom Mr Nields replied the word investigationwasnt used Mr Meese had been asked to doa factfinding inquiry  Later during the attorneygenerals appearance before the committee those twowords came up often  Those who tended to be favorableto the colonel used inquiry while those distrustfulof him were inclined to use investigation   Meese contendedthat his actions took just a few days and investigationimplies a thoroughness that is missing in inquiryWhile some were prone to use the phraseextensive or complete investigation  others used briefor informal inquiry             Somewhere sometime speakers of English mustbestow upon Representative Brooks a special commendationfor his creation of a description of a plannedgovernment agency that would be a more or less offtheshelfindependent standalone selfsupportingoperation for covert operations  He used a noun twoprepositional phrases and a string of adjectives thatwould make anyone proud            So the hearings have come and gone but therepercussions will remain for some time  Our judgmentsmay hinge on a wellturned phrase a beautifullynuanced sentence a wordimage that flashesacross our gray matter reminding us of childhood  Aposition that seemed logical a while ago now becomesirrational  A strong conviction is suddenly an indefensiblebelief  Some of us will hold to an idea or conceptregardless of the evidence others will change positionsStill others will simply marvel at the use of languageand wonder just where our analytical side endsand our emotional side begins  We may never know forsure if our conclusions are based on cold hard logic orpure sentiment                              Does Accent Matter            This interesting readable book is probably themost sensible work on the pronunciation of Englishever published  Professor Honey an English linguistnow on assignment in Bophuthatswana one of the lesseasily pronounceable places in the world writes in astraightforward simple casual friendly style totallydevoid of the offputting symbols and technical jargonthat usually mark writing on pronunciation  That isnot to say that the books theme is casual for Honeycomes to grips with social aspects of language that areseldom treated even in a clinical manner by linguistsA notable exception in the United States is WilliamLabov but despite his open readable style Labovswork is known mainly to academics because it appearsin scholarly journals and in books distributed largely tothe academic market  For all that Does Accent Matter is not a whit less scholarly and Faber must becongratulated for perceiving it as a work that deservesa wider readership  The biggest concessions to makethe presentation more palatable for the general readeris the elimination of footnote references within thetext even superior numbers do not appear in the textand those who demand footnotes must refer to a briefAppendix where they are arranged chapter by chapterwith clear page references  As one who understandsthe importance of footnotes but loathes thembecause of their continual unsightly interruption ofnormal reading I applaud this treatment they arethere if you want them but they do not intrude  Theindex is quite thin on the ground after reading such abook one naturally puts it aside till it is wanted forreference to certain points and the paucity of the indexwill make the location of information something ofa chore at a later date  I have always felt that everybook on language should include either in its index orin a separate listing all of the words and word elementsdiscussed in the text for they often provide thepoint of reference for a researcher            Honey explains the distinction between dialiectand accent If a regional speaker also uses the grammer vocabularlyand idiom that are distinctive of his regionthen we say he is speaking dialect  But if he uses thegrammer vocabularly and idiom of the standardEnglish found in newspapers books magazines andnews bulletins then all we notice about his speech ishis accentand possibly his intonation                        Most of this book is understandably concerned withaccent in the United Kingdom though other varietiesof English are discussed  To better understand attitudestoward the English spoken in the UK one mustbe familiar with the term Received PronunciationRP which the author describes asThe accent most obviously associated with the standardEnglish dialect RP echoes the ratheroldfashioned sense of received as meaning generallyaccepted as in the terms received opinion andreceived wisdom especially by those who arequalified to know                        Among speakers of English worldwide either as a nativeor an acquired language RP is the most highlyregarded accentindeed some might well regard RPas standing for Revealed Pronunciationso it behoovesone to pay attention to Professor Honeys commentsabout it favorable and adverse  The chaptertitles give a good indication of the subject mattercoveredONE  What is an

politicsEIGHT  Changing patternsNINE  Accents and the future                        In the course of his treatment of these topics theauthor provides a wealth of information that answersnumerous questions and confronts many of the prejudicesthat many people have about languageIncreasing literacy and pressures towards correctnessled in England to spellingpronunciationswhich caused speakers to restore a whole range ofsounds which earlier generations had dropped likethe l in fault vault and soldier the second w inawkward and the sole w in Edward the t at theend of pageant respect and strict and the d inthe middle of the word London and at the end ofhusband  Over the same period speakers of thestandard English accent learned to drop the final dwhich for centuries had been attached when ordinaryfolk talked of a scholard and his gownd                        We all know about language prejudice but it is nonethelessinteresting to read thatan RP accent was one of the foremost criteriafor being an officer in the First World War  In Birminghamin  it was possible to buy a manualdesigned to enable local speakers to correct theiraccents since as its author claimed to no one isthe absence of local dialect more important than tothe young officer in the army  Carnage at thefront forced that specification to be relaxed inmany cases and men had to be commissionedwhose voices betrayed their promotion from theranks  When one such officer inspected the cadetsat a public school Lancing in  the sixteenyearoldEvelyn Waugh helped to organize thedropping of rifles as a demonstration against themans accentIn the Second World War the publicschooleducatedactor Dirk Bogarde born in  claimsthat in that war the sole reason for his promotionfrom the ranks to officer status was his accent                        And we know that Professor Honey has it right whenhe writes aboutthe tendency which now pervades the wholeof our society for us to attach to particular accentscertain generalized assumptions about the valuesand attributes considered typical of certain socialgroups  In other words we judge accents bystereotypes which we already have about theirspeakers  One US observer has claimed thatnonstandard features grammer and vocabulary aswell as accent have the power to close off a conversationamong strangers bring job interviews to anabrupt end and when used on the telephone torender a flat advertised as vacant that morning suddenlyto be declared already let                        A curious aspect of RP was or is its continualshifting as soon as some of its characteristics areadopted by speakers of a different social or educationalclass RP speakers by consent that couldscarcely be tacit change the rules of the game comingup with shootin and huntin  For example Americanreaders of SS Van Dines detective novels of thes might have been mystified by the insertion intothe dialogue of its lordly hero expressions likedontcher know and the anathematized aint             Americans may be pleased or relieved to learnthatThe American accentany American accentcanexpect a favourable reception in Britain for threereasons  First its speaker is perceived as standingoutside the socialclass hierarchy which partly explainsthe scale of evaluation of our own British accentsSecondly we are not able to judge on accentalone the features of educatedness which mightbe apparent to native American listeners so wegive the speaker the benefit of the doubt  Thirdlythe American accent is to some extent glamorizedby the film industry and by the number of Americanprogrammes shown on British television  CanadianEnglish accents which in Britain cannot normallybe distinguished from American share thesame generally favourable evaluation  If thegreatest single influence on the current evolution ofEnglish RP and of many nonstandard accents inBritain today is the popular London accent it isalso true that the greatest single influence on thegrammar vocabulary and idiom of English as spokenand written in Britain is American English                        Those who are not intimately familiar from listeningto them on radio and television with how specificBritish politicians and entertainers of the decadessince WWII sound may find themselves at sea in therather detailed descriptions chapters six and seven oftheir pronunciations and their effects good and badon the British public  Despite that Honeys treatmentis virtually selfexplanatory and anyone contemplatinga work on American accents would do well to beguided by the principles he has established            Inevitably there are some slips regarding Americanpronunciation and accent most if not all of whichcan be charged to the failure to identify specific dialectsor the absence of a restrictive modifier like mostor many to precede American speakers   For exampleAmerican English removes the y from the yusound when it turns new and duke into noo anddook                        That is a pattern characteristic of only certainAmerican dialects as a check in any good moderndictionary would reveal  The same is true for Honeysassumptions about Buddha  which he implies is universallypronounced in AE with the vowel of boot about Moscow  the second syllable of which is notalways rhymed in AE with cow  about Nepal  which ispronounced identically to the British RP way bymany AE speakers and about Vietnam  the nam ofwhich contrary to the authors information is pronouncedby many AE speakers to rhyme with dam  notpalm   As for Pakistan  Americans tend to give both asounds the same quality whether they rhyme themwith that in father or in man   On the other hand thepronunciation of Afghanistan in Britain follows eitherthe pattern of Pakistan  which has the a of man in thefirst syllable and that of father in the last or as inAmerica is heard with the a of man in both positions            AgainAmericans pronounce a strong r in card port andsimilar contexts                        an observation that does not apply to New Yorkers orNew Englanders  And the author has been misled toinfer that all Americans say deTAIL baTON INquiryadverTISEment haRASS and REsearch both occurI for one say deTAIL baTON inQUIry or INquirydepending on the day adVERtisement HARass andreSEARCH which leads me to think that these stresspatterns are not necessarily distributed along dialectallinesBritons get the impression that large numbersof Americans go through their whole lives unableto make confident distinction between a positiveand a negative statement of possibility between Ican do it and I cant do it                        It may not come as much of a revelation to ProfessorHoney to learn that even I a native speaker of AEoften have to ask whether an American speaker meantto say can or cant when the word receives any emphasisbut in normal unstressed speech the former isusually reduced to kn while the

Tell            Settlement was much more rapid in the UnitedStates than it had been in Europe and this hasaffected the placenaming patterns  In Europe peoplehad time to contemplate the area before settling on anappropriate name in the United States where settlementwas more rapid names often had to be chosenwithout delay  This haste has quickened the creativejuices and has sometimes resulted in innovative andintriguing place names  As George Stewart wroteIn a period of rapid expansion towns and countieswere being established every daythe demandfor names outran the supply and the result wasboth monotony and confusion                        The problem of having to create a large number ofplace names in a relatively short period is illustrated ina true story told by Mark WexlerA store owner in Missouri applied for a postallisting under the name Excelsior but was turneddown because the title was already claimed in MissouriIn response he wrote back saying that anyname would do as long as it was different and peculiarA few weeks later federal officials notifiedhim that he was the postmaster of Peculiar Missouri                        In the confusion of finding a name quickly practicalproblems sometimes emerged  Morrow  Kansaswas first named after a state senator but this namehad to be changed to Morrowville because of semanticconfusion when juxtaposed with a common prepositionThe railroad claimed that its ticket sellers werebecoming confused when passengers requested ticketsto Morrow            At the December  meeting of the AmericanNames Society in San Francisco Lewis McArthur reciteda poem about another Moro  in Sherman CountyOregon  The passenger agent for the Union PacificRailroad in that particular town was named Mr Bassingerand an often recited poem in the town wasOh  Mr BassingerI want to be a passengerI want to go to MoroAnd I want to go todayWell the train that goes to MoroIs now upon its wayAnd you cannot go to MoroAny more today                        Frank Remington indicates that on the officialform for post office name selection there is a blank forName of Town and the directions Please write inink  The residents of a particular town in Arkansastook this information literally as they were voting forthe town name and so many of them wrote in Inkthat Ink became the name of the town            Railroads preceded settlers into many parts of theUnited States and every few miles a siding had to bebuilt so that trains could pull off the track and wait forothers to pass  Each siding was given a name  FrancisStupey of Amarillo Texas a lifelong employee of theSanta Fe Railway has collected stories which he sharesin a slideshow about the railroad sidings  Names wereused because they were easier to remember than numbersFrequently a name was chosen on the basis of atopographical feature resulting in such names asBluffdale dale near a bluff Clifton town near acliff Shopton near a repair shop and Coalinga near acoal shed  Meridian was on the th meridian Justinwas just inside the county line and Haswel was at aplace in Colorado that had dry wells  Stupey pointsout that there were so many sidings needing namesthat the railroaders were forced to be creative  Spanishand Indian names were precedents to other nonEnglishsoundingnames  For example casual observersprobably think such words as Calgro Rioca  andMopeco are Spanish  Actually in an early example ofshrewd public relations the names were taken fromthe names of shippers  Naming a siding after a companyflattered the company and increased its loyalty tothe particular railroad  Calgro was named for CaliforniaGrowers Rioco for the Richfield Oil CompanyMopeco for the Mobile Petroleum CompanyHepoco for the Hercules Powder Company Stoil forStandard Oil Biola for the Bible Institute of LosAngeles and Calwa for the California Wine Association            Because Indians had lived in the areas first andgiven names to certain places that were fairly wellknown it is to be expected that some of their nameswould be used Cucamonga means many watersSupai blue water Navasota muddy water and Wichitamany lodges  A siding named OKeene began asthe Indian word Cheyenne but an Irishman workingfor the railroad decided to make it look Irish and so hechanged it and added an apostrophe            Twentyseven of the fifty states have names takenfrom the  different Indian languages that were spokenon this continent when the first European settlersarrived  Sometimes a place or state name was borroweddirectly as was Asingsing  which became SingSing  and Messatossec which became MassachusettsQuemessourit became Missouri Ookannasa ArkansasUneaukara Niagara Machihaganing Michigan  andPotawanmeac Potomac   English speakers changed thepronunciations because the sound patterns in the Indianlanguages were so different from those of Englishthat they could not hear much less imitate the exactwords the Indians were using            Some of the names have interesting stories behindthem  Kalamazoo  Michigan is supposed to have gotits name from the Potawatomi tribe in which Kekekalakalamazoomeans something like where the waterboils or steams in the pot  Supposedly a man bethis friends that he could run to the river and backbefore they could get a pot of water to boil  Ten Sleep Wyoming got its name because it was ten days travelby foot from Yellowstone  Chugwater  Wyoming is atthe bottom of a high bluff over which the Indianswould stampede buffalo to kill them  When the bodiesof the buffalo his into the stream they would make achuglike noise hence the name  Thunderbolt Georgia got its name hundreds of years ago when abolt of lightning hit near the village  When the peopleran to see what had happened they found a mineralspring  Believing that the lightning had created thespring they named the area after the miraculousevent                           American English  by Albert H Marckwardtcontains the information that Chicago comes from anAlgonquian word meaning garlic field  It is furtherpointed out that words coming from Indian languagesfrequently undergo semantic changeMackinaw the name of the island at the junctionof Lakes Huron and Michigan according to oneexplanation at least was a shortening of Michilimackinacmeaning great turtle  The reason forthis application is clear enough to anyone who hassuddenly come upon the pinewooded hills of theisland projecting from the water                        Mistranslations from the American Indian languageswere also common  In his Illustrated Dictionaryof Place Names United States and Canada  KelsieHarder points out that when the explorers asked theIndians what a place was called they respondedCanada  The Indians meant village but the whitestook it to mean the name of the area            Often a name which appears to be Indian is somethingvery different  According to George R Stewartin American Place Names Wewanta  West Virginia isderived from the persistent plea in English of Wewant a post office  Stewart also reports that Itasca Minnesota is a manufactured name Coined in by WT Boutwell and HR Schoolcraft who believedit to be the true source of the Mississippi  Boutwellrendered this in crude Latin as Veritas Caput  Schoolcraftjoined the tail of the first word with the head ofthe second            A different type of mistranslation can result in astrange kind of doublet  MahoningLicking came to uspartly as a transliteration and partly as a translationAccording to Jean L Mutter Arizona State UniversityTempeUpon learning that mahonmeant saltlick thename was partially translated into English as Lickingthe ing being added by phonetic transfer andprobably some morphological influence as well                        Sometimes the borrowing of Indian words wascomplicated by going through a middle language oftenFrench  For example the Sioux Indians theyspoke Omaha called a river in the central part of theUnited States Niboapka   Thomas Gasque editor ofNames points out that this word comes from ni waterand bthaska flat like a board spreading out  WhenFrench explorers came upon the name they knewenough Sioux to know the name meant board so theyused a translated version of the Indian name andcalled it la Rivire Platte   English speakers adoptedthe French name and talked about the Platte River They named one of the towns on its banks NorthPlatte   But when the state applied for admission to theUnion in  it was under the original Indian namewhich they spelled Nebraska             In addition to Indian sources United States placenames have come from fifty different languages but aswith the Indian names most of the pronunciationshave been anglicized and many of the words have beentranslated  The stress pattern of a placename expressioncan sometimes differentiate between two meaningsbut this clue can be lost if names alternate betweenlanguages  In a  article in Onoma  HenriDorion gives an example from French  The nameGrande Rivire de la Baleine became anglicized intoGreat Whale River  but this is ambiguous in Englishsince the Great can modify either Whale or River When it was translated back into French the wrongsense was used and it became Rivire de la GrandeBaleine rather than the original Grande Rivire de laBaleine             Another oftenmistaken etymology is the nameAjo in Arizona  This is thought by many people to bethe Spanish word for garlic but Jean Multer pointsout that an indigenous language has a similarsoundingword meaning paint and this might be the correctorigin of the towns nameThe first documented source of the name was almostcertainly not written Papago  Formerly moreimportance was placed on written sources than onthe oral ones  The surroundings supported bothderivations the ores from the mines supplied redpaint and a type of onion akin to garlic grewthere                        Multer adds that these conflicting bits of evidencemake the etymology of Ajo difficult to confirm            According to Stupey similar but less commercialnames include Chanesa named after the three childrenof a railroad man Charlie Nellie  and Sarah  andEdruvera  also named after three children EdwinRuth  and Vera   Three adult sisters Daisy Cora  andNora  were honored at Dacono  Anna S Wilson washonored at Anness and Ellen Woods at LenwoodGlendora and Evadale were named to honour earlyhusbandandwife settlers Glen and Dora and Evaand Dale             Sometimes names were reversed  Yewed is Dewey and Corum is Muroc backwards  Enon is none Saxetis Texas  and Reklaw is Walker  there was already asiding named Walker and so when the same name wasagain suggested the clerk in the office just reversed itThe main reason for the reversals was that they alloweda man to name a siding after himself withoutappearing to be egocentric  One man was too humbleto have a siding named after him  He was a popularrancher in California  When he declined the offer theworkers said he was mucho modesto and they decidedto honor him indirectly by naming the sidingModesto  now the name of a goodsized city                           Tenino was named for the number  butthere is disagreement on its significance  One story isthat locomotive Number  was wrecked nearbyAnother is that the elevation is  feet and stillanother is that  people lived there when the sidingwas built  There is an unconfirmed story that Laredo Texas was named for the sounds made by thechimes in the Catholic church la re  and do   Anotherfolk etymology has it that the Snake River was sonamed because it coiled back and forth so much  Thetruth is however that it was named after the SnakeIndians of that area and it is further true that theSnake Indians got their name from their habit of eatingsnakes that part of the United States was verypoor and snakes were often the only food availableSome names do not tell false stories they tell no storiesat all  Azusa for example is euphonious but it does notimmediately suggest its own history  In fact Azusa wasmade from the first and last letters of the alphabetfollowed by USA  Ding Dong was chosen as thewhimsical name for a siding in Bell County Texas            Wish fulfillment is seen in the midst of CaliforniasDeath Valley where sidings were given such coolsoundingnames as Klondike and Siberia   These exoticnames also provided opportunities for playful statementslike Were really sailing today  Weve comefrom Cuba to Alaska in fifteen minutes            The story is told that six railroad men met nearSan Bernardino California  The last item on theagenda was to find a name for a new siding  They hadeach been instructed to bring a suggestionperhaps aSpanishsounding name but one that was short andeasy to say  Each mans suggestion was rejected by theothers hence they were surprised when the supervisorended the meeting saying they had made a unanimousdecision  When questioned he replied Well you allsaid On no  so Ono is what well use            The most common way for settlers to honor theirnative lands and languages as they spread out over thecontinent was to bring old names from home to theirnew towns  Moscow  Idaho was called Paradise untilits Russian postmaster decided to change it  This isespecially interesting in view of recent placenamechanges in Russia whereby Tsaritsyn was changed toStalingrad  then again to Volgograd   Likewise StPetersburg became Petrograd and later Leningrad Even in America politics change and people go inand out of favor  In From Hero to Celebrity DanielBoorstin points out that soon after Charles Lindberghacquired a reputation as a proNazi and accepted adecoration from Hitler the Lindbergh Beacon atop aChicago skyscraper was renamed the Palmolive Beacon and high in the Colorado Rockies Lindbergh Peakwas given the more obscure name of Lone Eagle Peak             Many names were brought over from the OldWorld including Holland

in in which American and British representativestried unsuccessfully to negotiate a peaceful end to theAmerican Revolution            Picturesque images are often captured in namesas in Bridal Veil Falls in Utah or Teapot Dome inWyoming  In addition to these there is Shiprock  arock resembling a ship in New Mexico the FingerLakes in New York and the Sawtooth Mountain Rangein Idaho  The sawtooth metaphor occurs also inSpanish since Sierra Nevada in Spanish means SnowcoveredSaw  In Utah the Big Rock Candy Mountainlooks good enough to eat and the nearby LemonadeSprings makes a person thirsty  The Chocolate Mountainsof California are brown the Painted Desert inArizona and Flaming Gorge in Wyoming are multicolored            Some American cities are named after animalsThere is Wolf Lake and White Pigeon in MichiganDeer Isle in Maine Elk Run Heights in Iowa andDeerfield and Raven in Virginia  One city that had aunique animal name decided that the uniqueness wasnot worth the bother  The town was Ptarmigan Alaska named after a wild bird common to the areaHowever people had such a hard time rememberinghow to spell Ptarmigan that they just began calling thetown Chicken  Alaska            Many city names express hope as in New Hope and New Freedom  Pennsylvania New Era  Michiganand the dozens of cities named Paradise   Once in awhile however a place gets a dysphemistic namesuch as the Badlands in South Dakota or Great DismalSwamp  which is a squaremile section ofVirginia and North Carolina            It is just for amusement that the residents of AnnArbor Michigan write A instead of Ann Arbor intheir return addresses or people in New Hampshirejoke about the towns named Orange Lebanon  andLyme  or a motel owner in Comfort Texas whichhappens to be near two towns named Alice and Louise puts up a billboard saying Sleep here in Comfortbetween Alice and Louise            Arizonans are amused at how Showlow and Whywere named  Showlow started out as a cattle ranchand got its name

 When friends would arrive many ofthem would ask Why here  The residents decided totake the words right out of their friends mouths bynaming the town Why Arizona  Truth or Consequences New Mexico used to be named Hot Springs but in  the residents voted to change its namewhen the host of a popular radio show promised freepublicity to any town that would do such a thingSome names sound more appealing than they areLovers Retreat  Texas has a violent rather than a romantichistory  It is a rocky area where a ranchernamed Lover hid among the boulders from people intenton killing him            It is not always possible to document the namingof particular places  The town of Intercourse  Pennsylvaniagets so many questions about the origin of itsname that the city has printed a brochure offeringseveral explanations  The name has been traced backas far as  and one theory is that it was the localterm for a junction of two roads  Another theory isthat there used to be a race track in the area andIntercourse was the spot where the horses entered ontothe course  Calistoga  California is supposed to havebeen accidentally named when a real estate developerfrom Sarasota Florida rose before a crowd to give asales pitch for the new property he was promoting  Hewas nervous and instead of saying that it was going tobe the Sarasota of California  he said it was going to bethe Calistoga of Sarifornia   People were so amusedthat the name stuck  Eleva  Wisconsin is said to havebeen named by the whim of a snowstorm  It was in thefall and a sign painter was perched high on the side ofa newly completed grain elevator where he was topaint the name of the grain company  He started withthe word Elevator  but by the time he had finished thefirst five letters he was forced down by the snowstormWinter had come and it was nine months before theweather was good enough and the cement dry enoughto finish the painting  But by then the name was sofirmly established that the painter did not bother toclimb up and finish the job            Ironic names are often given in hopes of achievinga commercial advantage  This is easily demonstratedin the real estate business where developers work hardto create names that will sell their town  Someonedeveloping a town on what used to be a swamp mightput a word like Heights in the name to counteractnegative feelings or fears people might have aboutleaking basements  Someone cutting up a farm intosmall lots will try to communicate a feeling of spaciousnesswith such words as Ranch Estate Manor  orGarden   Sometimes the onomastic irony merely resultedin two viable perceptions of the same placeTalking about some original Indian naming patternsKelsie Harder said that At the Grassy Meadow mightbe one persons perception of a place while At theChiggerInfested Patch might be anothers            Some of the original place names were rathercrude and had to be changed to appeal to more genteeltastes but such amelioration was sporadic  WhorehouseMeadows  Oregon was changed to NaughtyGirls Meadows by the federal mapmakers and BullshitSprings  Oregon was changed to Bullshirt Springs   Interestinglythe local residents were very upset aboutthe first change but not about the second  Titus Canyonis also a concealed obscenity  The original namewas Tight Ass Canyon named because of the narrownessof the pass  Robert Rennick has noted thatmany local citizens were indignant that civilizationhad chosen to modify the name            Some names although they may be objectionableare not changed  Paul Eschholz Alfred

for purposesof promotion  An the other hand the people ofIceland gave their own island the unappealing name ofIceland in hopes of discouraging immigrants fromcoming to what is actually a relatively

been Ericthe Red who bestowed the verdant name Greenlandupon the usually snowandice covered country            This is a strange flipflop because in those daysjust as today more people were interested in attractingrather than repelling visitors and settlers  We see thisin the way that postmasters increased their fame bynaming post offices after their businesses  The firstUS mail service began in conjunction with stagecoachruns  The stops were at inns or country storesThe person who ran the business received a little extramoney to serve as postmaster and in this role coulddecide on the name of the post office  At first littleattention was paid to the post office name but as mailbecame increasingly important it was the post officename which often won out as the town name  This ishow towns got such names as Brown Store  VirginiaYellow House  Pennsylvania Big Cabin  OklahomaWilley House  New Hampshire and Macks Inn  IdahoMail for other communities was left at crossroads orwaterways

that appears only in combination with anothermorpheme such as the suffixes and prefixes of EnglishThe American propensity for lexical shanghaiing hasproduced a new type of morpheme the bound andgagged morpheme  It is a series of sounds impressedinto a kind of semantic slavery for urltil recently thecollocations could do no semantic work on their own intheir present form            Admittedly I have given in to temptation in coiningthe term bound and gagged morphemethetemptation of wit  Many of these new morphemeshave not been gagged at all since no part of themmeant anything in thefirst place  Still let the termstand  It describes in spirit at least how neomorphemeslike athon tigue burger ateriaalator ercizeicize ician aholic on capadecade alyzer gate heli docu have become affixes            The news and advertising media have introducedmost such morphemes into common usage a spinoff oftheir tiieless search for novel titillating ways to attractpublic attention  The pattern for coinage is simple anduniform  A familiar noun provides the model for variationusually because it contains a memorable endingEverything except this memorable portion of the wordis then dropped and a new morpheme is substitutedin an innovation once the innovation is generallyknown it suggests a pattern for further combinationswith the neomorpheme whose meaning generalizesupon the models salient contemporary import  Becausethe model behind the original innovation mustbe easily recognizable to provide material for a newmorpheme most models are either placenames orcommon words for locations and activities                           Athon is the classic example although not thefirst                Marathon provided the model after it was reintroducedinto English from Greek with the FirstOlympic Games at Athens in  according to theOED   The longdistance running event honored thewarrior who in  BC ran to Athens in order toannounce the Greek victory over the Persians on theplains of Marathon  The grueling twentysixmileOlympic run has become one of the games most popularevents emblematic of the endurance and strengthan Olympian must have            But marathon soon escaped the arena of Olympiccompetition and sport  In  the Daily Chronicleused it figuratively to characterize a potatopeelingcontest  The Murphy Marathon and in the sendurance dances were regularly called marathonsthe earliest such reference surprisingly comes fromdour Scotlands Glasgow Herald in   But even inthese extensions of the word  athon was only part of aplacename even though now regularly applied tophysical activities and had no meaning on its own ineither English or the original Greek  Then in  theSan Francisco Examiner reported on a telethon  cautiouslyenclosing the word in quotation marks to showit was a neologism  It is the first citation in the OEDSupplement  Volume   which defines the wordas a TV program lasting several hours especially tosolicit contributions coined by analogy from marathon What had apparently happened was that a falseanalysis had divided the Olympic event into two speciousmorphemes as if mara meant running andathon meant long as a suffix            In any case telethon took hold quickly  By the Baltimore Sun could use it without the quotationmarks and so it has become an ineradicable part ofviewing terminology admitted into Websters ThirdNew International Dictionary in   The OED insiststelethon is orig and chiefly US but Australiahad taken it up by  and there was no more appropriateword at hand in  when a journalist forEnglands Listener wrote Perhaps we have all beencorrupted by the telethons of Vietnam television reportingPerhaps we have                           Telethon seems here to stay sanctioned by dictionariesbut no dictionary records the next innovationwith athon  and I can only guess that the newsuffix began attaching to other base elements in thes and s  As it is the last twenty years have seena bewildering array of applications all in the sense ofa longlasting demanding activity a test of enduranceor an indication of enormous capacity  It hasappeared in such unlikely combinations as talkathonwalkathon aquathon skiathon bikeathon birdathonsellathon saleathon curlathon a hairstylingextravaganza and even the seemingly unnecessaryjogathon and runathon denoting more leisurelyor shorter races than a marathon  Most usages areselfexplanatory but not all  Toolathon is a store inBergen County New Jersey rather than a constructioncontest and roofathon was an odd sales promotion in involving bicyclists atop a  store in RenoNevada  That forms like saleathon retain the a evenafter the base elements e demonstrates that the athonof marathon  rather than the ethon of telethon  isperceived as the primary form of the suffix but thematter has not been completely settled consider alcothonwhich I hope was a test of abstinence ratherthan indulgence            It will not do to heap scorn on athon and denounceathoninators as licentious with language  Anew morpheme survives the novelty of its first innovationlike telethon for  athon  because it turns out to beuseful almost as if by accident and brings somethingnew into the idiom  Athon clearly serves a purposewhen a business person or public relations representativewants to advertise a lot of some activity with asingle handy distinctive term  But utility alone hasnot kept athon current  It is easy to reuse and moreimportant each new usage reflects an attempt at creativityhowever feeble  What is easy and witty isbound to become popular  The hyphens that separateathon from the base morpheme is most new usagessurely are selfconscious attempts to call attention tothe wit invested in the coinage like parsley atop acasserole of leftovers  It is halffacetious showmanship            Even though the American taste for plunderingplacenames has provided words like telethon to othernations some have commited semantic thefts of theirown  The European peace movement for examplehas taken shima from Hiroshima to denote a site ofnuclear devastation  Nein Euroshima the astonishedvisitor is likely to find on tee shirts and sidewalks whereverantinuclear sentiments run strong  I would like tocontribute No Amerishima as well            A second class of bound and gagged morphemescomprises innovations based upon a portion of a commonterm that is either not a morpheme or an incorrectform of a morpheme used in a new sense  Myfavorite is erciseicise because of the notable diffidenceof its applications  Americas obsession withphysical fitness has brought us specialty group calisthenicswhich we designate jazzercise aerobicise  ordancercise on the model exercise  depending on whattype of music is playing or degree of enthusiasm  Buterciseicise cannot mean simply group dance exercisesbecause there is also sexercise  which almost certainlyinvolves neither large groups or dancing            These are only representative examples of thebound and gagged morpheme  More neomorphemesand their consequent neologisms exist than can besumupercised spawned daily by ingenuity and the desireto put some flash into news copy advertisingdrives or the names of businesses  Most will disappearas quickly as they were created  That is the way of allflash            The bound and gagged morpheme is in fact thestepchild of the pun and initially is meant to be recombinedonly as long as it seems clever to do so  It canthrive because the temptation arises so often too powerfulto resist as was the case with this essays title tothrow in a little wit for good measure even if withoutmuch accuracy  Like the puns above most word formswith newly created morphemes are incidental and almostalways dismissible but not functionless  Theymake us pause to groan the groan that is nearly laughterEven when we scorn yet another neologism withathon  or ridicule a new gate as in Irangate  orwince at alcoholic becoming chocoholic  it has alreadymade us concentrate on language and refreshed ourinterest by whetting our humor  That is a functionthat is precious            And for all our groans to the contrary bound andgagged morphemes are a feature of our national dispositionour lighthearted lack of regard for linguistictradition  We can dismiss them no more than we candismiss our euphemisms jargons and gobbledygookwithout frustrating our sensibility  The neomorphemesshow that in public life we are in a hurry and do notwant to slow down long enough to devise an explanatoryphrase if we can pack enough of our intention intoa single word  We can get by with a coinage like laughoramabecause we know oramas affiliation with panoramawill tell our listeners enough for the momenteven though the innovations orama does not clearlymean view as it does in the model            Here lies the most engaging feature of the layAmerican attitude toward language meaning is anadvisor but not a dictator in usage  The people whoestablish and preserve innovations are unlikely to havethe philologists taste for etymological fidelity but thathardly means they are uneducated or uninterested inlanguage  On the contrary their attention to meaningmust be acute even if purists pale at the inelegance ofthe many neologisms because bound and gagged morphemessucceed in communicating with marvelousease and utility  No one could scorn them if they weremeaningless then they would simply be empty odditiesIt is the emphasis of neologists the nature of theirinterest in language that is intriguingan interest inplayfulness over etymology an emphasis upon the witof brevity and an ear finely tuned for useful novelty            Teachers and other professionals are usually creditedwith setting the standard for usage but inAmerica at least theirs is not the only standard  Thereis rather a double standard first the socalled AmericanStandard that textbooks try to inculcate the dignifiedparlance of discourse and then the related but divergentAmerican Wit the standard of ingenuity whichtrafficks freely in analogy pun and portmanteau  At itsbest it can enrich the American idiom with phraseswords and even bound morphemes

radio and TVwhich as American visitors become quickly awareseems to be used with far less inhibition in Britain thanin North America  The situation in the US is improvingifthat is the correct wordin that someTV films I have seen there recently have not had thenaughty bits bleeped out  In the view of David Hatchmanaging director of BBC Radio a rude word on theradio is not a rude word if it is sworn in context andbroadcast at the right time  A rude word is of coursealways a rude word and the right time is somewhatarbitrary it is not as though everyone is not familiarwith the rude words indeed those who object to themthe most are not likely to be in bed by nine oclockThe feeling one assumes is that broadcasting themregardless of context at times when children are listeninglends rude words a patina of approval thatinures them to the corrosive atmosphere of tabooThus when uttered by an actor whose thumb has justbeen struck by a hammer or who has suffered somefrustration or other outrage any of several fourletterwords seem as natural as in real life  When uttered incircumstances where taboo language would seem eithergratuitous or otherwise inappropriate rude wordsare not only equally out of place in the world of makebelieveas in the real world but worse they interferein both with the message            British comedians though not quite as outspokenas Lenny Bruce show less restraint in their choice ofwords than their American counterparts but the betterfunnier ones like the Two Ronnies are typicallymore subtle than the rest  Benny Hill whose showshave often been seen too often some might beinclined to say in the US rarely resorts to rude languagefocusing rather on what is viewed as a revivalof old burlesque routines in which there is much rollingof the eyes winking and the sly aside to the audienceall of which add up to the rudeness being in themind of the beholder  As many of the British comedianseither speak with thick North or West Countryaccents mumble talk too fast or all three it is sometimesdifficult to understand what they and theiraudiences are on about  They appear to revel in thedelivery of punch lines that are totally unintelligiblenotI hasten to say because of a culture gap or adiminution of this viewers auditory acuity but becauseof essential lack of clarity of expression            As Alan Hamiltons item in The Times  June  reminds us the BBC guidelines of the ssince abandoned were quite specific There is an absoluteban upon the following jokes about lavatorieseffeminacy in men immorality of any kind suggestivereferences to honeymoon couples chambermaids figleaves ladies underwear lodgers and commercialtravellers  Observation reveals that we have beenspared the last two but the rest are retained as mainstaysof British humor especially knickers AmericanEnglish panties the mere mention of which seems tosend everyone in the UK in paroxysms of uncontrollablelaughter  The same reaction is guaranteed byreferences to poofs homosexuals big boobs lavatoriesYfronts Jockey shorts and especially incontinenceIt is not suggested that these subjects be interdictedmerely that it is difficult even after sometwenty years of acculturation for an outlander to discernmuch that is funny about them  To me the funniestcomedians by far chiefly because much of theirhumor is linguistic in nature are the Two RonniesRonnie Barker and Ronnie Corbett whose TV appearancescame to an end early in  with Barkersannounced retirement to run a business in antiquesfor which he doubtlessly acquired a taste from BennyHills jokes  Another form of humor that enjoys greatpopularity in Britain is that of transvestites like BarrieHumphreys Dame Edna Everage whom I find hilariousand Danny LaRue whom I have never seenThey do not seem to appeal to insecure men who havea defensive macho image of themselves even in Britainhence are likely to have less allure in the US            Getting back to strong language the writer of twoUK soap operas Grange Hill and Brookside defendedits use on the grounds of realism though it waspointed out that the audience for the latter had fallenfrom  million to  because of its language  Inthe UK that would seem an overreaction and Ishould venture to suggest that the quality of the showis more to blame  On the other hand as David Wadereports More people it appears ring or write in toBBC Radio about all the effing and blinding or thetaking of the name of God in vain than about anyother single subject  The Times  June  Thereis probably something to be said in favour of the occasionaluse of rude language in drama for the sake ofrealism on the other hand in the real world rudelanguage is often the resort of those who are unable toarticulate their thoughts and emotions and the presenceof characters so afflicted is certainly dispensablein drama  In the words of Howard Baker a playwrightThe dramatist has a responsibility to a highertruth than mere authenticity
