                    Introduction        Squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue is a common        malignancy treated by surgeons Incidence of tongue cancer        in India is second highest in the world Among males the        age adjusted incidence rate is as high as         peryear in Ahmedabad while among females it is          in Mumbai     In Trivandrum the incidence of        tongue cancer is   among males and         among females            Tongue is a complex anatomical site and its form and        function are crucial for efficient swallowing speech and        appreciation of taste In past different methods of        treatment have been employed but tongue has remained a        difficult area to assess and treat The survival in        carcinoma of the tongue is poor compared to other subsites        in oral cavity        The distribution of cervical lymph node metastasis from        squamous cell carcinoma at different subsites in the oral        cavity has been described before       However there        are very few studies from India where the incidence of        tongue cancer is high The distribution of metastases        suggests skip lesions and peppering       Predicting        the lymphatic spread from cancer of the oral tongue can        help in choosing the appropriate surgical procedure and may        also help in predicting the outcome The purpose of the        present study was to assess the pattern of cervical node        metastasis from carcinoma of the oral tongue and to        evaluate the impact of tumour status on survival                    Patients and Methods        A retrospective analysis of  patients undergoing        primary surgical resection for squamous cell carcinoma of        oral tongue between January  and December  in a        single surgical unit was carried out to evaluate the        pattern of nodal metastasis and survival The variables        like age sex tumour size grade clinical TNM        pathological TNM and histopathological levels of        involvement were extracted from case records All the        patients underwent evaluation under general anaesthesia        before the surgery and clinical TNM was modified if        indicated The types of surgical procedures performed are        detailed in table  Adjuvant radiotherapy  Gy        fraction was given if the primary tumour was greater than         cm had close margins or nodal involvement was present or        there was extranodal involvement Minimum duration of        followup was two years following surgery Survival        analysis was carried by KaplanMeier method and the curves        were compared using log rank test Multivariate analysis        was carried out using Cox proportional hazard model                    Results        Age of the patients ranged from  to  years with a        mean age of  years The male female ratio was         Table  All the patients had undergone primary surgical        resection        At presentation  of patients had T          tumour followed by T          in  Table  Clinically         patients were found to be neck node positive of which          were cN             were cN         b and   were cN         c  Histologically  cases were found        to have positive neck nodes of which majority          were pN         b  The T and N stage distribution is        detailed in table  Cervical lymph node metastasis was        present in  of T          tumours  of T          tumours  of T          tumours and  of T          tumours Table  Histologically         cases were true positive for nodal metastasis while         cases were true negative giving a sensitivity of  and        specificity of  for clinical examination of the neck        Table  Synchronous discontinuous operations were        performed in all cases None of the patients had a positive        resection margin however the margin was close  mm in         cases Neck was managed by vein preserving neck        dissection in  cases  and supraomohyoid neck        dissection in  cases  Table  It was observed        that the nodal involvement in ipsilateral level II was        highest  followed by the involvement of level I         level III  and level IV  Table         Table shows the distribution of nodes at different levels        of the neck in varying combination Skip metastasis to        level III  III and IV occurred in  cases On        histopathological examination only one patient had        bilateral positive nodes These nodes were located at level        I bilaterally and the patient had undergone bilateral vein        preserving neck dissection Table  A total of         patients received adjuvant radiotherapy radiotherapy was        given to  patients with N disease or extranodal        spread Nine patients with TN disease and  patients with        TN disease and one patient each with TN and TN        disease did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy        Over the twoyear followup  cases failed the        failure was nodal in  primary in  and both primary and        nodal in  patients The clinical TNM pathological TNM and        level of positive node are illustrated in additional table         The overall disease free survival DFS was found to be         at   year and  at   years Table  fig         Patients with T          tumours were found to have a        significantly poor survival with the disease free survival        at the end of   years being  T          and T          tumours showed better prognosis with        disease free survival of  and  respectively at        the end of   years Table  figure         Histopathological node negative cases had a DFS of  at        the end of   years whereas pathological N          pN           had survival of  and pN          of  P   Table  figure         No other parameter including use of adjuvant        radiotherapy was found to have significant effect on        disease free survival On multivariate analysis the tumour        size and nodal metastasis were found to be significant        independent prognostic factors The hazard ratio for        failure was  for T  for T  for T and         for T tumours Similarly hazard ratio for failure in N        disease was  it was  in N  in N and  in        N disease Sex was also found to be an independent        prognostic factor with hazard ratio for males being         however this difference was statistically not        significant                    Discussion        Squamous cell carcinoma arising in oral tongue is        curable if assessed and treated appropriately Clinically        undetectable nodal metastasis is the commonest cause of        treatment failure Incidence of neck metastasis in oral SCC        is reported to be  to       In our series level        II was found to be the most commonly involved site         and level IV involvement was seen in   patients        Isolated level IV involvement in absence of involvement of        one of the higher levels I II or III was not documented        in any patient in the present study Further clinically        node negative cases never showed level IV involvement Shah        et al     had documented similar results Hence a        supraomohyoid neck dissection is justified when the neck is        clinically negative On the contrary Byers et al             found  of patients with oral cancer to have        metastasis in level IV without nodes in level I II or        III        It was seen that only  of T          and T          lesions showed nodal metastasis where        as  of the larger tumours showed metastasis Table         Previous studies     support our finding that tumour        size is a predictor of lymph node metastasis though they        propose that tumour thickness is a more reliable factor        This is further explained by DiTroia      who        points to difficulty for the tumour emboli to form in small        calibre lymphatics of the superficial areas compared with        wider lymphatic of deeper tissues However tumour        thickness is a radiological or histological parameter        which cannot be assessed preoperatively by clinical        examination or biopsy        In our study sensitivity and specificity of clinical        examination was poor suggesting that clinical examination        is of limited use in predicting cervical nodal metastasis        This is in accord with previous studies      One        option would be to look for a more reliable methods to        asses the neck Sajeeda et al     documented that        ultrasonography is not only useful in detecting neck nodes        but is also useful in assessing the nodal characteristic        and the degree of vascular invasion Takashima et al            demonstrated ultrasound guided fine needle        aspiration to have  diagnostic accuracy Computed        tomographic CT scanning too is very useful for the        purpose of early detection of neck metastasis            Magnetic resonance imaging MRI on the other hand has been        found to have little advantage over clinical examination as        the soft tissue contrast resolution reported by MRI is        inadequate to detect minimal morphological changes in lymph        nodes            The technique of sentinel node biopsy is gaining        popularity Surgery on the primary tumour often modifies        lymphatic drainage so sentinel node biopsy is useful when        primary tumour and neck are operated at the same time            If the treatment decision has to be based on the        present sensitivity and specificity of clinical        examination then a minimum selective neck dissection        should be carried out for all node negative necks where        primary is being treated by surgery as primary modality        Studies have documented that ipsilateral level I II and        III neck dissection is an adequate diagnostic procedure for        staging of the clinically node negative neck in early oral        tongue cancer      Its diagnostic role cannot be        replaced by preoperative radiological screening and        intraoperative frozen section sampling        T          and T          tumours show a similar significantly        higher disease free survival compared to T          and T          tumours even though the number in the        present study is small the conclusions can be drawn with        conviction from these results as shown in earlier studies        on smaller sample size     Brown et al            too have shown similar results Nodal metastases too        significantly correlate with disease free survival as also        documented by Woolgar et al      Similar results        were seen in the present study as well where tumour size        nodal status and surgery as primary modality were found to        be a significant predictor of disease free survival        In the light of the present results showing a poor        sensitivity and specificity of clinical examination in        predicting nodal metastasis and infrequent involvement of        level IV in the absence of involvement of higher levels we        suggest that a supraomohyoid neck dissection should be        carried out in all patients of the oral tongue cancer with        clinically node negative neck to achieve a better disease        free survival
