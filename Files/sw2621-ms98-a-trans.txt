          but a lot of women are knowledge as knowledge about football as i am       can i guess your favorite team if you had one might be the Steelers well i can understand that i you know i kind of like the Cowboys too   yes uhhuh do you   theyve had some great games in the past   uhhuh i i always enjoy watching this Dallas the Dallas and Pittsburgh together you know   uhhuh me too it wasnt nearly as much fun when Bradshaw was playing for you guys ill tell you he lives in the Dallas area now as a matter of fact     does he really   well actually its probably closer to Fort Worth but its its in the same area he bought uh bought a big horse farm out in a little town called Roanoke Texas   uhhuh uhhuh   but he pops up on the Dallas scene quite often as a matter of fact there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job     oh wow i wonder if hed ever do that   i dont know hed be good at it hes such a motivator he primarily you know with the quarterbacks that would be his specialty i wished i wished they could work something i really like him i really do   yes uhhuh uhhuh well what about the Houston Oilers do you like them   yeah okay id love to see Dallas and Houston play in a Super Bowl that would be really great   uhhuh   that may not ever happen i dont know uh Houston has had some wonderful talent you know down through the years and in the earlier years they really had some super teams     uhhuh and Warren Moon is is proving himself quite well right now   thats right he certainly is hes very good   uhhuh hes one of the few uh black quarterbacks that there are   hes very good thats right Randall Cunningham was with Philadelphia i guess last year but hes no longer with the team so youre right there are very few black quarterbacks or at least that are starting anyway how do you think the Steelers are going to do this year you have any idea   uhhuh i dont know i hope they they do better they they during the past couple of years theyve been doing a little bit better   uhhuh   but uh i think they still have a little i think theyre still such a a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential  that it did when ever Bradshaw was playing   yeah oh yeah that was just such super team   or if they even reach that potential again you know they may never reach that again   yeah well thats a tough it would be tough to do it really would they have such a super team for years   uhhuh   that won what four Super Bowls   yeah four in a row   four in a row i dont know if that could ever be duplicated again or not   oh i dont know shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying but basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now so   yeah thats right  and thats right thats right   i think Mike Webster was left but then he he just left uh   uhhuh yeah he may have been the last of the old guard i dont know   yeah i think he is i think he was   yeah they had such a super team   uhhuh   have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday     no i didnt   i see   huhuh   theres quite a bit of activity now of course they had so many you know nice uh choices because their record was so lousy the last few years they picked up you know quiet a few     uh   of the of course you never know the guys they pick you know may may never play a game you just never know its its a gamble it really is they may get hurt or not be able to participate at that level if you know   yeah uhhuh well who would you say is your favorite player or has ever been your favorite player   ever been   uhhuh   probably an old guy that played probably before you were born  his name was Sam Huff he used to play for the New York Giants     oh   that was one of the toughest guys that ive ever seen in my life as far as you know dedication he just went all out every single play of course there have been some other great ones too Dick Butkis and Bradshaw you know theres been so many   really uhhuh yeah yeah   but if i had to pick one i would probably pick Sam Huff as a matter of fact   oh you know thats really funny um well i i come from a large family and there theres quite a few boys so thats kind of how i got in with the football either watch that or watch nothing and um   uhhuh thats right   at one time i could name all the players on the Steelers you know and but even when Bradshaw was playing i i dont know i i didnt particularly care for him i thought he was kind of cocky or something uhhuh   uhhuh he is he is of course there a quarterback has a big ego   yes uhhuh   they really do they have to have they cant survive   uhhuh   they always think they can win you know which is the way it should be and boy he never gave up ill tell you   uhhuh yeah him and Franco Harris i really didnt care for the either two of them   uhhuh uhhuh   i mean they were good but i you know you couldnt deny that but i didnt i thought you know well i just didnt really care for either one of them uh today  my favorites out of those guys were probably um   oh yeah uhhuh   Lambert Ham and uh Stallworth and Swan   uhhuh uhhuh uhhuh absolutely i cant disagree with that they were super players they really were they really   yeah uhhuh i i i like not just with the Pittsburgh i like watching on Saturday afternoons when theyll have like the plays or the the best plays from you know from the week or something   uhhuh yeah highlights yeah uhhuh   yeah i love watching that then i like watching their bloopers too you know   uhhuh yeah yeah thats kind of funny too as a matter of fact  some of them a a bit embarrassing       yeah well they make mistakes too i guess   yeah uhhuh its funny that more people dont get hurt   absolutely absolutely   you know especially i would say the receivers when theyre in the air and they get tackled   uhhuh go ahead they take such a beating   oh yeah its funny some of their necks dont get broken   absolutely i dont know how they do it its it must just take a hundred percent concentration i guess because they know theyre going to get hit its just a matter of how hard you know or where   yeah an they have to be in ideal physical shape basically   oh absolutely they look like sometimes theyre just broken in two like a match stem gosh what a beating they really do take a beating they really do     yeah well what did you think of um a couple years ago for the Bears the refrigerator   i think he was just probably a passing phenomena i think  i dont know i im       knowing what you know of course Mike Ditka was in Dallas for years and years as coach is knowing his or you know knowing of his temperament im just surprised he ever you know kept the guy around i really am hes such a hes about a half hot head anyway such a temper   oh you know and to me he does um oh hes just so big and fat he doesnt even look like hes in shape hes just so big no one can move him   uhhuh thats right yeah absolutely theres just so much mass there i guess they just cant i dont know you know i probably the guy is you know probably physically strong i you know obviously not very fast but i guess its just   uhhuh   like you say a mass that nobody can seem to to get out of the way as far as him scoring touch downs you know i think that was kind of weird i dont know           Dallas has a guy uh his name is Nate Newton now he has a real weight problem too he fights it every single year but he manages to still keep playing but   yeah   he has a terrible weight problem   wow   they watch the coaches watch him all year long they they weigh him several times a year just to make sure hes not you know completely out of control   uhhuh   but i guess most every team has some has someone like that i dont know   oh yeah theres there are some really big guys playing in football   absolutely they get bigger and bigger it seems every year i guess you have to to   uhhuh   know to stay in the game i guess yeah   yeah you would uhhuh um now who would you say that you have a favorite i mean other than Dallas would you say that you have uh a favorite quarterback i mean the quarterbacks seem to get most of the the attention you know   oh yeah sure well youd have to uh or i would have to say you know someone like Montana i guess whos done so well for so many years   yeah i really i i enjoy watching him play   yeah his age is about to catch up with him though       hes no Spring chicken anymore and like you say Warren Moons an excellent Warren Moons an excellent but hes very exciting to watch uhhuh sure uhhuh absolutely   no but hes still performing yes he is i i i enjoy watching him also what about uh Marino   uh im obviously hes a very good quarterback id i never was you know too a whole lot of a big fan you know   i think hell get better as he gets older   yeah he may uhhuh   because he he well was he was the youngest quarterback there was wasnt he   yes he was i believe thats right at one point in time yeah but hes a very young fellow yeah   uhhuh   of course a quarterback can look so good if hes got a lot if hes got a good supporting cast you know  if not he gets beat to death like poor old Troy Aikman has the last couple of years anyway you know well Dallas did better last year hopefully theyll do better this year   thats true thats true uh probably around twelve uhhuh yeah um i didnt i dont know i i just think you know Marino will get better and uh his teams not as good as what it was when he went to the Super Bowl you know so   uhhuh thats right thats right yeah Miamis had some down years too   yeah   but they all do i guess its its cyclical i guess as the players get older get slower   uhhuh yeah  thats true yeah and with age comes you know the the im sure arthritis sets in with them you know right yeah   get slower   yeah oh yeah oh yes very much so hip injuries and things like that yeah yeah that that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game   uhhuh and theyre so young but theyre retired you know and their so young still   thats right uhhuh yeah i read some time well not too long ago that the average uh professional career only lasts seven years so thats when you think about it thats really not a very long time of course   oh oh yeah but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that   yeah but if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys dont make it seven years you know   yeah a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple   thats right yeah thats right yeah   holy smokes i didnt  that doesnt seem like very long   thats thats a pretty short career on average   uhhuh   of course they play their you know cards right and do some good investments theyll you know theyll do all right but a lot of them dont unfortunately   uhhuh yeah um what do you think of the uh LA Raiders used to the the Oakland   yeah they theyre always branded you know as a bunch of outlaws and if their if their         you know arrest record wont let able wont let them play anywhere else they seem to go to they seem to go to the Raiders but that just may be you know perceived     yeah   you know perception i dont know Al Davis is hes a kind of strange character strange strange looking guy apparently hes kind of a wild guy i dont really know for sure theyve had some excellent teams though obviously im not sure theyve yet decided where they want to play they keeping talk about you know going   yes they have uhhuh
