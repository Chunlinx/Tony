                    Background        Embryological literature includes a broad array of        descriptions of development in one organism or another A        monophyletic ancestry for the vertebrates with the        possible exception of cyclostomes implies that some common        inherited mechanistic themes exist for development        Differences ought to reflect either adaptations for various        environmental conditions or nonadaptive not maladaptive        traits that appeared in conjunction with genetic drift        quantum speciation or punctuated equilibrium Common        themes and significant differences in developmental        patterns should appear through the study of as many        vertebrates as possible chosen from a list of diverse        types Phylogeny and ontogeny support each other in this        context    Comparative studies also help us to        identify model systems that are perhaps better suited than        more common ones to answer difficult biological questions        Development in many of the approximately fifty orders of        fishes remains unknown This paper will help in part to        fill the knowledge gaps        The longnose gar         Lepisosteus osseus also known as the        garpike is one of four living species of its genus within        the Osteichthyian division Ginglymodi infraclass        Neopterygii They are restricted to the Western        Hemisphere Wiley   using vicariance biogeography        placed a  millionyear age on the genus which arose        before the breakup of Pangaea Their adult anatomy and        distribution have been used to construct phylogenies for        actinopterygian evolution and details of their embryonic        development are likely to have similar usefulness        Most previous work on the early embryonic development of                Lepisosteus was performed before         and codified by Agassiz   Balfour and Parker          Dean   Eycleshymer    and Lanzi   Lack of        modern by todays standards laboratory facilities and        equipment were handicaps to those studies Much of the        description of early embryonic development in the garpike        is based on material that was badly distorted by harsh        fixation procedures Moreover the embryos themselves        might have been unhealthy they were sometimes raised under        suboptimal conditions Cellmarking techniques had not        been devised at the time so inferences made about        gastrulation movements or blastomere fate could not be        tested experimentally Recent embryological study of the        garpike either has been restricted to the development of        specific structures in older embryos eg   or has        been reported in sketchy fashion ancillary to studies with        another purpose eg          We took a fresh look at this animal to describe in        familiar terms the sequence of events during its        development Relatively recent information similar to what        we report here is known for four other basal fishes among        the Actinopterygii namely paddlefish Osteichthyes         Chondrostei Acipenseriformes sturgeon Osteichthyes         Chondrostei Acipenseriformes bichir Osteichthyes         Chrondrostei Polypteriformes and bowfin Osteichthyes         Halecostomi Amiiformes Studies of those groups               illustrated the marked differences in        development among them For example development of the        sturgeon is relatively froglike and the bowfin is much        more similar to teleosts in its gastrulation pattern We        found that garpike development differs from that of the        basal fish listed above as well as teleosts        One of us Long has engaged an experimental study of        morphogenetic cell movements in         L osseus which largely occupy        stages  described here see   Interpretation of        that and other studies will require the structural and        temporal framework provided by this staging description        This normal series of developmental stages partly is a        contribution to the body of science and partly is a common        reference point that will enable other investigators to use        the garpike in their own laboratories                    Results                  Rate of development          Fig   The developmental rate for           Lepisosteus as is common for fish          proceeds at a pace dictated partly by the developmental          program and partly by temperature Our temperature          control regime was of necessity weatherrelated for          specimens were raised either on a water table or in          running lakewater Developmental rates under such          conditions can be measured fairly accurately over a short          time period of up to several hours but their accuracy          suffers over longer periods because of environmental          temperature fluctuations We list shortterm rates for          early stages of development at several temperatures in          the following paragraphs Longerterm rates are shown in          figure  which is based on selected developmental stages          for a single batch of eggs taken in  The          temperatures listed each represent the average of two          temperature readings taken in the running lakewater          system every day at  AM and  PM Water temperature at          any time during a hour period fluctuated as much as a          degree away from the average ie warmer during the day          and cooler at night Development for this batch was not          timed past six days because travel arrangements precluded          it                          Stage  one cell          Fig A B  This stage begins at fertilization and          lasts until the first cleavage furrow is readily visible          about three hours postfertilization at  The eggs are          spherical about  mm in diameter As with other fish          species there is some variation in egg size from          femaletofemale We measured a range of  mm for          batches from various females The eggs become quite          sticky when they are placed in water and adhere firmly          to whatever substrate is available This is true even for          those that remain unfertilized          The egg envelopes enlarge slowly over the next hour          revealing a narrow perivitelline space about  mm wide          A cushioning nonadhesive jelly fills the perivitelline          space The principle envelope that surrounds the egg is          the chorion derived from the vitelline envelope of the          unfertilized ovum It is clear allowing the egg to be          viewed easily This layer has similar optical and          mechanical properties to the chorion of the medaka           Oryzias latipes though it lacks          the medakas characteristic filamentous ornamentation A          second layer of jelly surrounds the chorion This jelly          layer is of variable thickness up to  mm and it          provides the sticky character of the eggs          Dean   described slaty gray eggs This is true          except that each has a white blastodisc at the animal          pole The intersection of the white and gray regions          establishes a distinctly visible border for the          blastodisc The blastodisc itself is about  mm in          diameter and occupies about  of the eggs          circumference A dimple occurs at its apex and marks the          animal pole The dimple is the point of sperm entry It          lies immediately adjacent to the micropyle which is          easily seen in the chorion and jelly layers          Loosening of the vitelline envelope from the egg          surface at fertilization allows gravity induced egg          rotation to occur but the rotation is quite slow          perhaps impeded by the perivitelline jellys thick          consistency It takes two hours or more to complete                          Stage  two cells          Figs C A  This stage begins with appearance of          the first cleavage furrow about four hours after          fertilization at   hours at   hours at           The furrow first appears at the animal pole and          gradually extends to the edge of the blastodisc which we          now call the blastoderm It will ultimately cut further          but by then subsequent furrows appear Cleavage in this          species is meroblastic furrows divide the blastoderm          similar to the teleosts Unlike the teleostean pattern          however the cleavage furrows continue past the          blastoderm margin as grooves in the yolk cell surface          The first two grooves sometimes meet at the vegetal pole          but we found no evidence in living or fixed eggs that          they extend significantly beneath the yolk cell cortex          This phenomenon led to some confusion in  thcentury          literature concerning whether garpike cleavage is          holoblastic or meroblastic It is meroblastic                          Stage  four cells          Fig D  The second cleavage furrow appears about           hours after fertilization at   hours at  Dean            reported its appearance at threehours but his          specimens were subject to an uncertain temperature          regimen The second furrow proceeds like the first          dividing the blastoderm deeply and extending past its          margin outward across the gray yolk cell Like the first          groove this one will ultimately reach the vegetal pole          in some specimens                          Stage  eight cells          Figs E B  The paired third cleavage furrows          appear about  hours postfertilization at            hours at  They are generally parallel to the first          furrow and produce two rows of four blastomeres each          However a few specimens up to  in some batches of          eggs show an oblique thirdcleavage orientation that          produces a morula with a rosette of blastomeres at its          animal pole Dean first reported this in             The first cleavage groove extends to the eggs equator          by now while the second meets the blastoderm margin The          vegetal half of the morula the future yolk cell still          exhibits a smooth surface                          Stage   cells          Figs F C  The fourth round of cleavage begins          about  hours postfertilization at   hours at           and lasts for about two hours By now the first          cleavage groove reaches halfway between the equator and          the vegetal pole                          Stage   cells          Fig A B C  This stage begins the blastula          phase of garpike development Cleavage divisions carry          the blastula from  to  cells In a cell embryo          about  complete blastomeres appear on the surface          surrounded by marginal cells that are continuous with the          yolk cell Many central blastomeres are also separated          from the yolk cell by tangential cleavage divisions          Dissection shows that the deep blastoderm cells are still          connected to the yolk cell and appear to bud from          it                          Stage  smallcell blastula          Fig D  The surface of the blastoderm has acquired          a lumpy appearance which indicates the steady decrease          in blastomere size An enveloping cell layer can be          distinguished Many deep cells lie beneath the enveloping          layer Cleavage furrows on the yolk cell are regressing          by this time they extend only to the eggs equator no          further                          Stage  smoothsurfaced blastula          Fig E  This is the final stage before epiboly          Embryos reach it by about  hours at   hours at           Superficial blastomeres are tiny and the blastoderm          surface consists of a thin enveloping layer similar to          that in teleosts The yolk furrows gradually regress          until they are no longer visible          A virtual uninflated segmentation cavity forms          floored with large yolky cells In many specimens the          blastoderm forms a peaked mound at the animal pole The          blastoderm has an irregular rim and a flat bottom where          it joins the yolk cell Dissection reveals a continuing          presence of deep central cells that appear to be budding          from the yolk cell Many of them show broad connections          with the yolk cell and many join it via a narrow          stalk                          Stage  epiboly begins          Fig F  The blastoderm begins epiboly by  hours          at  but has not reached the eggs equator Some          specimens show the first indication of dorsalventral          asymmetry as a result of a lag in epiboly of the dorsal          blastoderm margin This produces a slight bulge in the          blastoderm margin at that location as though epiboly          were being retarded by its attachment to the yolk cell          The bulge is the first external expression of the          embryonic shield The germ ring appears internally at          this stage as well          Dissected specimens reveal an extensive subgerminal          cavity whose floor is paved by large yolky cells that          are adherent to the yolk syncytial layer           ysl The blastoderm can be          cleanly separated by dissection from the           ysl surface beneath the germ ring          and embryonic shield but the deep yolky cells at the          animal pole adhere to the           ysl Some of them are difficult to          remove for they are still attached by stalks to the yolk          cell                          Stage  epiboly reaches the equator          Figs G D  The hint of dorsalventral asymmetry          seen at stage  is now definite The blastoderm overhangs          its margin at the dorsal midline having a crinkled edge          where it attaches to the yolk cell The overhang appears          similar to the dorsal blastopore lip in amphibian          embryos and we give it that name The exposed yolk cell          surface beneath the dorsal lip is the first external          appearance of the yolk syncytial layer                          Stage           Fig A B  The blastoderm reaches  the          distance from the equator to the vegetal pole The germ          ring is wide approaching  mm and the embryonic shield          is broader still          The external           ysl now occupies a greater portion          of the blastoderm margin and is broader at the dorsal          midline than elsewhere Viewed from the dorsal side the          blastoderm margin at the dorsal lip has the appearance of          a horseshoe its sidewalls face each other          Deep cells anterior to the future forebrain region          begin to migrate away from the animal pole producing an          evacuation zone that is devoid of cells The evacuation          zone is not visible in living specimens at this stage          and some deep cells still remain tightly attached to the           ysl at the animal pole The zone          ultimately enlarges to a diameter of  mm at stage                                    Stage           Fig C  The blastoderm margin reaches  the          distance from equator to vegetal pole The dorsal lip          overhangs a pit floored by the external           ysl a virtual gastrocoel The          embryonic shield extends above the equator It can be          dissected into two principal layers the epiblast and the          hypoblast The roof of the evacuation zone at the animal          pole is much thinner than before The exposed surface of          the yolk cell now comprises a large yolk plug                          Stage           Fig D  The yolk plug is half or less the diameter          of the equator The germ ring is narrow now and the          embryonic shield is longer nearly reaching to the          evacuation zone above the equator There is a hint of a          neural groove on its surface The crinkled sidewalls of          the dorsal lip flatten out as epiboly in the dorsal          midline catches up to that in other areas of the          blastoderm margin                          Stage           Fig E  The yolk plug is  or less the equator          diameter but is still visible The embryonic shield is          long intruding anteriad on the evacuation zone which          has a jumble of floor cells They can easily be dislodged          with a hair loop The shield extends over about  of          the yolk cell surface Although its neural groove has          deepened somewhat it is still quite shallow          The subgerminal cavity distinct from the evacuation          zone begins to inflate under the embryonic shield but          little outside it It has a smooth floor which is formed          by the surface of the           ysl                           Stage  yolk plug closure          Fig F  The yolk plug is no longer visible inside          the tiny blastopore The neural folds are distinct but          feeble They close in a posterioranterior sequence at          this stage remaining open last at their anterior end          Internally the posterior part of the notochord          segregates from the neural keel A crescent of cells          extends forward anterior to the neural field Later          these cells will contribute to the adhesive organ The          subgerminal cavity inflates lateral to the neural keel          This cavity is not a blastocoel it is a product of          morphogenetic cell movements not of cleavage                          Stage           Fig A B  The embryos axis occupies from           to  of the egg circumference The neural folds          disappear and the neural keel pushes deeper intruding on          the subgerminal cavity The prospective diencephalon          enlarges slightly where the optic lobes will form          The inflated subgerminal cavity extends the full          length of the embryonic axis The cavity extends          laterally as a wide pellucid area on each side of the          axis and anterior to the brain it extends into the          evacuation zone Somites  appear during this stage          and pronephric ducts occur from somite  posteriad A          slight swelling the trunktail bud lies at the          posterior end                          Stage           Fig C  New somites form from the  thto the           th The length of the axis exceeds  of the egg          circumference Expansion of the optic vesicles is          obvious they enlarge to hemispherical proportions The          telencephalon lies anterior to them Development of the          adhesive organ produces a beanshaped swelling anterior          to the brain Thickened protrusions in the subgerminal          cavity roof lateral to the axis mark the beginning of          the pharyngeal arches                          Stage           Fig D  New somites form from the  thto the           th The brain and trunktail bud rise prominently above          the main curvature of the embryo but neither is          undercut The single curved mass of the adhesive organ          wraps tightly around the telencephalon The optic          swellings have become rounded vesicles          The hyomandibular and hyobranchial pharyngeal pouches          are visible externally but they are best seen from below          after dissection of the embryo from the yolk The walls          of the pharynx as seen in dissection project down          laterally and begin to fold mesad to form the pharynx          floor                          Stage           Fig E  New somites form from the  thto the           th The trunktail bud projects from the embryo it is          slightly undercut but not bent down around the yolk          sacs contour The head end is markedly raised and          appears knobby because of the swollen brain vesicles the          spherical optic vesicles and the adhesive organs The          operculum appears extending a free edge Ventral fusion          of the pharynx sidewalls begins signaling the appearance          of the anterior intestinal portal Lateral plate mesoderm          extends about halfway out over the yolk sac A vascular          network shows on the dorsal portion of the yolk sac but          the heart is straight and not beating

equal to          that from adhesive organ to hindbrain The posterior          intestinal portal appears The pronephros begins to bend          Lenses can be seen in the eyes The opercular edge begins          its extension This is the stage of first motility a          slight onesided squirm at best                          Stage           Fig A  The trunktail outgrowth is now longer          than the whole brain but still curved along the contour          of the yolk Postcloacal somites are now forming and the          dorsal fin fold appears The trunk is almost straight          The entire trunk is still attached to the yolk mass but          the cloacal region is beginning to lift away from it          There is a strong pronephric bend          The head begins to project freely over the mouth area          The adhesive organ is larger than the eyeball but it is          not sticky The epiphysis appears and olfactory placodes          are visible One can find pigment on the yolk sac and          posterodorsal to the eye The heart begins to beat It is          hardly curved at all Blood vessels cover all but the          midventral part of the yolk Motility increases and          embryos move in a strong single coil                          Stage           Fig B  The free portion of the trunk is fairly          straight but the tail is bent down beyond the cloaca          which is  to  of the way out along the free ventral          surface of the trunk The dorsal finfold is obvious and          the intestine is visible between the yolk mass and the          cloaca Postcloacal somites have formed halfway out          along the tail          When viewed face on the adhesive organ has the shape          of a horseshoe The heart begins to coil and blood flows          on to the dorsal face of the yolk sac Dissection reveals          a bulging liver although this is not visible externally          Trunk somites are arranged as chevrons halfway down the          attached portion of the trunk Motility increases to one          or two coils but there is no backlash                          Stage           Fig C  The tail is finally straight Both the          dorsal and ventral fin folds of the tail are taller than          the caudal somites and a ventral fin notch appears at the          cloaca Inside the chorion the tail tip reaches the          eye          The somites become dusted with pigment Somites are          chevronshaped only on the attached part of the trunk          The margin of the operculum is thickened but does not yet          flare Blood circulation is established over most of the          yolk mass and the flow is strong in the subintestinal          vein                          Stage           Fig D  Tail segmentation is virtually complete          it never reaches the tail tip The yolk mass has become          ovoid The adhesive organ becomes sticky The free edge          of the operculum begins to expand but does not yet cover          the branchial arches Dechorionated embryos can swim          clumsily when prodded                          Stage           Fig A  Somites are chevronshaped as far as the          middle of the trunk Pectoral fin buds are visible after          fixation Specimens can swim in circles when prodded                          Stage           Fig B  Pectoral fin buds are visible in the          living embryo Somites are chevronshaped past the          cloaca There is a prominent bulge in the operculum edge          below the branchial arches                          Stage           Fig C  Pigment aggregates in the ventral fin          fold indicating the location of the future anal and          caudal fins Pectoral plates now possess barely          detectable ridges The adhesive organ is equal to or          larger than the eye                          Stage           Fig D  Anlagen of the anal and caudal fins are          clearly visible in the ventral fin fold Erosion of the          dorsal fin fold begins back beyond the pectoral fin          level The pectoral fin is now a low disc without a          membranous flange The opercular flap which is as wide          as the eye obscures the branchial arches in side view          Slight swellings on the gill arches presage gill          filaments                          Stage           Fig A B  The anlage of the dorsal fin is now          visible in the dorsal fin fold Although the pectoral fin          has acquired the shape of a halfmoon it still has no          flange Gill filaments are sprouting on branchial arches          one and two Most hatching occurs at this stage                          Stage           Figs C E  The dorsal fin fold has eroded as          far as the midtrunk The height of the yolk mass now has          been reduced nearly to the height of the tail including          its fin folds The pectoral fin is larger than a          halfmoon with a flange narrower than its muscle mass          The operculum is nearly twice as wide as the eye Gill          filaments occur on branchial arch three                          Stage           Fig D  The dorsal fin fold has eroded beyond the          midtrunk and the height of the yolk mass is now less          than or equal to the height of the tail including its fin          folds Somites are chevron shaped clear to the caudal          fin The pectoral fin flange is now equal to or wider          than the fins muscular disc The edge of the operculum          flap reaches the base of the pectoral fin The diameter          of the adhesive organ is now less than that of the eye          The nasal pit is still single and round as it has been          since stage                           Stage           Fig A B  Pelvic fin mats are visible as smooth          bulges The yolk mass is still perhaps twice the volume          of the head Nasal openings are still single but          elongating and the snout begins to lengthen The lower          jaw reaches the adhesive organ Rhythmic movements of the          jaw and operculum begin Bumplike tooth primordia are          barely visible on the jaws The pectoral fins tremble at          the end of a swim                          Stage           Fig C D  The fin fold of the tail is shrinking          between the anal and caudal fins and around the          permanent dorsal fin Rudiments of fin rays become          visible in these unpaired fins No dorsal fin fold          remains anterior to the level of the cloaca The yolk          mass is now smaller than the head The nasal apparatus          finally has separated into incurrent and excurrent          openings                          Stage           Fig E F  The yolk is finally exhausted Pelvic          fins are halfmoon shaped with narrow membranous flanges          The jaws are studded with sharp teeth                            Discussion        The bowfin         Amia calva and the garpike         Lepisosteus osseus are frequently        compared to each other in their anatomical characters as        they are both basal actinopterygians Study of their        development is an appropriate sequel to previous work on        members of the Chondrostei  the paddlefish         Polyodon   and the sturgeons         Huso and         Acipenser          Garpike have three developmental characters that        immediately separate them from bowfin  they show        meroblastic cleavage  they possess a welldefined yolk        syncytial layer and  events of gastrulation produce a        pit associated with the dorsal blastoderm margin The pit        is a formation of maneuver a temporary structure resulting        from cell migration It has no apparent ultimate        morphogenetic significance and it eventually        disappears                Amia cleavage is clearly holoblastic        producing about a dozen large yolky macromeres upon which        the smaller cells of the blastoderm rest   An initial        view of         Lepisosteus would lead one to draw a        similar conclusion for this fish However only one or two        garpike cleavage furrows even extend to the vegetal pole        and these are nothing more than shallow grooves in the yolk        cell cortex They eventually regress Garpike therefore        have a single yolk cell similar to that of teleosts This        condition sets the stage for the later appearance of the        yolk syncytial layer         ysl an otherwise uniquely        teleostean feature From a phylogenetic point of view the        garpike         ysl marks its first evolutionary        appearance in the actinopterygian fishes The teleost         ysl has important mechanical and        communications functions in early development            Therefore its presence in         Lepisosteus raises interesting        questions about its role there One of us Long is        pursuing these        Among the rayfinned fishes bichirs sturgeon and        paddlefish display a dorsal lip around which surface cells        migrate to the interior      Others eg           reported a similar condition in bowfin a        circumstance later shown to be mistaken    Teleost        fishes lack both a blastopore and invagination their outer        enveloping layer of cells serves as a casing inside of        which deep cells construct the embryo   The appearance        in garpike of structures appearing similar to the        sturgeons dorsal lip raises the possibility that        invagination and involution of surface cells to the        interior actually happens in         Lepisosteus Cell marking experiments        actually show that to be the case Long unpublished thus        we use the terms         dorsal lip blastopore and         yolk plug as names for the        appropriate embryonic structures in this report        Their size feeding habits and seasonal spawning cycle        make         Lepisosteus embryos generally        unsuitable for rapid progress through experiments as is        possible for organisms like the zebrafish         Danio rerio Garpike embryos        however possess combinations of features whose        investigation should prove valuable in the areas of        development evolution and taxonomy We hope that this        catalogue and description of the developmental sequence in        the garpike and our notations of comparison to other        fishes will spur further investigation into the embryology        of these remarkable animals                    Materials and Methods        Longnose gar spawn during the months of May and June in        Michigan and Vermont the locations at which we collected        our specimens The first two weeks of June were productive        at the Michigan site Dean   took eggs from a lake in        New York State between May  thand June  th        One of us Ballard collected some specimens for this        study from a rocky shoreline in Vermont on the eastern        side of Lake Champlain opposite Fort Ticonderoga He took        them from the rocks on which they were laid as soon as        possible after natural spawning of the fish which were        abundant in the lake during those years  These        eggs developed in dishes of standing water on a water table        at Dartmouth College Hanover New Hampshire        Later from  onward we worked at the Gull Lake        Laboratories of Michigan State University near Hickory        Corners MI Laboratory facilities are immediately adjacent        to the lake and only a hundred feet from the site at which        we trapped garpike in spawning condition We first used a        gill net set overnight perpendicular to the shoreline        running from the shore to about a hundred feet into the        lake Later we used a trap net set in a similar manner        Both of the devices were used under supervision of the        Michigan State Department of Natural Resources and the        department owned the trap net Adults providing gametes        ranged from  cm to  cm in length the females tended        to be larger than the males Adult females possessed a        silvery body coloration while males had a golden cast to        their scales        We dissected ripe gametes from the ovaries of gravid        females and fertilized them in glass dishes by mixing them        with minced testes a procedure similar to that commonly        used to fertilize frog eggs in the lab   We rinsed the        zygotes and incubated them in running water pumped fresh        from the lake The first ocytes to mature during the        spawning season are located in the anterior end of the        ovary Ocytes mature in a wave proceeding gradually        posteriad as the season progresses The ovaries are large        and contain thousands of eggs The eggs turn from white to        gray as they mature        Specimens from the  batches were preserved in        Bouins fluid at appropriate stages A glutaraldehyde        fixative  glutaraldehyde in  Holtfreter solution        served for the more recent work One day in the        glutaraldehyde followed by an overnight rinse in cold          Holtfreter solution prepared the specimens for        transfer to  ethanol and then to  ethanol for        storage We generally dechorionated the specimens after the        Bouins or glutaraldehyde fixation i e during the first        rinse Some embryos were dechorionated with pronase         mgml before fixation        Paraffin sections provided an internal view of specimens        at various stages Ballard also prepared some        celloidinimbedded hand sections more than thirtyfive        years ago figure Cwas drawn from one of these Some        material was also prepared for scanning electron        microscopy and examined using the ETEC Autoscan scope at        Western Maryland College In this case specimens were        carried gradually through a series of  ethanol         ethanol a  mix of acetone and  ethanol to        acetone They were processed through a critical point dryer        and sputter coated with gold before observation        Alternately specimens for electron microscopy were passed        through a series of  ethanol  ethanol absolute        ethanol a  mix of absolute ethanol and        hexamethyldisilazane HMDS to  HMDS These were        allowed to air dry in a fume hood before mounting and        sputter coating The specimen shown in figure Dwas        prepared this way Usually we dissected fresh or        recentlyfixed embryos to look into their interior        Dissection easily provided the level of detail required for        definitions of these stages and the other methods        confirmed the identification of internal structures        Figures        were prepared from camera        lucida drawings made over the years The design of the        stages and the use of outline drawings follow the pattern        established by Ballard and his associates for the normal        stages of fishes        Figure shows        photomicrographs of selected live specimens and an example        of one specimen prepared for electron microscopy
