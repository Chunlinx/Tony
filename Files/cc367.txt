                    Introduction        Postoperative morbidity and mortality after        hepatobiliary operations especially in cancer patients        has traditionally been perceived as being high Prior        reports however have failed to identify a predominant        class of complications such that interventions could be        undertaken that might be able to reduce the incidence of        these complications Prior reports have focused on        subgroups of operations within the family of all        hepatobiliary procedures such as hepatic resection              proximal bile duct resection    pancreatic        resection    and biliaryenteric bypass   There        are no prior reports on the utilization and outcomes of        critical care services required in the management of all        patients who experience complications after hepatobiliary        surgery at a single institution This paper reviews the        complications leading to the utilization of critical care        services after all hepatobiliary procedures performed over        a month period by a team of specialized surgeons        nurses anesthesiologists and internists who comprise the        Hepatobiliary Disease Management Team of the Memorial        SloanKettering Cancer Center                    Materials and methods                  Statistical analysis          Results are expressed

Hepatobiliary Surgical Service was            out of  patients Twelve ofthe  patients           admitted to the SCU during their postoperative          coursedied compared with five out of   patients          never admitted to the SCUduring their postoperative          course            P   Neither          thepreoperative diagnosis Table  nor the          operationperformed Table  appear to be associated with          an increased risk of SCUdeath At the time of death          eight out of the  patients  had          respiratoryfailure five patients  had hepatic          failure and three patients  hadacute renal failure          Additionally five out of the  patients           wereseptic two patients  had persistent          coagulopathy and ongoing uppergastrointestinal bleeding

postoperative duration of stay in the SCU          wassignificantly longer            P   for nonsurvivors            days than for survivors    days          Univariate analysisdemonstrated that mortality was          significantly increased for patients who hadmedian total          postoperative duration of stay in the SCU that was          greater thanthe overall median duration of stay of           days            P   and forpatients who had          more than two SCU admissions during their          hospitalization           P   However multivariate          analysis of these variablessuggested that only a median          total postoperative duration of stay in the SCU ofgreater          than the median total duration of stay of  days was an          independentpredictor of postoperative mortality            P   Postoperativemortality          did not depend on the total postoperative duration of          stay or on thenumber of times a patient was taken to the          operating room          Preoperative and intraoperative variables were          analyzed Table as potential predictors of postoperative          mortalityamong patients admitted to the SCU A history of          viral hepatitis           P   was determined to be          significantly associated withpostoperative mortality          among patients admitted to the SCU by univariateanalysis          By univariate analysis the association of history          ofcirrhosisportal hypertension with postoperative          mortality was determined toapproach statistical          significance            P   among patients admitted          tothe SCU Multivariate analysis of those two variables          revealed that neither ahistory of viral hepatitis and a          history of cirrhosisportal hypertension wasan          independent predictor of postoperative mortality among          patients admitted tothe SCU          Preoperative and postoperative laboratory values          meanstandard

patient with postoperativepneumonia            P   hepatic failure            P   orrespiratory failure                     P   was statistically more          likely to diethan patients with other complications          However multivariate analysis of thesethree          postoperative complications failed to disclose any          independent predictorof postoperative mortality                            Discussion        There is relatively incomplete information available        within the literature as to the causes and outcomes of        utilization of critical care services for patients        undergoing hepatobiliary surgery In the present paper we        have reviewed the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center        experience during the period of February   to        December   Firstly this study was initiated to        help to determine the causes of major morbidity and        mortality after hepatobiliary surgery such that we might        alter our patient care in order to avoid similar        complications in the future Secondly this study was        initiated to help to evaluate possible predictors of        survival once a major complication had arisen such that        guidance could be given to clinicians caring for such        patients in determining the likelihood of ultimate survival        of such events        Over a month period  of patients operated upon        by the Hepatobiliary Surgical Service at Memorial        SloanKettering Cancer Center required critical care        services Information on similar critical care services        utilized by comparable hepatobiliary services at other        institutions is not available in the surgical literature        however this appears to be an appropriate level of care        because the mortality of patients treated postoperatively        with floor care alone was only  five out of         patients The fact that the mortality of hepatobiliary        patients once admitted to the SCU was   out of         patients may be taken to suggest that patients might have        been kept for inappropriately long periods on floor care        before being admitted to a critical care setting or that        the problems that arose were poorly treated in the critical        care setting or that the problems that arose were beyond        the ability of critical care medicine to salvage The        latter explanation seems to be the most probable        The causes for admission to a critical care setting were        varied Three findings from the present results appear to        be worth further discussing however First more than         of the patients requiring a SCU admission suffered        respiratory failure It is possible that instituting an        improved preoperative evaluation of pulmonary function as        well as instituting a pulmonary rehabilitation program        might help to reduce this excessive rate of respiratory        failure Second the intraoperative blood loss among        patients requiring a SCU admission was approximately cm        and the intraoperative blood transfusion requirement among        patients requiring a SCU admission was  units of packed        red blood cells Both of these values are well above the        median values of  cm of intraoperative blood loss and        less than one unit of packed red blood cells for        intraoperative blood transfusion recorded for  patients        undergoing hepatic resection at our own institution          Third  out of  patients requiring a SCU admission        underwent preoperative biliary drainage procedures which        is above the rate for all patients undergoing hepatobiliary        surgery Our own institutional data have shown that        previously drained patients with tumors causing proximal or        distal obstruction of the biliary tree who undergo surgical        resection or surgical bypass suffer increased        intraoperative blood loss   as well as increased        postoperative infectious complications             Those organisms responsible for the postoperative        infectious complications were the same as those organisms        isolated from intraoperative bile cultures             This suggests that the potential benefit of        preoperative drainage of the biliary tree before surgical        resection is questionable and needs to be evaluated        further        On univariate analysis we found an association of a        history of viral hepatitis with postoperative mortality          P   and a near association of        a history of cirrhosis with or without portal        hypertension with postoperative mortality          P   These findings confirm        the prior reports of Bozzetti         et al   and Lehnert and Herfarth          Likewise we found that preoperative prothrombin time        was significantly          P   higher in the nonsurviving        patients versus the surviving patients who required        postoperative critical care utilization and preoperative        albumin was nearly significantly          P   lower in the nonsurviving        patients versus the surviving patients who required        postoperative critical care utilization These findings        confirm the prior reports of Nagino         et al   Su         et al   and Lehnert and Herfarth          Although these associations were not independent        predictors of postoperative mortality on multivariate        analysis these associations suggest the importance of        hepatic function and hepatic reserve in preoperative        patient selection for hepatobiliary surgery as has been        previously established by the ChildTurcottePugh grading        system for severity of liver disease    None of the        thirtytwo patients requiring postoperative SCU admission        had ascites or were encephalopathic preoperatively        Therefore preoperative prothrombin time and preoperative        albumin as well as a history of viral hepatitis andor a        history of cirrhosis with or without portal hypertension        may be taken to indicate a need for heightened alertness to        the possibility of the need for critical care services        after significant hepatobiliary surgery        Once admitted to the critical care unit postoperative        mortality increased with increasing duration of stay with        patients whose SCU stays exceeded  days doing        significantly worse Beyond this association of survival        and duration of SCU stay we were unable to establish any        distinct individual markers to help determine the        appropriateness of continuing aggressive care of critically        ill patients However if markers could be identified then        the determination of the time at which aggressive critical        care becomes futile could be established This would        ultimately better assist the critical care staff in        advising the patient or proxy as to when survival is        unlikely and all subsequent decisions about pursuing        further aggressive interventions could be made with this in        mind
