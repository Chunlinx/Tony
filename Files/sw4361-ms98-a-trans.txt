        so what do you think   okay well thats a pretty loaded topic  well here in um   absolutely   hang on just a second the dog is barking       okay here in Oklahoma we just went through a uh major educational reform were uh that was a hot topic   uhhuh   uh part of the problem had been there wasnt enough spent on education the classes were too large   uhhuh   and we recently well were were through a proposition now where theyre limiting class size to about twenty two i think and theyve increased salaries and just done a major revision   umhum yeah are your um schools paid for primarily with your real estate tax   yes yeah its just about all   yeah what for a typical middle class house uh what kind of annual tax do you pay   oh well actually the actually it isnt just  i i said yes and it really isnt we   well i know its split federal and so forth   we also well no we have a uh an excise tax on cars our car tags are very expensive average taxes are very low on real estate probably in the five to six hundred dollar a year range   uhhuh umhum they are oh okay okay because um over here um you could pay between four and eight thousand dollars a year   right   and um id be surprised if were getting something that was ten times as good as what youre getting   yeah   matter of fact ill bet its not as good   right   um my feeling is that there you know while there are certain problems where you know being able to buy a new set of books or a new piece of equipment may be valuable by and large that correlation between the amount of money you shovel in and the quality of education doesnt seem to be that strong   yeah i i do have to tend to agree with you the only other problem with that is that its difficult to attract people into the teaching profession   well again i dont know what its like on your side of the fence um over here   hm   um teachers salaries arent bad uh theyre not executive type salaries although if youre a teacher whose been at it for fifteen twenty years uh you can retire  when you when you reach the top level its not bad at all its quite good   yeah yeah i think thats thats the other thing here the benefits are  very good for teachers where   um yeah thing is there are nonfinancial there there should be nonfinancial benefits to teaching that i think weve managed to squash out of the system um it used to be thirty years ago being a teacher was a uh position of respect you were educating the young   right   um now it seems that you know now the the joke of the year is you know those who cant teach   right   and um you know so something went wrong somewhere along the line and i think its felt both by the people in the educational profession and those outside theres a wonderful book by a fellow named Charles Murray called In Pursuit of Happiness   umhum   and he discusses what he feels is wrong with the educational system and um he even offers some suggestions for improvements uh one of the points he makes is he feels that any attempt to fix the problems uh whatever the nature of the reform is the administration of the reform will be captured by the union and rendered ineffective   yeah   in other words if you decide that youre gonna pump another ten percent money in itll right eventually filter down it filters its way around to the most firmly entrenched teachers with no regard to their skill level um if you provide other benefits theyll eventually work their way around to more firmly entrench the problems not to resolve them im not sure i agree with him completely but he makes some interesting points   yeah that does i i think though you hit the the nail on the head  when you when you said its the attitude more than anything of the teacher profession the teaching profession um   umhum yeah   and that thats something you really cant change even with money   well it did change the thing to do is find out uh why um because uh you know there was a time when the teacher was a respected individual and something changed um and intrinsically intrinsically the ideas you know um training our   umhum   the youth of the country to be uh mature productive responsible citizens is potentially a uh a very um whats the right word um its potentially a very rewarding not rewarding but uh it should be a respected profession so the question about asking is not why does no  why isnt it but well it should be whats preventing it from being respected   yeah right right its a its a pretty big responsibility i mean to to teach   now absolutely absolutely i have a wife who substitute teaches and um she brings home some interesting stories uh but the thing that you know i i hate falling into the trap of back when i was a kid   umhum   uh im just saying that but the thing that changed is   yeah   um back when i was a kid you know maybe hated the teacher maybe you didnt do your work but you respected or at least feared the teacher
