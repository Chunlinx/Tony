Le Soir of Brussels said Thursday in an editorial thatthe king of the Belgians is the incarnation of a unifying morality and ofproclaimed virtue He presides over what Belgians regard as the ideal family even the incarnation of the family But the paper concluded that if theking casts more light on the matter he has so far refused to comment thelongterm consequence might be no more than to make him seem more like anordinary mortal Another leading Belgian paper La Meuse  expressedregret that the last symbol of a united Belgium is sinking into thebedclothes but in general the press was less condemnatory of the kingsadultery than of the intrusion into his private life Because of this LaLibre refused to publish the name of his illegitimate daughter DelphineBoel            TheTimes ofLondon

twice in defiance ofGovernment policy It reported that the exiled Tibetan leader paid a privatevisit to the princes English country estate five months ago            In aneditorial the Daily Telegraph
