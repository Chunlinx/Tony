                                 Stuff and Nonsense                         Sometimes arts just notenough Theres a new fashion in museum exhibitions Accessorize Were seeingfewer shows like the Cezanne retrospective at the Philadelphia Museum of Art whichmerely assemble great pictures unembellished by catchy themes relatedobjects documentary materials or voluminous explanatory texts Todayscurators increasingly feel the itch to interpret not only with words but withobjects and illustrations that explain the art and give it context            A few recent examples            The Metropolitan Museum ofArts RembrandtNot Rembrandt displaying drawing materials and printmakingtools of the type used by Rembrandt as well as photos and bios of Rembrandtscholars and radiographs showing the underpainting in real Rembrandts andRembrandt wannabes            The Mets and Boston Museumof Fine Arts John Singleton Copley in America at the Milwaukee Art Museumthrough Aug  intersperses the art

preRevolutionary Boston and New York            The Florida InternationalMuseums Splendors of Ancient Egypt through July  recreating apharaohs burial chamber and providing a taste of the actual Karnakexperienceusing mirrors and two dozen massive columns to completely surroundthe visitor with the magnificence of the temple To add an authentic deserttouch real sand was dumped on the floor along one wall            People used to visit artmuseums to look at art Great paintings on the walls superb sculptures ontheir pedestalswhat more could you ask The thirst for detailed informationon the arts significance or the artists life and times was best slaked beforeor after Outside intervention just interfered with the intimate communicationbetween artwork and art lover            Not anymore From the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Mississippi Arts Paviliontheres a growing sense that art cant communicate on its own A newbuzzwordinterpretive designmeans that art exhibitions must be laden withtext and context Curators divert us from art with an array of relatedartifacts or documents from the period as if too much aesthetic concentrationmight tax our attention span The creative process itself is demystifiedthrough displays of artists working tools and illustrations of artistictechnique as in the National Gallery of Arts Winslow Homershow The show has traveled to the Met where it will stay until Sept without these supplementary materials            Is there a problem here Not if you think an art museumshould be like a history museum treating art as a cultural artifact thatillustrates the story of a particular person period and place But for thoseof us who cherish art for arts sake gussying it up with photos paintsamples and teapots merely trivializes and distracts            The trendtoward interpretive installation aimed at broadening arts appeal by expandingpublic understanding paralleled the transformation of museumgoing fromserious cultural pursuit to highbrow entertainment Efforts to make informationabout art as well as art itself more accessible were strongly encouraged byfunding policies of the National Endowment for the Humanities NEHsupportedexhibitions were distinguished by their elaborate wall panelseducationalmaps photomurals stenciled treatiseswhich competed with the objectsthemselves for space and attention One early critic of this trend ShermanLee then director of the Cleveland Museum of Art complained  years ago thatNEH tends to lose sight of the fundamental purpose of an art exhibition whichis not to illustrate history but to allow an art work to be understood andenjoyed as a work of art            Next came the burble of taped audio guidesfilling our heads with instructions on what to see and think while inhibitingpersonal response This also suppressed civilized conversation with ourcompanions who were similarly encased in electronic earmuffs The latest audioguides have gone Hollywood and digital Art authorities electronically beamedup by recent museumgoers include Leonard Nimoy Steve Martin Charlton Hestonand Morgan Freeman The newest curatorsinyourpocket are lightweight CDROMbased systems on which visitors can punch in the numbers on wall labelsaccessing commentary on whatever interests them            People enjoy thesecybertoys Some exhibitions where visitors tote around the latest electronicgadgetry are beginning to resemble cellularphoneusers conventions Peoplealso enjoy shows that make them feel they are not just gazing at the productsof a distant culture but for a brief time are actually a part of that milieuroaming about an Egyptian pyramid a Chinese tomb or a Russian palace Suchcultural tourism has become the specialty of a new breed of instamuseum builtsolely to imbue foreign masterpieces with glitz and mystique In addition tothe Florida International Museum other such blockbuster mills include theWonders exhibition series in Memphis and the Mississippi Arts Pavilion inJackson Before the opening of the Palaces of St Petersburg exhibitionthrough Aug  Russian and American artisans painstakingly transformed theMississippi Arts Pavilion into lavishly appointed rooms adapted from the homesof the czars fitted out with authentic paintings and furnishings            Virtualreality exhibitionsgo one step further They attempt to create the youarethere sensation withoutthe objects The Getty Conservation Institute in California recently sponsoreda virtualreality recreation of Queen Nefertaris tomb in Egypt which purportsto let cyberexplorers look at the yearold wall paintings  withoutfear of damaging the fragile artwork This cartoonish cultural video game cannow be navigated at the Guggenheim Museum SoHo and perhaps more fittingly atEpcot Center in Disney World Virtual Pompeii recently had a glitchriddenrun at the MH de Young Museum San Francisco and a new company AtlanticNetworks plans to work with major museums to produce a Great Civilizationsseries which will display the finest archaeological works of art togetherwith reconstructions and virtual reality visits to ancient sites            All of this surely will drawthe curious hoards a benefit that few museums can ignore given theunreliability of outside funding sources Museums must rely increasingly onselfgenerated incomethe kind that comes from admissions membershipsrestaurants and shops But as the seductive trappings gain prominencesomething else is obscured Its the art
