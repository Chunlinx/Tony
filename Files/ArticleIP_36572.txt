political the less overt its politics paceBrecht            Now given the emotional and criticalpersuasiveness of both positions the question of how one might produce artadequate to the Holocaust is fraught with incommensurability How can art beboth authentically free and at the same time totalize the experience ofgenocide            And so Grass like Michel Tournier in TheOgre and DM Thomas in The White Hotel                charts an obliquecourse as far as historical engagement is concerned though Thomas cuts loosein his shocking denouement            If this is as far as Grass is concerned a moralfailure of literary process then Ms Shulevitz and a notably resentful JacobHeilbrunn in the Wall Street Journal  need to make sense of theircriticism by showing how art can measure

opening that Timothy Noah quotes            Heres what I noticed about the NY Timesarticle It neglected to mention a principal source of RNs frustration aboutthe Jewish community which is plenty clear in our analysis and the tapesthemselves Many of the same folks who wanted the US to support Israelagainst her aggressive foreign enemies did not particularly want the US tosupport South Vietnam against hers            Do you or do you not believe this is a legitimatereason for a commanderinchief in the middle of a war he inherited to befrustrated particularly when he was still signing  letters a week to thefamilies of KIA Add that to the fact that hed gotten about  of the Jewishvote in  and what you have is a politician and a President who basicallyviewed the Jewish community as predominantly liberal Democratic and antiwarHe didnt just think they were against him they were against him            And thats fine Blocs of ethnic or religiousvoters are frequently against certain politicians and maybe all thosepoliticians get frustrated about it Thats fine tooexcept when itscaptured on tape But heres the bottom line Words are words and actions areactions When RN says Jews on the tapes I hear damn liberals and Iunderstand it This is why the points that he saved Israel in  and that hisinner circle included Kissinger Stein Safire and Garment are more thanaspects of a some of my best friends  defense These colleagues werepolitically simpatico And this was a politician Its not complicated Alsofind the tape in the new batch where he talks about how impressed he was aftera meeting with Arlen Specterthen I believe a tough young prosecutor fromPennsylvania            Anyway back to the NYT omission In awhole article about RN and Jews why leave out the bit about Vietnam andIsrael Doesnt he have the right to have the most immediate source of hisfrustration even mentioned Does the NYT want people to think thesefeelings sprang from him totally unprovoked            Heres what I think Were all still tiptoeingaround the Vietnam War We postVietnam elites all tend to think that Ellsbergwas a great hero and that the war was immoral We all tend to think that it wasokay to be for Israelis freedom from aggression but to be indifferent towardthat of South Vietnamese And so we still scapegoat RN for all the sins of theera to avoid having to ask tough questions about what really happened toIndochina and to America when Hanoi and the Khmer Rouge were permitted tohave their way with people whom wed pledged to protect and almost succeededin protecting Check out

posted late yesterday about theBible code would not have been published if your reporter or your editors hadtaken the time to check out the facts            As author of The Bible Code  Ive spentthe past seven years checking out all the claims and counterclaims Here aretwo basic facts your article ignores            a The data for the original Bible code experimentwere chosen by an independent scholar Dr Shlomo Havlin of BarIlanUniversity who did not know how the data would affect the outcome of theexperiment That alone absolutely refutes the new accusation that the data weretuned or fitted to the tests            b The original Bible code experiment wasreplicated by an American codebreaker Harold Gans for more than  years asenior National Security Agency cryptoanalyst He not only redid theexperiment from scratch but also confirmed the code using entirely newdata            That alone absolutely refutes the new claim thatthe results of the Israeli experiment cant be replicated I understand yourreporters false relief in not having to believe in the Bible code any longerIm also secular            But this new attack by the same old critics doesnot let Wittes off the hook He in fact has done what he accuses those whobelieve in the code of doinghe has taken on faith the false claims of thecritics            Had he actually checked the facts he would knowthe critics have not solved the Bible code puzzlethey told a lie            They knew that the esteemed scholar who chose thedata had stated in writing that he did not know how the data would affect theexperiment They knew that the NSA codebreaker had publicly confirmed that hereplicated the experiment These critics even lied about the results of theirown experimentswhich did not debunk the Bible code            In fact the critics first experiment confirmedthe Bible code So they ran a second experiment rigged to fail and then hidthe positive results of their first experiment by lumping them together withthe fixed experiment            All of us who are not religious think we know thatthe Bible code simply cannot be real When I first heard about it that was myentire replyIm not religious            But then I learned Hebrew obtained a copy of thecomputer program used by the worldclass mathematician who discovered the codeand worked with it myself every day for years And then I found in the code awarning that Yitzhak Rabin would be assassinated and told the PrimeMinistera year before he was killed            I still dont believe in God Im still notreligious But I can assure you that the code is real Your reporter perhapstoo quickly too easily embraced the Bible codeand has now like many adisappointed convert too quickly too easily embraced the critics            Im surprised that you and

are discussed atlength in the rebuttal paper In fact the central point of that paper as Inoted in the article is that the criteria Prof Havlin applied in creating hislist of appellations was insufficiently welldefined before the dataset wasassembled to be scientifically valuable Far from ignoring this I described itas the core of the critique            While my article does not discuss Mr Gansexperiments that is chiefly because they were never published in a prestigiouspeerreviewed journal to begin with The fairminded reader will agree that theMcKay paper devastates the Gans experiments completely            It is also false to say that I ever embraced theBible Code or am now a disappointed convert Rather I always believedandstill dothat the codes would if demonstrated to be real propel ascientifically minded person towards Orthodox Judaism I have at the sametime also always believed they would ultimately be debunked Hence they didnot change my religious convictions at all though they shook them            Consider by contrast Drosnin whose workconstitutes the least scientific and most intellectually shallow end of theTorah codes discussion He regards the codes as a proven fact yet somehowstill professes nonbelief How is it possible that such a futurepredictingcode embedded in such an impenetrable form in an ancient document could be thework of something less than God How can one believe in the codes and not inGod            It is not McKay and his coauthors who told alie That dishonor rather belongs to Drosnin himself for publishing a workthat grossly
