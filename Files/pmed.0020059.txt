                    Introduction        The World Trade Center and anthrax terrorist attacks in  as well as the recent West        Nile virus and SARS outbreaks have motivated many public health departments to develop        early disease outbreak detection systems using nondiagnostic information often derived        from electronic data collected for other purposes syndromic surveillance         These include systems that monitor the number        of emergency department visits primary care visits ambulance dispatches nurse hot line        calls pharmaceutical sales and West Nilerelated dead bird reports The establishment of        such systems involves many challenges in data collection analytical methods signal        interpretation and response Important analytical challenges include dealing with the        unknown time place and size of an outbreak detecting an outbreak as early as possible        adjusting for natural temporal and geographical variation and dealing with the lack of        suitable populationatrisk data        Most analytical methods in use for the early detection of disease outbreaks are purely        temporal in nature  These methods are useful for detecting outbreaks that        simultaneously affect all parts of the geographical region under surveillance but may be        late at detecting outbreaks that start locally While purely temporal methods can be used        in parallel for overlapping areas of different sizes in order to cover all possible        outbreaks that approach leads to a severe problem of multiple testing generating many        more false signals than the nominal statistical significance level would indicate        First studied by Naus  the scan statistic is an elegant way to solve problems of        multiple testing when there are closely overlapping spatial areas andor time intervals        being evaluated Temporal spatial and spacetime scan statistics  are now        commonly used for disease cluster detection and evaluation for a wide variety of diseases        including cancer  CreutzfeldtJakob disease  granulocytic ehrlichiosis         sclerosis  and diabetes  The basic idea is that there is a scanning window that        moves across space andor time For each location and size of the window the number of        observed and expected cases is counted Among these the most unusual excess of observed        cases is noted The statistical significance of this cluster is then evaluated taking into        account the multiple testing stemming from the many potential cluster locations and sizes        evaluated        To date all scan statistics require either a uniform population at risk a control        group or other data that provide information about the geographical and temporal        distribution of the underlying population at risk Census population numbers are useful as        a denominator for cancer birth defects and other registry data where the expected number        of cases can be accurately estimated based on the underlying population They are less        relevant for surveillance data such as emergency department visits and pharmacy sales        since the catchment area for each hospitalpharmacy is undefined Even if it were        available the catchment area population would not be a good denominator since there can be        significant natural geographical variation in healthcare utilization data due to        disparities in disease prevalence access to health care and consumer behavior  One        option when evaluating data that are affected by utilization behavior is to use total        volume as the denominator For example one may use total emergency department visits as a        denominator when evaluating diarrhea visits  or similarly all pharmacy sales as the        denominator when evaluating diarrhea medication sales  This may or may not work        depending on the nature of the data For example changes in total drug sales due to sales        promotions or the allergy season could hide a true signal or create a false signal for the        drug category of interest        In this paper we present a prospective spacetime permutation scan statistic that does        not require populationatrisk data and which can be used for the early detection of        disease outbreaks when only the number of cases is available The method can be used        prospectively to regularly scan a geographical region for outbreaks of any location and any        size For each location and size it looks at potential oneday as well as multiday        outbreaks in order to quickly detect a rapidly rising outbreak and still have power to        detect a slowly emerging outbreak by combining information from multiple days        The spacetime permutation scan statistic was gradually developed as part of the New        York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene DOHMH surveillance initiatives in        parallel with the adaptation of populationatriskbased scan statistics for dead bird        reports for West Nile virus  emergency department visits  ambulance dispatch        calls  pharmacy sales  and student absentee records  In this methodological        paper the spacetime permutation scan statistic is presented and illustrated using        emergency department visits for diarrhea respiratory and feverflulike illnesses                    Methods                  New York City Emergency Department Syndromic Surveillance System          The New York City Emergency Department syndromic surveillance system is described in          detail elsewhere  In brief participating hospitals transmit electronic files to the          DOHMH seven days per week Files contain data for all emergency department patient visits          on the previous day including the time of visit patient age gender home zip code and          chief complainta freetext field that captures the patients own description of their          illness As of November   of New York Citys  emergency departments were          participating in the system covering an estimated  of emergency department visits in          the city          Data are verified for completeness and accuracy concatenated into a single dataset          and appended to a master archive using SAS  To categorize visits into syndromes          eg diarrhea syndrome a computer algorithm searches the freetext chief complaint          field for character strings indicating symptoms consistent with that syndrome          The goal of data analysis which is carried out seven days per week is to detect          unusual increases in key syndrome categories To run the spacetime permutation scan          statistic we have written a SAS program that generates the necessary case and parameter          files invokes the SaTScan software  and reads the results back into SAS for          reporting and display          Two sets of analyses are performed one based on assigning each individual to the          coordinates of their residential zip code and the other based on their hospital address          With  zip codes versus  hospitals the former utilizes more detailed geographical          information while the latter may be able to pick up outbreaks not only related to place          of residence but also to place of work or other outside activities if people go to the          nearest hospital when they feel sick Residential zip code is not recorded by the          hospital for about  of patients and for the analyses described here these individuals          are only included in the hospitalbased analyses          The performance of the prospective spacetime permutation scan statistic was evaluated          using both hospital and residential analyses We used historical diarrhea data to mimic a          prospective surveillance system with daily analyses from  November  to  November           For each of these days the analysis only used data prior to and including the day          in question ignoring all data from subsequent days This corresponds to the actual data          available at the DOHMH  h after the end of that day when that analysis would have          been conducted if the system has been in place at that time We also present one week of          daily prospective analyses conducted in November  where the daily analysis was run          about  h after the conclusion of each day as part of the regular syndromic          surveillance activities at the DOHMH                          The SpaceTime Permutation Scan Statistic          As with the Poisson and Bernoullibased prospective spacetime scan statistics           the spacetime permutation scan statistic utilizes thousands or millions of overlapping          cylinders to define the scanning window each being a possible candidate for an outbreak          The circular base represents the geographical area of the potential outbreak A typical          approach is to first iterate over a finite number geographical grid points and then          gradually increase the circle radius from zero to some maximum value defined by the user          iterating over the zip codes in the order in which they enter the circle In this way          both small and large circles are considered all of which overlap with many other          circles The height of the cylinder represents the number of days with the requirement          that the last day is always included together with a variable number of preceding days          up to some maximum defined by the user For example we may consider all cylinders with a          height of       or  d For each center and radius of the circular cylinder          base the method iterates over all possible temporal cylinder lengths This means that we          will evaluate cylinders that are geographically large and temporally short forming a          flat disk those that are geographically small and temporally long forming a pole and          every other combination in between          What is new with the spacetime permutation scan statistic is the probability model          Since we do not have populationatrisk data the expected must be calculated using only          the cases Suppose we have daily case counts for zipcode areas where           c          zd is the observed number of cases in zipcode area           z during day           d  The total number of observed cases           C  is                    For each zip code and day we calculate the expected number of cases                       zd          conditioning on the observed marginals                    In words this is the proportion of all cases that occurred in zipcode area           z times the total number of cases during day           d  The expected number of cases                       A          in a particular cylinder           A is the summation of these expectations over all the zipcodedays          within that cylinder                    The underlying assumption when calculating these expected numbers is that the          probability of a case being in zipcode area           z given that it was observed on day           d is the same for all days           d           Let           c          A be the observed number of cases in the cylinder Conditioned on          the marginals and when there is no spacetime interaction           c          A is distributed according to the hypergeometric distribution          with mean                       A          and probability function                    When both                       z                    A          c          zd and                       d                    A          c          zd are small compared to           C c          A is approximately Poisson distributed with mean                       A           Based on this approximation we use the Poisson generalized likelihood ratio          GLR as a measure of the evidence that cylinder           A contains an outbreak                    In words this is the observed divided by the expected to the power of the observed          inside the cylinder multiplied by the observed divided by the expected to the power of          the observed outside the cylinder Among the many cylinders evaluated the one with the          maximum GLR constitutes the spacetime cluster of cases that is least likely to be a          chance occurrence and hence is the primary candidate for a true outbreak One reason          for using the Poisson approximation is that it is much easier to work with this          distribution than the hypergeometric when adjusting for space by dayofweek interaction          see below as the sum of Poisson distributions is still a Poisson distribution          Since we are evaluating a huge number of outbreak locations sizes and time lengths          there is serious multiple testing that we need to adjust for Since we do not have          populationatrisk data this cannot be done in any of the usual ways for scan          statistics Instead it is done by creating a large number of random permutations of the          spatial and temporal attributes of each case in the dataset That is we shuffle the          datestimes and assign them to the original set of case locations ensuring that both the          spatial and temporal marginals are unchanged After that the most likely cluster is          calculated for each simulated dataset in exactly the same way as for the real data          Statistical significance is evaluated using Monte Carlo hypothesis testing  If for          example the maximum GLR is calculated from  simulated datasets and the maximum GLR          for the real data is higher than the th highest then that cluster is statistically          significant at the  level In general terms the           p value is           p            R           S   where           R is the rank of the maximum GLR from the real dataset and           S is the number of simulated datasets  In addition to           p values we also report null occurrence rates  such as once every           d or once every  mo The null occurrence rate is the expected time between seeing an          outbreak signal with an equal or higher GLR assuming that the null hypothesis is true          For daily analyses it is defined as once every           p d For example under the null hypothesis we would at the  level          on average expect one false alarm every  d for each syndrome under surveillance          Because of the Monte Carlo hypothesis testing the method is computer intensive To          facilitate the use of the methods by local state and federal health departments the          spacetime permutation scan statistic has been implemented as a feature in the free and          public domain SaTScan software                           Implementation for New York City Syndromic Surveillance          Depending on the application the method may be used with different parameter          settings For the syndromic surveillance analyses we set the upper limit on the          geographical size of the outbreak to be a circle with a km radius and the maximum          temporal length to be  d This means that we are evaluating outbreaks with a circle          radius size anywhere between  km one zip code only and  km and a time length          cylinder height of  to  d The latter restriction is a reflection of the belief that          the main purpose of this syndromic surveillance system is early disease outbreak          detection and if the outbreak has existed for over  wk it is more likely to be picked          up by reporting of specific disease diagnoses by clinicians or laboratories          Another practical choice is the total number of days to include in the analysis One          option is to include all previous days for which data are available We chose instead to          analyze the last  d of data adding one day and removing another for each daily          analysis We believe this time frame provides enough baseline beyond the  to d          scanning window to establish the usual pattern of visits while avoiding inclusion of data          that may no longer be relevant to the current period          To reduce the computational load we limited the centers of the circular cylinder          bases to be a collection of  zipcode area centroids and hospital locations in New          York City and adjacent areas This ensures among other things that each zipcode area          may constitute an outbreak on its own          The last parameter that we need to set is the number of Monte Carlo replications used          for each analysis For the daily prospective analyses we chose  which meant that the          smallest           p value we could get was  so that the smallest null occurrence          rate possible for a signal was once every  y In our system signals of that strength          clearly merit investigation For the historical evaluation in order to obtain more          precise null occurrence rates we set the number of replications to                           Adjusting for Space by DayofWeek Interaction          The spacetime permutation scan statistic automatically adjusts for any purely spatial          and purely temporal variation For many syndromic surveillance data sources there is          also natural space by dayofweek interaction in the data that is not due to a disease          outbreak but to consumer behavior store hours etc For example if a particular          pharmacy has an exceptionally high number of sales on Sundays because neighboring          pharmacies are closed we might get a signal for this pharmacy every Sunday unless we          adjust for this space by dayofweek interaction This can be done through a stratified          random permutation procedure          The first step is to stratify the data by day of week Monday Tuesday Sunday The          spacetime permutation randomization step is then done separately for each day of the          week For each zip code and day combination the expected is then calculated using only          data from that day of the week For each cylinder both the observed and expected number          of cases is summed over all dayofweek strata zip code and day combinations within          that cylinder The same technique can be used to adjust for other types of spacetime          interaction The underlying assumption when calculating these expected numbers is now          that the probability of a case being in zipcode area           z given that it was observed on a Monday is the same for all Mondays          etc          All our analyses were adjusted for space by dayofweek interaction                          Missing Data          Daily disease surveillance systems require rapid transmission of data and it may not          be possible to get complete data from each provider every single day When we first tried          the new method in New York City a number of highly significant outbreak signals were          generated that were artifacts of previously unrecognized missing or incomplete data from          one or more hospitals This is a good reflection on the method since it should be able          to detect abnormalities in the data no matter what their cause but it also illustrates          the importance of accounting for missing data in order to create an early detection          system that is useful on a practical level          Depending on the exact nature of the missing data there are different ways to handle          it We used a combination of three different approaches  If a hospital had missing          data for all of the past  d all possible days within the cylinder we completely          removed that hospital from the analysis including all previous  d  If a hospital          had no missing data during the last  d but one or more missing days during the previous           baseline days then we completely removed the baseline days with some missing data          for all of the hospitals  If a hospital had missing data for at least one but not all          of the last  d then we removed those missing days together with all previous days for          the same hospital and the same day of week That is if Monday was missing during the          last week then we removed all Mondays for that hospital This removal introduces          artificial space by dayofweek interaction so this approach only works if it is          implemented in conjunction with the stratified adjustment for space by dayofweek          interaction          For some analyses more than one of these approaches were used simultaneously Note          that since the missing data depend on the hospital the solution is to remove specific          hospitals and days rather than zip codes and days even when we are doing the          zipcodebased residential analyses If there are many hospitals with missing data then          the second approach could potentially remove all or almost all of the baseline days To          avoid this one could sometimes go further back in time and add the same number of          earlier days to compensate Another option is to impute into the cells with missing data          a Poisson random number of cases generated under the null hypothesis Given the          completeness of our data neither of these methods were employed  of analyses were          conducted with four or fewer baseline days removed                            Results                  Evaluation Using Historical Data Diarrhea Surveillance          We first tested the new method by mimicking daily prospective analyses of hospital          emergency department data from  Nov  to  Nov  looking at diarrhea visits          Signals with           p              are listed in Table  and depicted on the map in Figure  That          is we only list those signals with a null occurrence rate of once every year or less          often          For the residential zipcode analyses there were two such signals For the hospital          analyses there were six two of which occurred in the same place on consecutive days It          is worth noting that at the false alarm rate chosen none of the residential signals          correspond to any of the hospital signals          For the residential analysis the strongest signal was on  February  covering           zipcode areas in southern Bronx and northern Manhattan This signal had  cases          observed over  d when  were expected relative risk   With a null occurrence          rate of once every  y a spike in cases of this magnitude is unlikely to be due to          random variation The signal immediately preceded a sharp increase in citywide diarrheal          visits from  February to  March Figure  In both the localized  February cluster          and the citywide outbreak the increase was most notable among children less than  y of          age The weaker  February hospital signal and the  March residential signal that were          centered in northern Manhattan occurred at the peak of this citywide outbreak Laboratory          investigation of the citywide increase in diarrheal activity indicated the rotavirus as          the most likely causative agent          The two hospital signals on  November and  November  were at the same three          hospitals in southern Bronx and northern Manhattan with null occurrence rates of  and           y respectively These signals immediately preceded another sharp increase in          citywide diarrheal activity this time among individuals of all ages Figure  This          citywide outbreak lasted approximately  wk and coincided with a number of institutional          outbreaks in nursing homes and on cruise ships Laboratory investigation of several of          these outbreaks revealed the norovirus as the most likely causative agent A similar          citywide outbreak of norovirus in  began shortly before the  November  hospital          signal in northern Bronx which had a null occurrence rate of once every  y          For the hospital analyses the strongest signal was a d cluster at a single hospital          in Queens on  January  with ten diarrhea cases when only  were expected which          one would only expect to happen once every  y Being very local in both time and          space it is different from the previously described signals preceding citywide          outbreaks While examination of individuallevel data revealed a predominance of infants          under the age of two this cluster could not be associated with any known outbreak and          retrospective investigation was not feasible          As shown in Table  at the           p   threshold there were six and two signals for the hospital          and residential analyses respectively compared to one expected in each Figure  shows          the number of days on which the           p value of the most likely cluster was within a given range Had the          null hypothesis been true on all  d analyzed the           p values would have been uniformly distributed between zero and one          The fact that in our data there were more days with low rather than high           p values is an indication that there may be additional true          outbreaks that are indistinguishable from random noise These could be very small          disease outbreaks for example due to spoiled food eaten by only a few people or they          could be artifacts caused by for example changes in the hours of operation at an          emergency department or coding differences between the emergency department triage          nurses                          Daily Prospective Surveillance          Since  November  the spacetime permutation scan statistic has been used daily          in parallel with the populationatriskbased spacetime scan statistics  as part of          the DOHMH Emergency Department surveillance system For respiratory symptoms feverflu          and diarrhea the results for the last week of November are listed in Tables  and  For          diarrhea or respiratory symptoms there were no strong signals warranting an          epidemiological investigation and all had null occurrence rates of more often than once          every month This reflects a very typical week          For feverflu there was a strong d hospital signal in southern Bronx and northern          Manhattan on  November with a null occurrence rate of once every  y On each of the          following  d there were again strong hospital signals in the same general area as well          as residential zipcode signals of lesser magnitude These signals started  d into a          gradual citywide increase in feverflu that continued to grow through the end of          December driven by an unusually early influenza season in New York City                            Discussion        In this paper we have presented a new method for prospective infectious disease outbreak        surveillance that uses only case data handles missing data and makes minimal assumptions        about the spatiotemporal characteristics of an outbreak When using historical emergency        department chief complaint data to mimic a prospective surveillance system with daily        analyses we detected four highly unusual clusters of diarrhea cases three of which        heralded citywide gastrointestinal outbreaks due to rotavirus and norovirus Three of four        weaker signals also occurred immediately preceding or concurrent with these citywide        outbreaks If we assume that all of these clusters were associated with the citywide        disease outbreaks then the method generated at most two false alarms at a signal threshold        where we would have expected one by chance alone        For disease outbreak detection the publichealth community has historically relied on        the watchful eyes of physicians and other healthcare workers However the increasing        availability of timely electronic surveillance data both reportable diagnoses and        prediagnostic syndromic indicators raises the possibility of earlier outbreak detection        and intervention if suitable analytic methods are found While it is still unclear whether        systematic health surveillance using syndromic or reportable disease data will be able to        quickly detect a bioterrorism attack  the methods described here can also be        applied to early detection of outbreaks of other more common infectious diseases        There are other alternative ways to calculate expected counts from a series of case        data One naive approach is to use the observed count  d ago in a zipcode area as the        expected count for that same area today and then apply the regular Poissonbased        spacetime scan statistic When applied to the New York City diarrhea data described above        such an approach generated at least one statistically significant outbreak signal on each        of the  d evaluated The basic problem with this is that there is random variation in        the observed counts that are used to calculate the expected which is not accounted for in        the Poissonbased scan statistic If we based the expected on the average of multiple prior        weeks of data we would get less variability in the expected counts and fewer false        signals but the problem would still persist and as the number of weeks increase beyond a        few months other problems may gradually arise due to for example seasonal trends or        population size changes        Computing time depends on the size of the dataset and the analysis parameters chosen        With  replications the hospital analyses with  data locations take  s to run on a        MHz Pentium  computer while the residential analyses using  zipcode area        locations take  s The same numbers for  replications are  and  s        respectively        There are a number of limitations with the proposed method The method is highly        sensitive to missing or incomplete data Our first implementation of the method resulted in        a number of false alarms and highlights the need for systematic data quality checks and        the analytic adjustments described above When excellent populationatrisk data are        available we expect the Poissonbased spacetime scan statistic that utilizes this extra        information to perform better than the spacetime permutation scan statistic If however        the populationatrisk data are of poor quality or nonexistent which is often the case        then the spacetime permutation scan statistic should be used        Since the spacetime permutation scan statistic adjusts for purely temporal clusters it        can only detect citywide outbreaks if they start locally but not if they occur more or        less simultaneously in the whole city Hence it does not replace purely temporal        surveillance methods but rather complements them        Finally it is important to note that the geographical boundary of the detected outbreak        is not necessarily the same as the boundary of the true outbreak Since we used circles as        the base for the scanning cylinder all detected outbreaks are approximately circular        Other shapes of the scanning window are also available  but it has been shown that        circular scan statistics are also able to detect noncircular outbreak areas  The less        geographically compact the outbreak is though the less power sensitivity there is to        detect it For example using circles we cannot expect to pick up an outbreak that is very        long and narrow such as a oneblock area on each side of Broadway stretching from southern        to northern Manhattan        The emergency department data used in this study also have some limitations In addition        to the citywide outbreaks there were several institutional gastrointestinal outbreaks        reported to DOHMH during the historical y period but not detected in emergency department        data using the spacetime permutation scan statistic One reported outbreak involved school        children that went to the emergency department of a nonparticipating hospital Other        outbreaks went undetected because medical care was not sought in emergency departments        Most people with diarrhea do not go to the hospital emergency department Rather they call        or go to their primary care physician they visit the pharmacy to buy overthecounter        medication or they may have symptoms that are so mild that they do not seek medical care        Further studies are needed to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different data        sources        The geographic units of analysis used were residential zip code and hospital location        It may be hard to detect outbreaks that affect only a small part of a single zip code        especially if the background rate of the syndrome is fairly high Where available the        exact coordinates of a patients residence can be used to avoid problems introduced when        aggregating data Furthermore some outbreaks may not be clustered by place of residence        as in the case of an exposure occurring at the place of work or in a subway Using the        location of the hospital rather than residence may provide higher power to detect        workplacerelated outbreaks but the only way to fully address this issue may be to conduct        workplace surveillance        In spite of these limitations we have presented a new method for the early detection of        disease outbreaks and illustrated its practical use The primary advantages of the method        are that it is easy to use it only requires case data it automatically adjusts for        naturally occurring purely spatial and purely temporal variation it allows adjustment for        space by dayofweek interaction and it is capable of handling missing data        While the method was developed and applied in the context of syndromic surveillance it        may also be used for the early detection of diagnosed disease outbreaks or for detecting        changes in the pattern of chronic diseases when population census information is        unavailable unreliable or not available at the fine geographical resolution needed The        ability to perform disease surveillance without populationatrisk data is especially        important in developing countries where these data may be hard to obtain The spacetime        permutation scan statistic could also be used for similar early detection problems in other        fields such as criminology ecology engineering social sciences and veterinary        sciences
