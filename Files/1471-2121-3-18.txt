                    Background        Metastasis of tumor cells is critically dependent on the        ability of cancer cells to adhere and migrate The cell        surface expressed integrins can control this process by        physically interacting with the extracellular matrix        proteins and other cell surface proteins on endothelial        cells lining the blood vessel wall     These integrins        signal adhesion and migration by communicating with several        tyrosine kinases inside the cell including the Focal        Adhesion Kinase FAK and Src family kinases      Src        kinases control the activation of FAK as well as the        tyrosine phosphorylation of critical substrates that        regulate adhesion and migration     Indeed colon        cancer cells with high metastatic potential have elevated        levels of Src activity or activating mutations in the Src        gene      One Src substrate that is involved in        regulating an important signaling node in this process is        the adaptor protein p         cas Cas         Cas        appears to play a central role in the transformation        process by several oncogenes including ras ornithine        decarboxylase ODC vSrc vcrk and BcrAbl as these        tumors all have elevated levels of tyrosine phosphorylated        Cas        Cells from mice that lack Cas have        much reduced migration and are resistant to transformation        by vSrc while expression of Cas antisense RNA in cells        transformed with ras vSrc or ODC result in reversion of        the transformed phenotype       Furthermore        increased expression of Cas can rescue cell migration and        adhesion in cells expressing the tumor suppressor PTEN and        can enhance cell migration and adhesion in normal cells        with a major role being played by the substrate domain                    Cas is a protein which migrates with an apparent mass of        approximately  kDa with a Nterminal SH domain a        central substrate domain SD with up to  tyrosines which        can be phosphorylated a Cterminal region with a        prolinerich region and two tyrosine phosphorylation sites        capable of binding Src kinases Src binding domain SBD             The latter SBD domain regulates the ability of Src        to activate the serum response element as well as in the        phosphorylation of the SD of Cas by Src       The        substrate domain controls adhesion and migration and the        majority of the tyrosines within this domain are of the        sequence YQXP  or YDXP  which when phosphorylated        bind to the adaptors ccrk nck and AND               The importance of these molecules in Cas function is        unclear however ccrk seems to be critical in the        regulation of adhesion and migration mediated by Cas In        addition the SH domain of Cas mediates an interaction        with FAK CG CMS and the zinc finger containing protein        CIZ while nephrocystin interacts with Cas via its SH        domain and proline rich sequences in Cas                  The SH domain of Cas can also interact with the        tyrosine phosphatase PTPB and expression of PTPB in        transformed cells reverts the phenotype in part by        dephosphorylating Cas             Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is regulated by        adhesion such that adherent and migrating cells have high        levels of tyrosine phosphorylated Cas whereas cells in        suspension have reduced levels of Cas phosphorylation             In addition as mentioned above transformed cells        that are able to grow in an anchorage independent manner        show increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas             These data suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas in        part regulates a switch from adhesion dependent growth to        adhesion independent growth Whether mere tyrosine        phosphorylation or localization of Cas is more important        for its regulation of adhesion and migration is unclear        Tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor molecules such as Cas        is dependent on upstream signals that lead to the        phosphorylation of the adaptor and with multiple pathways        leading from these upstream signals it is difficult to        tease out the events resulting from the phosphorylated        adaptor itself We have tried to address this problem by        constructing a chimeric Cas molecule SrcCasSD that is        phosphorylated independently of upstream signals by fusing        the SD of Cas to a Src kinase domain that had been        attenuated by mutating the activation tyrosine Y  to        phenylalanine Such a mutant is inactive against exogenous        substrates       We found that this SrcCasSD        molecule is constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated when        expressed either transiently or stably in cells and acts        as a dominant negative mutant attenuating vcrk mediated        transformation when expressed in cells transformed by this        oncogene We also observed a reduction in basal JNK        activity in normal cells expressing this chimera and in        vcrk mediated activation of JNK in cell expressing both        vcrk and the chimera By contrast tyrosine        phosphorylation of endogenous Cas and FAK was unaffected by        the Cas chimera indicating that these processes lie        upstream of the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD Finally we        show that this chimera can act as a decoy to selectively        disrupt signaling events downstream of the tyrosine        phosphorylated SD of endogenous Cas acting as a dominant        negative mutant We suggest that this approach and modified        versions of this approach can be a general method to        determine the role of tyrosine phosphorylated domains        without regard to upstream signals                    Results                  Creation of a dominantly tyrosine phosphorylated          Cas substrate domain          The adaptor protein Cas has a Nterminal SH domain a          large number of tyrosines that serve as potential kinase          substrates within its substrate domain and a Cterminal          Src binding domain Fig  Understanding the function          of this substrate domain and the tyrosines within it          could lead to a better understanding of the signaling          pathways regulated by this protein Previously          investigators have created dominant negative versions of          this protein lacking its substrate domain and shown that          it is required for cell adhesion and migration However          these studies depend on upstream signals and so it is not          clear which signals are directly emanating from the          substrate domain itself as this domain requires the          activation of upstream kinases for its phosphorylation          and function We have tried to address this problem by          attempting to create a dominant active substrate domain          of Cas ie a Cas substrate domain that is          constitutively tyrosine phosphorylated and able to send          signals independently of upstream signals We did this by          fusing the SD of Cas to a Src kinase domain that had been          attenuated by mutating the activation tyrosine Y  to          phenylalanine SrcCasSD Fig  This Src mutant is          inactive against exogenous substrates       We          also generated fusions of the Cas SD with a Src kinase          inactive mutant KM that has no enzymatic activity          Src KMCasSD fusions of either the attenuated kinase          domain or kinase inactive domain to the  or  regions          of the Cas SD SrcCasSD SrcCasSD Src          KMCasSD Src KMCasSD as well as the          attenuated Src kinase Src alone without the attached          Cas SD Fig  Transient expression of the SrcCasSD          in Cos cells followed by analysis of total cell lysates          using antiphosphotyrosine antibodies demonstrated that          while the attenuated Src kinase domain alone did not          increase total cellular tyrosine phosphorylated proteins          as expected expression of the SrcCasSD fusion          resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein of the          expected size of the chimera as well as other proteins          Fig a b Expression of the CasSD or the Src          KMCasSD fusion did not result in any increase in          total phosphotyrosine containing proteins nor in the          tyrosine phosphorylation of the Cas SD data not shown          and see Fig                           The Cterminus of the Cas SD is involved in the          interaction with vcrk          Investigators have shown that vcrk interacts via its          SH domain with the substrate domain of Cas              Association of vcrk with endogenous Cas is believed to          protect the phosphorylation status of this molecule due          to protection from phosphatases     Expression of an          unphosphorylated Cas SD along with vcrk should therefore          result in stable tyrosine phosphorylation of the Cas SD          if they interact The Cas SD has two sets of potential          SH interacting tyrosines the Nterminal subdomain          containing  YQXP motifs located between aa L to A          and the Cterminal subdomain containing  YDXP motifs          located between aa S to R  The vcrk SH domain          interacts with YXXP motifs upon phosphorylation          suggesting that both of these regions may be able to          interact with vcrk     Fusions of the kinase          inactive Src kinase domain and either the full Cas SD          the  region of the Cas SD CasSD containing  YQXP          motifs or the  of the Cas SD CasSD containing           YDXP motifs are not stably tyrosine phosphorylated when          expressed alone in cells data not shown and see Fig          b We therefore used these fusions to determine which          region of the Cas SD interacts with vcrk Initially we          expressed the Src KMCasSD entire Cas SD in Cos          cells alone or along with wild type WT vcrk or vcrk          SH or SH mutants and assayed for tyrosine          phosphorylation and association by coimmunoprecipitation          Fig a Figure ademonstrates that while the chimera          was not stably tyrosine phosphorylated when expressed          alone expression of the Src KMCasSD chimera along          with either WT or an SH domain mutant of vcrk resulted          in its stable tyrosine phosphorylation and          coimmunoprecipitation with vcrk Fig a lanes             However coexpression of the Src KMCasSD chimera          along with a SH mutant of vcrk demonstrated that an          intact vcrk SH domain is required for association with          the tyrosine phosphorylated Src KMCasSD Fig a lane           These data suggest that the kinase inactive fusion          with the Cas SD is either transiently tyrosine          phosphorylated in cells and vcrk protects them from          being dephosphorylated by interacting with them via its          SH domain or alternatively that vcrk induces their          tyrosine phosphorylation          We then used the  and  fusions of the Cas SD to          determine which motif YQXP or YDXP interacts with the          vcrk SH domain Expression of the Src KMfused to the          full length Cas SD  Nterminal YQXP motifs or           Cterminal YDXP motifs alone demonstrated that these          fusions were not stably tyrosine phosphorylated in cells          Fig b lanes  although they can be stably          tyrosine phosphorylated when fused to the attenuated Src          kinase domain data not shown and see Fig a By          contrast coexpression of these fusions along with vcrk          results in stable tyrosine phosphorylation of the           Cterminal YDXP motifs and the full length Cas SD          carrying both motifs but not the  Nterminal YQXP          motifs Fig b lanes  These data indicate that the          vcrk SH domain interacts with the Cterminal YDXP          motifs and as suggested by Birge et al vcrk may be          able to protect them from dephosphorylation andor          induces their phosphorylation     They also suggest          that the YQXP motifs may be involved in binding to other          intracellular signaling molecules                          Suppression of vcrk mediated transformation by          tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD          As our tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD chimera can          interact with vcrk we decided to find out if the          chimera would affect cell growth andor transformation in          normal cells and those transformed with vcrk NIHT          cells or those transformed with vcrk were stably          transfected with the Cas SD chimera Fig  Several          independent clones were obtained for each set of          transfections suggesting that expression of the tyrosine          phosphorylated Cas SD domain did not negatively affect          cell growth data not shown Figure ademonstrates that          stable expression of the SrcCasSD chimera resulted in          constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein in          NIHT cells Analysis of the effect of this chimera in          nontransformed NIHT cells indicates that these cells          were not transformed and had normal morphology although          they grew slightly slower than vectortransfected cells          data not shown Analysis of the growth of either          nontransformed or vcrk transformed NIHT cells in soft          agar confirmed that expression of tyrosine phosphorylated          Cas SD chimera did not transform NIHT cells as no          colonies of these cells grew in soft agar data not          shown Instead expression of tyrosine phosphorylated          Cas SD chimera resulted in significant reduction in the          number of vcrkNIHT soft agar colonies as well as          their size Fig b suggesting that the SrcCasSD          chimera blocked the ability of vcrk to transform these          cells                          Tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD blocks JNK          activation by vcrk          The JNK pathway is regulated by interaction of c or          vcrk with Cas via the substrate domain     In          determining which pathways are affected in our stable          cell lines generated we determined if JNK was activated          in the vcrk transformed cells and if the tyrosine          phosphorylated Cas chimera was affecting this activation          JNK was immunoprecipitated and tested for activity from          control NIHT cells those expressing the Cas chimera          and those expressing the Cas chimera and vcrk Fig a          We found that while JNK activity was elevated in vcrk          transformed NIHT cells expression of the tyrosine          phosphorylated Cas chimera resulted in reduced activity          of JNK Fig a cf lanes   and  Interestingly          JNK activity was also lower in the NIHT cells          expressing the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas chimera than          the vector transfected cells suggesting that this          chimera also affected JNK activity in those cells Fig          a cf lanes  and  These data suggest that the          tyrosine phosphorylated Cas chimera perturbs signaling          via vcrk and probably via endogenous ccrk to affect the          activation of the JNK pathway          We also verified that the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas          chimera could affect the ability of vcrk to activate the          JNK pathway in transient transfection experiments Fig          b Transfection of vcrk along with gstJNK into Cos          cells resulted in activation of the cotransfected JNK          Fig b cf lanes  and  However cotransfection of          vcrk and gstJNK with the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas          chimera blocked the activation of JNK induced by vcrk          Fig b cf lanes    confirming that tyrosine          phosphorylated Cas SD can inhibit the ability of vcrk to          activate the JNK pathway Transient expression of the          Src increased JNK activity slightly while expression of          the Src KMCasSD fusion did not affect JNK activity          data not shown          To determine if the tyrosinephosphorylated Cas SD          chimera affected other signaling pathways we tested          whether the association between ccrk and CG was          affected in NIHT cells expressing the chimera Fig          a Immunoprecipitating endogenous ccrk and probing for          associated CG demonstrated that CG association with          ccrk was reduced in the presence of the tyrosine          phosphorylated chimera Fig a cf lanes              In addition we determined if tyrosine phosphorylation of          endogenous FAK and endogenous Cas was affected by the          presence of the chimera This was not the case Figure          bdemonstrates that there was no difference in tyrosine          phosphorylation or association with tyrosine          phosphorylated proteins of either FAK or endogenous Cas          upon stable expression of the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas          SD chimera                          Tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD acts as a decoy for          vcrk and endogenous ccrk          As the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas substrate domain          acts as a dominant negative for vcrk mediated          transformation and JNK activation and can also interact          with vcrk and ccrk data not shown we wanted to          determine if it could compete for binding of v and ccrk          to endogenous Cas We transfected vcrk alone or along          with the chimera of the attenuated Src kinase domain          fused to the Cterminal crk interacting region of the Cas          substrate domain SrcCasSD carrying the YDXP          motifs into Cos cells and immunoprecipitated either          the chimera or vcrk and assayed for interacting tyrosine          phosphorylated proteins Fig a Our analysis showed          that expression of this chimera resulted in expression of          the highly tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD chimera Fig          a lanes  whole cell lysates or lane  antichimera          immunoprecipitate Expression of vcrk alone resulted in          its coimmunoprecipitation with endogenous tyrosine          phosphorylated Cas Fig a lane  By contrast          coexpression of vcrk with the chimera resulted in          reduction in the association of vcrk with endogenous Cas          and in induced association of vcrk with the tyrosine          phosphorylated Cas SD Fig a lane  To determine          if the tyrosine phosphorylated chimera could compete with          endogenous Cas for binding to endogenous ccrk we          transfected either the isolated attenuated Src kinase          domain as control or the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas          substrate domain SrcCasSD into Cos cells and          immunoprecipitated endogenous ccrk Fig b          Immunoprecipitation of endogenous ccrk showed          association with endogenous Cas Fig b lane  while          coexpression of the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas          substrate domain resulted in reduced association of          endogenous ccrk with endogenous Cas and association with          the tyrosine phosphorylated chimera Fig b lane           These data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylated          substrate domain of Cas acts as a decoy for binding to v          and ccrk thereby interfering with signaling to JNK          activation and transformation                            Discussion        Adaptor proteins that regulate tyrosine kinase signaling        pathways fall into two major categories those primarily        with proteinprotein interaction domains such as SH SH        PTB and PH domains exemplified by the adaptor proteins        ccrk nck and grb and those that are primarily tyrosine        phosphorylated exemplified by proteins such as Cas Dok        IRS and  Slp LAT TRIM or SIT The latter class may        also have proteinprotein interaction domains The former        class of adaptor proteins form complexes with downstream        effectors in a constitutive fashion via their SH domains        Signals are initiated by tyrosine phosphorylation of        upstream effectors that recruit these adaptors to assemble        larger protein complexes by bringing downstream effectors        to the distinct cellular compartments for activation Thus        ccrk interacts constitutively with downstream effectors        such as CG via its SH domains and interacts in a        phosphotyrosine dependent fashion with tyrosine        phosphorylated receptors using its SH domain     To        analyze downstream signals regulated by these adaptor        proteins investigators have developed methods that target        them to distinct cellular membrane compartments by using        heterologous targeting sequences This leads to the        generation of constitutive signals by the adaptor proteins        in the absence of other upstream signals            The second class of phosphotyrosine dependent adaptors        exemplified by proteins such as Cas Dok IRS and  or        Slp as cytosolic adaptors or LAT TRIM or SIT as        membrane anchored adaptors also require the activation of        upstream signals by tyrosine kinases for their function        This second class of adaptor proteins is characterized by a        substrate domain with multiple tyrosines for        phosphorylation by upstream kinases Phosphorylation of        these sites leads to recruitment of other proteins        including the first class of adaptor proteins with SH or        PTB domains and subsequent signal transmission see           for review Analysis of the specific signals emanating        from the second class of adaptor proteins has been        difficult due to their dependence on upstream kinases for        tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrate domains for        subsequent assembly of downstream effectors While these        upstream kinases lead to tyrosine phosphorylation of the        adaptor and activation of downstream effectors they        usually also activate other signaling pathways that can        confound analysis of the specific role of the tyrosine        phosphorylated adaptor protein        We describe a novel chimeric molecule approach that        allows the analysis of signaling events regulated by        adaptor proteins that require tyrosine phosphorylation by        upstream signals for which we used the Cas protein as a        model The adaptor protein Cas has several domains that are        important for its function an SH domain a central        substrate domain with up to  tyrosines that can serve as        tyrosine kinase substrates for upstream kinases such as Src        and Abl       and a Cterminal Src binding domain        with PXXP motifs for binding to the SH domain of Src and        two tyrosines providing docking sites for the Src SH        domain upon phosphorylation     The substrate domain of        Cas has two major types of tyrosine motifs that can be        phosphorylated and bind downstream effectors YQXP         copies and YDXP motifs  copies suggesting that at        least two classes of downstream effectors one capable of        binding to YDXP motifs and the other capable of binding to        YQXP motifs are assembled by this adaptor protein        Tyrosine phosphorylation of the substrate domain leads to        the recruitment of other downstream adaptors such as crk        and nck as well as other downstream effectors possessing        SH domains and signaling events attributed to this domain        include activation of the JNK MAPK pathway and control of        adhesion and migration of cells         We        constructed a chimera between a kinase that phosphorylates        Cas         in vivo and the substrate domain of        Cas in order to determine events regulated by this domain        We constructed chimeras by placing the Cas SD at either the        Nterminus or Cterminus of the Src kinase domain However        we found that placing the Cas SD at the Nterminus of the        Src kinase domain was inferior to placing it at the        Cterminus with regards to tyrosine phosphorylation of the        Cas SD Subsequently in all our experiments reported we        used chimeras of the Cas SD fused to the Cterminus of the        Src kinase domains Rather than the WT kinase domain of        Src we used an attenuated Src kinase domain YF as the        fusion partner for our chimera to avoid phosphorylation and        activation of other Src substrates that would occur with a        WT kinase domain data not shown     The attenuated        Src kinase domain has reduced kinase activity and does not        phosphorylate exogenous substrates     We also used a        kinase inactive Src kinase domain as a control fusion        protein The chimera of the Cas SD domain fused to the        attenuated Src kinase domain was highly tyrosine        phosphorylated in cells and could bind known Cas binding        proteins in cells In contrast the chimera containing the        kinase inactive domain was not stably phosphorylated in        cells These findings indicated that this approach would be        useful in analyzing the events that occur following        tyrosine phosphorylation of the Cas SD in the absence of        upstream signals that may activate other signaling        pathways Our initial experiments were designed to        determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of the SD of Cas        would lead to the assembly of protein complexes and        activation of downstream effectors        Using different regions of the Cas SD containing either        the YDXP or the YQXP motifs we could demonstrate that        vcrk specifically interacts with the Cterminal YDXP        motifs when tyrosine phosphorylated Moreover in the        absence of stable tyrosine phosphorylation as seen in the        Src kinase inactive fusions vcrk could either induce        their phosphorylation or protect transiently        phosphorylated YDXP motifs from dephosphorylation through        yet unknown mechanisms Thus while both sets of motifs in        the Cas SD have been thought to interact with the vcrk SH        domain we demonstrated that this domain only interacts        with the YDXP motifs Since crk is the major protein        reported to bind to the Cas SD our data suggest that the        YQXP motifs may interact with other yet to be identified        downstream effectors        We also found that while downstream effectors assemble        onto the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD domain the        downstream signals were not activated In particular we        found that the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD domain        blocked vcrk mediated activation of the JNK pathway In        addition we found that expression of the tyrosine        phosphorylated Cas SD domain in vcrk transformed cells        reduced their ability to grow in soft agar a measure of        their transformation Furthermore we found that the        tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD competed effectively with        the endogenous Cas for binding to vcrk and endogenous        ccrk while not affecting tyrosine phosphorylation of        proposed upstream proteins such as Fak and endogenous Cas        Thus our data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas        SD acts as a decoy for endogenous Cas binding proteins and        blocks signaling via crk to the activation of JNK as well        as transformation of cells by the oncogene vcrk The        ability of the tyrosine phosphorylated Cas SD to act as a        decoy suggests that while tyrosine phosphorylation of the        substrate domain of Cas may be important for its function        in assembling downstream signals specific localization of        Cas may also be critical for its downstream functions        Indeed phosphorylated endogenous Cas is localized to FAK        and the focal adhesions via its SH domain andor its Src        binding domain in its distal Cterminus both were excluded        from our chimera suggesting that proper localization of        the tyrosine phosphorylated substrate domain may be        required for Cas activity                         Conclusions        A number of proteins have been identified that bind to        the substrate domain of Cas however the large number of        tyrosines and potential binding sites for downstream        effectors suggest that there may be more We propose that        our chimeric approach can be used to identify Cas binding        proteins in mammalian cells in the absence of specific        upstream signals normally required for tyrosine        phosphorylation of the Cas substrate domain We can also        use this approach to ask which tyrosines within the SD of        Cas can act as decoys for specific downstream signals        attributed to the SD of Cas Other uses for such a chimera        include screening approaches such as the yeast twohybrid        screen to select proteins that interact with the tyrosine        phosphorylated Cas SD Finally we can theoretically target        this tyrosine phosphorylated chimera to specific areas of        the cell to determine which cellular localization will        recover the activation of downstream Cas functions This        chimeric approach can also be extended to other adaptor        proteins that require upstream signals for tyrosine        phosphorylation creating tyrosine phosphorylated decoys or        targeting tyrosine phosphorylated substrate domains or full        length adaptor proteins in transgenic cellular and animal        systems We also propose that similar approaches could be        used for analyzing proteins that are phosphorylated on        serine or threonine and assemble complexes such as         for analysis of their downstream signals or identification        of binding proteins                    Materials and Methods
