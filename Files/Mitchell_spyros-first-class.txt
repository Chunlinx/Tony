TRENDS IN FIRSTCLASS MAIL VOLUMES WITH EMPHASIS ONBILLPAYMENT AND ADVERTISING MAILSpyros S XenakisOffice of Rates Analysis and PlanningUS Postal Rate Commission July The paper was presented to the Commission in December  andwas revised in June  to include the data from the HouseholdDiary Study conducted in HIGHLIGHTS AT A GLANCEHousehold and Business MailThe share of FirstClass Mail sent by businesses isincreasing while the share sent by households isdecreasingThe Postal system is increasingly becoming a medium forbusiness transactions rather than personal exchangeBillPayment MailHousehold billpayment mail has started losing volumebut the number of pieces lost so far is too small to have anymaterial impact on FirstClass volumePayments are declining faster than bills households arenow making less than one payment by mail for every two billsreceived in the mailThe loss of household billpayment mail is having moreimpact on FirstClass singlepiece than presort mailAdvertising MailFirstClass household advertising mail is growingfastFirstClass advertising mail growth could offset some ofthe loss in billpayment mailStandard A mail is also growing fastIn  the Postal Service delivered at least billion more pieces of advertising than nonadvertisingmailHIGHLIGHTSHousehold and Business MailThe volume of FirstClass personal HHtoHH mailcontinues to decline Between  and  it decreased at a rateof  percent annually Its share of total FirstClass Mail hasdropped from  in  to  percent in  One of the factorscited for the decline in personal mail volume is falling longdistance telephone rates which have made telephone communicationmore affordable and fostered substitution of telephone calls forpersonal mailBusiness NHHtoNHH mail is the only sector ofFirstClass mailstream that has experienced healthy growth in thes Between  and  its volume grew at a rate of percent annually  times higher than total FirstClass Mail Itsshare increased from  percent in  to  percent in The prevailing view is that the high growth of business mailreflects the healthy growth of the US economyThe share of FirstClass Mail sent by businesses ieNHHtoHH and NHHtoNHH mail is increasing while the share sentby households is decreasing In  businesses originated percent of FirstClass Mail up from  percent in The above trends support the observation that the Postalsystem is increasingly becoming a medium for business transactionsrather than personal exchangeBillPayment MailHousehold billpayment mail as defined in this analysisincludes both the household payment mail ie FirstClass Mailused by households to pay their bills and the household bill mailie FirstClass Mail used by businesses to send bills tohouseholds The volume of business billpayment mail ie mailused by businesses to pay their bills and send bills to otherbusinesses is unknown and is not covered in thisanalysisIn  household billpayment mail totaled  billionpieces or  percent of FirstClass Mail Of those  billionpieces were payments and  billion pieces were billsHousehold billpayment mail is now declining Its annualgrowth has dropped from percent in  to  percent in  and further tonegative  percent in So far however the number of billpayment pieces lostis too small to have any material impact on FirstClass volumePayment mail is declining fast while bill mail is still increasingthough at a falling rate Between  and  the number ofpayments made by households declined by  billion pieces but thenumber of bills received increased by  billion pieces As aresult the total billpayment mail decreased by only  billionpieces in seven yearsSo far it seems that households are converting frompaying by mail to other methods of payment at a faster rate thanbusinesses are converting their methods of sending billsConsequently the ratio of payments made by mail to bills receivedin the mail has dropped from  percent in  to  percentin  On average households are making less than one payment bymail for every two bills received in the mailPayment mail is all FirstClass singlepiecenonpresorted letters while bill mail consists mostly of presortedletters So far the former has been more vulnerable to diversionthan the latter Thus the diversion of billpaying by mail toother methods of billpaying is having more impact on FirstClasssinglepiece than presort mailAdvertising MailHousehold advertising mail as used in this analysisincludes only FirstClass standalone advertising mail that is sentby businesses to households It does not include advertisingstuffers ie advertising mail sent enclosed with other itemssuch as bills Moreover the volume of business advertising mailie advertising mail sent by businesses to other businesses isunknown and thus it is not addressed in this analysisIn  FirstClass household advertising mail amountedto  billion pieces or percent of FirstClass MailFirstClass household advertising mail is growing fastBetween  and  it grew at a rate of  percent annuallyIts volume almost doubled in ten years It grew from  billionpieces in  to  billion pieces in  If this trendcontinues FirstClass advertising mail growth may offset the lossin billpayment mail allowing FirstClass Mail to maintain itscurrent growthIf we subtract the  billion pieces of FirstClasshousehold advertising mail reported for  from FirstClass volume and add them to Standard A mail volume weobtain the following figures for  a  billion pieces ofnonadvertising mail and b  billion pieces of advertisingmail Thus in  the Postal Service delivered at least billion more pieces of advertising than nonadvertising mailBecause of lack of data for  we have assumed that FirstClassadvertising mail volume stayed constant between  andThe high growth rates of both FirstClass advertising andStandard A mail have contributed to shifting the balance in favorof more advertising than nonadvertising mail in the Postal Servicemailstream In the last two years  and  Standard A mailgrew at a rate of  percent annually five times higher thanFirstClass MailWith FirstClass household advertising and Standard Amail growing at high rates it is expected that the trend of moreadvertising than nonadvertising mail in the Postal Servicemailstream will continue for the years to come This may haveserious political implications for the legal protection of thePostal Service monopoly on letter mail The public and the Congressmay question such protection when they learn that the PostalService is increasingly becoming an advertising mediumANALYSISIntroductionThe focus of this paper is FirstClass Mail First we identifythe sectors or flows of FirstClass Mail and evaluate their volumegrowth Then we turn our attention to FirstClass household mailand evaluate the growth of two of its uses billpaying andadvertising As far as I know this is the first time the growthrates of FirstClass Mail sectors and uses have been analyzedFor the purpose of this analysis billpayment mail is broadlydefined as FirstClass Mail used by households to pay their billsas well as FirstClass Mail used by nonhouseholds to send bills tohouseholds On the other hand advertising mail is narrowly definedas FirstClass standalone advertising mail ie FirstClass Mailused exclusively for advertising Because of their importance wewill revisit these definitions later during the review ofbillpayment and advertising mail dataHousehold Diary StudyAll data used in this analysis come from a market research studycalled the Household Diary Study HDS Thus before we turn to thedata I would like to review some highlights related to thisstudyHDS is financed by the Postal Service and is conducted annuallyby Chilton Research Services a market research firm located inRadnor Pennsylvania The study was first conducted in  Thelast data report available to us is for  Thus we havehousehold diary data for ten years which we use for thisanalysisHDS collects data on mail either sent or received by householdsThe analysis of these data provides a detailed description of thehousehold portion of the Postal Service mailstream HDS does notcollect any information on mail sent from nonhouseholds to othernonhouseholds Thus the nonhousehold or business portion of themailstream is not analyzed by the studyThe data are collected on a fiscal year basis HDS is designedso that data collected in a given year can be compared with datacollected in preceding or subsequent years This allows us to makeintertemporal data comparisons and develop volume growth ratesThe Postal Service and the Commission have been using HDS data forvolume forecasting and ratemaking purposes during rate casesAdditionally the Postal Service uses the data for planning andmarketing purposesIn  the Survey Research Center of the University ofMichigan conducted two studies on behalf of the Postal Service theHousehold Mailstream Study HMS which like HDS analyzed thehousehold mail and the Nonhousehold Mailstream Study NMS whichanalyzed the business portion of the mailstream These studieswere however conducted only once Thus we do not have data forthe years between  and  for annual comparisonsHDS collects information on household mail by surveying a randomsample of  households per year Each household is surveyed fora randomly selected week During the first  and final four highvolume weeks of the postal fiscal year  households are surveyedper week for the remainder of the year  households are surveyedweeklyAfter an entry interview and training selected members of thehousehold are asked to keep a diary of every mail piece sent orreceived by the household during the sample week The entryinterview provides mainly information on household demographicslike the size and income of the household and the education andemployment of the head of the household The interviewer alsocollects information about the households attitudes andresponsiveness regarding mailThe data used in this analysis are mostly collected by theweeklong diary of household mail The diary mainly collectsinformation on the class and subclass of mail sent or received byhouseholds the sector or flow of this mail the content or use ofit and the industry source of household mail originating innonhouseholdsSectors or Flows of FirstClass MailTable  shows the breakdown of FirstClass Mail by sector orflow for FYs    and  The first row of the tableidentifies the FirstClass Mail in the HHtoHHHouseholdtoHousehold sector This mail also called personalmail is sent by households to other households and includes mainlyholiday greeting cards like Christmas cards other cards lettersand invitations like a wedding invitation This sector does notinclude billpayment or advertising mailA subject that is discussed during the entry interview is thehouseholds reaction to advertising mail The respondents areasked among other things if they read advertising mail and ifthey find it useful Surprisingly in   percent of therespondents said that they read or look at advertising mail and percent said that they find it useful or interesting Personal Mail FirstClass Mail sent by households to otherhouseholds eg holiday greeting cards other cards letters andinvitations This sector does not include billpayment oradvertising mail FirstClass Mail sent by households to nonhouseholds egpayments made to utility and credit card companies and ordersplaced or payments made in response to advertising About percent of HHtoNHH mail contains some type of payment and isclassified as billpayment mail This sector does not contain anyadvertising mail FirstClass Mail sent by nonhouseholds to households egutility credit card insurance and medical bills as well asadvertisements from credit card companies publishers leisureservices and banks This sector is the only source of advertisingmail shown in Table  Household Mail FirstClass Mail either sent or received byhouseholds Business Mail FirstClass Mail sent by nonhouseholds toother nonhouseholds This mail is not subject to HDSThe second row of the table is devoted to FirstClass Mail inHHtoNHH HouseholdtoNonhousehold sector This mail is sent byhouseholds to nonhouseholds and includes mainly payments made toutility and credit card companies as well as orders placed orpayments made in response to advertising About  percent of thismail contains some type of payment and is classified asbillpayment mail This sector does not contain advertisingmailThe third row shows the FirstClass Mail in the NHHtoHHNonhouseholdtoHousehold sector This mail is sent bynonhouseholds to households and includes utility credit cardinsurance and medical bills as well as advertisements from creditcard companies publishers leisure services and banksThe fourth row labeled Subtotal shows the FirstClasshousehold mail as the sum of mail in the above three sectors Thisis the FirstClass Mail either sent or received by all householdsand is subject to analysis by HDSThe fifth row is devoted to FirstClass Mail in NHHtoNHHNonhouseholdtoNonhousehold sector This mail also calledbusiness mail is sent by nonhouseholds to other nonhouseholdsHDS does not survey this mail and thus we practically knownothing about its uses More importantly we do not know how muchof business mail is used for billpaying or advertising Thus theFirstClass billpayment and advertising mail volumes presented inthis analysis do not include the business billpayment andadvertising mailThe sixth row labeled Unknown shows some FirstClass Mailthat cannot be identified with any of the aforementioned foursectors This mail is insignificant except for FY  the firstyear the study was conducted Finally the last row labeledTotal is devoted to total FirstClass MailNow let us turn to columns in Table  Columns   and  labeled Volume show in millions the total FirstClassMail pieces brokendown by sector for FYs    and respectively For example the first number in Column shows that in FY  the HHtoHH or Personal Mail volume was billion pieces Similarly the last number in Column  shows thatthe total FirstClass volume was  billion pieces in FYColumns    and  labeled Share of Total showthe volume share of each sector in total FirstClass Mail for theaforementioned fiscal years For example the first number inColumn  shows that in FY  the volume of mail sent byhouseholds to other households represented  percent of totalFirstClass volumeFinally Columns   and  labeled Annual Growthshow the annual volume growth rates of all sectors and totalFirstClass Mail for the time periods   and respectively For example the first number in Column  showsthat between  and  personal mail volume declined by percent annually Similarly the last number in Column  showsthat for the same time period total FirstClass Mail volumeincreased by  percent annually It should be noted that thenumbers in Columns   and  are average annual growthrates If someone wants to estimate the cumulative volume growthfor a period she has to multiply the annual growth rates inColumns   and  by the number of years in theperiodNow let us evaluate the historical volume data in Table  Inthe s  only NHHtoNHH business mail has experiencedhealthy volume growth All other sectors and total household mailhave suffered either volume decline or anemic growth ratesHHtoHH personal mail is the smallest sector of FirstClassMail Its annual growth rate fell from  percent in  tonegative  percent in  and further to negative  percentin  Its volume declined from  billion pieces in to billion pieces in  Finally its share of totalFirstClass Mail dropped from  percent in  to  percent in One of the factors cited for the decline in personal mailvolume is falling long distance telephone rates which have madetelephone communication more affordable and fostered substitutionof telephone calls for personal mailThe HHtoNHH sector which consists mainly of payment mail hasexperienced a steeper volume decline than personal mail in the sIts average annual growth rate fell from  percent in  tonegative  percent in  and further to negative percent in  Its volume declined from  billionpieces in  to  billion pieces in  a drop in volume of billion pieces Finally its share of total FirstClass Maildropped from  percent in  to  percent in  As wewill see in Table  the decline in HHtoNHH volume is mostlyattributed to the decline of this sectors household paymentmailIn the s the volume of NHHtoHH sector has increased butits annual growth rate has been falling Its volume increased from billion pieces in  to  billion pieces in  Itsannual growth rate however fell from  percent in  to percent in  and further to  percent in NHHtoHH mail is now the second largest sector of FirstClassMail Its share of total FirstClass Mail has declined from percent in  to  percent in  The NHHtoHH sectorincludes both bill and advertising mail As we will see later thevolumes of both bill and advertising mail included in this sectorhave increased in the s However the annual growth rate of billmail is declining whereas the annual growth rate of advertisingmail is increasing fastHousehold mail is defined as the sum of mail in the above threesectors and is shown as Subtotal in Table  Its annual growthrate fell from  percent in  to  in  and furtherto negative  percent in  Its volume declined by billion pieces between  and  and its share of totalFirstClass Mail decreased from percent in  to  percent in NHHtoNHHbusiness mail is the only sector of FirstClass Mail that hasexperienced healthy growth in the s Its annual growth rates wereas follows  percent in   percent in  and percent in  Its volume grew from billion pieces in  to  billion pieces in  anincrease in volume of  billion pieces Finally its share oftotal FirstClass Mail increased from  percent in  to percent in  The prevailing view is that the highgrowth of business mail reflects the healthy growth of the USeconomy In Docket No R referring to period  PostalService volume witness Tolley first observed that the generaltrend has been a decrease in the share of FirstClass letters sentby households and an increase in the share sent bynonhouseholds He then testified that the increase innonhousehold originated mail reflects the importance of mail asan input in the production of goods and services in the economywith mail volume being associated importantly with growth in outputof goods and services in the economy and in demands forcommunication in productionBillPayment and Advertising MailTable  has the same format as Table  and shows the breakdownof FirstClass Mail by use The first row labeled Personal Mailand the sixth row labeled Business Mail are identical to firstand fifth rows in Table  respectively The second third andfourth rows labeled BillPayment Advertising and Other HHMail identify the uses of HHtoNHH and NHHtoHH mail reported insecond and third rows of Table Billpayment mail includes both the household payment mailie FirstClass Mail used by households to pay their bills andthe household bill mail ie FirstClass Mail used bynonhouseholds to send bills to households On the other handadvertising mail includes only FirstClass standalone advertisingmail ie FirstClass Mail used exclusively for advertising thatis sent by nonhouseholds to households Advertising mail does notinclude advertising stuffers ie advertising mail sent enclosedwith other items such as bills Neither does it include the mailsent in response to advertising A large portion ofresponsetoadvertising mail involves a payment and is included inbillpayment mail If the responsetoadvertising mail were alsoadded to advertising mail it would have resulted in doublecountingThe volume of letters sent by households or household originatedmail can be obtained from Table  by adding the volumes of HHtoHHand HHtoNHH mail In  households originated only  percentof FirstClass mail down from  percent in  The volume ofletters sent by nonhouseholds or nonhousehold originated mail canalso be calculated from Table  by adding NHHtoHH and NHHtoNHHvolumes In  nonhouseholds sent  percent of FirstClassMail up from  percent in  Billpayment mail includes both the household payment mailie FirstClass Mail used by households to pay their bills andthe household bill mail ie FirstClass Mail used bynonhouseholds to send bills to households The volume of businessbillpayment mail ie mail used by nonhouseholds to pay theirbills and send bills to other nonhouseholds is unknown and is notincluded in billpayment mail Advertising mail only includes FirstClass standaloneadvertising mail that is sent by businesses to households It doesnot include advertising stuffers ie advertising mail sentenclosed with other items such as bills Moreover the volume ofbusiness advertising mail ie advertising mail sent bynonhouseholds to other nonhouseholds is not known and thus itis not included in advertising mail Finally it does not includethe mail sent by both households and nonhouseholds in response toadvertising Other HH mail is the residual household FirstClass Mail withthe following major uses financial statementsannouncementsmeetings notices of order request for andconfirmation of donations tax forms education acceptances andinsurance policiesIt should be noted that the figures of billpayment andadvertising mail presented in Table  account only for theFirstClass household mail and thus represent the lower bound ofFirstClass billpayment and advertising mail volumes The volumeof business billpayment mail ie mail used by nonhouseholds topay their bills and send bills to other nonhouseholds is unknownand thus it is not included in billpayment mail figurespresented in this table Likewise the volume of businessadvertising mail ie advertising mail sent by nonhouseholds toother households is not known and thus it has not been added toadvertising mailIn  household billpayment mail amounted to  billionpieces or  percent of FirstClass Mail and FirstClasshousehold advertising mail amounted to  billion pieces or percent of FirstClass MailThe growth of billpayment mail has slowed down significantly inthe s Its average annual growth rate dropped from  percent in to  percent in  and further to negative percent in  Its share dropped from  percent in  to percent in  So far however the number of mail pieceslost to alternative billpaying methods is too small to have anymaterial impact on FirstClass volume Between  and billpayment volume declined by only  billion pieces Theserepresent an average loss of  million pieces or less than percent of FirstClass Mail annuallyAdvertising mail has experienced high growth rates in allperiods In  it enjoyed a very high growth rate of percent annually in  its growth slowed down to a healthy percent annually and in  it grew by  percentannually Its volume almost doubled in nine years It grew from billion pieces in  to  billion pieces in In  the volume of total FirstClass Mail was  billionpieces and the volume of Standard A mail which is mainlyadvertising mail was  billion pieces If we subtract the billion pieces of FirstClass advertising mail from FirstClassvolume and add them to Standard A mail volume we obtain thefollowing figures a  billion pieces of nonadvertising mailand b  billion pieces of advertising mail Thus in  thePostal Service delivered  billion fewer pieces of advertisingthan nonadvertising mailNow if we perform the same exercise using the actual FY FirstClass and Standard A volume figures of  billion and billion pieces respectively and assuming that FirstClassadvertising mail volume has not changed between  and  weobtain the following figures for FY  a  billion piecesof nonadvertising mail and b  billion pieces of advertisingmail Thus in  the Postal Service delivered  billion morepieces of advertising than nonadvertising mailIt should be pointed out that high growth rates of bothFirstClass advertising and Standard A mail have contributed toshifting the balance in favor of more advertising thannonadvertising mail in the Postal Service mailstream In the lasttwo Fiscal Years  and  Standard A mail grew at an averageannual rate of  percent five times higher than FirstClassMailWith FirstClass advertising and Standard A mail growing at highrates it is expected that the trend of more advertising thannonadvertising mail in the Postal Service mailstream will continuefor the years to come This may have serious political implicationsfor the legal protection of the Postal Service monopoly on lettermail The public and the Congress may question such protection whenit becomes common knowledge that the Postal Service delivers morejunk than other letter mailSources of BillPayment MailBillpayment mail can originate either in households ornonhouseholds and its source can be anyone of the following threesectors HHtoNHH NHHtoHH and NHHtoNHH Table  which hasthe same format as the previous two tables shows the sources oftotal FirstClass billpayment mail reported in Table The first row shows the billpayment mail that comes from theHHtoNHH HouseholdtoNonhousehold sector This is the paymentmail ie mail used by households to pay their bills In payment mail was  billion pieces or  percent of billpaymentmail The total household billpayment mail which was firstpresented in the second row of Table  is now reported in thefourth row of this table In  its volume was  billionpiecesThe second row shows the billpayment mail that comes from theNHHtoHH NonhouseholdtoHousehold sector This is the billmail ie mail used by nonhouseholds to send bills tohouseholds Bill mail was  billion pieces or  percent ofbillpayment mail in The third row is devoted to billpayment mail that is part ofthe NHHtoNHH NonhouseholdtoNonhousehold sector This is thebusiness billpayment mail ieIn FY  and FY  Standard A mail grew  percent and percent respectively FirstClass Mail grew  percent in bothyearsmail used by nonhouseholds to send and pay bills to othernonhouseholds No figures are reported on this row because thevolume of business billpayment mail is not known to theCommissionHousehold payment mail has been declining Its annual growthrate dropped from positive  percent in  to negative percent in  and further to negative percent in  Its volume declined from  billionpieces in  to  billion pieces in  a drop of  billionpieces This drop in payment mail volume accounts for  percent ofthe decline in the volume of HHtoNHH sector amounted to billion pieces between  and  see Table The growth rate of household bill mail is also declining but itsvolume has increased in the s Its annual growth rate droppedfrom  percent in  to  percent in  and furtherto  percent in  but its volume increased by  billionpieces between  and  This increase in the volume of billmail offsets more than half of the decline in the volume of paymentmail allowing billpayment mail to decline by only  billionpieces between  and  As said before the decline inhousehold billpayment volume so far amounts to a very smallportion of FirstClass volumeThere is another observation that can be made based on householdbillpayment volume figures reported in Table  Although bothpayments and bills seem to have been affected by the diversion frompayment by mail to other methods of payment the effect ofdiversion is more pronounced on payment mail As a result theratio of the number of payments made by mail to the number of billsreceived in the mail has dropped from  percent in  to percent in  Thus in  on average households made lessthan one payment by mail for every two bills received in themailFinally payment mail is all FirstClass singlepiecenonpresorted letters while bill mail is mostly presorted lettersSo far the former has been more vulnerable to diversion than thelater Thus the diversion of billpaying by mail to other methodsof billpaying is having more impact on singlepiece than presortFirstClass MailFirstClass PerHousehold VolumesOne of the factors affecting the demand for mail services is thenumber of households Households send and receive mail and theirnumber is expected to affect the demand for mail services in apositive way An increase in the number of households is expectedto cause an increase in mail volumeFor building HR  Model the Postal Service has assumedthat in  business billpayment mail was about  percent ofFirstClass Mail or  billion pieces If the  percent figurewere also true for  then  percent of business mail wouldhave qualified as billpayment mail in that year and total iehousehold plus business billpayment mail would have been billion pieces or  percent of FirstClass Mail The PostalService did not tell the Commission where this  percent figurecomes fromAs we have seen Tables   and  show the breakdown of totaldemand for FirstClass Mail by sectors and uses for FYs   and  Now if we assume that the volume of all sectorsand uses in Tables   and  have an elasticity of one withrespect to the number of households ie every one percentincrease in the number of households has yielded exactly a onepercent increase in all annual mail volumes and for all years inTables   and  we can then divide the annual volume figuresby the number of households in the respective year to obtain annualvolume figures per household This process eliminates the effect ofhousehold growth on mail volume and allows an analysis of thevolume behavior at the household level However when we analyzethe perhousehold volume figures we have to remember that for thepurpose of developing those figures we made the aforementionedassumption about the relationship of mail volume and number ofhouseholds and this assumption may not hold true for some or allsectors or uses and for some or all years in Tables   andTables   and  display FirstClass perhousehold annualvolumes They are identical to Tables   and  respectivelyexcept that the total annual volumes in Tables   and  have beenreplaced with perhousehold annual volumes in Tables   and  Acomparison of figures in Tables   and  with the correspondingfigures in Tables   and  respectively shows that thereplacement of total by perhousehold volume figures leaves theshares of sectors and uses in total FirstClass Mail volumeunchanged However because the number of households has beenincreasing every year the replacement of total by perhouseholdvolume figures produces annual growth rates which are lower thanthose shown in Tables   and  That is the positive annualgrowth rates in Tables   and  shrink in Tables   and  andthe negative rates augment in absolute termsFor example if we compare the annual growth rates of mailvolume for period  shown in Column  of Tables  and  wecan see that a the  percent annual decrease of total HHtoHHvolume in Table  has been augmented to a  percent annualdecrease of perhousehold volume in Table  b the  percentannual decrease of total HHtoNHH volume in Table  has beenaugmented to a  percent annual decrease of perhousehold volumein Table  c the  percent annual increase of total NHHtoHHvolume in Table  has shrunk to a  percent annual decrease ofperhousehold volume in Table  and d the  percent annualincrease of total NHHtoNHH volume in Table  has shrunk to a percent annual increase of perhousehold volume in Table Similarly a comparison of annual growth rates for the sameperiod in Table  with those in Table  reveals the following athe  percent annual decrease of billpayment volume in Table has been augmented to a  percent annual decrease of perhouseholdvolume in Table  and b the  percent annual increase of totaladvertising mail volume in Table  has shrunk to a  percentannual increase of perhousehold volume in Table Finally a comparison of annual growth rates for  inTable  with those in Table  shows the following a the percent annual decrease of the total number of payments in Table has been augmented to a  percent annual decrease of the numberof payments per household in Table  and b the  percentannual increase of total number of bills in Table  has shrunk to a percent annual decrease of the number of bills per household inTable  Personal Mail FirstClass Mail sent by households to otherhouseholds eg holiday greeting cards other cards letters andinvitations This sector does not include billpayment
