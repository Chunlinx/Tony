                                 Rest in Paz            There is simply to theinfluence the poet Octavio Paz enjoyed in Mexico I lived in Mexico City fromthe fall of  through the following spring Those were heady days for PazFor years he had challenged the uncritical leftwing rhetoric that dominatedMexicos intellectual life and now Eastern Europes abandonment of communismwas proving him correct President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was renegotiatingthe national debt getting foreigners to invest again and in general becomingan international darling this was four years before he would be unmasked as acriminal and thrown out of the country Paz was one of his biggest fans            Iremember a TV commercial that seemed to appear every three seconds At thispoint there was still for all practical purposes one network owned by EmilioAzcrraga a Mexican Rupert Murdoch with whom Paz was rumored to be friendlyThe commercial advertised an exhibit at the contemporary art museum The showwas of basically things Octavio Paz found interesting I looked in the daybefore I left Mexico and was fascinated and appalled The first thing you sawwas a gallery of preColombian artifacts that had sparked his imaginationThere followed a room hung exclusively with colonialera portraits of Sor JuanaIns de la Cruz the  th century poet whose life Paz told in asuperb  biography And so it went with room after room displaying whatevercaught Pazs fancy A nook devoted to playful gewgaws by Marcel Duchamp whomPaz adored A painting given to Paz by Jasper Johns But the most amazingfeature of the exhibit was in the lobby Dozens of TV monitors were stacked tocreate a giant image of the great mans head as he discoursed on this and thatThe whole thing looked like a homage to some ancient emperor It was a creepydiscouraging display            An ironic one too given Pazs record as a critic ofMexicos addiction to patriarchal power All his life he had seen thetemptations up close and many times he had resisted His grandfather apublisher was allied with the turn of the century dictator whose highhandedrule provoked the Mexican revolution Late in life he switched sides and tookup the doomed cause of liberal democracy Pazs father worked in turn with theanarchist peasant guerrilla leader Emiliano Zapata who wanted Mexico to returnto its preHispanic agricultural roots When that cause too failed andafter a decade of bloodspilling the country ended up with a Byzantinecoalition of interests presided over by a strongman the Paz family went intoexile in Los Angeles So before he was even a teenager Paz had experience inliberalism anarchism revolutionnot to mention the loneliness of the Mexicankid in inhospitable America            Enthralledby Marx and socialism even in later years when foes called him conservativePaz would insist he was a socialist at heart the young Paz went to fightFranco in Spain But it was the idea of instantaneous action by the people thathe loved not the Spanish Communists with their rigid principles and uglytotalitarian tendencies He went to Paris and hung out with Surrealistsdeepening his sense that a writers job is to reveal what society tries torepress Like many wellconnected artistically inclined Mexicans he got intocushy work that supplied living expenses and food for the imaginationdiplomacy            It was while working as a diplomat in Paris that he wrotethe book hell be remembered by In The Labyrinth of Solitude Life andThought in Mexico  Paz drew on his reading of Freud Marx and Nietzsche toexplore the Mexican cult of death the phenomenon of the macho and explosiverituals such as the fiesta His conclusion Mexican customs were a kind ofmask a defensive camouflage worn to hide the countrys unresolved past Thewhole history of Mexico from the Conquest to the Revolution can be regardedas a search for our own selves which have been deformed or disguised by alieninstitutions he wrote The Revolutionary Institutional Party that took powerafter the revolution had promised Mexico a new beginning But instead ofproviding Mexicans with an idea they could organize a modern community aroundit was a touchy compromise that preserved backward attitudes toward powerleftover from the Aztecs and colonial Spain            The patriarch protects isgood powerful wise The macho is the terrible man the chingon  thefather who has left who has abandoned a wife and children The image ofMexican authority is inspired by these two extremes Seor Presidente andCaudillo            Much ofThe Labyrinth now feels dated Its infused with a mournful seraExistentialism and Pazs French influence pushes him into abstraction Inplaces his indictment of certain aspects of the Mexican character is soharshhe accuses his fellow countrymen of pathological passivity and a love oflyingthat it verges on masochism But the book singlehandedly invented theway people think about modern Mexico and it has a tough truthfulness thatsstill palpable today Never academic it proceeds from a simple urgentquestion What are we and how can we fulfill our obligations to ourselves aswe are This is a poets or a philosophers approach to history that couldfruitfully be applied to any country in the world Click to see for examplehow he applies it with not very flattering results to the United States            Paz cemented his reputation for integrity in  when theMexican government murdered hundreds of students and he resigned his post asambassador to India in protest But gradually it has to be admitted he cameto suffer a mild case of the very power sickness he had diagnosed He set up amagazine Vuelta  to pursue intellectual inquiry free of the Mexicanlefts more overblown rhetoric The magazine was and is serious and fresh anddistinguished But Pazs omnipresence was sometimes unhealthy From high up onhis throne he conducted feuds with thoseCarlos Fuentes was onewhodisagreed with him For decades too much of what was published in Mexico waswritten either in argument with him or to court his favor            That saidPaz could not have remained on top if he had not remained relevant Some shrewdinner compass and an unholy supply of curiosity saved him from becoming a relicof the past or an embattled opponent of the present I wont argue for hispoetry which while frequently beautiful is never quite as beautiful to me ashis prose That is gentle and clear yet so packed with suggestive ideas thatit is almost painful to read While other writers struggled with Pazsdefinition of the Mexican condition he wrote about Chinese calligraphyJapanese haiku the Marquis de Sade an enemy of love yet paradoxically agenerous man or obstacles to democracy in India he always thought there wereuseful parallels between Mexicos and Indias struggles to set up a legitimategovernment In his life Paz made himself invulnerable but in his writing hekept his eyes ears and heart open A writer should be a guerrilla fightershould bear solitude and know that he is a marginal being he once told aninterviewer He never gave up this ideal of marginality even as he climbed tothe top of the pyramid He was a singular case both admirable and disturbingthe perennial guerrilla fighter who also became king                           If youmissed the links within this article click to read about Kerrs thoughts on Or read applied to North
