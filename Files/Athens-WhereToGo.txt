Where to GoV iewed from the airor from the high ground of the Acropolis or Mount LycabettusAthens is a sprawling city a maze of apartment blocks and office buildings stretching as far as the eye can see Yet the downtown area is remarkably compact Most of the major sites are within walking distance of one another but the inexpensive and reliable Metro system links many museums and attractions for those who get a little foot weary Ancient remains are scattered across the central downtown area and Athens has grown almost organically throughout its history resulting in numerous districts each with its own particular character This guide divides the city into a number of sections covering the ancient center of the city first and then moving clockwise through the other important districts Attractions featured will include major squares gardens ruins monuments and museumsThe heart of ancient Athens was centered around the dome of the Acropolis with sacred temples built atop the rock and the town built on its undulating flanks Today the area is still replete with Greek and Roman remains though these are interspersed with later buildingsa fascinating mixture of NeoClassical mansions and terraced cottages dating back to Ottoman times This area known as Plaka is now perhaps the most charming in Athens and acts as a magnet to visitors from around the worldThe AcropolisIt is impossible to overestimate the importance of the Acropolis to the ancient Greeks The religious significance of this sheersided rock  m  ft above the town was paramount and the enduring images of the temples there still represent the principles of freedom and democracy in the present day You can see the temples from most parts of the cityparticularly at night when they are welllitwhich only adds to the feeling that this small area is still the essence of the city The name Acropolis derives from the Greek words acro meaning highest point and polis meaning townTry to visit early or late in the day to avoid the tour groups or on Mondays when most tours dont operate and remember to wear comfortable flat shoes as there are many slippery stones worn smooth over the centuries and numerous uneven areas where heels can catchOnce through the ticket office a path leads to the summit of the Acropolisa relatively flat plateau around  m by  m  ft by  ft in area This path is the original sacred way used for ceremonial entrances to the inner sanctum in ancient timesUsed for strategic purposes throughout the Mycenaean and Archaic periods the rock was easy to defend it had a water supply and superb views of the surrounding area The first religious structures appeared at the end of the sixth century bc when the summit became a sanctuary and the town was founded on lower ground below These early temples were destroyed by the Persian forces of Xerxes in  bc Following this new defensive walls were constructed that included elements of the ruined old Temple of Athena and the old ParthenonIt was during the era of Pericles that construction began on many of the buildings that we see today He commissioned the Parthenon Erechtheon Temple of Athena Nike and Propylaia taking advantage of a new marble quarry on Mount Pentelikonthe marble became known as Pentelic As the Romans took control of Athens they embellished the site with small additions but the wake of Christianity and the decline of Roman power saw the Acropolis vulnerable to attack theft and vandalism Statuary was removed and temples were used as palaces by European nobles during the th century The rock reverted to its earliest use as a strategic stronghold during Ottoman rule resulting in damage to most of the major structures Vast amounts of stone were taken from temples on the pinnacle for a program of building in the city belowFollowing Greek independence a zealous restoration project saw the removal of all medieval and Ottoman structures on the plateau and harkened the beginning of archaeological study of the ancient remains This continues to the present dayFirst impressions as you make your way towards the inner sanctuary are of the Beul Gate a Roman addition of the third century ad The path leads on directly in front of the Temple of Athena Nike to the Propylaia sacred entranceway which led on into the inner sanctum This monumental gateway was a sign of things to come and for the ordinary citizens of Athens it was meant to inspire and impress It retains this ability in modern times even though the structure was never finished Construction began in  bc to a plan by Mnisikles an otherwise unknown architect A series of six Doric columns mark the transition into the Propylaia following which there are four symmetrical rooms two on either side of the walkway Ionic colonnades frame the walkway this was the first building to incorporate both styles of column There were five heavy wooden doors along the walkway heightening the tension of those ancient pilgrims as each would be opened in turn The only room to have been completed was the second on the northern side This was used as a waiting room and also according to the Roman historian Pausanias as a picture gallery or Pinakotheke the name it holds todayOnce through the Propylaia the sacred way leads on to the Acropolis plateau proper In Classical times a  m  ft statue of Athena Promachos the Defender dedicated to Athenian exploits during the Persian Wars stood immediately beyond the entranceway This was taken to Constantinople during the Byzantine era Make your way left along the southern flank of the Propylaia to view the Temple of Athena Nike Athena of Victory The Acropolis had been a sanctuary to Athena Nike since the fifth century bc and following the sacking of the site by the Persians a new smaller temple or naskos was commissioned and designed by Callicrates Six elegant columns support a pediment with decorative friezes depicting the gods on Mount Olympus and heroic battle scenes of Greek warriors fighting barbarians The temple built on the remains of an older Mycenaean wall offers excellent views across the surrounding landscape and this location was prized by the Ottomans who tore down the structure to build a defensive battery The temple has been painstakingly reerected using rubble found underneath the battery when it was removed in the sWalking back to the center of the plateau youll pass scant remains of the Sanctuary of Artemis Brauronia founded in the fourth century bc but your eyes will be drawn to the immense structure of the Parthenon which dominates todays Acropolis siteThe ParthenonThe Parthenon is one of the most recognizable buildings in the world The series of columns supporting pediment and frieze is Athens to many visitors and would have been also to travelers in ancient times However they would have seen a structure with a veneer of splendid color and decorated with magnificently carved sculptures not to mention a strong wooden roof now lost to posterity What remains is the bare Pentelic marble used in the construction and the refined lines and form that make it an architectural masterpieceThe Parthenon was dedicated to Athena and means Temple of the VirginAthena in her guise as protector of the city goddess of wisdom and justice It also housed the national treasury bringing together the spiritual and secular power of ancient Greece At least four other Parthenons have been built on the sitein fact the base of the present temple indicates that its predecessor was wider Designed by architects Callicrates and Iktinus work began in  bc and the temple was dedicated in  bc with a huge celebration the Panathenaic Festival that involved thousands of people live animals were sacrificed at an altar on the eastern faade This festival then took place every four years during the Pagan era and continued until the fifth century ad see page  Converted into a church in the sixth century the cella inner temple had frescoes painted on its walls and upper galleries where women worshipped A bell tower was added by the Byzantines who named it Agia Sophia also meaning wisdom Later under Ottoman rule the bell tower became a minaret and the church was converted into a mosqueEventually it was used as a powder magazine In September  Venetian forces threatened Athens and one of their mortars hit the Parthenon igniting the powder inside The resulting explosion badly damaged the structure and many other ancient buildings on the site The center of the Parthenon was totally destroyed along with many columns and priceless carved friezes Subsequent licences granted by the Ottomans to European nobles saw many prize friezes disappear to archaeological collections around Europe including the Elgin marbles ornately carved pediments that were taken to London by Lord Elgin Restoration of the temple has been almost constant since Today it is not possible to walk among the columns and through what remains of the inner temple This echoes the rules of ancient Greece when only the highest priests could enter the cella There they would be able to worship an ivoryand goldcovered wooden statue of Athena said to be  m  ft high which has long since been lost Walk around the  m  ft by  m  ft exterior to really appreciate the grace of the columns There are no straight lines anywhere in the buildingthe graduated curves simply create the illusion of the vertical and horizontalTo the north of the Parthenon stand the graceful statues of the Porch of the Caryatids which adorn the southern faade of the Erechtheon This temple is an unusual mlange of architectural styles with rooms at varying levels where the worship of three gods took place It was the last of the great building flurry of Pericles to be finished dedicated in  bc Built beside an ancient Temple of Athena whose scant remains can just be seen the Erechtheon brought together the worship of Athena and Poseidon under one rooflegend says that following the contest between the two gods for the honor of protecting Athens they were reconciled and this dual temple recognized their special bond with regard to the city Erechtheuspart man part snakewas a legendary King of Athens who over the generations became closely connected with Poseidon A temple of Zeus also forms part of the complex The temple was damaged by fire almost immediately and again during the Roman period It was converted into a church in the sixth century ad and was used as a harem building during Ottoman timesThe caryatidsfemale figures used as pillarsare thought to represent the Arrephoroi maidens who attended to the goddess Athena and performed rituals in the sanctuary and the temple as they all originally carried libation vessels in their hands Both the vessels and the arms of the caryatids have been destroyed The sculptures at the site are copies with all but one of the originals displayed in the Acropolis Museum Their portico protected the tomb of Cecrops the mythical founder of AthensBeyond the porch is the eastern faade Here a row of Ionian columns mark the entrance to a rectangular inner sanctum of the new Temple of Athena The walls of the interior were removed during the Byzantine era and the north corner column and pediment was removed by Elgin and taken to London with the Elgin marblesA large north porch balances that of the southern Porch of the Caryatids This sits on high foundations as the ground level falls steeply on the northern side Much of the building here dates from the time of the Roman Empirea devastating fire destroyed the earlier temples to Zeus and Poseidon Marks on the ground in the porch area suggest that this building was once struck by lightning A hole was left in the ceiling of the temple since the belief at the time was that a lightning strike should never be closed off from the sky Ancient Greeks believed that the Acropolis was guarded by a giant snake that lived under this temple Pilgrims would buy honey cakes for this snake and leave them at the temple entrance for it to enjoyThe west wall was restored in the early th century after it fell down in  The reconstruction recreates the temple of the Roman era The Acropolis Museum in the southeast corner of the plateau was opened in  It was designed and built so as not to spoil the skyline or compete with the temples and it cannot be seen from the streets of the city or from the sacred way as you enter through the Propylaia Much of the fine statuary and carved friezes still present when Ottoman forces left have been displayed here along with four of the original Caryatid statues from the Erechtheon The museum displays pieces of the ornate decorative pediment that adorned the temples and dedications to Athena herself found in the inner sanctuary The whole collection is breathtaking and proof if it were needed of the immense wealth and influence of this ancient site Each room has something of note but look for the pediment of a lion tearing apart a bull dating from the sixth century bc in room  Pediment depicting a tripleheaded demon and a kouros male statue named The Calfbearera young man carrying a calf to ritual slaughter at the templeare both displayed in room  Kritikos Boy and Blondhaired Boytwo sculptures carved in the severe style fashionable around  bc are displayed in room  Panels from the Ionic frieze that decorated the Parthenon are in room  and the original Caryatids can be found in room When you have explored the architectural delights of the Acropolis take time to enjoy the views from its walls Sections of the stone defences date back to Mycenaean times though the majority were constructed during the first millennium and were reinforced by the Turks From the north you can take in the other major archaeological sites and the district of Plaka directly below From the east the verdant slopes of Mount Lycabettus come into view with the smart district of Kolonaki on its lower slopes South leads the eye towards the coast and the islands of the Saronic Gulf As you leave the site via the smooth stone path through the Propylaia youll pass the Monument of Agrippa Originally erected with a single chariot to commemorate victory in the Panathenaic Games a second chariot group including Marcus Agrippa was added in  bc Youll leave through the Beul Gate a remaining part of the Roman defensive systemAround the AcropolisA number of other archaeological remains can be found on the flanks of the Acropolis and on nearby hills Head south of the rock by taking a left out of the main entrance and youll reach the first after a fiveminute strollThe Odeon of Herodes Atticus was one of the last great building projects of ancient Athens The vast auditorium was completed towards the end of the second century ad in typical Roman style During Byzantine times it was used as a dye works and the Ottomans used it for defensive purposes However excavations began in the s and the Odeon is once again holding spectacular summer performances On the southeastern flank of the Acropolis are the vast remains of the Theatre of Dionysus hacked out of the earth in the fifth century bc and upgraded in the third century bc In Roman times a long colonnaded stoa and promenade linked the two theaters but only scant remains can be seen today The theater separate fee with entrance at Ods Thrasyllou was the birthplace of the dramatic and comic art and formed the social and political heart of Athens during its golden age The premiers of several major pieces by Sophocles Euripides and Aristophanes were performed here and the Athens assembly also met here late in its history The whole auditorium held  people but most interesting are the carved front row thrones for VIPs including one with lionsclaw feet that was reserved for the priest Dionysus Eleutherios The particularly fine bema of Phaedros carved stage depicting scenes from the life Dionysusgod of wine and merrimentis of Roman origin Surrounding the theater are remains of several other buildings including an Asclepieion place of healing and Odeon of Pericles These are currently being worked on by archaeologists To the west of the Acropolis stands another small range of hills now cut by footpaths and covered in trees offering cooling shade in the heat of summer This area reached by crossing Ods Rovertou Gali and walking up behind the Dionysus restaurant offers splendid views across to the Acropolis its the best place for afternoon overviews and the Sound and Light Show auditorium is located here for this reason Several archaeological sites can be seen and the area is much less crowded than the Acropolis itself Youll also see the th century church Ayios Dimtrios Loumbardhi nestling under the woodland canopyIn the northeastern area youll come to the Hill of the Pnyx meeting place of the Assembly of Athens Loosely translated pnyx means crowded or tightly packed place and in ancient times this was a highly populated area Youll see the outlines of walls including the defensive Themistoklean Wall between the bushes or under the turf as you stroll The Pnyx meeting place can be found below the summit on the northeastern side of the hill When democracy was established at the end of the sixth century bc the debating chamber moved from the Agora to this structure and it was here that the great statesmen of Greece made their speeches at the rostrum Seats were provided for the  citizens of the city needed for a decisionmaking quorum who would listen to the arguments of Pericles and Themistocles On the Hill of the Nymphs north of the Pnyx youll see the NeoClassical lines of the original Athens Observatory founded in  Perhaps the most popular point for visitors lies in the south where at the highest pointHill of the Muses or Philopappos Hillis the Tomb of Philopappos a highranking nobleman in Roman times Its convex faade has a sculptured frieze depicting Julius Philopappos riding a chariot and performing his duties in the Senate It is from here that youll get the best views of the Acropolis so dont forget your camera or video recorderOn the north flank of the Acropolis is the hill of Areopagos found close to the right of the main Acropolis ticket office With views across the city below it is a popular spot for photographs however it also has a long and illustrious history Tradition states that this was the site of the original Agora of Athens and the original council of the city was known as the Council of Areopagos Later it held courts of law and justice was dispensed here In ad  St Paul addressed a crowd of Athenians from the hill with his sermons of Christian faith He met with a hostile response from the Pagan population but did convert Dionysus who later became the patron saint of AthensPlaka and AnafiotikaAfter all the exploration of these fascinating archaeological sites youll probably be ready for a rest and change of scenery As you make your way to the city youll pass through two small districts which offer a range of cafs bars and tavernas along with images of Greek daily life not found in more modern parts of Athens The tiny area called Anafiotika hugs the high ground immediately below the Acropolis Built in the th century for migrant workers from around Greece that came to take advantage of construction opportunities in the capital the first few families came from the island of Anafi and wanted to create surroundings that would remind them of home Today the narrow lanes with their neat whitewashed cottages and plethora of potted geraniums are still reminiscent of the Aegean settlements across the waterPlaka lies below Anafiotika and fills the space between the ancient and modern city stretching to Ods Ermou and Syntagma Square to the north This was the center of population from Byzantine times through to Greek independence and thus can be called Athens Old Town The maze of narrowmostly trafficfreestreets is a delight to explore and there are numerous shops and eateries to choose from Playful cats dart down the narrow alleyways and you may be lucky to hear the Terpsichordean notes of the laterna drifting through the streetsthese handturned barrel organs are now becoming extremely rare Plaka is particularly atmospheric in the evenings when locals enjoy a volta or stroll before dinner and tavernas set tables out on the narrow side streets It is almost a living museum with Byzantine Churches NeoClassical mansions housing galleries or collectibles stores and a wealth of historical detail at every turn Do look beyond the tempting shop fronts to really get the most out of your tour Though youll want to simply follow your nose around the district here are the locations of the main historical attractions of PlakaAt Kidathinon  youll find the Museum of Greek Folk Art which offers an interesting collection of embroidery lace and numerous liturgical garments Spinning and weaving is also highlighted along with traditional puppets and festival masks and costumes The collection features artifacts from all over Greece and her islands Other divisions of the folk art museum can be found around the city On the southern end of Ods Adrianou in a small square surrounded by cafs is the Monument of Lysicrates Dating from the fourth century bc it consists of a series of curved panels and columns creating a circular structure supporting a dome made from a single block of Pentelic marble Originally this would have been topped by a bronze tripoda prize awarded in choral competitions during the Classical era In the th century a Capuchin monastery occupied land all around the monument and the interior of the base was used as a guest room Lord Byron stayed here in  and is said to have written some of his work while enjoying the seclusionOne mansion on Ods Pans high up near the Acropolis has been turned into a museum The Kanellpoulos Museum which opened in  has a family collection of artifacts from many eras of Athens history Mycenaean figurines and pottery Classical Greek and Roman sculpture and Byzantine icons frescoes and tapestries are all welldisplayed and illustrate very effectively the varied influences that make up the history of the cityTo the Greek and Roman AgorasFrom Plaka there are numerous streets leading northwest towards the sites of the Roman and Greek Agoras however the most direct route is via Ods Adrianou Take a short diversion right along Ods Paleologolou to explore Mitrpolis Cathedral of the City of Athens Built in the s following Greek independence from the remains of over  churches it is now surrounded by a network of supporting scaffolding erected following damage sustained in the  earthquake The cathedral is a focus for prayer particularly to the Black Madonna surrounded by an ornate silver frame In the shadow of the cathedral is the tiny Mikr Mitrpolis Little Cathedral officially named Panaya Gorgoepkos and sometimes known as Ayios Elefthrios or freedom church the name given after King Otto left the Greek throne Dating from the th century the church was built using stone from the ancient sites of the city Wander around its exterior walls to see sections from Greek and Roman columns or fragments of ornate pedimentsNearbywhere Mitropoleos meets Pentelisis another church Aya Dinamis which means the holy power of the Virgin This tiny place of worship has survived the redevelopment of the district but now sits literally underneath a modern office blockWhen Adrianou meets Ods Eolou it is cut by excavations on the site of Hadrians Library Adrianou once passed directly through the site and still continues on the other side The site is closed to the public but can easily be viewed from the surrounding streets Built in ad  only the western wall is in good order Turn left along Eolou to find the site of the Roman Agora Founded in the first century ad to accommodate an expanding Athens the ornate entrance gate was commissioned by Julius Caesar in honor of Athena Archegetis Founder of the City Much of the north and west wall of the Agora lies unexcavated under the houses of Plaka but the south wall and the remains of the south colonnade are there along with a series of shops near the ticket office The most remarkable building in the Agora complex though it was outside the Agora when built is the Tower of the Winds This ornate octagonalshaped structure was a clock and meteorological station built by astronomer Andronikos in the first century bc Each of the eight faces corresponds to a cardinal point on the compass and is decorated with an ornate frieze depicting the wind blowing from that direction The timing device was waterdriven with a supply from the Acropolis aboveJust beside the Agora youll see one of only two mosques still standing in the cityit now houses an archaeological workshop and is not open to the public Nearby on Ods Diogenous is the Museum of Greek Folk Music with a fascinating collection of instruments and musical recordings bringing the varied regional folk music of Greece to lifeContinue along Adrianou to find the remains of the Ancient Greek Agorabirthplace of western democracy and the social heart of the ancient citystate of Athens agora comes from the Greek agiero meaning to assemble From the sixth century bc this area played host to a number of activities including religious and political meetings law courts education shopping or simply passing the time of day Here Socrates regaled the people with his philosophical theoriesunfortunately for him he fell foul of the authorities and was put to death in  bc St Paul met an audience of skeptics who argued against him when he gave a speech here in ad  The whole area was razed during Barbarian attacks in the centuries following the fall of the Roman Empire and was covered with new buildings during Byzantine times all of which had to be cleared when excavations beganFrom the entrance at Adrianou there are two other entrances to the site look immediately to your right to see remains of the Altar of the Twelve Gods a small monument from where distances from Athens to all other points in the Greek world were measured This was truly the center of the world during the Classical Greek era Directly ahead in the area of the central Agora the outline of the Altar of Ares and Temple of Ares can be seen in gravel Behind this the remains of the Odeon of Agrippa built in  bc and the Royal Palace overlaid by two later stoas can be discerned In the southeast corner of the site the th century church of Ayios Apostoloi is the only building on the site remaining from the Byzantine era Greatly changed over the centuries it was fully restored to its original form in the late s The paintings in the narthex are original others were transplanted from the Hephaisteion see below when it was deconsecratedTo the right facing the main square are two Bouleuterions council chambers These served the city from the time of Kleisthenes and his Council of  in the late fifth century bc Beyond the council chambers stands the bestpreserved temple in Athensthe Hephaisteion or Temple of Hephaistos also known as the Thisio The design of the temple is classic Doric and was completed after the Persian invasions Hephaistos was the god of metalworking and this temple was set at the heart of the smithing and ironmongery district of the city Later it was converted into a church with the addition of interior walls and this survived through Ottoman timesthe last services were performed in the s For some years following it served as the first archaeological museum in Greece The exterior of the temple is wellpreserved and uses the same curved lines as the Parthenon though the columns are more slender and the entablature horizontal platform above the columns sturdier The metopes carved space on a Doric frieze around the entablature depict the legendary feats of Heracles and Theseus Surrounding the temple is a garden area attempting to recreate a garden that existed here in the ancient era It includes the same plants speciesmedicinal and herbalthat were popular during that time The eastern flank of the Agora site is dominated by the Stoa of Attalos First erected by King Attalos of Pergamon and opened in  bc it was faithfully recreated during the s to offer us a stunning vision of what communal buildings were like in ancient times Stoas were extremely popular in the Roman era and all large settlements had one These long porches or porticos provided shade in summer and shelter in winter and they were often used to link important community buildings The Stoa of Attalos was a twostory construction with rooms at the back that housed small shops Today it is home to the Agora Museum and displays numerous artifacts found at this extensive sight Here youll find a range of everyday objects not seen in the Acropolis Museum in addition to religious and civic statuary and mosaicsThe route of the great sacred way that linked the Agora with the Acropolis aboveand that was used during the Panathenaic Festivalis now being excavated and rebuilt to allow visitors to walk in the footsteps of the ancient AtheniansMonastirki and ThissioThe area immediately to the north of the Greek AgoraMonastirkiis one of the most interesting in Athens Under the Ottomans it held the main market and despite the great amount of archaeological excavation that has taken place since the s it still retains the atmosphere of an oriental bazaar Its streets are full of small trinket shops coffee shops and bars In a throwback to ancient times there is still a metalworking and blacksmith area that produces handmade items and you can find textiles ceramics and copies of the latest streetwear Monastirki is particularly cosmopolitan on Sundays when a huge flea market fills the streets and you can haggle over furniture and knickknacks for that unique remembrance of your tripThe district centers on Monastirki Square with its busy Metro station The church at its heartthe Pantnassais thought to be part of a large monastery complex that sat here before the Ottoman invasion As if to reiterate this historical event the south side of the square is dominated by the Mosque of Tsistarkis built in  and named after the Ottoman governor of the time It now houses the ceramics branch of the Museum of Greek Folk Art The main thoroughfare cutting through the district is Ods Ermou which leads east to Syntagma Square see page  Ermou is one of the main shopping streets of the city and numerous European retailers have outlets here A small square cuts its path just a little way from Monastirki Square and it is decorated with the beautiful Byzantine church of Kapnikara the official church of Athens University Built in the th century its dome is supported by four Roman columns and its modern frescoes were created in the s by Fotis Kondoglou Kapnikara was earmarked for demolition in the s but was saved by the personal intervention of Prince Ludwig of Bavaria father of Greeces first kingWell take the route west from Monastirki Square as if leaving the city This leads us one kilometer  miles to the archaeological site of Kerameiks As you walk along immediately to the north of Ermou on your right is the district of Psir Unspoiled by tourism there is a very Greek atmosphere in the maze of narrow streets and some excellent tavernas among its traditional shopsThe excavated area of Kerameiks is interesting because it incorporates a section of the  bc city wall and the ceremonial entranceways into Athens from the cities of Eleusis to the west and Piraeus to the south The Panathenian Festival Procession would start from here on its journey to the Acropolis and the procession of the Eleusian Mysteries would leave from here through the Sacred Gate and along the Sacred Way The most important building found here is the Pompeion where procession paraphernalia was stored and where those involved in major processions would ready themselves Kerameiks was named for the potters who worked here within the city walls Inner Kerameiks directly on the site of good clay deposits Their work was carried around the Greek empire and is now displayed in museums worldwide but they were not highly regarded by citizens in ancient times Outside the wall Outer Kerameiks was the major cemetery of the city it was forbidden to bury the dead within the city walls with burials dating from the th century bc Major figures from Greek history including Pericles were buried here and their funerary artifacts are some of the most exquisite items found during excavations around the city A small museum has burial finds dating from thsixth centuries bc but youll see many more in the National Archaeological MuseumFor those whose taste leans towards postindustrial landscapes just a little way beyond Kerameiksacross Ods Pireosis the old gas works of Gazi which has been converted into the Museum of Industrial Architecture It also hosts a regular program of art and photography exhibitionsOmonia Square Platea OmniasFrom Monastirki Station take the straight thoroughfare of Athinas to Omonia Square Omonia means Concord the commercial heart of the modern city As you walk youll pass through the Municipal Market area of Athens where the streets buzz with constant activity goods spill out onto walls and alleyways and people throng the sidewalks The market operates from early morning to mid afternoon Youll also pass Platea Dimarkou also known as Platea Kotzi where youll find several fine NeoClassical buildings including the Mel Mansion  now a Bank of Greece building The center of the square has benefited from archaeological exploration during the s and Athens Town Hall is on the left flank as you almost reach Omonia SquareThe rather shabby modern buildings belie Omonias importance Its always busy with people there are some good cafs and restaurants and some of the most prestigious companies have offices here Combine this with the bus and Metro routes that run through it and you have a major city hub The National Archaeological MuseumA tenminute walk north of the square on Ods Patission is the National Archaeological Museum one of the most prestigious archaeological collections in the world Finds cover  years of Greek history and have been brought from sites all across Greece The collection brings the ancient Greek world to life shedding light on almost every aspect of the daily activities of the citizens Prepare to spend at least two hours here dont try and rush this amazing collection The map of the museum issued with your ticket will be a great help in finding your way around the somewhat confusing array of rooms and corridors You are sure to find your own favorites but here are a few acknowledged highlights In the prehistoric collection rooms  enjoy the treasuretrove found at Mycenae including the exquisite gold Mask of Agamemnon Schiemann thought that this was placed over the face of the dead King Agamemnon around  bc but in fact it dates from over  years earlier the prehistoric rooms also have a collection of Cycladic figures dating from the third millennium bc The simple rounded female figures were funerary or religious objects and are in total contrast to the intricate pediment and frieze carvings and religious statuary found at temples on the Acropolis and in the Acropolis Museum Youll also see a rare male figure among the collection and the beautiful Harp Playera more complex carving in the same styleRooms  concentrate on sculptureperhaps the greatest collection of ancient sculpture in the worldand these are displayed to show the chronological development of the art form Simply styled male and female figures kouros and kore of the Achaiac Age seventhfifth century bc give way to more ornate and literal human forms as you walk through the collection into the Classical Age and then on to the Hellenistic and Roman eras Greek gods are popular themes followed by eminent human figures of Roman times Room  holds the important early statue of Artemis by Nikandre of Naxos c bcRoom  is dominated by a fine statue of Poseidon in bronze  bc found in the sea off the island of Euboea The god is set to launch his trident against foes unknown The Hall of the Stairs hosts another statue dredged from the sea that of the Jockey of the Artemision The diminutive jockey drives on the handsome steed which has its two front legs raised into the air as if about to leap over an invisible obstacleRooms  have a collection of bronzes including votive offerings found at the Idaean Cave in Cretemythical birthplace of the god Zeus Rooms  and  display artifacts from Egypt covering every era of history in the land of the Pharaohs including the Ptolemaic period when Ptolemy a general under Alexander the Great and therefore of Greek descent took control of Egypt One of his descendants was Cleopatra perhaps this most famous ancient queen Second floor room  is devoted to finds from Akrotiri a th century bc settlement on Santorini in the Aegean The frescoes found while excavating the site are particularly fine and offer a glimpse into a world lost through a devastating earthquake around  bc The remaining rooms on the second floorfeature an amazing collection of pottery and miniature objects in contrast to the epically proportioned artifacts on the ground floorWhen you have finished your tour head one block north to Pedion Areos a large park area created in the s where you can enjoy the fresh air before continuing your explorationsFrom Omonia to SyntagmaThree major thoroughfares run parallel between Omonia Square and nearby Syntagma Square Stadhiou is perhaps the busiest with several major department stores and highclass stores that sell jewelry and the best designer names plus two modern stoas packed with bookstores When you reach the small square of Klathmonos youll find the Museum of the City of Athens housed in the former King Ottos palace of the th century Nearer to Syntagma in Koloktroni Square is the National Historical Museum with a collection of artifacts dating from postClassical times This is a useful museum to visit if you have a particular interest in postindependence Greece as many artifacts add detail to the individuals and incidents that shaped the new countryNortheast of Stadhiou is Panepistimiou University Street officially named Elefthera Venizlou after the Cretan statesman This also plays host to several important buildings The National Library University and National Academy all sit here confirming it as the academic and intellectual heart of modern Athens All three are NeoClassical in design and made of Pentelic marble helping to give a feel of how the Agora of the ancient city may have looked at its prime The Academy  is perhaps the most impressive of the three and was designed by Theophilus Hansenpreeminent architect of his generation A native of Denmark Hansen was responsible for the Zappion and Royal Observatory in Athens and numerous buildings in Vienna Austria The seated figures of Plato and Socrates sit guarding the Academy entrance and an intricately carved pediment depicts the gods and goddesses of the ancient world these were sculpted by Leondas Drsis Come and look at these carvings through binoculars to get a feel of how richly decorated the temples and communal buildings of the ancient world originally were Walking towards Syntagma youll pass the Renaissancestyle house of Heinrich Schliemann that most famous of archaeologists who was instrumental in turning the myth of the Mycenaeans and the Trojan War into factThe outwardmost thoroughfare is Akadimias which runs behind the Library University and Academy Opposite these buildings youll find the Athens Cultural Center housed in a former hospital dating from the s There are auditoria and cultural exhibitions here and a small Theater Museum has displays charting the development of this art since ancient timesSyntagma Squareofficially Plateia Syntagmatos or Constitution Squareis perhaps the emotional home of modern Athens It is dominated by the imposing faade of the Parliament building or Vouli which was built as the new royal palace following independence officially opened in  The use of Pentelic marble on the faade with a Doricstyle prolylaia above street level echoes use and form in the ancient city In front of the building the Memorial of the Unknown Soldier commemorates all Greeks who have fallen in war Decorated with a modern carved relief of a Classical theme the marble is inscribed with the words of an oration by Pericles to honor the dead of the wars of the Peloponneseit is said that the tombs of these ancient soldiers lie under this very spot The tomb is guarded day and night by the vzonestraditionally dressed soldiers who became Royal Guards and then presidential guards following the war of independence The formal

position and its dimensions m  ft long and  m  ft wide with columns of over  m  ft in heightare truly majestic The temple took  years to complete and it was Hadrian who finished the task in the second century ad One hundred and eight columns originally surrounded an inner sanctum that protected a goldandivory statue of Zeus Today only  are still standing but their Corinthian capitals have a wonderful form and elegance In ancient times the temple sat close to the banks of the River Ilissos creating an even more beautiful vista Today the river still flows but its path lies beneath the cityNearby along Vas Olgas is the impressive Olympic Stadium sitting in the lea of Ardittou Hill The stadium was constructed for the ancient Panathanaic Games when each of the surrounding citystates sent delegations to compete During Roman times beastbaiting also took place here Dating from the third century bc the complex was refurbished for the games of ad  but was disused and left to decay

hereLycabettus and KolonakiTo the west of the bare sheer rock of the Acropolis is a rival hillthe verdant pineclad Lycabettus which makes an inviting diversion from the archaeological sites of the city Here youll be able to sit in shade and listen to the birds The hill was never settled in ancient times because there was no water supply You can reach the upper slopes by funicular When you reach the top station walk to the small chapels of Ayios Isidoros and Ayios Georgioscenter of the Easter celebrations for the citya modern amphitheater for summer performances and wonderful views across Athens where major attractions are pointed out on marble panoramas Though there are fixed telescopes here having your own binoculars is a boon to really take in the detailSurrounding the lower slopes

stores restaurants and bars It is one of the best parts of the city to eat out in the evening with a range of good international eateries in addition to traditional Greek tavernasExcursionsTheres no doubt that Athens is a fascinating city but with the rush of traffic and the push of the crowds even these attractions can begin to pall after a few days Luckily you are perfectly placed to take in numerous excursions for the day or a few dayseither on an organized itinerary or under your own steam This city break can truly be a three or fourinone vacation if you wishPiraeusSituated only  km  miles south of Athens and almost indistinguishable from the sprawling capital is Piraeus This city of over half a million people is actually the third largest Metropolis in Greece and is its largest port Although many people simply use Piraeus as a departure point for the myriad Greek islands of the Aegean the city has its own attractions being settled since ancient times This was not the port that served the citystate of Athens because it could not be seen from the city and was therefore vulnerable to attack It was first settled around  bc when long defensive walls were built from Athens to the sea By the time of Philip of Macedon it had become a thriving commercial port Though it fell into decline as did Athens through the late first and second millennium it was reenergized following independence Its location so close to the new capital ensured its commercial success Today Piraeus is above all a working city with some less than prosperous areas Stay on the main thoroughfares as you exploreTaking the Metro the overland electric railway section from downtown Athens costs only drs and brings you directly to the waterside Huge quaysides in the Main Harbor cater to hundreds of ferries large and small and youll see fleets of large container ships laying anchor offshore Walking south along the quaysides brings you to a small shady square with the Cathedral of Agia Triada on its northern flank Take this street Dimokratias to the Town Hall and visit the lively daily market that takes place in the surrounding streetsTake a right down Lampraki to reach the pretty harbor of

oceangoing vessels A wide promenadeAkti Moutsopoulouframes the bay and this is where local people come to stroll in the evenings and on weekendsyou can sit at a portside caf and watch the world go byNorth from Zea harbor is another pretty harbor Mikrolimani Small Harbor or Tourkolimani where youll find the fishing fleet and some good fish tavernas Or head south towards the main historical attractions of PiraeusFrom the south side of Zea harbor it is only a short walk to the Archaeological Museum of Piraeus The rather dour building hides a treasuretrove of statuary and other artifacts found during excavation of the ancient shrines of the city and communal buildings such as the Agora Pride of place goes to the Piraeus Kouros the oldest fullsize bronze figure depicting the god Apollo On the grounds of the museum are scant remains of the ancient Theater of ZeaWalking further south along the promenade past remnants of the ancient sea wall brings you to another small bay where you will find the Hellenic Maritime Museum a semicircular museum with small garden in front complete with cannon Rooms display an eclectic series of artifacts with dioramas of the great Battle of Salamis in  bc letters from the naval heroes of Greek independence and numerous items salvaged from the seas around the Attica coastlineThe Saronic IslandsThe islands closest to Athens are those of the Saronic Gulf the nearest only  minutes from Piraeus by hydrofoil These represent a total contrast to the bustle of the city and a perfect antidote to the acres of concrete you find thereHydrofoils for the Saronic islands depart from Quay I at Piraeus HarborAeginaThis is the closest island to the mainland and the pretty quayside of Aegina Town with its NeoClassical buildings awaits as you disembark Youll see a pretty whitewashed church protecting the harbor entrance Stroll along the waters edge past the colorful fishing fleet have lunch at a seafront taverna or buy some of the pistachio nuts or local ceramics for which the island is famed The resort of Agia Marina is  km  miles from the town on the west coast and has a good childfriendly beach and most people make a trip to the nearby fifth century bc Temple of Aphaia for some more historyAegina is a delight out of season but can be very busy especially on summer weekends Many houses on the island are second homes for wealthy Athenian familiesPorosPoros lies less than  m  ft from the Greek mainland off the northeastern coast of the Argolid Peninsula and  minutes from Piraeus by hydrofoil Small sailboats crowd the narrow straits and its a yachtsmans paradise in the summer months Poros Townthe only settlement on the islandis a maze of narrow winding streets rising up a small hill The seafront is the hub of all activity with tavernas and cafs lining the waterside The rest of Poros is covered with verdant pine forest and the coastline is dotted with small rocky covesgreat for swimming and snorkelingA km mile hike to the interior brings you to the remains of the Temple of Poseidon where the famous Greek orator Demosthenes committed suicide in  bc rather than surrendering to Alexander the Greats forcesHydra Only  hour  minutes from Athens by hydrofoil Hydra is the most exclusive of the Saronic islands and your approach into the harbor is the most dramatic The beautiful port of Hydra Town keeps its secret hidden until the very last moment and when the panorama comes into view its time to get the camera ready Above the shoreline of the narrow cove lie a series of low hills and each of these are blanketed with NeoClassical Italianate mansions painted in myriad dusty hues There are no cars on Hydraonly donkeys No sandy beaches make the water some of the clearest in the area for snorkelingStill most people dont visit Hydra for any activity other than to see and be seen In the s the island was an artist colony and today it has developed into a place for the beautiful people The boutiques are some of the most exclusive in the Mediterranean intermingled with the Bohemian craft galleries exclusive restaurants tavernas chic cafs and Greek ouzeriesIf you dont want to max your credit card dont worryHydra has not yet lost its charm that is freeofcharge You can simply enjoy strolling along the narrow streets with a pretty view on each corner before you head back to Athens on the late hydrofoilSpetsesAt two hours away from Piraeus by hydrofoil Spetses is the most remote of the Saronic islands and less crowded with Athenians than the three other islands There are some good sandy bays to enjoy and Spetses Townsleepy by day yet with a vibrant nightlifeoffers a good mooring spot for sailboats Perhaps a little too far for a day trip Spetses could make a good option for a twopart vacationCorinth and the ArgolidThe history of Ancient Greece is littered with the feats of citystates led by great leaders of which Athens is of course the most famed Within a days journey of the capital are the sites of two such citystates in an area known as the Argolid These can be viewed as part of an actionpacked day either independently or as part of an organized tour but make an excellent two or threeday excursion for those who want to take it at a more gentle paceCorinthIn ancient times Corinth rivaled Athens in its power and influence It mimicked the layout of the larger citya town radiated out from the base of a rocky pinnacle that housed religious templesthough at Corinth the hill is much higher than at AthensThe site was first settled by Mycenaeans because it had an excellent natural water supply and it reached its first level of prosperity around the seventh century bc It became Athens enemy when it sided with the Spartans during the devastating wars of the fourth century bc but the city recovered quickly from the defeat and had a second period of influence that began during the third century bc when Philip of Macedonia made it the capital of the Corinthian League In  bc it became head of a group of independent Greek cities of the Achaean League Ravaged by the Romans in  bc it rose again from the ashes and was a bustling city when St Paul came to preach here He won more support than in Athens and planted the seeds of a very successful early Christian church Several major earthquakes in the early Christian era saw the citys final declineLuckily for us the modern city of Corinth lies several kilometers to the northeast of the site and this leaves much of the ancient city for us to explore Most prominent as you approach the site is the Temple of Apollo built in the sixth century bc and one of the oldest buildings in Corinth Many other remains date from the Roman era including ornate entrances round the Fountain of Peirene where you can still hear the waters flowing through caves at the rear and the Lechaion Road that linked the city to Athenswith worn cart tracks clearly visible in the marble slabs The site museum has some interesting finds and has a number of dioramas depicting Corinth as it would once have lookedAfter visiting the ancient city head up the hill to take in the magnificent site of Acrocorinth standing sentinel above Fortified since the seventh century bc the summit is crisscrossed with miles of high stone walls dating from this time that were expanded during the Byzantine and Ottoman eras At the summit within three layers of protective wall are the remains of a Temple of Aphrodite an early Christian Basilica Byzantine cisterns a Frankish Tower and Ottoman mosques and fountainsthis is Greek history in a nutshellThough the modern city of Corinth has little to draw the visitor a modern engineering marvel lies just outside its boundary The Corinth Canal cuts the narrow isthmus that links the Peloponnese with the Greek mainland and splits the Saronic Gulf from the Gulf of Corinth this links to the Adriatic further west Sailing around the Peloponnese to Athens not only added extra time to the journey but also carried ships through some of the most dangerous waters in the Mediterraneanespecially in the winter Ancient Greeks did not attempt to sail around but portaged their huge vessels across the  km  mile wide isthmus and as early as ad  the Roman Emperor Nero was making the first attempts at cutting a canal It would not become reality for another  years In  after eleven years of digging a channel  m  ft deep  m  ft wide with  m  ft of water opened for shipping taking a single ship at a time between the two gulfsThe ArgolidFrom the th to the th century bc this rocky peninsula was one of the most important centers in the known world It was from here that the mighty Mycenaean empire grew to encompass mainland Greece and the northern Aegean islands The exploits of the Mycenaeans and their greatest leader Agamemnon were thought to be myth until the archaeologist Heinrich Schliemann set out to find evidence of the sites of Homers stories of Troy and Mycenae He was successful in doing both and transformed the world of archaeologyand mans view of historySchliemann found the remains of the city of Mycenae buried under thousands of years worth of debris in a sheltered valley some  km  miles south of Corinth It was so well hidden that the site had been completely forgotten and it surprisingly had not been plundered by robbers The military might of the Mycenaeans had been well documented by Homer but nothing could prepare the archaeologists for the artistic treasures found at the site As they dug through the remains the tombs of several kings were discovered each skeleton lay where it had been carefully buried the faces covered in a mask of pure gold Exquisite statuary and intricate jewelry found in the family tombs below show a softer side of these enigmatic people and brought the world of Agamemnon to life All the artifacts from the site were taken to Athens and many are now on display in the National Archaeological MuseumThe archaeological site of Mycenae now stripped of its treasures still makes a majestic scene though it is rather smaller than one might imagine The large Cyclopean Wallshuge roughhewn blocks of granite laid one atop another with extreme precisionare so called because their enemies could not believe that humans could be responsible for the construction and gave the credit to the oneeyed giant of myth These date from around  bc and surround and protect the inner sanctum through which the only entrance is the worldfamous Lions Gate decorated with the earliest known monumental sculpture in EuropeImmediately as you enter the compound you can get a birdseye view of Grave Circle A where the Royal grave shafts were found and then climb to the top of the settlement to view the remains of the Royal Palace From here the views of the surrounding rolling countryside are magnificentHalf a mile below the city is an immense Beehive tomb cut into the hillside and lined with stone blocks The acoustics inside the tomb are very precise exaggerating the sound of your approaching fellow visitors If a party of schoolchildren arrive to test out the tomb it may be a good idea to beat a hasty retreat for the sake of your earsFurther east from Mycenae is another ancient site also renowned for its acoustics The Theater of Epidauros Epidavros was built in the fourth century bc and could hold an audience of  people Live performances still take place here every summer The theater does not sit in splendid isolation but was part of a large settlement based around the Sanctuary of Asklepiosone of the most important centers of healing in the ancient world Today there is little left of the site and it is difficult to imagine hospitals spas and faithhealing practices catering to travelers from across the Greek worldThe port town of Nafplio makes the perfect base for touring the area or perhaps a spot to have lunch while on your tour Set on the south coast of the Argolid it has been a strategic strongpoint for centuries and boasts no less than four castles dating from Byzantine and Venetian timeson far more ancient foundationscalled Akronafplia Castle The modern settlement has an urbane gentility with an oldtown of grand Italianate mansions linked by cobbled walkways Pretty tavernas set tables out in the street and tempt you with fresh seafood caught by the small fishing boats in the harbor The seaside promenade flanked by smart cafs is where youll find locals and Athenians alike strolling in the cooling evening air Look out towards the tiny fortified island of Bourzi you can even take a boat trip to explore the castle if time allowsSounionThe windswept peninsula of southern Attica reaches out towards the Aegean Sea and at its very tip  km miles south of Athens the ancients built a beautiful Temple to Poseidon the God of that watery realm The views from here are beautiful whatever the time of daybut the sunsets are particularly spectacularThe temple itself is one of the finest in Greece Of the  Doric columns only  are still in situ and the ornate frieze on the pediment and entablature has been ravaged by the salty air but the whole effect of the building combined with the settingwith beach on one side and sheer drop on the otheris magnificentSounion is reached by following the coast road from the capital down through several lovely resorts with private beaches Glyfda is the closest to Athens and Vouliagmni is the furthest awayDaphni and EleusisAthens has a beautiful downtown area but it is one of the largest cities in Europe and it also has an industrial element mostly based around the southern and eastern suburbs Incongruous among the landscapes of oil refineries and factories youll find historical gems to explore Ten kilometers  miles west of Athens is the Monastery of Daphni soon to be linked with the downtown area by Metro extension built on the site of an earlier Temple of Apollo Founded in the fifth or sixth century ad the site was refurbished and extended in the th century but sacked and abandoned before being occupied by Orthodox monks in the th century Restoration took place after WWII and again in the s The pretty Byzantine church c has a stoneandtile dome exterior but is famed throughout Greece for the fantastic mosaics that decorate the interior particularly that of Christ Pantocrator in the main domeThrough this same industrial area runs the Sacred Way that linked Athens with the city of Eleusis In ancient times the way was lined with shrines and tombs which are now and again brought to light when redevelopment takes place Eleusis was home to the Sanctuary of Demeter and the Eleusian Mysteriesa series of complex and enigmatic rituals only performed by initiates of the order The order thrived from the Mycenaean era to the coming of Christianity Annual celebrations to Demeter took place in Athens each September with a public festival and a secret religious rite that transformed chosen followers into initiates of the secrets A procession would leave Eleusis and walk along the Sacred Way entering Athens via the Sacred Gate at Kerameikos see page  before proceeding to the AcropolisIn Eleusis the sacred way led directly to the Sanctuary of Demeter and a large Temple of Artemis with a forecourt where the initiates would gather in preparation for the procession A great Propylaia marked the entrance to the towna copy of that at the Acropolis The Precinct of Demeter lay in a walled complex and its inner sanctum the Periklean Telesterion where only initiates were allowed to enter sat within the temple You will also find the remains of more mundane structures such as the Bouleuterion and gymnasium A museum on site displays extremely good artifacts found among the ruinsDelphiWhere the mysteries of Eleusis were only open to a few initiates advice from the Oracle at Delphi was open to all It was simply a matter of making your way to the Sanctuary of Apollo now three hours by road from Athens to the northwest In ancient times this was the spiritual center of the Greek world and people would travel by land or sea to consult the gods No important decisions of state could be made without consulting the Oracle here and when the Colossus of Rhodes was toppled in an earthquake the people of that citystate in the Aegean left it where it lay after advice from the Oracle not to rebuild itThere has been a temple here since prehistoric times when Gaia the EarthMother goddess was worshipped Even in these early times the gods would be consulted with the oracle issuing their verdicts from the Rock of Sybil Later Olympian gods usurped Gaia but the sanctuary retained its role Legend says that the God Apollo arrived at Delphi by sea on a dolphin and slayed the monstrous python that guarded the entrance to the sanctuary Thus the temple was named in his honorA modern road cuts through the remains and the approach to the site from the parking lot leads first to the Roman Agora where pilgrims would stock up on supplies and offerings for the temple only a few minutes away Here you can see the remains of the Sanctuary of Apollo the nearby waters of the Kastalian Springs where pilgrims would purify themselves before their consultation and the Rock of Sybil where the oracle proclaimed the verdict of the gods The modern museum has a wonderful collection of statuary treasure and other artifacts found at the siteBelow the road are the remains of a large gymnasium and the temple of Athena Pronaia where pilgrims would make their first religious stop on the climb to the sanctuary Its tholos columned rotunda is set in a beautiful wooded lot with the sanctuary on the hillside behind
