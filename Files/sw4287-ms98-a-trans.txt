               okay well lets see invasions of privacy actually um i cant think of too many except uh oh occasionally my employer   uhhuh   or um sometimes it seems of a bit of an invasion when i when i get calls from phone solicitors   yeah thats thats one of the thats also thats also for me invasion of privacy thats also a one of my pet peeves   well i get ive uh figured out someways creatively as to fight back with phone solicitors though   okay   like um well i ive discovered its kind of fun to try to take control of the conversation   uhhuh   uh like you know typically theyre reading from a script   right   so if you start asking questions right away   uhhuh   or do anything thats a little out out of the ordinary they get really thrown   oh i see   so like often what ill do is ill call up and say hi im Carla from XYZ company and ill say  excuse me uh whats your name again and uh act like im writing it down and  could i have your last name Carla   umhum umhum   and whats the name of your company you know and this by this time theyre really shook up and then um i ask her uh uh Carla could i have your home telephone number please   umhum   and and they go  well uh no i go well why not i said well i dont give out my home number as well why not i mean youre calling me at home i ought to be able to call you at home and that really shakes them up   well thats good you have a good sense of humor with it i i would do something like talk to them for like two minutes or something and then say uh       well you know the person to talk to isnt isnt isnt here right now wait a minute i think theyre just just a minute let me see if theyre here and then you leave   yeah right or put them on hold yeah   and see how long yeah see how long theyll wait but   yeah well another thing you can do is you can pretend that you got them on call waiting   yeah   say im on long distance on the other line  or you can just say no thank you and hang up   yeah right well i yeah well one of my Tad T A D okay uh one of my things one of my pet peeves is social security numbers   ah   and that is um im an adult but im going back to school and everywhere on the campus where i write a check its they want social security numbers on everything and i just go bananas because its just its number one its none of their business and it and it doesnt have they want it they want it to be put on your check   yeah and those are used as pin numbers a lot like with my bank uh uh if i want to move money around over the phone or check my balance or anything the pin number they want is the last four digits of the social security   right exactly and plus in California they have this new thing where they have the magnetic stripe on the back of the drivers license i dont have one yet yes   really i didnt know that huh   yes and thats another thing so they think they can plug you in for a profile see and i   well now where where do they use the stripe   in a a reader   oh you mean like when a cop pulls you over he runs it through a reader   or something right exactly   well thats amazing   but see whats happening though is that its starting be integrated to going theyre going to try to integrate it into the stores too   really   so so but the stores cant get all the information   yeah well like the stores can probably develop their own databases but they cant get into the department of motor vehicles   right   ill bet thats it   but the yeah but in other words so they can verify they can go in and and get the card and get information off it but the the police reader could get more information you might say   yeah because they could   but i i just i dont i i dont like the idea i dont like the idea of business and information you know and in the world is coming to is is is information   well then you know about caller ID   oh exactly oh yeah   yeah hey did you get uh did you get the number for this off of the internet   yeah i did   oh okay   are you an internet man   yeah most of the uh most of the people i talk to on here are on internet   yeah   yeah did you get it off of uh Telecom Digest   yeah   oh yeah i read that constantly   so do i yeah   yeah i post on there from work under Paul Cook at Proctor and Associates   okay   and at home as Tad Cook   i see yeah yeah i have an account at school so im able to do that   oh yeah well i got mine from a friend of mine uh owns a Unix consulting firm and gave me a free account there a few years ago   oh i see   so i can just dial it up and   so you have a free dial you dial in free yeah   yeah its real neat   yeah what is it is it eight hundred number or you just happen to be within the boundaries   oh im with yeah were in actually almost exactly the same exchange im real near his office   oh okay right yeah   but its uh its
