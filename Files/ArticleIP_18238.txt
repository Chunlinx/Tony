                                                            Over the past year and a half several pieces have appeared in Slatethat delve into the cultural and political dimensions of race in the UnitedStates In honor of Black History Month Slate is proud to present a fewof these pieces most of which have only been available tosubscribers                        Not JustTalk            Afivepoint program for better race relations                           ByJacob Weisberg                        To the growing legion ofClinton cynics the presidents racerelations initiative unveiled lastweekend is an exercise in cheap talk Liberal and conservative punditsdisagree about affirmative action and welfare reform but concur that a seriesof town meetings an advisory panel and an eloquent report are sorrysubstitutes for decisive action            If they were talkingabout Social Security reform the critics might have a point There endlesscalls for more study postpone necessary but unpopular changes in policy Butwhen it comes to race the power of words should not be so lightly dismissedIf President Clinton can use his rhetorical gifts to change attitudes on bothsides of the divide he will be accomplishing something of great significanceIts also all he can really hope to do right now The publics currentskepticism about activist government stymies new initiatives Having screwed uphis first term by misjudging the public demand for reform in the far lessdifficult area of health care the president would be foolish to present acostly multipoint program on race            But if we had the moneyand the willwhat would we doabout race relations A few years of peace prosperity and balancedbudgetsand a deeper awareness of just how bad our race problem ismay createa climate where such a program could succeed When that moment arrivesClinton or his successor should have a fivepoint plan ready            De facto segregationexists throughout society But the essence of the problem is the condition ofthe worstoff blacks in the urban ghetto White fears of the urban underclassare distorted into broader stereotypes about blacks as a whole which poisonrelations between the races at all levels Next week Dateline NBC willreport on the south Chicago suburb of Matteson which is tipping from anuppermiddleclass white suburb into an uppermiddleclass black one Mattesonought to be an integrationists paradise but whites are fleeing because oftheir concerns about crime and gangs declining schools and falling homeprices In reality schools safety even the property values havent declinedBut fear that these things will happen is not purely irrational If the whitesall leave decline may become a selffulfilling prophecy Thus subtle racismand a rational urge to selfpreservation are bound up together Unmaking theunderclass would answer white fears while giving lowerclass blacks a chancethey are now largely denied that of assimilating into the mainstream of anintegrated society            Perhaps the most important difference between people wholive in the ghetto and those who live outside it is that most of the formerarent employed Breaking down the underclass will require finding new ways todraw unemployed ghetto residents into the culture of work The jury will remainout for some time on the effects of the welfare cutoff signed by Clinton lastyear But even with the jobs provisions included in that bill its evidentthat there still arent sufficient jobs in the inner cities especially whenyou consider the prospects of unemployed men who arent eligible for welfareIn his latest book When Work Disappears  William Julius Wilson arguesthat there is a spatial mismatch between workers in the cities and jobs inthe suburbs Wilsons answer is a transportation program to get blacks to wherethe jobs are and a big WPAstyle jobs program the details of which he borrowsfrom the journalist Mickey Kaus These subminimumwage jobsdoing basicneglected work like repairing roads and bridgeswould constitute the missingbottom rung on an economic ladder            The second step is toaddress the extreme isolation of the innercity poor This means a housingstrategy that shifts more decisively in the direction it has been inching underClinton Instead of trying to tame innercity housing projects with differentkinds of architecture lower density and income mixing the Department ofHousing and Urban Development should redefine its purpose to help its tenantsescape the ghetto It should take a sledgehammer to every highriseunder its control and instead provide vouchers But these vouchers cant be thekind conservatives prefer which are sharply limited in value so as toforestall real integration while directing tenants toward privatesector slumsVouchers need to be worth enough to afford real avenues of escape They shouldalso steer beneficiaries away from other beneficiaries to keep pockets ofconcentrated poverty from reemerging farther from the citys core An easy wayto do this would be to enforce strict limits on the percentage of vouchertenants allowed in any one building            A less obvious factor fostering residential segregation isthe boundary between city and suburb When whites flee the central cities theytake with them most of the tax revenue and leave behind a downward spiral ofcity services As David Rusk a former mayor of Albuquerque argues in hisbook Cities Without Suburbs  metrowide governments where the suburbsand the city are joined tend to be more racially integrated and better off invarious other ways as well Washington cant erase jurisdictional frontiersbut it can encourage metropolitan government via tax incentives andcheerleading Such a policy would displease many black politicians since itstands to diminish black political representation in the short run But this isa tradeoff well worth making            All of these measurestogether will not cause the ghettos to disappear Providing escape routes fromthe inner city may make the ghettos worse by depriving them of their mostcompetent residents Whats needed alongside an evacuation plan is arealistic program to stabilize conditions for those left behind The goalshouldnt be to make the desert bloom It should be to create zones wherepeople can raise children in safety even if they must travel elsewhere to workTo accomplish this a strategy would need to focus on crime and schools            Of course neither law enforcement nor education isprincipally a federal responsibility But in both cases the feds can help Oncrime Clinton has had basically the right idea with his communitypolicinginitiative Cops walking the street create a sense of order and provide goodrole models for young boys This program should be expanded perhaps withincentives for police to live in the neighborhoods they patrol full timeSchools are a harder nut but not an uncrackable one There are a few goodschools even in Harlem which have succeeded by doing end runs around theunionized bureaucracy of the central system The federal government should domore to spur the creation of such institutions by providing resources and byhelping to equalize the shameful disparity in funding between rich and poordistricts generally            Some of these conceptshave demonstrated their success at an experimental level and are ripe forexpansion Others are just promising ideas that ought to be tried Allunfortunately are expensive and sure to be controversial They cant simply befoisted on a reluctant public To lay the groundwork for useful action on racerelations we need exactly what President Clinton is proposing as a startingpoint honest talk and lots of it                           Illustration by Robert Neubecker
