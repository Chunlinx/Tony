                                  JD Salinger Failed Recluse            JD Salinger is inevitably described as the mostprivate man in America  Esquire  or the most private of literaryfigures the New York Times  In the introduction to his justpublishedSalinger biography Paul Alexander calls the Bard of Cornish the one figure inthe twentieth century who didnt want his biography written Yet Salinger hasalready been the subject of two biographies            If Salinger really wants to be left alone he isgoing about it in a very strange way He doesnt live in a gated community Hesummons perfect strangers into his hideaway He sues people and then phonesthe media to spread the story            Maybe Salinger should take a page from ThomasPynchon American letters other famous recluse who really wants to beleft alone Two years ago a London Sunday Times hireling beardedPynchon on the streets of Manhattan and nearly got his head bitten off Getyour fucking hand out of my face Pynchon bellowed            Heres the Tale of theTape in the Battle of the Hermit Divas             Location                           Salinger               Salinger has lived on the same Cornish NH property for over  years Otherthan a No Trespassing sign there is no particular barrier to entry from thefictional Ray Kinsella of Shoeless Joe to the notorious stalkerazziphotographer Paul Adao of the New York Post  no one has ever had muchtrouble finding the place Up until recently Salinger used to chat casuallywith his doorsteppersunless they were journalists The next generation ofvisitors wont even have to interrogate the locals as Alexander providesdirections in his new book            On the one hand its churlish to suggest thatSalinger should move just to protect himself from his public On the otherhand people have moved for less                           Pynchon                Until recently no one was reallysure where Pynchon lived Seattle Mexico Northern California Probably all ofthe above Much ink has been shed in proving that Pynchon spent several yearsin Californias Mendocino County researching his novel Vineland andwriting letters to the local newspaper under the name Wanda Tinasky But thatmay have been a hoax             Litigation                           Salinger                In Salinger sued the editor of an unauthorized collection of his stories and bookstores that stocked the book Lest his filing go unnoticed he phonedNew York Times reporter Lacey Fosburgh to alert her to the case He madePage One            In  he sued to blockpublication of Ian Hamiltons biography In Search of JD Salinger  andforced the biographer to remove many quotations from the published work Thiskept his name in the papers for months and forced him to give a sixhour longdeposition to Hamiltons lawyer a portion of which appears for the first timein Alexanders book In  Salingers agent forbade a nonprofit Catcherin the Rye Web site from using quotations from the novel garnering theusual rash of publicity             Lady Friends                           Salinger                In the yearold Salinger wrote the notorious fan letter to theyearold Joyce Maynard who had just written a New York TimesMagazine cover story about herself The rest is herstory Salinger wrotesimilar letters to other young female writers He also had a fascination withactresses At age  he wrote a fan letter to the year old actress ElaineJoyce whom he had seen in the TV show Mr Merlin  That resulted in alongrunning affair A few years later he developed a fascination with thecomely Catherine Oxenberg then starring in the TV show Dynasty Salinger traveled to California and had shown up on the set according tobiographer Hamilton He had to be escorted off                           Pynchon                As befits a man guarding as opposedto flaunting his privacy Pynchon has kept his private life private Pastgirlfriends have spoken with journalists mainly to report that Pynchon wascharming and a tad eccentric In the early s Jules Siegel a collegefriend wrote an article for Playboy titled Who Is Thomas Pynchon andWhy Did He Take Off With My Wife The story praised Pynchon as a wonderfullover sensitive and quick with the ability to project a mood that turned themost ordinary surroundings into a scene out of a masterful film             For almost a decade now Pynchon has been married to hisliterary agent and keeping to himself Cunningly Pynchon is hiding in plainview He lives in Manhattan and escorts his son to and from school many days ofthe week A friend of mine says hes active in childrens activities and haseven been written up in the school newspaper The mothers love him he saysLocal literati know where he lives and they leave him alone            Why Why is Pynchon leftalone and Salinger harassed Theories abound Some people feel that Pynchon isa cerebral writer and his fans are mature in age and temperament Salingersgreat classic The Catcher in the Rye is about an adolescent and hasvisceral appeal to adolescents of all ages John Lennons assassin Mark DavidChapman and Ronald Reagans wouldbe killer John Hinckley were both majorCatcher fans            Another major difference is that Pynchon has continued topublish Unlike Salinger people have been able to access Pynchon and hisevolution as a writer explains Ron Rosenbaum who has followed both writerscareers closely In  Rosenbaum published an Esquire cover storylauding Salingers selfimposed Wall of Silence as his most powerful his mosteloquent perhaps his most lasting work of art            But I wonder Is the wall really art or is it anact And has the act now supplanted the art            Two years ago Salinger announced plans to publisha yearold story Hapworth   as a book After some negativepublicity he changed his plans The way Salinger handled the publicity hesaid he did not want was a bit too contrived to get attention itself PaulAlexander concludes at the end of his new biography He continues Salingerbecame the Greta Garbo of literature and then periodically when it may haveseemed he was about to be forgotten he resurfaced briefly just to remind thepublic that he wanted to be left alone  The whole act could have beencute or whimsical only it felt as if it were being put on by a mastershowman a genius spin doctor a publicrelations wizard hawking a story thepublic couldnt get enough of
