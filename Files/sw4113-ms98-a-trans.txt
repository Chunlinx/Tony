        um       so do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time   generally i dont think they are uh my my personal opinion is that uh the politicians are out for their own good because they theyre entrenched they dont ever have to go out and get a real job they just stay in their current job you know what i mean   uhhuh uhhuh i agree uh with with both of those things but uh do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest   i think by putting term limitations on you could you could slow down some of the problems uh but it has to be not just at the national level but at the you know the state and the local level too   umhum   i know some senators and i dont know which ones but theyve been in office since the the nineteen forties and   umhum   i they theyve never had a job i mean theyve never gone out in the real world and and paid normal taxes i know they pay taxes but they dont you know they they get paid a hundred and twenty five grand a year   um yeah umhum   which is more than twice my salary by quite a bit and you know im going like i i dont understand how theyre supposed to be my servants and yet theyre paid more than i am and they work less   uhhuh   you know less than i do   uhhuh uh the the only problem the only problem i see with term limitations um is that i think that the bureaucracy in our government as is in with most governments is just so complex that theres a very large you know there there is a learning curve and that you know you cant just send someone off to Washington and expect you know his first day to be an effective uh Congress person uh i think i think there really is a theres a lot they need to learn you know when you get there   i think i think thats true however i think thats always been true   uhhuh   i mean thats true of the presidency too and we seem to be able to get along with the President turnover every eight years or four years   yeah but   and uh they i mean there is a lot to learn but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up i think two years is too short   uh umhum   i think it has to be extended uh you know a term limitation for Congress would be like three terms or even four terms or you would increase the length of the of each term of a Congressman uh but maybe standardizing on on a a four year term for Congress Senate and the the presidency and then uh staggering them so that you dont you we arent having a massive ballot every four years   umhum yeah uh the other the other thing that that uh bothers me about our system is just that um in for for in in in Congress the amount of power any any particular Congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long theyve been there so its you know for you know uh so unless you have actual you know across the boards uh limitations the uh you know the idea of well were going to just were  im im just going to you know vote vote against the incumbent every time doesnt work you know its going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states arent doing it at the same time   uhhuh i think i think that thats true but then you have you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin uh the C i A is moving out to West Virginia which is a really stupid location for   uhhuh   a large agency like that and for almost any agency i mean the action isnt in West Virginia i hate to tell the senator the senator from West Virginia this information but   uhhuh   it really doesnt  uh the world does not revolve around West Virginia uh as far as this country is concerned the world does revolve around D C you know as far as the politics in this country are concerned the national politics and   uhhuh uhhuh   the C I A is a a very large very high profile agency and to have it located out in West Virginia yeah you know it might only be two hour drive from here but thats a two hour drive   uh   and uh you know it its a i think its a mistake to move large agencies like that or is it the F B I i dont remember but i think theres   yeah uhhuh well i mean  i dont see why it makes a big difference the CIA because you know officially they dont do they dont have any operations within the United States other than administrative   yeah thats officially   uhhuh   i mean we all know that thats not necessarily true but i i think that there are there are advantages to having seniority and uh turnover or not having a complete turnover every some small number of years i think there are i mean theres an institutional memory that you need to maintain   uhhuh   but i think that uh all with all the perks that weve given them i mean i heard on the radio back a a few weeks ago uh during the incidents where they were you know like they arent paying their their restaurant bills and theyre bouncing checks all over the place uh one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks   uh umhum
