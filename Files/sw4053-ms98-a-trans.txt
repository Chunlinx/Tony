        do you do for exercise do you do anything regularly     i walk   do you uh how often   uh about every other day   well thats good thats good   no thats not very much really   do you walk very far   uh a couple miles   yeah well thats thats not bad i mean i know um just probably in the last four or five months ive been able to pick up um i go to a gym and and uh ride the bike and do the whats called the stair master so thats uh i try to do that three or four times a week well   have have you done that a long time   um uh i i am uh uh i didnt i have a six month old baby hes my third one and didnt do it much while i was pregnant but um but the about at six weeks i really began picking it back up so ive been doing it at least for the last uh last five six months so but before that i did uh i did biking i like to swim a lot too so   that sounds pretty good youre   i   youre better than i am i uh   its tough       it is   i i have purchased any number of well i say any number ive purchased three different uh types of exercise equipment uh mainly uh uh a rower and two different uh kinds of uh exercycles but uh i have teenagers and it drives me nuts when i get on and   umhum   uh somebodys screwed the tension all the way up so you can hardly move   yeah i bet well did you do you like the rowing rowing machine because i did that for a while and   no i didnt like that   i i didnt i just didnt feel like it was doing much for me and i dont i dont know if i wasnt doing it properly or what but i didnt i didnt feel like it was doing much except maybe   i didnt like that i uh the uh like i say the   maybe for my arms   main problem with me is ive got to have something thats repeatable   umhum   and uh walking is repeatable and bicycling is repeatable i i bicycle once in a while   yeah yeah   but if its any kind of equipment then uh i have uh four kids at home and and they just theres a joy i think in changing the settings   yeah   and it takes me a while to get back into it so     well so do you do you enjoy your walking or is it just because you have to exercise you know you need to exercise   well therere two kinds one kind is where you just get out and you do it because youve got to do it and the other kind is   yeah   is uh actually most of the walking ive been doing these days is is just a bunch that im with uh uh a couple of people in my group who we just take off and walk uh uh over to the shopping center and walk through the shopping center and then come back which is about a two mile trip   yeah   so its but its a kind of sedentary job here i dont know about you but uh uh this job just involves sitting in in front of a keyboard all day long writing computer programs   ah yeah well i i run after preschoolers  at this point so   is is that right so you get uh so you get more exercise than   yeah   than uh thats a fair amount of exercise by itself right   well uh yes and no i mean i dont i mean you know we play around and fool around but i dont i dont ever feel you know ive ive really worked out but i i really have you know first going to the gym was really really tough and ive been doing it like early in the mornings before the kids wake up so but now its you know i dont like to wake up but once im up i enjoy it and i enjoy the the challenge of seeing how much further i can get and um right now im you know increasing levels on the bike or increasing time on the the stair master and um so thats you know and i only have a certain amount of time i can do it and so its okay how many calories can i burn at this in this amount of time so   are these are these uh does this gear have some kind of a little uh electronic uh thing uh read out on it   yeah um i im a member of Presidents and so the the cycle tells you how far youve you have uh levels that you can um ride on or walk on and it tells you you know how far youve walked or how far youve um biked and how many calories its burned and you can set it up where you can be going up hills or you can be going just constant level and so its
