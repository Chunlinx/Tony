                okay the topic said to discuss the weather what is it like where you are and hows that different from normal and     well i tell you what it is its warm where im at     well lets see if youre in Plano and im in Plano are you in east Plano or west Plano   uh west Plano   okay well im in east Plano im out in Las Rios so its bound to be different over here but yeah yeah   okay       good deal well i tell you what uh yesterday i went out and played a little golf and uh i paid the price my neck got got burned to a crisp   oh got a little sunburn yeah   yeah but uh it was it was beautiful out   wow i worked around in the yard a little bit and ive got sunburned a few years ago and you know got one of those what second or third degree burns and the doctor looked at it and said dont ever   oh Lord     dont ever let that area get sunburned again   yeah   and uh its got the you know the kind of the black freckled things on it that the doctor looks at every once in a while for that what melanoma business   right exactly   so i am super whenever we go down to Galveston to the beach or something like that you know i look kind of stupid im out there in a Tshirt and everything else   all covered up   pretty much covered up but uh you know im never going to let my shoulders and back get sunburned again     well i tell you im the same way i tell you i i knew better i should have put some sunscreen on uh yesterday but i dont know it felt so nice out   umhum well it is March after all you know youre not supposed to worry about sunburn in March   well thats right thats right they shouldnt even be selling suntan lotion yet     thats right   but uh hopefully uh you know its going to stay warm for this weekend   yeah   and uh   well yeah i hope so yeah were going to go to Lubbock theyll probably have another sandstorm out there you know   so youre going to go to the big city of Lubbock huh yeah   big Lubbock yeah are are you a native type Planoite or you been here a while or   no i just been uh up here in Plano for about uh i guess close to three years now and uh   okay well well where did you come from originally   i grew up in a small town right outside of Amarillo and uh then when i went to school at Tech there in Lubbock   oh okay well im a Tech graduate so   are you okay   yeah i grew up over in New Mexico at Roswell   i see   and my wife is from Plains if you know where Plains is   ive heard of Plains yeah   its on the its on the road where do you know where well you go south out of Lubbock down to Brownfield and then you like youre headed over toward Roswell Plains is right there   right   uh about fifteen miles in from the New Mexico line   i see okay   so so yeah you talk of little towns in west Texas yeah im   well no see im from a town named Panhandle   okay yeah i know where Panhandle is thats north up there isnt it yeah   yeah yeah right right right up there by Amarillo   yeah   so uh   yeah i had a friend who lived in Dumas   okay yeah on the other side of Amarillo yeah   so yeah so anyway yeah were kind of familiar with that part of the world now theres where the weathers interesting i think its kind of dull around here compared to   well thats right because uh one day itll be eighty and the next day itll be about thirty below i tell you what and uh   yeah my mother still lives in Lubbock and we talked to her the other day and they said Friday they had or Thursday or Friday they had a you know one of the world class sandstorms out there that happens every once in a while hadnt had one like that in a couple of years   oh Lord thats one thing i do not miss about uh being in Lubbock i tell you because one i ill never forget uh one spring we had a real big dust storm come in and it started raining and uh it was like raining mud out there you know     yeah i recall a snirtstorm out there one day where about this time of year that there was a big cold front coming in and they got the dirt up in the air and then it snowed a little bit   and uh   oh Lord   and uh i can imagine that happening more in Amarillo than i could in Lubbock but still anywhere out there it could happen   right thats exactly right i tell you   yeah i we like i said i grew up in New Mexico we lived in Albuquerque Karen and i both lived in Albuquerque for quite a long time and then i went to work for TI here   right   and i came here in sixty nine and then seventy two they opened or seventy three they opened up that plant out there in Lubbock and uh man that was like going home and uh so we went out there were there for about ten years until that all folded up out there     i see   ended up coming back but uh yeah the weather out there was uhhuh it it could get a little bit a little bit interesting now and again   oh it sure can because uh the you never just you just can never tell what its going to do   uhhuh   and uh its just hard to plan anything   well if youve been here for three years you didnt get here the year they had the big freeze and stuff here did you what was that eighty eighty four   uh that i did this okay   oh wow that would have been six or seven years ago then   yeah uh my first year down here uh uh that first winter i remembered TI was closed one one day uh   umhum with the ice yeah   that yeah with the ice but that uh thats about the worst worst winter ive been been through down here   well the uh was it i guess it was three years ago that they had the real right before was it right before Christmas or where   yeah where it got just real real cold   yeah yeah got down to around zero somewhere and then warmed back up and killed everything off   yeah right   yeah that was that was bad news were still try i set out a whole bunch of crepe myrtles and stuff and of course it killed th em   oh Lord   well they all come back from from the bottom   right   so im getting kind of convinced that if something doesnt grow naturally here theres no sense in planting it because eventually youre going to lose it   thats right because the weathers going to get it exactly   and you noticed all the pretty little trees that are out everything now the native trees     that still dont have the leaves on them yet thats right thats exactly right   theyre they know better  they know better  yeah yeah   and uh my wife and i are going through that process now we just bought a house and were trying to decide what we want to do with our landscaping and we still have to put a yard in   umhum umhum   and uh im still trying to decide when when the best times going to be to do that so uh   yeah well youre just about there i think its   thats thats right you know id id like to get the yard in before all the rain start and uh you know if we could get it up a little bit then the rain would really just help it   umhum well we moved into this house it was a year old and the landscaping was semiin but there was still a lot more to do   i see   and one of the things that uh well they were really selling everybody on back then was this Indian Hawthorne boy you know thats the best stuff in the world   right   well  i am somewhat less than enthused about that ive got some out here thats       five six years old now and still doesnt look a whole lot different than the day that i put it in   oh is that right   and i noticed that a lot of the garden well you know that Indian Hawthorne that didnt work out quite as well as we thought you know so now theyre pushing something else   right oh Neil Sperry hasnt been pushing that real hard and heavy here lately   yeah yeah       well anyway uh like i said if it if it doesnt grow out in the woods here somewhere im not sure   thats worth planting huh   that its worth planting yeah   thats exactly right   this uh photinia the red tipped photinia   red tipped bush yeah   it seems to do pretty good weve got some here thats really taken off   well yeah i i i know everybody in our neighborhood has has those bushes and uh   umhum   like i say really seem to to do well   that and uh the little dwarf yaupon hollies you know they they seem to or just yaupons period seem to do all right   right holley yeah right   weve got a couple of Live Oaks in the front yard and of course theyre they werent native to this particular spot but they seem to have done pretty good and   they sure have and thats a good tree it sort of stays green most of the year you know and   and uh yeah its its its a strange one it will kind of scare you if you dont know what its doing because right now is when its dropping its leaves   right   and you go out there and look at your tree after a good windstorm and the thing is bare and you think oh no   the things dying   but you look look real close and theres all the little new leaves getting ready to come out so it holds its leaves all winter then loses them in the spring   right yeah   that and that red what is it red oak   red oak yeah   were thinking about putting one of those in   only thing is those things grow pretty slow you have to   uhhuh well you know i heard something about that here whether Neil uh here again it may have been Neil Sperry they say you know everybody looks at these oaks and says yeah they grow slow and all that   right   but most of the time thats the way that the native ones grow because they dont get the water they dont get the theyre theyre growing under bad conditions   oh is that right yeah   and uh if you bring one in and put it under good conditions theyll grow about as fast as any tree   so if you really fertilize it and huh well thats surprising   so yeah   thats good to know   so anyway thats that was i guess he was talking about some of the other kinds of oaks i dont know   right right   whether the live live oaks is not really an oak i guess its something oh   i think its just by name yeah   yeah it just got the the name of being an oak because its got a kind of an acorn kind of thing on it   right right   but uh i think the real honest to gosh oaks like the what bur oaks and pin oaks and red oaks and all that sort of thing they theyll grow a lot faster   yeah huh   well i guess we were supposed to be talking about the weather but thats   at least we had a good conversation anyway yeah   yeah well are you you with TI   but uh yes i am yeah   yeah how many these have you gotten very many of these calls at home   um probably about three i guess yeah   okay well i got the first one this evening that i had gotten at home i   i see   id made a couple at work you know made made several from work but id never uh id never gotten one yet i was just   right gotten one at home huh yeah ive gotten about three i guess   yeah yeah   so     well you know youd think that this crazy system if youre going to talk about something about the weather theyd have tried to plug you in with plug you in to somebody   split it up a little bit   like you know  New York or something yeah   like New York or somewhere yeah thats right   yeah weather difference between east and west Plano   but uh exactly       clear across town but uh   clear across town well when we lived in Albuquerque there was such a elevation difference there that there was a weather difference between the valley and the heights   right   you know it would be snowing up in our area and then the sun would be shining and it would be hot down in the       downtown but uh thats not the way Plano works
