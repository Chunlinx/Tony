damaged book publishing with their obsessive pursuitof blockbusters  Last year  hardcovers sold more than copies establishing a new record The conglomerates pay huge advances andspend outrageous sums marketing these titles in the hope that they will top thebestseller lists Critics also say that editors who once patiently developedwriters now spend more time marketing books than editing them which resultsin the production of longer sloppier less interesting books thatreaders spurn Also the conglomerates are accused of having dumbed down bookspublishing titles that may be more easily adapted by their Hollywoodsubsidiaries Last year News Corps HarperCollins opened an office in theheadquarters of its  th Century Fox unit                           Declining Sales and Profits Mostconglomerates

was a genteel and polite profession too with few booksellersowning more than one store All that changed in the postwar era Thepaperback book emerged to tap the popular market and mallbasedchains such as Waldenbooks and B Dalton arrived to make the book market atrue mass market            The s brought thesuperstore typified by the stillexpanding Barnes  Noble and Borderschains Thanks to the superstore chains retail space devoted to booksexpanded by  percent last year  Industry giant Barnes  Noble has superstores and does  billion in annual sales The chains sell percent of all books nonbookstores department stores grocery storesdiscount outlets etc sell  percent small independent stores sell percent and book clubs account for most of the remainder            Criticscomplain that the chains exploit the industrys liberal returns policy in which stores pay for only the books they sell About  percent ofall hardcovers ordered by the chains are returned Chains overorder to filltheir expanding floor space but sell a lower percentage of the books orderedthan independent stores do Publishers must then absorb the high costs of hugereturns from the chains The conspiracyminded allege that the chains alsoleverage their influence to persuade the big publishers to produce moreblockbusters at the expense of moderateselling books Although the bookbusiness has grown more dependent on new blockbusters  percent of Barnes Nobles sales for example come from backlist books ie bookspublished more than  months ago                           Overproduction Fueled by

Some charge that theconglomerates are starting to ignore the midlist  book seriousnonfiction and literary fiction that sells fewer than  copies preferringto gamble on potentially lucrative blockbusters Imprints that concentrate onmidlist bookslike The Free Press Basic Books and Pantheonhave beendownsized sold or repositioned by their conglomerate fathers in recentyears            Some publishers say that theproliferation of midlist books not blockbusters have injured the bottom lineIncoming Random House editor Ann Godoff argues against this notion Sheplans to publish more literature and fewer celebrity memoirs because thebigmarket books ultimately earn lower returns
