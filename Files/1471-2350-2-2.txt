                    Introduction        Although conflicting findings about bone mineral density        BMD in patients with type  diabetes have been reported        there are substantial data which support the notion that        type  diabetes is associated with increased BMD            The Rotterdam Study   which involved         subjects including  men and  women with type         diabetes provides the most convincing evidence They found        that diabetic men and women had increased BMD independent        of age obesity the use of estrogen thiazide or loop        diuretics impairment in the ability of daily living and        smoking   Furthermore hyperinsulinemia has been        reported to be associated with an increased BMD in diabetic          and nondiabetic subjects   From the Rancho        Bernardo Study   the level of fasting insulin was        significantly and positively associated with BMD in        nondiabetic female subjects where each  Uml increase        in fasting insulin level was associated with an increase of        BMD by  gcm in the radius and  gcm in the        spine However no independent association between fasting        insulin level and BMD was noted in males   Since        fasting insulin level is an indicator of insulin        resistance it is tempting to hypothesize that insulin        resistance decreased insulin sensitivity is associated        with increased BMD        BMD is known to have strong genetic determinants Our        understanding of the relationship between BMD and VDR gene        polymorphism is based on a twin study of serum osteocalcin        level   The synthesis of osteocalcin the most abundant        noncollageous protein in bone is induced by calcitriol        the active form of vitamin D through the VDR Since a        variation in serum osteocalcin level was shown to have a        strong genetic component mediated through the VDR the        relationship between VDR polymorphisms and serum        osteocalcin level was found Furthermore this relationship        was shown to be independent of age or menopausal effect          Subsequently the VDR gene polymorphisms were found to        account for  of the total genetic effect on BMD in        healthy people   However to date there are more than         studies on the relationship between VDR gene        polymorphisms and BMD   About half of the studies found        a significant association and the other half found no        association   The most convincing evidence comes from a        study of peak BMD in a group of prepubertal girls          which confirms the relationship between VDR gene        polymorphism and BMD        Since the VDR is expressed in tissues namely muscle and        pancreatic islets      which are involved in        the regulation of glucose metabolism we hypothesized that        the VDR gene could play a role in glucose metabolism In        this study we examined the role of the         Fok I polymorphism in the translation        initiation codon of the VDR gene in  healthy glucose        tolerant Caucasians who underwent a standard oral glucose        tolerance test The insulin sensitivity and beta cell        function were estimated using a homeostasis model        assessment HOMA   We found that the         Fok I polymorphism is associated with        insulin resistance in a Caucasian population                    Results                  Characteristics of the study population          Since hypertension is associated with insulin          resistance   only those with normal blood pressure          systolic blood pressure less than  mmHg and diastolic          blood pressure less than  mmHg were enrolled into the          study Because we were also concerned about the effect of          glucose toxicity on beta cell function and insulin          sensitivity   all subjects underwent a standard          gm oral glucose tolerance test Only those subjects          with a fasting plasma glucose level less than  mM          interval plasma glucose levels at   and           minutes less than  mM and twohour plasma glucose          level less than  mM were enrolled in this study          This study included  healthy Caucasian subjects of          which  were female Clinical features of the subjects          were mean age  years old range  years mean

After genotyping we identified  FF  Ff and           ff subjects In this Caucasian population the allele          frequency was  for the F allele and  for the f          allele The distribution of genotypes was in compliance          with the HardyWeinberg equilibrium p Since only           ff subjects were identified they were pooled with the          Ff subjects Two groups FF vs Ffff had compatible          gender distribution age body mass index systolic and          diastolic blood pressure fasting lipid profiles and          fasting plasma glucose level Table  However the          Ffff subjects had a higher mean waisthip ratio and a          higher mean fasting plasma insulin level compared to the          FF subjects p and p respectively These          results indicate that the Ffff subjects are more obese          and more insulin resistant than the FF subjects          Beta cell function B and insulin sensitivity S          were estimated from the HOMA based on the average of          three fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels before          the oral glucose tolerance test No difference was noted          in B between the two groups p However there was          a drastic difference in S between the two groups          p After an oral glucose load Figure  the          Ffff subjects had similar plasma glucose levels at each          time point compared to the FF subjects However the          Ffff subjects had higher postchallenged insulin levels          at   and  minutes than the FF subjects p          p and p respectively Furthermore the          Ffff subjects had a higher insulin area under the curve          than the FF subjects p These results again          indicate that the Ffff subjects are more insulin          resistant than the FF subjects                          Stepwise regression analysis          Various covariates have been shown to affect either          beta cell function or insulin sensitivity or both To          examine the influence of the available covariates in          addition to the           Fok I polymorphism on beta cell          function and insulin sensitivity we employed a stepwise          regression analytical approach Age gender body mass          index waisthip ratio and systolic and diastolic blood          pressure were entered into the model and a backward          stepwise regression analysis was performed It revealed          that the           Fok I polymorphism was an          independent determinant for S but not for B Table           The           Fok I polymorphism combined with          waisthip ratio explained  of the variance in S          This result confirms that this polymorphism is an          independent risk factor for insulin resistance                            Discussion        We found that in healthy normotensive Caucasian        subjects with normal glucose tolerance the         Fok I polymorphism in the vitamin D        receptor gene accounted for  of the variance in S        but had no impact on B Although the Ffff subjects were        more obese than the FF subjects p for waisthip        ratio the difference in S between the two groups        decreased after adjusting for waisthip ratio  vs         before and  vs  after adjusting for waisthip        ratio However this polymorphism remained an independent        determinant for S after adjusting for waisthip ratio        p Figure  Therefore we concluded that the         Fok I polymorphism was a risk factor        for insulin resistance independent of obesity        The allelic frequencies of the present study  for        the F allele and  for the f allele are very similar to        the reported frequencies in a Japanese  for the F        allele and  for the f allele and a Caucasian  for        the F allele and  for the f allele population           In the present study we pooled the ff subjects with        Ff subjects for its small sample size  ff vs  Ff and         FF To examine whether there is a difference among the        three genotypic groups we examined the influence of        genotypes on S and B by ANOVA We found a significant        difference in S p and again no difference in B        p However no difference in S was noted between        the Ff and ff groups p The main difference in S        is between the FF and Ff groups p Although we        cannot exclude the possibility of inadequate power to        detect the difference from the present sample size this        observation is consistent with the functional study of the         Fok I polymorphism in cultured human        peripheral blood mononuclear cells   In this        functional study they compared the inhibitory effect of        dihydroxyvitamin D          on the growth of cultured human        peripheral mononuclear cells isolated from subjects with        different         Fok I genotypes and found significant        differences among the three genotypes but found no        difference between the Ff and ff groups          Obesity is well known to be associated with insulin        resistance   In the present study we also found that        the         Fok I polymorphism was associated        with obesity assessed by waisthip ratio but not by body        mass index Table  However the association between the        Ffff genotypes with both insulin resistance and obesity        prompted us to further examine the interaction among this        polymorphism obesity and insulin resistance Multivariate        analysis revealed that this polymorphism had no independent        impact on waisthip ratio p after adjustment for        age p gender p and body mass index p          while systolic and diastolic blood pressure        had also no impact on waisthip ratio p and        p respectively However from the multivariate        analysis result of S Table  we concluded that this        polymorphism had an important impact on insulin        sensitivity which was independent of the influence of        waisthip ratio Although gender was excluded as an        independent covariate for S in the present study after        adjustment for waisthip ratio which was affected by        gender the interaction between gender and this        polymorphism if any needs to be addressed in a study with        a much larger sample size        The role of VDR gene polymorphisms has been examined in        four groups of diabetic patients however their roles in        insulin sensitivity have not been examined In  Southern        Indian families with type  diabetes transmission        disequilibrium testing analysis demonstrated the        preferential transmission of the b allele of the         Bsm I polymorphism to affected        subjects   However it was less certain for the         Taq I and         Apa I polymorphisms in this sample        set Nonetheless this study indicates that the         Bsm I polymorphism at the VDR gene        locus is a risk factor of type  diabetes In a study of         Caucasian families with type  diabetes there was an        excessive transmission of bT and bAT extended haplotypes to        affected individuals but no evidence of excessive        transmission of         Taq I and         Apa I alleles alone   Recently        we confirmed the association of this marker with type         diabetes in a Taiwanese population   These studies in        two different populations indicate that the         Bsm I polymorphism at the VDR gene        locus confers susceptibility to type  diabetes The study        of type  diabetes with the VDR gene included         Bangladesh Asians who were at risk for type  diabetes and         of them were either diabetic or impaired glucose        tolerant An association between the         Apa I polymorphism and insulin        secretion index was noted   These studies suggest that        the VDR gene locus is a genetic marker for both type  and        type  diabetes        Since the         Bsm I polymorphism is located in        intron  the         Apa I polymorphism in intron  and        the         Taq I polymorphism in exon  within        the untranslated region of the VDR gene they are less        likely to have any biological consequences in causing the        disease and affecting glucose metabolism Furthermore        functional studies of these polymorphisms show no clearly        demonstrable difference among them      The        TtoC transition polymorphism at the translation        initiation codon of the human VDR gene not only destroys a         Fok I site but also abolishes the        first translation initiation codon of this gene The        alternative translation initiation codon which also        adheres the firstAUG rule by Kozak   is located        downstream by three amino acids In the present study we        examined the         Fok I polymorphism which not only        affects the translation of the peptide but also affects        the biological activity tested in Hela Cells   This        TtoC transition resulted in the synthesis of a smaller F        allele three amino acids less than the f allele protein        with increased vitamin Ddependent transcriptional        activation   In addition the different response to        dihydroxyvitamin D is also demonstrated in cultured        human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects with        different         Fok I genotypes   We found that        the subjects with homozygous F allele had increased insulin        sensitivity compared to those with the f allele        Although the molecular basis of this association is        unclear the study of the relationship between the level of        vitamin D and glucose tolerance   provides some insight        to the underlying mechanism Glucose tolerance and vitamin        D level were assessed in  elderly Dutchmen Fasting        insulin and postchallenged insulin levels decreased with        increased vitamin D levels   As a higher insulin level        is a surrogate for decreased insulin sensitivity their        observation suggests that a higher vitamin D level is        associated with increased insulin sensitivity Since        vitamin D binds to the vitamin D receptor to initiate the        downstream action a higher vitamin D level would lead to        an increase in vitamin Ddependent transcription        activation Our observation that the subjects with        homozygous F alleles associated with an increased        activity are more insulin sensitive than those with the f        allele is consistent with the notion above        Our original hypothesis was that the allele which is        associated with increased BMD was also associated with        higher insulin levels and insulin resistance However        since the F allele is associated with increased BMD           our observation of the association between the F        allele and increased insulin sensitivity is not consistent        with our original hypothesis On the other hand not all        reports support the association between the F allele and        increased BMD    Nonetheless our observation shows        that this polymorphism is an independent determinant for        insulin sensitivity and is in agreement with the notion        that a higher level of vitamin D is associated with        increased insulin sensitivity   Furthermore additional        studies in the Caucasian and other ethnic populations are        required        In the present study we report an association between a        polymorphism at the translation initiation codon of the        human VDR gene and insulin sensitivity in glucose tolerant        and normotensive Caucasians This polymorphism is an        independent determinant of insulin sensitivity explaining         of the variance in S and with waisthip ratio        explaining  of the variance in S Although the        speculated mechanism of our observation is in agreement        with the published association between vitamin D levels and        insulin sensitivity further studies are required to        confirm our observation in other ethnic groups as well as        in another Caucasian population To explore the underlying        molecular basis of the         Fok I polymorphism at the VDR gene        locus as well as the association between vitamin D level        and insulin sensitivity also warrants further study                    Subjects materials and methods                  Study subjects          We confirm that the study has complied with the          recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki The study          was approved by the institutional review board and a          written informed consent was obtained from each          participant at the beginning of the study Subjects were          recruited through an advertisement on a campus media of          this institution Only healthy subjects were invited to          participate in this study They were prescreened via          telephone and confirmed again on the day of the visit          They were biologically unrelated                          Oral glucose tolerance test and physical          examination          Subjects were instructed to fast for at least  hours          before the study visit On the morning of the visit an          indwelling angiocatheter was inserted into an antecubital          vein All subjects had fasting blood samples drawn at            and  minutes These samples were used for          glucose insulin lipid measurement and genomic DNA          isolation Fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels were          calculated as the average of three fasting samples After          the oral administration of gm glucose postchallenged          blood samples were drawn at    and  minutes          for glucose and insulin measurements A limited physical          examination was performed on all study participants          including measurements of weight height waist hip and          blood pressure After resting quietly for  minutes          three consecutive measurements of systolic and diastolic          blood pressures were taken one minute apart and the          average of the three measurements was reported                          DNA extraction and genotyping of the Fok I          polymorphism          Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes          as previously described   The genomic DNA fragment          flanking the           Fok I polymorphism was amplified          using two primers flanking exon  of the VDR gene          AGCTGGCCCTGGCACTGCTCTGCTCT and          ATGGAAACACCTTGCTTCTTCTCCCTC Polymerase chain reaction          PCR was carried out
