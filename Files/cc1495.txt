                    Introduction        Vancomycin is among the most effective antibiotics for        treatment of methicillinresistant         Staphylococcus aureus infections             and it is widely used prophylactically in cardiac        surgery     Among the adverse effects of vancomycin        apart from nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity anaphylactoid        reactions may occur which manifest clinically as cutaneous        rash pruritus red man syndrome hypotension and        broncospasm     These reactions are caused by        histamine release and are not mediated by an immunological        mechanism           In our cardiosurgical center vancomycin is administered        prophylactically before induction of anaesthesia in all        patients undergoing openheart surgery and in some such        patients we have observed the occurrence of pruritus        localized or generalized during infusion of the        antibiotic We therefore conducted the present study to        investigate the haemodynamic behaviour that follows the        occurrence of pruritus and to compare it with that        observed in patients who are free from this clinical        sign                    Patients and methods        We studied  patients undergoing elective coronary        artery bypass surgery following approval from the local        ethics committee and once written informed consent had been        obtained from each patient Admission criteria to the study        were as follows stable preoperative haemodynamic        conditions no intravenous cardiovascular therapy no        preoperative diuretic therapy sinus rhythm no history of        anaphylactic reactions and normal hepatic and renal        function        Preoperative therapy was continued until the morning of        the operation Premedication consisted of morphine         mgkg and scopolamine  mgkg administered        intramuscularly  hour before the patient entered the        operating room After the monitoring devices had been        positioned electrocardiograph leads DIIV for STsegment        analysis radial artery cannula and pulmonary artery        catheter Arrow AH H  F Arrow International        Inc Reading PA USA transcutaneous oxygen saturation        probe vancomycin  mgkg was administered at a        constant rate by a syringe pump DPS Fresenius Grenoble        France over  min        A complete haemodynamic profile was taken for each        patient at the following time points before the        administration of vancomycin time point  at  time        point  and  min time point  after the beginning of        vancomycin infusion and  min after vancomycin infusion        had been stopped time point  Apart from collection of        haemodynamic data at each time point two blood samples        were drawn one from the radial artery cannula and another        from the distal port of the pulmonary artery catheter in        order to measure arterial and mixed venous blood parameters        that are necessary for calculation of QspQt ie        haemoglobin concentration and oxygen tension and        saturation        Each haemodynamic profile consisted of parameters        measured directly ie heart rate systemic and pulmonary        pressures pulmonary capillary wedge pressure central        venous pressure and cardiac output and those that were        calculated ie SVRI pulmonary vascular resistance index        PVRI CI and SVI        The pulmonary shunt fraction QspQt was calculated        using the following equation                  Where CcO          is the pulmonary capillary oxygen        content CaO          is the arterial oxygen content and        CvO          is the mixed venous oxygen        content        Analysis of the blood samples was performed by the same        operator using a blood gas system model  Ciba        Corning Medfield MA USA located just outside the        operating room        During the study all patients breathed room air and        crystalloid was continuously infused at a rate of  mlkg        per hour which was increased if necessary to offset a        moderate reduction in systemic arterial pressure If mean        blood pressure decreased by more than  then more fluids        andor boluses of ephedrine were infused vancomycin        infusion was temporarily discontinued and the patient was        excluded from the study        The patients were divided into two groups group A        including patients who exhibited pruritus during vancomycin        infusion and group B including those patients who did not        exhibit pruritis Each group was then divided into two        subgroups on the basis of preoperative therapy with a        blocker subgroups A and B were treated with a        blocker whereas subgroups A and B were not        The results are expressed as mean  standard deviation        Data were analysed using Students ttest and analysis of        variance with Bonferroni correction         P   was considered        statistically significant                    Results        Group A included  patients subgroup A         n   and subgroup A         n   and group B included         patients subgroup B         n   and subgroup B         n   Five patients were excluded        from the study because of reduction in mean blood pressure        by

of the patients are        provided in Table  There were no significant differences        between the groups in terms of age weight preoperative        left ventricular ejection fraction preoperative

QspQt a significant increase        at time point  as compared with time point  in patients        of group A and subgroup A Tables and         In the majority of cases studied pruritus was mild or        moderate and localized on the scalp face neck or upper        torso In a few cases it was severe and spread all over the        body surface In four cases pruritis was accompanied by a        cutaneous rash and no other clinical sign was        observed                    Discussion        The development of pruritus an important symptom of        histamine release is relatively frequent with vancomycin        administration     It generally appears alone but        sometimes it is associated with headache flushing        erythematous rash over the face neck and upper torso the        socalled red man syndrome hypotension and broncospasm             One of the most important factors that        impact on the incidence of these adverse reactions is the        vancomycin infusion rate For example Renz and coworkers          infused  g vancomycin over  min to patients        scheduled for elective prosthetic joint replacement and        found that  of patients had rash and pruritus and         had significant hypotension Also Valero and coworkers          administered  g vancomycin over  min to cardiac        surgical patients and observed hypotension in  of cases        For this reason the international literature recommends        that vancomycin be infused over a period of  min in order        to prevent these side effects and hypotension in        particular which in some cases manifests as        lifethreatening shock             The present study was conducted to investigate the        haemodynamic changes that occur following the appearance of        pruritus We therefore opted to administer vancomycin over        a period of  min in order to encourage appearance of the        sign as the coronary patients were adequately monitored        and the anaesthetist was therefore in the optimal        conditions to detect and treat any change in        cardiorespiratory function at an early stage        Our analysis of haemodynamic profiles shows that in        those patients who exhibited pruritus group A systemic        vascular resistance fell significantly  min after        initiation of vancomycin administration This effect was        transient disappearing  min later The reduction in        systemic vascular resistance was not accompanied by a        significant decrease in systemic arterial pressure and        because heart rate was unchanged the increase in stroke        volume offset the peripheral vasodilatation induced by the        antibiotic On the contrary in patients free from pruritus        group B those haemodynamic changes were not observed and        all of the parameters considered remained stable throughout        the study In group A the normovolaemic condition of the        patients and the fluids infused during the study        undoubtedly contributed to haemodynamic compensation        However it may be supposed that if vancomycin is        administered to an hypovolaemic patient then this        compensation cannot be as effective and hypotension may        occur We were unable to confirm this for two reasons        first hypovolaemia was among the exclusion criteria and        second we considered exposure of a coronary patient to the        additional stress of relative hypovolaemia to be harmful        However considering the different amounts of crystalloid        infused in each group we can indirectly deduce that fluid        compensation contributed to the maintenance of stable        values for mean systemic pressure when systemic vascular        resistance decreased        The stability of heart rate in face of a reduction in        systemic vascular resistance in group A patients renders        possible an influence of preoperative blocker therapy on        haemodynamic compensation Confirmation of this is        indicated by the different trends of heart rate in the        group A patients who were treated with a blocker as        compared with those who were not The stability of heart        rate in subgroup A and the significant increase in        subgroup A represents proof that blocker therapy limited        that compensatory mechanism to peripheral vasodilatation        Surprisingly assessment of other haemodynamic parameters        SVRI CI SVI revealed a significant change only in those        patients who were affected by pruritus and not treated with        a blocker as though treatment had antagonized all of the        cardiovascular effects triggered by the release of        histamine during vancomycin administration However        because the number of the patients studied was small these        findings require further investigation and confirmation in        larger studies        The significant increase in QspQt and decrease in PaO          in the patients affected by pruritus        can be interpreted as the effect of an imbalance in the        ventilationperfusion ratio induced by the vasodilating        action of vancomycin on the pulmonary circulation as        supported by the significant reduction in pulmonary        vascular resistance at time point  Also the respiratory        changes were significant only in patients of group A who        were not treated with a blocker whereas preoperative        use of the drug eliminated any significant respiratory        change The degree of reduction in PaO          was moderate and had no important        impact on arterial haemostasis in the patients studied who        showed however normal preoperative respiratory        function        A limitation in the calculation of QspQt was that the        patients were breathing room air during the study In such        conditions apart from changes in the QspQt the decrease        in PaO          may be caused by effects of        maldistribution in the ventilationperfusion ratio For        this reason we must consider the QspQt not as an absolute        value but as a relative one but we can nevertheless        attribute meaning to changes in this parameter          On the basis of the results obtained we conclude that        occurrence of pruritus during vancomycin administration        must be considered an alarm bell that indicates the        presence of peripheral vasodilatation It can help the        physician to identify at an early stage those patients who        are at risk for hypotension eg hypovolaemic patient and        to compensate for hypovolaemia before continuing        administration of vancomycin This benefit is useful not so        much in intensive care units where patients are        continuously and adequately monitored as in medical and        surgical departments overall where monitoring of arterial        pressure is not continuous and nurse care is not as strict        as in the intensive care unit        Finally the lack of haemodynamic and respiratory        changes in the patients affected by pruritus and treated        with a blocker before surgery makes it probable that        these agents can confer protection against the        anaphylactoid reactions that are mediated by release of        histamine                    Key messages         Pruritus which may occur during vancomycin        administration can be considered an alarm bell indicating        the presence of peripheral vasodilatation         The physician encountering pruritus during vancomycin        administration must correct the condition of hypovolaemia        before continuing vancomycin infusion         Pruritus is also associated with a slight but        significant reduction in PaO          and increase in QspQt         Patients affected by pruritus during vancomycin        infusion but who were treated with a blocker before        surgery did not exhibit any significant haemodynamic or        respiratory change                    Competing interests        None declared
