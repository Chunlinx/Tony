                                 Exhibiting Contempt            Art museums are underpressure these days Theres the constant hunger for money exacerbated by thedecline in government funding There is brutal competition for donors and worksof art Since the onset of the culture wars museums also have faced the hazardof political controversy and the chilling effect it can have on potentialsponsors Perhaps most relentless is box office pressurethe demand to boostattendance            A recentNew York Times article argued that these burdens have made the job ofmuseum director less desirable than it might seem Perhaps so But that doesntexcuse the way some directors have responded to these pressures with a styleof populism that is very different from a genuine democratic sensibility            Museum populism is not quite the same as the blockbustersyndrome Though devised and marketed on a large scale shows like the upcomingVan Gogh exhibition at the National Gallery in Washington or the Monetretrospective at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston fall within the traditionalboundaries of what these institutions display They may not contain much thatis conceptually fresh but they do provide mass access to artisticmasterpieces You cant really argue with that The populist trend bycontrast draws museums away from art their curators sincerely believe isgreator sometimes away from art entirely The current defining example isthe The Art of the Motorcycle now on view at the Solomon Guggenheim Museumin New York City Other examples include the exhibition of landscapes by thetraditionalist painter Andrew Wyeth that just closed at the Whitney Museum ofAmerican Art and the Louis Comfort Tiffany show that just opened at theMetropolitan Museum of Art            Museumpopulism began with an unlikely figure a patrician medievalist by the name ofThomas Hoving who was the director of the Met from  to  Hoving is theguy who came up with the idea of flying huge banners over the entrance to themuseum He also essentially invented the blockbuster show His tenure beganwith a splashy exhibition on royal patronage and built to the crescendo ofKing Tut which visitors waited in long lines to see in  In anentertaining book published a few years ago Making the Mummies DanceInside the Metropolitan Museum of Art  Hoving unabashedly recounts his ownMachiavellian management and PT Barnumstyle hype But despite his excessesHoving was still in some sense a conventionalminded curator It never occurredto him that you could herd even more people into an art museum if you didntforce them to look at art at all Thus it was left to the San Diego Museum ofArt to mount a few years back a Dr Seuss retrospective and to the Whitneyto mount a fashion show titled The Warhol Look last year            Conservative critics such as Jed Perl andHilton Kramer who predictably have decried the motorcycle exhibit mightreflect upon the fact that the populist approach it represents grew out of theMapplethorpeNational Endowment for the Arts controversy of the lateswhich they started            Charged with being out oftouch both with popular morality and with popular taste and punished with aloss of funds museum directors have been trying hard to demonstrate that theyare not elitist difficult and obscure The best way to prove yourenot a snob is by not letting your museum seem empty And the master ofpreventing emptiness while at the same time cultivating it is Thomas RKrens the director the Guggenheim            Thehallmarks of Krens  year tenure have been aggressive global expansionthereare now three Guggenheims in Europe in addition to the two in New Yorkand thebox office smash In the last few years the museums main branch the iconicFrank Lloyd Wright corkscrew has mounted huge retrospectives of less difficultcontemporary artists such as Roy Lichtenstein and Robert Rauschenberg Wheremodern art ceases to be popular Krens ceases to display modern art at leastin a mainevent manner Last summer Krens cooperated with the Chinesegovernment in mounting an exhibition titled China  Years that fell welloutside the museums charter But with aggressive promotion includingadvertising in Chinese language newspapers the museum set new records foritself drawing an average of nearly  visitors a day The commercialsuccess of The Art of the Motorcycle has dwarfed that Nearly  people aday are paying an obscene  per head to see the shimmering machines makingit by far the bestattended show in the Guggenheims history            An exhibition on motorcycle design at the Guggenheim wouldbe defensible if it made a better argument for either the cultural significanceor the aesthetic importance of the machines Industrial design is a stepchildof fine art and the crossfertilization of high and pop is an important partof the story of artistic modernism But the exhibition doesnt make the caseThe basic message of the show is Motorcycles are really cool here are a bunchof really cool motorcycles It includes too many machines in all Some ofthese are undeniably eyecatching but by the end the nonaficionado is boredsilly Part of the problem is that as you might expect from an exhibitiondirectmarketed to motorcycle clubs the approach is designtechnical ratherthan designaesthetic or designcultural The information plates that accompanythe exhibition and the catalog text both seem pitched at preestablishedfanatics Heres a snatch from the catalog entry for the  Cyclone one of afew truly stunning bikes in the show            The hallmark feature ofthe ci Vtwin Cyclone engine is its shaftandbevelgeardriven overheadcamand valve arrangement The motorcycle also contains a number of other importantfeatures that presage modern highperformance engine technology anearhemispherical combustion chamber the extensive use of cageroller andselfaligning ball bearings and a precise recessed fit of the crankcasecylinders and heads all contribute to the engines exceptional performanceEven with its modest compression ration of  to  it is estimated that theCyclone produces  hp at  rpm            As curatorof the exhibition Krens lays on this technical specification as a defenseagainst the charge of unseriousness But in doing so he more or lesseviscerates his own claim that these machines belong in a modern art museum asopposed to one focused on design transportation or history            Perhaps ironically museum populism comes witha tendency toward corporate exploitation BMW is the sole sponsor of anexhibition that includes BMW motorcycles including a current model In itsdefense the Guggenheim points out that there are only six BMW bikes fewerthan the number of Hondas or Harleys But the point is not that the sponsorinfluences the content of the show It is that the sponsor influences the factof the show That a company like BMW can get brownie points for art patronageby promoting its own product is part of the reason that this exhibition tookplace instead of the one examining  th century art at the end ofthe millennium which it replaced The current Tiffany show at the Met issponsored by Tiffany Everywhere the border between the museum and its giftshop is growing more porous At the Guggenheim SoHo you cant enter thegalleries except through the gift shop            The Guggenheim has been busyrationalizing its decision to mount the motorcycle exhibition Krens amotorcycle enthusiast and the owner of two BMWs contributes an utterlyunpersuasive introduction to the catalog in which he breezily declares thatthe distinction between the unique work of art and the mechanically producedobject is now irrelevant In other words its open season for guys like himOthers are embracing this philosophy of complete categorical breakdown TheChicago Museum of Contemporary Art just hired its new head away from Disney Ininterviews Robert Fitzpatrick who styles himself director and CEO has saidhe wants to make the museum friendlier to visitors According to my sources herecently stunned his curators by proposing to fill the galleries with pottedplants they draw bugsno good for paintings            Resisting empty populismdoesnt have to mean a haughty elitism An aesthetic democrat says that morepeople could profit from the experience of art if those who ran museums thoughtmore creatively about how to converse with their audience A populist says thatif you drop what is difficult in art you can get more people to pay attentionThe democrat at the helm of a museum a symphony orchestra or a publishinghouse tries to expand his audience while challenging it The populist bycontrast panders to his audience figuring out what it likes and thendelivering it in heaps Where the democrat exhibits respect for the public thepopulist exhibits contempt
