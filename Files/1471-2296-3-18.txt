                    Background        Obesity is rapidly becoming one of the most important        medical and public health problems of our time Obesity is        associated with a high rate of morbidity and early        mortality if left untreated        Studies indicate        that the presence of obesity increases the risk for        developing cardiovascular diseases and diabetes               Its role as a health hazard in adults has been well        recognized for some time                       but little attention has been paid to childhood and        adolescent obesity               The prevalence of obesity among US children is        approximately of  and has increased at an        accelerating rate in the past several years              the prevalence of obesity is   in some pediatric        populations      Obesity in childhood is associated        with obesity in adulthood        and is a        predictor of all causes of obesityassociated mortality        during adulthood particularly mortality from        cardiovascular diseases which are independent of adult        weight      Epidemiologic evidence supports the        theory that the relation between obesity and disease risk        begins early in life For instance adolescents who died in        accidents had fatty streaks in the coronary arteries and        aorta that were found at autopsy and were associated with        blood lipid profile blood pressure and obesity status        obtained at one or more points antemortem             Moreover a recent longitudinal study indicated that the        occurrence of overweight hypertension and dyslipidemia in        young adults aged  y was associated with these same        risk factors in childhood Data from the Childrens        Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati have shown that the        incidence of type  diabetes among adolescents increased        fold from  to  and virtually all diagnosed        cases of type  diabetes occurred in obese individuals            These observations are likely to reflect national        trends and certainly deserve both confirmation and a        sharper focus        To test the hypothesis that being an overweight or obese        adolescent is associated with early appearance of glucose        and lipid profile abnormalities we performed a        casecontrol study quantifying the odds ratio of overweight        and obesity on these abnormalities through different        Tanners stages The association between glucose and lipid        profiles and the distribution of adipose tissue was also        tested in this study The objective of the second study was        to determine from a retrospectiveprospective longitudinal        study of overweight and obese male and females having        abnormal glucose andor lipid profiles at which age obesity        in adolescence can be predictive of adult obesity and its        obesityassociated cardiovascular risk factors                    Methods                  Study           The first investigation was designed as a casecontrol          study and was performed in hospitals associated with          Montreal and McGill Universities Many of the subjects          were also directly recruited from nursery schools This          study was conducted to determine the relationship between          various indicators of adiposity and risk factors for          cardiovascular diseases in Caucasian normal overweight          and obese male and female adolescents The prevalence and          odds ratio of being overweight or obese on glucose and          lipid profiles was also determined Each Tanner stage is          associated with important changes in genital development          and sexual hormone profiles which could have an impact          on adipose tissue distribution and glucose and lipid          profiles Informed written consent was obtained from the          parents andor of all participating subjects The          participants were recruited from local and national          advertising To be included in the study adolescents and          adults had to meet the following criteria  be of          Caucasian ethnicity  be free from diagnosed endocrine          conditions that could lead to obesity and  not taking          any medication affecting body weight They were selected          for the study on the basis of their body mass index          Standing height was measured with a wallmounted tape          and weight was measured with the same standard balance          scale          Adolescents were classified according to BMI            thpercentile as overweight and   thpercentile for age          and sex as obese        Recent workshops          concluded that the BMI has been validated by studies on          total body fat     The standards used to identify          overweight and obesity in children and adolescents should          agree with the standards used to identify grade  and          grade  overweight BMI of  and  respectively in          adults     Adolescents with a BMI            thpercentile were classified as controls Group  Group           were overweight BMI   thpercentile and            thpercentile and group  were obese BMI            thpercentile Adults with a BMI   were classified          as controls between  and  as overweight and   as          obese Sexes were grouped separately          WCAC was calculated from the ratio of waist          circumference to arm circumference and used as a measured          of fat distribution analogous to waist to hip ratio on          the assumption that a higher ratio of waist to arm          circumference is an indicator of a more central pattern          of adiposity We used this measure in preference to waist          to hip ratio because a study which determined peripheral          and abdominal adipose tissue content in children using          magnetic resonance imaging found that WCAC correlated          positively with intraabdominal adipose tissue r            P   while waist to hip ratio did not r                Two other indices of central adiposity were          calculated from skinfolds Centralperipheral CPR as          subscapular skinfold  suprailliac skinfold  triceps          skinfold thigh skinfold and ratio of subscapular to          triceps skinfold STR STR is an index of relative          distribution of central subcutaneous adiposity The sum          of the four skinfolds SUM was calculated from triceps          subscapular suprailliac and thigh skinfolds in the total          sample The SUM provides a single measure of subcutaneous          adiposity Anthropometric measurements were done by the          same experienced evaluator to reduce variability which          was measured at less than           Genital development was evaluated with the criteria of          Tanner     and was performed with a questionnaire          and physical exam by an experienced physician in which          stage  is prepubertal stage  is initial development of          the genitalia stages  and  are intermediate and stage           is mature Stage of sexual maturation in the girls was          determined on the basis of a combination of menarcheal          status and breast and pubic hair development     The          stages of sexual maturation were performed with a          questionnaire and physical exam done by an experienced          physician as follow premenarcheal with no secondary          sexual development stage  Premenarcheal with some          secondary sexual development stage  premenarcheal at          the time of study but attained menarche within  months          stage  postmenarcheal with secondary sexual          development not yet mature stage  and postmenarcheal          with secondary sexual development stage           The subjects were instructed to arrive to the clinic          at  AM after hour overnight fast BMI was measured          and a venous blood sample was taken followed by a          breakfast Fasting blood samples were stored at C Serum          glucose and insulin levels and lipid profile were          determined They completed a questionnaire on risk          factors for atherosclerosis including family history of          coronopathy smoking high blood pressure personal          history of coronopathy or myocardial infarct history of          cerebrovascular disease or occlusive peripheral disease          Most overweight and obese subjects had at least two risk          factors for atherosclerosis          The diagnostic criteria for glucose profile were those          approved by the American Diabetes Association              Diabetes is defined as a fasting serum glucose equal or          higher than  mmolL  mgdl and impaired fasting          glucose with values between  and  mmolL Subjects          with high fasting glucose levels were referred to their          own physicians for further clinical evaluation          Lipid profile was also performed on the fasting blood          sample The blood lipid variables investigated were          triglyceride TRG total cholesterol TC highdensity          lipoprotein HDL cholesterol concentrations lowdensity          lipoproteins LDL cholesterol concentrations and the          ratio of totalHDL cholesterol THDLC     All          biochemical measurements were performed in an accredited          hospital laboratory                          Study           The second investigation was designed as a          retrospectiveprospective longitudinal study from  to           and was performed from hospitals associated with          Montreal and McGill Universities This study was          conducted to determine the age of apparition of abnormal          glucose and lipid profiles in a group of overweight and          obese young Caucasians adults presenting abnormal glucose          andor lipid profiles The study was performed from chart          review of participants  charts were preselected by          the archivists To be included in the study young adults          had to meet the following criteria  be of Caucasian          ethnicity  be between the ages of  y  be free          from diagnosed endocrine conditions that could have led          to obesity

pertinent data at the different  agegroups permitting          longitudinal study of all the subjects used in this          study These charts were reviewed by  reviwers A sample          of  charts were reviewed by the two reviewers to          determine variability between reviewers The interchart          reviewer differences was less than  Data from the          subjects were presented by specific age group which we          think may approximate the criteria of Tanner    for          genital development WCAC ratio was removed from the          anthropometric measurements because the concept of waist          circumference waist to hip ratio or waist circumference          to arm circumference was unknown or not used to quantify          central adiposity                          Statistical procedures          SAS PROC MIXED version  SAS Institute Cary          North Carolina was used to analyze longitudinal and          correlated data The analyses were interpreted using P            as the level of significance An unpaired          Ttest was used to analyze the difference between male          and female for each variables measured at each Tanner          stages Pearson correlations were computed to evaluate          the relationship between specific continuous variables          Odds ratios were used to quantify risk in our          population                            Results                  Study           Table shows the main anthropometric measurements of          our study population Pubertal status was appropriate for          age in all subjects all girls over  y had reached          menarche and all boys over  y had Tanner Stage grades          of  or more The distribution of obese and overweight          adolescents in our study did not differ from that          expected in an average North American population As          defined in methods WCAC ratio which is an indicator of          central adiposity was significantly higher in both P            overweight and P   obese          adolescents in comparison with controls either in          adolescents of different Tanners stages or adults of          both sexes The CPR value which is representative of          centralperipheral obesity was also significantly higher          P   in both overweight and P   obese          adolescents The same is true for the STR and SUM values          For all the anthropometric measurements there were no          significant differences between sexes          Table indicates that the prevalence of impaired          glucose and lipid profiles were highest among those with          a BMI above the  th The prevalence of impaired fasting          glucose is already significant at Tanner stage  with          percentage prevalence of  and  for

either in adolescents of different Tanners          stages or adults of both sexes The prevalence of          impaired fasting glucose did not differ significantly          between adolescents and adults either in male or female          Adolescents with BMI exceeding the  thpercentile are at          increased risk of being classified as having diabetes or          impaired fasting glucose Also the prevalence of lipid          profile abnormalities was highest among those above the           thpercentile for BMI Adolescents with BMI exceeding          the  thpercentile are at increased risk of having          abnormal lipid profiles Again the difference between          the three groups was already present at Tanner stage           The presence of an abnormal lipid profile was observed          from Tanner stages III and above          Sensitivity refers to the percentage of obese or          overweight participants who were correctly predicted to          be at risk for either glucose or lipid profiles          abnormalities Specificity refers to the percentage of          participants who were correctly predicted to be in the          remaining groups BMI

the study is          that the stage of sexual maturation is an important          variable in applying anthropometric measurements as          predictors of risk for cardiovascular diseases On          average BMI seems to increase with stage of genital          maturation in boys relative to fatness and then in          contrast decreases in the later stages of maturation          reflecting the rapid growth of fat free mass with          puberty BMI in girls also increases with stage of sexual          maturation but relative fatness is variable especially          in girls who just attaining menarche stage III To          obviate this bias we preselected our subjects according          to their BMI For instance a BMI   thpercentile for          age and sex was classified as being overweight and          those with a BMI   thpercentile as obese                 Recent workshops concluded that the BMI is an index          of choice for evaluating obesity in adolescents because          it has been validated by studies of total body fat              The criteria used to identify overweight and obesity in          children and adolescents agree with those used for grade           and grade  overweight BMI of  and           respectively in adults     Using a representative          sample from the general North American Caucasian          population we demonstrate that the BMI is also a good          indicator for obesity in adolescents however the          readilymeasured WCAC CPR and STR indices of central          obesity and SUM a single measure of subcutaneous          adiposity are stronger predictor of both fasting glucose          and insulin levels and lipid profiles than BMI We also          demonstrated that each anthropometric variable taken          separately can significantly predict fasting glucose and          insulin levels and lipid profile in adolescents of both          sexes with a probability of P   Our results are          in accordance with others of children aged  and  in          whom indicators of fatness such as weightforheight          BMI and skinfold thicknesses have been associated with          higher total and LDL cholesterol lower HDL cholesterol          and higher triglyceride concentrations                          Our overweight and obese adolescents had higher          fasting glucose and insulin levels for BMI than subjects          with BMI in the healthy range Furtheremore the          prevalence of obesity was comparable between boys and          girls In both sexes the prevalence of diabetes and          impaired fasting glucose increased relative to          chronological age in both overweight            P   and obese subjects            P   Previous study in          Aboriginal children recognized to be at high risk for          type II diabetes has shown that obesity is associated          with high fasting glucose and fasting insulin levels          They also demonstrated that children with BMI exceeding          the  thpercentile are at increased risk of diabetes or          impaired fasting glucose odds ratio of  with           coefficient interval       With use of the          cutoff point of the  thpercentile we demonstrated that          adolescents of Tanner stage III and higher of both          sexes are at increased risk of having impaired fasting          glucose with odds ratios of  and higher          Our overweight and obese adolescents had higher TC          LDL TRG and lower HDL values which correlated with BMI          and other measures of fatness In both sexes the          prevalence of impaired lipid profile increased relative          to chronological age in both overweight            P   and obese subjects            P   l Adolescents of          both sexes with BMI   thare at increased risk of          impaired fasting lipid profiles with odds ratios of           and higher                          Study           The goal of the second study was to determine the          childhood age of abnormal glucose and lipid profiles from          overweight adults By using a retrospectiveprospective          longitudinal study design we were able to track BMI          glucose and lipid profiles from late childhood and          adolescent ages to adulthood in a white Caucasian          populations Then we were able to correlate their          subsequent risk of obesity and its associated impaired          glucose and lipid profiles There is general agreement on          the use of BMI with selected cutoff points as guidelines          for desirable weight         This study          provided a basis for prediction of overweight and obesity          in adults from their  year old group suggesting          that this simple measurement could be applied to the          prediction of obesity in public health programs The          results presented here were comparable to those observed          in a previous study showing that with use of the cutoff          point of the  thpercentile at age  y the odds ratios          of overweight at age  y were of  for males and  for          females with corresponding SEs of  and           respectively Previous data on  y olds in Project          HeartBeat demonstrated that the odds ratio of overweight          in adulthood for those with childhood BMI values at the           thpercentile were  and  to  times as great as          for those with a BMI values at the  thpercentile for          males and females respectively              The incidence of impaired glucose profile was          comparable between boys and girls In both sexes the          incidence of diabetes and impaired fasting glucose          increased significantly            P   relative to          chronological age in comparison to adults The          sensitivity of the selected cutoff point for BMI values          at the  thpercentile at  years old for identifying          impaired glucose profile at age  y was  and           for both male and female respectively Therefore at          least  of male and female adolescents aged between           and  years old who were having a BMI   thwere          correctly predicted to have impaired glucose profile at           y On the other hand  of male and  of          female adolescents of this age group who were having a          BMI   thwere correctly predicted to have normal          glucose profile at  y As stated in the introduction          obesity in childhood is associated with obesity in          adulthood        and is a predictor of all          cause of obesityassociated mortality during adulthood          particularly mortality from cardiovascular diseases          which is independent of adult weight      The          results of the present study agreed with a previous study             indicating that the metabolic alterations caused          by excess body fat are expressed early in the natural          history of obesity Such alterations seem clinically          important even in children as evidenced by an increase          in glucose profile abnormalities in obese adolescents          These observations underscore the need for research          efforts directed at the development of effective          interventions for obese adolescents          The incidence of impaired lipid profile was comparable          between boys and girls In both sexes the incidence of          impaired lipid profile increased significantly            P   relative to          chronological age in comparison to adults The          sensitivity of the selected cutoff point for BMI values          at the  thpercentile at  years old for identifying          impaired lipid profile at age  y was  and           for both male and female respectively The specificity          was  and  for both male and female          respectively If we consider that most of the subjects          having a BMI   thwere also presenting more than  risk          factors for cardiovascular disease this means that they          are at increased risk for developing cardiovascular          diseases Few studies have examined the longterm effects          of adolescent obesity on adult disease Nonetheless          obesity present in childhood or adolescence seems to          increase the likelihood of adult morbidity and mortality              In the present study we demonstrated that in          both men and women obese during adolescence risk of          cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were increased          These effects seems related both to the persistence of          obesity and to the effects of childhood or adolescent          obesity on the quantity and location of body fat          distribution The risk factors for adult disease that are          associated with obesity in children and adolescents          persist into adulthood or increase in prevalence if          weight gain occurs Although both total body fat and          regional fat deposition could account for the association          of childhood or adolescent obesity with adult disease no          studies to date have examined cardiovascular risk factors          and related them to visceral fat                            Conclusion        The strengths of the study include the use of large        samples of both genders a wide age range subjects        representative of the population being studied precise        measurements of body composition and the use of        wellaccepted BMI classifications of overweight and        obesity By using a retrospectiveprospective design in the        second part of the study we were able to obtain the        longitudinal data required to answer the questions        addressed In conclusion our study confirms the hypothesis        that overweight and obese adolescents have higher fasting        plasma glucose and insulin levels and an abnormal lipid        profile relative to their lean peers This study highlights        the critical importance of early identification and        intervention of adolescent obesity to avert the longterm        consequences of it and to protect adolescent against the        risk of cardiovascular diseases There is an urgent need to        follow cohorts atrisks children and adolescents to        investigate cofactors acting in concert with obesity that        are responsible for the early onset of risk factors for        cardiovascular diseases a phenomenon increasingly being        observed in many populations                    Competing interests        None declared
