                                 What Harry Knows            So Harry Thomason is back intown The First Friend testified to Ken Starrs grand jury today but thatsprobably not the most important reason he has returned If news reports arecorrect the sitcom producer is also here to advise Clinton on his Monday grandjury appearance That is to stagemanage him            Bit of advice for thepresident Harry hasnt had a hit for five years How bout calling one of theER producers            Starr andthe White House no doubt negotiated endlessly about the nuts and bolts ofMondays testimony but you can be sure Thomason Clinton and Co are doingeverything they can to tilt the arrangements in the presidents favor Whatshould Clinton wear How should he sit Where should the camera be What shouldbe in the background How should he be lighted These may not be questionson which a presidency hangs but theyre undoubtedly ones that the White Houseis obsessing about Its political theater and theyll treat it liketheater            Thomason and the White House arent talking so I consultedmy own image expert Jackson Bain He runs Bain and Assoc a PR firm inNorthern Virginia and he specializes in prepping corporate honchos for scarymedia appearances What would Bain do if Clinton were his client            First ofall Clinton must look as presidential as possible says Bain Clinton shouldwear his soberest LeaderoftheFreeWorld outfit dark blue suit white shirtdark tie The Oval Office would be the ideal setting but it appears Clintonwill testify in the Map Room a private meeting chamber where he has testifiedtwice before Its filled with Chippendale furniture andsurprisemaps butthey should be out of the picture The Clinton operatives should place anAmerican flag and a photo of Hillary and Chelsea behind the president            Clinton must sit behind a desk and the camerashould see only his head and shoulders Not to be crude but I dont wantanything below Bills third button showing and I want the desk between Billsprivate parts and the grand jury says Bain I dont want anything on hisdesk and I dont want to see his hands            I want a nice tight shotas tight as possible Get those baby blues right down the throats of the peoplewatching in the grand jury I want to give the grand jurors a sense that theyreally are in the room with him            That alsomeans great soundthe best stereo microphone money can buy And greatspeakers in the grand jury room If I could sneak a subwoofer in there Iwould            No one but Clinton should appear in the camera shot Thisis of paramount importance If I am running a show to get Clinton off I wantthe grand jury totally focused on this mans face his honesty his sadness ofhaving to do this I want the audiences total concentration on his guiltlessguileless face I want them to see his eyebrows go up and down He is the onlyperson the grand jury wants or needs to see            Clinton should look at Starrnot at the camera but Starr himself should not be visible If I were onClintons side I would not let them show Ken Starr says Bain They shouldhave him be just a disembodied voice Having another head in the picture is adistraction And if you do have to show Starr just show the back of his earnot his face There is nothing less attractive than the back of someoneshead            Should Clinton be able towatch the grand jurys reaction on a monitor No Clintons totalconcentration should be on the eyeballs of Ken Starr            DavidKendall should be invisible too You dont want Clinton to look like a puppetof his lawyers And as for Hillary forget it Hillary cannot be there Nono no It is too awkward Just one quick nanosecond glance at her just onemoment of discomfort and the grand jury will see it You dont wantthat Keep her out of the West Wing Keep her out of the White House Some timelater they can go on some benign morning talk show together and talk aboutthis            And what if Bain were advising Starr            I would make Clinton lookas small as possible I would show the desk I would show Clinton fidgetingwith his hands And I would show Starr Starr has been well trained to smilebenignly He has learned to smile sweetly to the media because he realizesthat America does not like him that much He has developed this beatific smileand I would want to show that            Behind Starr I would put aneutral or chocolatebrown backgroundbut not blackso his flesh tones lookgood He is a palelooking fellow You really have to warm him up                           Moviesand The Dress Part                         Last week I suggestedthat Clinton watch three movies for inspiration about how to escape the dressPrimary Colors  Presumed Innocent  and Theres Something AboutMary  Reader Jason Furman reminds me of a fourth film Gattaca  ascifi thriller in which the hero hides small packets of blood in his fingertipand urine in his bladder dont ask how in order to fool DNA tests
