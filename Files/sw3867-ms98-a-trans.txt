                um Tom what does camping mean to you   well it usually just means sort of getting away from the normal uh time spent at uh day to day job in the office and trying to enjoy the outdoors for the most part um i havent done as much as i use to but i i still like to go once and a while and go camping   uhhuh umhum well when i think about camping is uh well back from my boy scout days uh usually means hiking out in the mountains and and uh building your own camp fire bringing your own food in a pack um and   right   and things like that um things that i associate with camping usually the hikes and camping that we do we go to a lake and it might even involve some canoeing and and then we might i remember especially the fifty mile hikes where wed hike from lake to lake you know one day wed be at one lake and hike to another lake they might be about five or ten miles away the next day and   the long ones right   and things like that   my son my son has recently joined boy scouts and i ive become fairly active with them and and uh he joined about four months ago and weve gone on about three uh camp outs since then uh two of which involved uh back packing and and hiking theyre a pretty active troop and ive enjoyed it its gotten me a chance to get back out and do a little bit more again   uhhuh well i havent done much recently thats just what comes to mind when i think of camping that is what i think of and was what i did when i was a boy scout um   yeah   yes uh we uh my family uh and i we lived in Colorado up until about three years ago for about fourteen years and and of course that was a great uh state for camping uh to get up in the mountains and it was easy to go some place on a weekend its its a little more difficult for me now living in Texas just because there is so much private land in Texas and there is not too much in the way of national forests and state lands that you can go hiking on here as opposed to states in the west i dont know how the Iowa area is for for that   well i just picture myself and i was going to say i really dont know whats available here i know theres some lakes we could drive to but i dont know of any places where you know you can do hiking and stuff like that   you can really yeah really get out and hike uhhuh   i grew up in the Seattle area and the Cascade Mountains were just an hours drive away and that   oh yeah uhhuh   thats where we did a lot of our hiking and camping um and then i lived   yeah   while i was going to school at the University i was in Utah and there is also you know mountains there where you can   yeah   do hiking and plenty of hiking and camping   yeah well camping camping i guess uh different people look at it in different ways and and do different activities whether its canoeing or uh back packing or hiking some people just like to go car camping and get away and enjoy the part about building a camp fire and eating outside and and doing that sort of thing even if it is not back packing   yeah   camping can still be enjoyable   yeah i know for from my mom  um camping is um definitely bringing the Coleman stove and   yes  the two burner stove   uhhuh even if we do build a campfire along side um the cooking is done on the Coleman stove just because it is more convenient   right   although even when my family and i went camping when we were growing up uh we went in the tents always you know   yeah we weve evolved to the stage of uh pop up tent camper camping now  now that my our kids have gotten a little bit uh uh involved with camping and my wife finally got tired of camping in tents and having to bail out the water during rain storms and so forth so she talked me into getting a pop up camper so our camping is sometimes a little more leisurely now than it use to be a little more   oh in the camper oh that would that is what makes it a little more luxurious   yes uhhuh yeah its its somewhere in between camping and going to uh a motel i guess   well i guess the main point is to get to um enjoy the outdoors and you know especially if you go near a lake or mountains or you know beautiful scenery you know   yeah uhhuh my my sons boy scout troop does an annual one week float on the Buffalo River in Arkansas and i am trying to make sure he gets his qualifications in by next spring because i would like to go on the trip with them because they camp out for seven or eight days while on the Buffalo River and theyre floating floating for that many days and i am looking forward that would be uh roughing it more than i have in a long time   that
