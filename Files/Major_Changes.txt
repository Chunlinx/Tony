Major Changes Hit City Legal ServicesRestructuring Plan Prompts Lawsuit in BronxBy Daniel WiseThe New York City legal services program is undergoing a radicalrestructuring at the prompting of the federal Legal ServicesCorporationThe transformation will leave the program which was formed in along the model of decentralized school boards under localcommunity control with a far more centralized structureFor the last  years the program has had a twotieredstructure in which a citywide agency now called Legal Servicesfor New York City LSNY has received federal funds that in turnhave been distributed to seven different local corporations whichprovided the bulk of services in civil legal matters to indigentNew Yorkers LSNYs role has been generally limited to certainadministrative functions though over the years it has come to runtwo programs of its ownUnder the revised structure which is expected to be put inplace in the early part of next year LSNY will have a controllingvoice in the selection of the boards for the local corporations Inaddition the local corporations are being asked to adopt newcertificates of incorporation and bylaws which some of the groupscontend vastly expand LSNYs powers One program Bronx LegalServices was so distressed by the changes that it filed a lawsuitin the Southern District of New York seeking to block itsrestructuring Approximately  of the  lawyers working in theprogram are employed by the seven local corporations The remaining lawyers work either in the LSNY central office or in the twoprograms it directly runs one for the elderly and the other forthe poor in the Williamsburg and Brighton Beach sections ofBrooklynLSNY disperses approximately  million a year of which million comes from the federal Legal Services Corporation Of the million  percent is earmarked for the LSNY budget and percent is allocated among the seven local corporations accordingto LSNY spokeswoman Edwina MartinThe Legal Services Corporation insisted upon the changesaccording to its spokesman Eric Kleiman because the New Yorkprograms structure is completely anomalous in that there aretwo degrees of separation between the federal corporation and theprograms actually delivering civil legal servicesThe change is necessary he added to assure a true oversightmechanism for the New York City program As the funding agencyLSNY subcontracted with the local boards to provide legal servicesand was left with only the drastic remedy of defunding a localprogram if problems in management or delivery of services wereuncovered he said Defunding was not a viable remedy Mr Kleimanadded because the only people hurt are those who benefit from theservicesThe New York Law Journal NY  Thursday August  Bronx Programs LawsuitHowever Walker Thompson the head of Bronx Legal Serviceswhich filed a lawsuit on Aug  seeking to block the changes saidthe restructuring threatens our ability to be a good legalservices programThe change in corporate structure he explained eviscerateslocal control by placing power in a distant entity  LSNY  withlittle need to be accountable to the Bronx communityAlso he charged that bylaw changes which LSNY is forcingthrough its exercise of its power over his programs purseexpands enormously LSNYs legislative power to tell local programswhat they can and cannot do The changes he added furtherempower LSNY to get involved in the minutiae of running localprograms by for instance requiring LSNY to approve theexpenditure of very small sums of moneyMichael W Martin a Fordham University School of Law professorwho sits on the LSNY board however countered that the changeswere narrowly tailored to ensure effective monitoring by LSNYwhile still preserving the power of local boards to run theirprograms He explained for instance that provisions were beingwritten into the new bylaws that would prohibit LSNY from forcingany bylaw changes for two years These provisions he said wouldpreserve forever the rights of local programs to disassociatewith LSNYThe core change in corporate structure under the reorganizationrecasts all seven of the local corporations as membershiporganizations with LSNY as the sole member Under New Yorksnotforprofit corporation law a nonprofit can be structuredalong the lines of a business corporation by creating a class ofmembers analogous to a business shareholders who run thecorporation through their power to select the corporations boardof directors explained Sean Delaney one of the lawyers who workedon the restructuring for LSNYBusinesses use the device to create a wholly owned subsidiarysaid Mr Delaney executive director of Lawyers Alliance of NewYork Similarly he said LSNY will exercise control over the localcorporations by being designated as the sole member in eachcorporation empowered to choose or discharge board membersProfessor Martin asserted that LSNY has no plans underconsideration to exercise its powers as the sole corporate memberto force any changes on the boards of the local corporations Healso pointed out that LSNY has agreed to bylaw changes thatcircumscribe its otherwise unlimited powers over the selection andreplacement of local board members For instance he said LSNY hadagreed to select new members from a slate put together by a localcorporationBut Bronx Legal Services Mr Thompson took little comfort fromthose concessionsThe New York Law Journal NY  Thursday August  Even without the corporate changes he noted LSNY has assertedthe right to withhold from the local corporations money that itgets on their behalf from the Legal Services Corporation and anyother source For his group that would mean LSNY can withhold morethan  percent of its  million annual budget if its lawsuitfails Bronx Legal Services raises about  a year throughits own fundraising initiatives he explainedMartin Needleman the executive director of Brooklyn LegalServices Corp A said there is wide backing from the otherprograms for the lawsuit Bronx Legal Services v Legal Servicesfor New York City  But he added that many other groupshad gone along with the reorganization reluctantly when facedwith the possible loss of most of their budgetsThe five local programs in addition to Bronx Legal Services andBrooklyn Legal Services Corp A are Bedford Stuyvesant LegalServices Harlem Legal Services South Brooklyn Legal ServicesCorp B MFY Legal Services and Queens Legal Services
